Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee did an entire interview on MSNBC Monday morning with what appeared to be a nosebleed dripping down her lip Why didn t anyone at MSNBC tell her to wipe her nose when she was off camera?
Notice at the beginning of the interview, a staffer is off camera trying to tell her about the problem but she shoos the person away MSNBC Anchor Chris Jansing did the entire interview with Lee like this!Sheila Jackson Lee Does Entire MSNBC Interview With A Nosebleed #TRUMP #CyberMonday #MondayMotivaton #FakeNewsTrophy #CFPB #TheStorm #FollowTheWhiteRabbit #TickTock @LowInfoTweeter pic.twitter.com/MACn5ZdLoK John Dee -Deplorable (@GaltsGultch) November 27, 2017Daily Caller reported: Get away, she said when MSNBC anchor Chris Jansing cut to her camera, while motioning for someone to get out of the camera shot.The unidentifiable liquid underneath her nose was immediately visible and stayed there throughout the interview, which lasted just under ten minutes.
It s not totally clear what the liquid is, but based on the placement underneath the nose and the dark color, we can only guess that it is a nosebleed.The MSNBC producers apparently didn t think to do Jackson Lee a favor and tell her to wipe her nose while they weren t showing her on screen.
The good news is that the supposed nose bleed matched the color of Jackson Lee s red blazer.
