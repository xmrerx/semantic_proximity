wittenberg , germany ( reuters ) - invoking the spirit of the reformation , chancellor angela merkel called for religious freedom and tolerance on tuesday and said germany should lend extra support to the children of refugees who have experienced awful things .
we have learned that tolerance is the soul of europe , she said at a ceremony on the 500th anniversary of the reformation in wittenberg , where martin luther is said to have nailed his theses challenging catholicism to a church door .
luther argued against what he saw as abusive practices by catholic preachers , though the reformation divided western christianity and resulted in violence , persecution and discrimination .
merkel , the daughter of a protestant pastor , praised luther s translation of the bible into a standard form of written german , which she said made its teachings accessible to the population at large .
religious education was a fundamental concern of the reformation , she said , stressing the importance of education for everyone .
to learn and develop skills , some children need to be given more support than others - for example when parental support is lacking .
this applies too to integrating children from refugee families who have experienced and undergone awful things .
merkel has come under fire for allowing more than one million migrants to enter germany over the past two years - a decision that saw her conservatives bleed support to the anti-immigration alternative for germany ( afd ) party in a national election last month .
people from different backgrounds often knew too little about each other , she said , stressing the importance of dialogue between religions .
just as the freedom of belief always has to be protected from religious fanaticism , so freedom of worship , on the other hand , requires that religion be protected from contempt , merkel added .
to honor the 500th anniversary , reformation day was a public holiday in germany this year .
