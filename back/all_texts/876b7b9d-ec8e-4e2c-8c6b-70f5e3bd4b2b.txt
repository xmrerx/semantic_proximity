WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration believes its budget plan will boost economic growth by fostering capital investment and creating jobs for workers who gave up their job hunts during tough times, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Tuesday.
“One component of this is making sure we can create jobs for people who want jobs and will come back into the workforce,” Mnuchin said at an event on fiscal policy.
“The other component is productivity and capital investment.”
