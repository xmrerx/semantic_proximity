Sarah Palin has said a lot of stupid things over the years but she definitely defended her America s village idiot crown with this one.The New York Times is looking to cut costs by vacating eight floors at their current headquarters to generate rental revenue and create a better work environment.
Of course, conservative media is gloating about this by claiming that the newspaper is broke and will be laying off hundreds of employees.
But it appears that the New York Times is simply restructuring and the moves will only affect a handful of jobs for the time being if any at all.
Meanwhile, the publisher and CEO are giving up corner offices, which will save more money to keep more employees.
So the plan is displacing everyone on those floors no matter what position they hold in the company.And so Sarah Palin decided to brag about the New York Times supposedly going broke (citing a right-wing website that profits on fake news and can t even bother to check their headlines for typos) by posting about it on Twitter, massacring lyrics from a popular Jamie Foxx and Kanye West song from 2005 in the process.NYT: I ain t saying you a golddigger, but there s a reason you messin with broke, broke, broke.
