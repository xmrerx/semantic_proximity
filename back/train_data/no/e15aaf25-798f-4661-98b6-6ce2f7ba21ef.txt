taipei ( reuters ) - at least one chinese air force yun-8 transport plane conducted a long-haul flight near taiwan on sunday , the island s defence ministry said , amid simmering tensions between the two rivals .
taiwan dispatched its aircraft and ships to monitor and deal with the yun8 , which returned to its base after flying through the bashi channel and miyako waterway , defense minister feng shih-kuan said .
it was unclear whether one plane or more made the flight .
there was no untoward incident and the public should not be alarmed , feng said .
he did not give further details .
china has considered taiwan to be a wayward province since chiang kai-shek s nationalist troops fled to the island in 1949 after losing the chinese civil war to mao zedong s communist forces on the mainland .
beijing suspects taiwan president tsai ing-wen of the independence-leaning democratic progressive party wants to declare the island s formal independence .
tsai says she wants to maintain peace with china but will defend the island s security .
china has never renounced the use of force to bring the self-ruled democratic island under its control .
china has conducted numerous similar patrols near taiwan this year , saying such practices have been normalized as it presses ahead with a military modernization program that includes building aircraft carriers and stealth fighters to give it the ability to project power far from its shores .
in september , the u.s. congress passed the national defense authorization act for the 2018 fiscal year , which authorizes mutual visits by navy vessels between taiwan and the united states .
that prompted a senior chinese diplomat to say this month china would invade the island if any u.s. warships made port visits there .
