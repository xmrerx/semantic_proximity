a longtime clinton ally and donor has a theory about black republicans : they re like the jewish guards in concentration camps who tried to save their own skins by helping the nazis kill jews .
in a hidden-camera video released wednesday by project veritas action , author and academic benjamin r. barber compared black republicans to the sonderkommandos during a sept. 19 fundraiser for north carolina senate candidate deborah ross .
he described the sonderkommandos as jewish guards who in effect helped murder jews in the camps so they could live a little longer .
so there were even jews who were helping the nazis murder jews .
so blacks who are helping the other side are seriously f * * * ed in the head , said mr. barber in undercover footage .
mr. barber , a rutgers university professor emeritus and city university of new york senior research scholar , isn t some fringe figure : he served as an informal consultant on civic affairs to president bill clinton , wrote a book about the clinton administration , and donated to hillary clinton s presidential bids in 2008 and 2016.read more : wt
