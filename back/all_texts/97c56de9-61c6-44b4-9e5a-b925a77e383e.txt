A new animatronic figure in the Hall of Presidents at Walt Disney World was added, where every former leader of the republic is depicted in an audio-animatronics show.
The figure which supposedly resembles Jon Voight Donald Trump was added to the collection and it s absolutely horrifying.
The internet noticed that, too.Here s a few more pictures of the Donald Trump animatronic.
