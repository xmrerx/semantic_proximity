astana ( reuters ) - russian president vladimir putin s envoy for syria said on thursday that there was no reason for u.s. forces to remain in syria and that washington s stated reasons for maintaining a military presence there were groundless .
alexander lavrentiev was speaking in astana , the capital of kazakhstan , ahead of a new round of syrian peace talks between russia , iran and turkey .
any reasons cited by the americans to justify their further military presence ... are just excuses and we think their presence must end , he told reporters .
lavrentiev said the astana talks would focus on setting the ground for a congress of syrian peoples which russia plans to host early next year .
the sides plan to decide on the date for the congress on friday , he said .
but agreeing a list of delegates will take longer , up to three weeks .
turkey last month objected to the presence of the main syrian kurdish group at the congress .
