is karma knocking on her door ? mayor lyda krewson released a statement following the verdict saying , i am appalled at what happened to anthony lamar smith .
krewson s comment drew a rebuke from neil bruntrager , stockley s lawyer .
how do you promote all those things by creating distrust in a system that clearly worked under these circumstances ?
bruntrager said .
it is irresponsible and a disservice to the community to make statements like that .
it s an insult to judge wilson to make statements like that .
and it falsely encourages the belief that an injustice was done here when in fact justice was done .
st. louis dispatchagitators refuse to disperse causing property damage near mayor 's home .
