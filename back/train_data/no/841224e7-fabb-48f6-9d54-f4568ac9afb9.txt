since the moment word got out about the firing of fbi director james comey , democrats and their allies in the leftist media have been falling all over themselves to spew their hatred towards trump and his unfair firing of james comey .
even though for months , democrats and the leftist media have been outraged at comey for the reopening of the fbi investigation into hillary s e-mails just prior to the election , all is forgiven now .
it s time for the media and the democrats to come together , regroup and focus on the real target president trump.but now , fbi director james comey has made a statement about the firing , and it s not exactly what the media was hoping for .
comey took the high road when he sent a letter on wednesday to agents and friends regarding president trump s firing of him the day before .
i have long believed that a president can fire an fbi director for any reason , or for no reason at all , he wrote , according to cnn .
i m not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed , comey added .
i hope you won t either .
it is done , and i will be fine , although i will miss you and the mission deeply .
