The Trump administration was going to show Democrats a thing or two by touting a Pittsburgh, not Paris rally which is taking place at a park across from the White House.
Meanwhile, at cities across the U.S., thousands rallied in the March for Truth .
The exact numbers aren t in yet, by the way.
Instead of attending the rally the Trump administration hyped, the former reality show star went to the Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia on Saturday morning, according to Business Insider.While Trump is at his golf club, the Pittsburgh, not Paris rally has kicked off with dozens of Trump supporters who gathered to express their support for Trump s decision to pull out of the landmark Paris Agreement.If the US completes the withdrawal process from the climate deal, it will join Nicaragua and Syria the only other countries who have not signed the agreement.The Trump-Pence campaign announced a Pittsburgh Not Paris Event for President Trump on Saturday morning which was organized by the Fairfax County Republican Committee and the Republican Party of Virginia.
The group asked those who planned to attend to dress in your most patriotic, red, white, and blue outfit.
Look at em all.

The White House has been in panic mode trying to contain the damage from the Russia-Trump scandal so some officials felt the best way to do that would be to hold more rallies.
Meanwhile, Trump s approval rating is plummeting with even some supporters of the alleged president finding out that they are tired of all the winning that they were promised.At the March for Truth rally in Raleigh, a registered Republican who described himself as pro-life and an evangelical, said that he was diagnosed with cancer.
He said, Thank God for Obamacare!
then he ripped his party to shreds while taking aim at Ted Cruz.
At the end of his speech, the anti-Trump crowd was chanting, Run for office, run for office!
The crowd was just so happy to witness Republican who isn t spineless.Photo by Ralph Freso via Getty Images
