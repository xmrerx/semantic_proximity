Today, President Obama endorsed Hillary Clinton for President of the United States.
The media was abuzz, Clinton s campaign website saw a spike in viewership, and Sanders supporters started uniting behind the nominee.But there was one person who was not impressed: Donald J. Trump.In typical Trump fashion, the blowhard Republican nominee decided to take to his precious Twitter account to bash both President Obama and Hillary Clinton:Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary.
He wants four more years of Obama but nobody else does!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2016Clinton, who has chided the Republican candidate over his sophomoric use of Twitter, clearly didn t have time for his crap, so she decided to send a message (a message most Americans probably agree with): Delete your account.
