CNN has more than enough representation from the radical side of the Democrat aisle This host is yet another who speaks in terms of race and divisiveness..@wkamaubell: "Bye Nazis!"

Do you think Bell needs to go?
We do!WHAT ABOUT THE WHITE PEOPLE?
CNN host W. Kamau Bell spoke at the No Hate In The Bay rally in Berkeley, California, over the weekend that featured Antifa violence.The rally was organized in opposition to a Patriot Prayer event led by founder Joey Gibson, who has vehemently denounced neo-Nazis and white supremacists.
The black-clad antifa protesters chased the small number of Patriot Prayer attendees out of the park and threatened and attacked right-wingers and journalists.Bell, a comedian who hosts the CNN program United Shades of America, spoke at the rally and said, when the Nazis leave, as they have left you have to stand up for the brown people, the black people, the LGBT people, the immigrants everybody everyday!
Bell never denounced the Antifa violence in any of his tweets about the rally.
We re guessing he s still with the violent group Via: DC
