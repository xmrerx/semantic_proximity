another activist liberal judge who s denying first amendment rights to americans .
this is very interesting information and the thing that stood out to me is the 6th circuit court of appeals reversed bunning s decision.the federal judge who held rowan county clerk kim davis in contempt and ordered her to jail for refusing to sign marriage licenses has on two occasions denied christian students in kentucky public schools their first amendment rights by ordering them to undergo re-education training promoting the homosexual lifestyle against their religious objections.in 2003 , federal district judge david bunning ordered boyd county education officials to implement training , which mandated school staff and students undergo diversity education principally devoted to issues of sexual orientation and gender harassment .
a number of students objected to being forced to watch a gaystapo propaganda video denouncing christian views that opposed homosexuality as wrongheaded and proclaiming homosexuality as a safe , healthy , and fixed lifestyle that can not be changed.when it was discovered that students would be punished if they didn t undergo the training their parents brought in the alliance defending freedom ( adf ) legal organization , which sued the boyd county board of education.in 2006 , the gaystapo tool was back at it .
once again he tried to force christian students to watch a gaystapo propaganda video promoting the homosexual lifestyle , and denying christian students the ability to opt out of the indoctrination training .
bunning ruled that an opt-out was unnecessary because the training didn t mean that students would have to change their religious beliefs.bunning s decision was overturned in october 2007 by the sixth circuit court of appeals .
the court ruled that a christian student could seek damages from the school district because the training bunning imposed had chilled the student s ability to express his christian beliefs about homosexuality to his fellow students.via : cfp
