Earlier today, Donald Trump told a group of U.S. governors that his mysterious, frustratingly nonspecific replacement plan for Obamacare (also known as the Affordable Care Act) would give states more flexibility amongst other soaring promises.
He also thanked some of the governors in the room for helping him because he obviously knew nothing about health care before he stepped into his role as POTUS and he probably still doesn t.Trump s plan to repeal and replace Obamacare was a disaster from the start, and we re now seeing protests erupt across the country as millions of Americans stand to lose life-saving affordable health care if Trump gets his way.
Many prominent GOPers have also spoken out against completely taking Obamacare away from the American people, but Trump isn t listening.In his speech, Trump addressed the reason why his plan has been so secretive and poorly planned.
Stating that health care was unbelievably complex , he said: We have come up with a solution that s really, really I think very good.
It s an unbelievably complex subject.
Nobody knew that health care could be so complicated.
We have a plan that I think is going to be fantastic.
It s going to be released fairly soon.
I think it s going to be something special I think you re going to like what you hear.
And of course, he couldn t provide any details as usual.
Despite bragging about the Republican Party s major move to repeal and replace a health care law that has given millions of Americans affordable, accessible health care, Trump and the GOP have done nothing but stall and beat around the bush.
And yet despite having a concrete solution, Trump dissed Obamacare: As soon as we touch it, if we do the most minute thing, just a tiny little change, what s going to happen?
They re going to say it s the Republicans problem.
But we have to do what s right because Obamacare is a failed disaster.
