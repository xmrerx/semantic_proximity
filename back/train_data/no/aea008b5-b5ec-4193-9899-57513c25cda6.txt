it s interesting that a lighthearted moment like the one below could cause such anger and outrage from the left ! rob gronkowksi popped into today s white house press briefing to ask sean spicer if he needed any help .
spicer , a patriots fan , declined the offer .
mild laughs were had .
gronkowski then disappeared , presumably to cause more mischief in other parts of the building.it s not surprising that the tight end performed a bit like this .
that he was wearing a shirt while doing it was a bit of a shock.right after this video was posted facebook comments were brutal about how unprofessional it was to have this guy pop into the briefing .
we had obama s antics for 8 years and these people can t take one light moment like this ? the left went nuts with faux outrage : we can think of many moments during the obama administration where some unprofessional antics took place .
the only problem is that these antics are much more serious remember jay carney ?
well , here are 6 big moments he s caught in big lies .
we consider this to be much more important than what happened today.6 of the top antics from white house press briefings under obama jay carney s not funny but serious gaffes : 1 .
when he said he knows 3 people named hilary rosen .
after obama adviser hilary rosen said ann romney hadn t worked a day in her life , it was discovered rosen had visited the white house numerous times .
when questioned on it , carney claimed he knew 3 separate women named hilary rosen .
2 .
that one time he stumbled when asked why the obama administration withheld a crucial benghazi email.3 .
that day when he called a reporter s repeated questions on kathleen sebelius lame .
4 .
that time he admitted white house staff knew of the irs scandal and didn t tell obama.5 .
that time he admitted that the obama budget wouldn t balance.6 .
that moment when he finally admitted obama s keep your plan promise wasn t true.shouldn t the liberal snowflakes be outraged at what jay carney did ?
