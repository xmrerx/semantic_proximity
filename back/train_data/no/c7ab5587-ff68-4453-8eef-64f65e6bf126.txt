does anyone else find it ironic that black multi-millionaire athletes are protesting oppression in america after 8 years of our first black president ? how much courage does it take for these multi-millionaire athletes to stand in protest against the flag our us military members defend with their lives every day ?
members of our armed forces are making between $ 17,892 and $ 34,696 in basic pay , depending upon time served in the military and rank .
but yeah we can see why you multi-millionaire punks who are treated like royalty wherever you go , are all feeling so oppressed that you need to disrespect our flag and the brave men and woman who stand on the field next to you , while you spit on their sacrifices as a way to promote obama s black lives matter legacy nfl player-activists continued to take a knee sunday during the national anthem to protest alleged oppression of blacks in america.on sunday in seattle , dolphins running back arian foster , wide receiver kenny stills , safety michael thomas , and linebacker jelani jenkins took a knee as everyone else rose to honor america .
they are taking a knee for injustice in america , according to civil-rights activist shaun king.but what is the end game ?
how will we know when the injustice has subsided to the point so they can stand again ? perhaps when the murder rate in chicago falls .
it s currently on a record pace ( 512 so far this year ) with most of the victims african-american .
or maybe when the black teen unemployment employment rate of 31 percent , six times higher than the national average , improves.maybe that is what the nfl activists are waiting on , for these two oppressive situations to be fixed.watch here : we will see .
don t hold your breath .
this seems like a one-note song it s clearly an extension of the black lives matter movement , and it s about police killing a few unarmed black suspects .
