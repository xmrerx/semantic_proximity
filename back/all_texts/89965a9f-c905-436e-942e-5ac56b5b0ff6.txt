As a Democrat won a Senate seat in deep-red Alabama, social media offered up everyone s opinion because that s what social media does.
Democrat Doug Jones narrowly defeated accused pedophile and serial sexual assaulter Roy Moore in a special election for the Senate seat vacated by Jeff Sessions when he was appointed Attorney General.
And some Republicans aren t exactly heartbroken about this.Take Meghan McCain John McCain s daughter.
She went right after one of Trump s biggest supporters Steve Bannon as soon as the election results were announced:Suck it, Bannon Meghan McCain (@MeghanMcCain) December 13, 2017Three simple words.
It s amazing what three simple words can say.Steve Bannon spoke at Moore s election night rally, which we assume was supposed to be a night of celebration.
Bannon endorsed Moore early on, against Luther Strange, whom Donald Trump himself campaigned for earlier this year.
Bannon s support for Moore remained steadfast even in the wake of multiple allegations surfaced against him of sexual assault, harassment and even pedophilia.
Bannon even said, There s a special place in hell for those who refuse to support Moore.On Dec. 12, the people of Alabama rejected Roy Moore s penchant for pursuing, even assaulting, teenage girls.
They rejected his hate and bigotry.
They rejected an asshat who has been removed from Alabama s Supreme Court twice for violating federal court orders, thus demonstrating he has no respect for the rule of law.
And they sent a message to the Republican Party that this bullshit will no longer be tolerated.
If deep-red Alabama can elect a Democrat, then anyone can.
And that should have Republicans scared out of their minds.Well, we re going there, along with Meghan McCain and anyone else who believed Moore shouldn t ever hold public office.
Even Republicans have their limits, it seems.Featured image via Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images
