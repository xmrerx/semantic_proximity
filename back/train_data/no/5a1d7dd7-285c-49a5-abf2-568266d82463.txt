donald trump , while pretending to reach out to minorities , has almost no minority support .
that doesn t stop him from talking down to african-americans and telling them that they live in conditions of dangerous squalor that only he can fix .
of course , that doesn t stop trump from bragging about his great relationship with the blacks .
well , perhaps the two people holding up the blacks for trump signs at an october 12th rally had the last name of black , because they certainly didn t look african-american.most noticed only the woman , and twitter tore her and the fake black outreach of the trump campaign apart.note the blond woman with the blacks for trump sign .
okay .

( @ rere_76804 ) october 13 , 2016um , shaun king is bi-racial , just like the president who you hate because of his dark skin.clearly , the problem is not with the woman .
it s simply that the woman ( and the man who for some reason is ignored ) is the perfect symbol of trump s african-american outreach .
trump is a white man who tells african-americans how they should be feeling , while at the same time , having a deep history of racism .
his black outreach is a farce and he knows it , so really , who better to carry a blacks for trump sign than a white woman ? featured image via darren mccollester/getty images .
