why does fox news even give this guy a microphone ?
he lost his relevance about a decade ago , and yet fox news still thinks americans care about anything he has to say .
he was against gun control before he was for it republican strategist karl rove said on fox news sunday the only way to stop gun-related violence , like the wednesday massacre at emmanuel african methodist church in charleston s.c. , was to repeal american citizens second amendment rights.when chris wallace asked rove how we can , stop the violence , the long-time gun-rights advocate stated that we have made great strides as a nation in empathizing with the victims of these types of shootings , but the only way to guarantee they will stop is to remove guns from society .
what do you think ? wallace : how do we stop the violence ? what do you think ?
rove : i wish i had an easy answer for that , but i don t think there s an easy answerwhat do you think ?
we saw an act of evil .
racist , bigoted evil , and to me the amazing thing is that it was met with grief and love .
think about how far we ve come since 1963 .
the whole weight of the government throughout the south was to impede finding and holding and bringing to justice the men who perpetrated the [ birmingham ] bombing.what do you think ?
and here , we saw an entire state , an entire community , an entire nation come together , grieving as one and united in the belief that this was an evil act , so we ve come a long way.what do you think ?
now maybe there s some magic law that will keep us from having more of these .
i mean basically the only way to guarantee that we will dramatically reduce acts of violence involving guns is to basically remove guns from society , and until somebody gets enough oomph to repeal the second amendment , that s not going to happen.via : daily caller
