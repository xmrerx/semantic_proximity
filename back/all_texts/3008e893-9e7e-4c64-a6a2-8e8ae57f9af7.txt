WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet April 6-7 with Chinese President Xi Jinping at the presidentâ€™s Mar-a-Lago retreat in Florida, a source familiar with the meeting said on Tuesday.
It will be their first face-to-face meeting since Trump took office on Jan. 20.
Trump played host to Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe last month at Mar-a-Lago, in Palm Beach, Florida.
