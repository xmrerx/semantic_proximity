frankfurt ( reuters ) - french president emmanuel macron said on tuesday he is determined to engage germany in a debate that he wants to push forward on european reforms , despite a cool initial response from chancellor angela merkel .
i believe that , if you have a vision , you shouldn t go to the doctor but you should open a debate , macron said in frankfurt , where he was due to meet merkel and attend the opening of an annual book fair .
macron s visit is his first to germany since merkel narrowly won an election last month , losing votes to a far-right party that drew support from people angered by an influx of more than a million migrants over the past two years .
the 39-year-old french president , in a speech two days after the german vote , set out an ambitious vision for europe , calling for tighter cooperation on defense and immigration , and for a common euro zone budget .
merkel , still to begin what promise to be difficult talks on building a new coalition government , has cautioned that reforming the euro zone should not be the top priority and the debate should be more inclusive .
macron was taking part in a panel discussion at frankfurt s goethe university with daniel cohn-bendit , the green politician best known for his role in the paris student protests of 1968 , and gilles kepel , a political scientist and expert on the middle east .
