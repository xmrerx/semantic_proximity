abuja ( reuters ) - nigeria s atiku abubakar , a former vice president and key ally of president muhammadu buhari , said on sunday he had joined the country s opposition party after quitting the ruling all progressives congress ( apc ) last month .
abubakar is the first political heavyweight to signal a potential bid for the presidency , which could pit him against the 74-year-old buhari .
buhari took power in 2015 , but illness has kept him absent for much of this year .
abubakar is prepared to run for president in 2019 , a spokesman said last month when he left the apc .
he did not indicate on sunday whether he would try to become the opposition people s democratic party s ( pdp s ) presidential candidate .
abubakar rejoined the pdp after four years because it has resolved its issues , he said , according to a statement on sunday .
he had left the pdp because he believed it was no longer aligned to the principles of equity , democracy and social justice , he said .
in sunday s statement , abubakar criticized the apc for letting down the nigerian people by failing to create a strong economy and jobs , especially for the young , with one quarter of 18-25 year olds unemployed .
