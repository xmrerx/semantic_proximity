Trevor Noah compared the excitement of the people of Texas over the new open-carry law to men celebrating their homosexuality at a gay pride parade.
Texans already could carry hand guns but had to conceal their weapons.
Now they could simply be open about it.He said: You see, gun lovers in Texas they just want to stop hiding who they really are.
Although it is a little odd how as soon as people got this right they immediately went out into the streets.
They were just running like yah!
Ooh now I m gonna bring my gun everywhere!
We re in the streets!
Let s go shopping and at the laundry-mat and hey I m late at my shift at the coffee shop!
He then went on to compare the excitement of gun owners over the new law to a gay pride parade: You know what, a little exuberance is fine but what made this weird for me is this is almost a little bit like when gay people first realized that society was starting to accept them for being openly gay and they immediately went out and started dancing on trucks dressed as giant penises, which on the one hand, is great.
But after a certain point, we get it: you love giant penises.
Texas expanded its open-carry laws to include handguns.
Military rifles and other long guns have been legally openly carried for years.Featured image via video screen capture
