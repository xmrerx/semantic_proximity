wake up christians the left won t stop until they ve removed any mention of christ in your church the bishop of stockholm has proposed a church in her diocese remove all signs of the cross and put down markings showing the direction to mecca for the benefit of muslim worshippers.eva brunne , who was made the world s first openly lesbian bishop by the church of sweden in 2009 , and has a young son with her wife and fellow lesbian priest gunilla linden , made the suggestion to make those of other faiths more welcome.the church targeted is the seamen s mission church in stockholm s eastern dockyards .
the bishop held a meeting there this year and challenged the priest to explain what he d do if a ship s crew came into port who weren t christian but wanted to pray.calling muslim guests to the church angels , the bishop later took to her official blog to explain that removing christian symbols from the church and preparing the building for muslim prayer doesn t make a priest any less a defender of the faith .
rather , to do any less would make one stingy towards people of other faiths .the bishop insisted this wasn t an issue , after all airports and hospitals already had multi-faith prayer rooms , and converting the dockyard church would only bring it up to speed .
regardless , the announcement has aroused protest.father patrik pettersson , one of the priests in her diocese and active in the same parish as the seaman s mission church has hit back in a blog of his own , complaining there is no way you could equate a consecrated church with a prayer room , remarking i should have thought a bishop would be able to tell the difference .calling the bishop s words theologically unthinking , he asked what was to be done with crucifixes screwed to the walls , and heavy items such as baptismal fonts .
ignoring the rhetorical murmuring , pettersson wrote : the only argument bishop eva really put forward in support of her view is hospitality how do you respond to that ?
not much of a basis for discussion , as one colleague put it .
the theological , ecclesiological , pastoral and working issues are left untouched .via : breitbart news
