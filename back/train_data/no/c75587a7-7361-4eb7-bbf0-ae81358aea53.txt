nevatim air base , israel ( reuters ) - lockheed martin has invested large sums of money to reduce the price of the f-35 stealth fighter program , a company executive said in israel on monday , responding to criticism from u.s. president-elect donald trump about costs .
“ since the beginning , we have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to reduce the price of the airplane by about 70 percent since its original costing , and we project it to be about 85 million dollars in the 2019 or 2020 time frame ” , said jeff babione , lockheed martin ’ s f-35 program leader .
babione was in israel for the arrival of the first f-35s ordered by the israeli air force .
trump wrote on twitter earlier on monday that the f-35 program and cost is “ out of control ” and that billions of dollars can be saved on military and other purchases once he is inaugurated on jan. 20 .
