WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is not coordinating its military operations in Syria with Russia, the White House said on Thursday.
“At present, the United States is not conducting or coordinating military operations with Russia,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a news briefing.
“I know there’s some speculation that an agreement may be reached to do so, but it’s not clear that will happen.”
