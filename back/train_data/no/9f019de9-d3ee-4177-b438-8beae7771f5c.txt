tell us your thoughts about this new gun design in the comment section below .
is this compact , folding gun a great idea or will it make going through security a nightmare ?
while gun control remains one of the biggest debates in the country , one man wants to make concealing guns easier .
he created a pistol that folds into what looks like a smartphone easy to carry and hard to detect.cnn money spoke with the creator of the ideal conceal pistol , kirk kjellberg of minnesota , who said he got the inspiration for the handgun after a little kid saw his concealed pistol in a restaurant and told his mom , bringing unwanted attention to the fact that he was packing heat.the problem with his product is it may stoke fears rather than quell them.the pistol itself is a double-barreled .380-caliber derringer that only holds two bullets and can only be fired when it is folded out .
it isn t available for sale yet and the patent is still pending , but it looks like ideal conceal has the intention of producing it.because the gun is disguised even when it isn t concealed , it may require a concealed carry permit even if you aren t hiding it depending on your state s laws .
in new york , weapons that are disguised to look like something other than a firearm are illegal.while this may seem like a great idea for gun owners who don t want to alarm people with the presence of their firearm , what about the people who have bad intentions ?
the ideal conceal pistol can easily be brought anywhere , making it past metal detectors and security pat downs under the guise of being a phone .
if anything , the existence of this weapon could make security even more of a pain to get through imagine if everybody s smartphones had to be inspected on top of everything else .
