Are we the mutation nation now?
Is this person the most qualified for the job or does he/she just fit the agenda to diversify the White House?President Obama has made equality for the LGBT community a priority of his administration, and advocates praised the president for diversifying his White House.
Raffi Freedman-Gurspan, who formerly served as a policy advisor at the National Center for Transgender Equality, has been hired as an outreach and recruitment director in the White House Office of Personnel.
I am elated that Raffi Freedman-Gurspan will become the first openly transgender staff member at the White House.
President Obama has long said he wants his Administration to look like the American people.
I have understood this to include transgender Americans, said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality.
A transgender person was inevitably going to work in the White House.
That the first transgender appointee is a transgender woman of color is itself significant.
And that the first White House transgender appointee is of a friend is inspiring to me and to countless others who have been touched by Raffi s advocacy.
