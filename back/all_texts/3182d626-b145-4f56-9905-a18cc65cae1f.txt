August 30, 2013 Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was given a half-million bucks worth of diamond and ruby jewelry by Saudi Arabian King Abdullah bin Abdul Aziz and received $58,000 worth of bling from Brunei.The lavish gifts were among a treasure trove of keepsakes bestowed upon U.S. leaders in 2012, the State Department disclosed Thursday.The Constitution prohibits U.S. government employees from keeping presents worth more than $350.
But officials at the U.S. General Services Administration said the gifts were accepted to avoid awkward moments.
