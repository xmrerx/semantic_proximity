WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump urged congressional Republicans to repeal Obamacare immediately on Tuesday, saying there was no cause for delay and that a replacement plan should follow the repeal within weeks, according to an interview with the New York Times.
“We have to get to business.
Obamacare has been a catastrophic event,” Trump was quoted as saying in the Times.
He said he wanted a repeal vote next week and said he would not accept a delay of more than a few weeks for a replacement.
