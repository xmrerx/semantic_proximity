Donald Trump probably should have just let this one fly under the radar instead of publicly bragging about it like it s the best news ever.Former President George W. Bush is considered one of the worst presidents in American history.
His policies dragged America into two wars in the Middle East, gave our nation a black eye because of torture and imprisonment at Guantanamo Bay, and led to the Great Recession in 2008 that nearly imploded the world economy.
And let s not forget that Bush responded poorly to Hurricane Katrina and ignored a memo warning that Osama bin Laden was determined to strike the United States using commercial airplanes.But Trump is absolutely thrilled that Bush will be in attendance on January 20th at the inauguration.
@KellyannePolls: Welcome to President and Mrs. Bush.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 8, 2017Honestly, Bush is probably more thrilled about it than Trump is.
After all, he gets to pass the title of worst president to Trump, who is even more illegitimate and inept than Bush ever was, finally making all those Miss me yet memes relevant.And Twitter had a field with Trump s post.
@realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls JUST GET OUT OF HERE AND BE IMPEACHED StopTrumpPutin16 (@stoptrumpputin) January 8, 2017Trump thrives off a Cult of Stupidity.

Jon Byers (@jonbyersphotos) January 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump @KellyannePolls I never in my life thought I d long for/miss George W. Bush.
That s really how much of a monster you are.
Not My President (@NotMyPresident4) January 8, 2017Donald Trump is a disgrace to this country who is going to do more to destroy it than Bush ever did.
Because while Bush did a lot of bad things, he never allowed himself to be used as a puppet by a foreign nation.Featured image via YouTube
