Sarah Palin is having a rough day.
It began with an awkward interview with NBC s Today Show when Palin fumbled and gibberished her way through a softball question about whether she really blamed Barack Obama for her son Track s PTSD (she clearly did).And then, during her introduction of Donald Trump during an Iowa rally on Monday, she attacked a longtime ally, Iowa congressman Steve King, and accused the far-right member of the House Crazy Caucus of huffing ethanol.From TPM: It s dirty business but why would a conservative guy want to say something that he knows isn t true?
Palin asked the crowd.
Maybe he s forgotten some of his heart in the heartland.
Maybe he s been hanging out in a corn field too long huffing ethanol.
Steve King endorsed Ted Cruz and, during an appearance on MSNBC, King accused Trump of buying off Palin in exchange for his assets and resources.
A few things here.1) The first rule of conservatism remains: Don t try to be funny.
It never works.2) You might recall how Palin expressed admiration for King during her infamous off-prompter speech in which she inexplicably blurted, Steve very strong, he goin rogue.
3) If anyone knows the impact of huffing fumes, it s Palin.
In fact, she might ve been high or drunk during her Trump introduction today like always.4) I wonder how Iowa residents feel about Palin insulting their famous congressman, while also insulting ethanol as being nothing more than something one can huff.
5) It s worth repeating: Stop trying to be funny, conservatives.6) Now, Ted Cruz?
Ted Cruz might actually be more tolerable if he huffed something.
Anything.7) Palin thinks it s smart politics to emphasize the notion that huffing ethanol can get you really, really high.
I m sure the children of Iowa Republican caucus-goers will thank her for it.
