berlin ( reuters ) - german voters are punishing the pro-business free democrats ( fdp ) for walking out of three-way coalition talks last month as a poll showed on thursday support for the party falling and the popularity of its leader christian lindner tumbling .
the fdp in mid-november quit exploratory talks to form a coalition government with chancellor angela merkel s conservatives and the environmentalist greens .
lindner said back then it was better not to govern than to govern the wrong way .
some observers speculated that the fdp had planned the move well in advance to boost its standing among voters from the center-right political spectrum and to show the party puts policy principles before power .
but the monthly deutschlandtrend survey , conducted by infratest dimap pollster for ard public broadcaster , showed that support for the fdp fell 3 percentage points to 9 percent , making it the smallest party in parliament .
merkel s conservatives gained 2 percentage points to 32 percent , the social democrats ( spd ) were unchanged at 21 percent .
the far-right alternative for germany stood at 13 percent , followed by the greens with 11 percent and the left party with 10 percent .
the popularity of fdp leader lindner plunged 17 percentage points to only 28 percent .
merkel s popularity fell 3 percentage points to 54 percent , her lowest level in the survey since october 2016 .
the list of germany s most popular politicians was topped by spd foreign minister sigmar gabriel who shot up 8 percentage points to 65 percent .
greens co-leader cem ozdemir came in second with an approval rating of 57 percent .
