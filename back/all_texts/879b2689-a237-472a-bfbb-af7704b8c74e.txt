Australian Senator Larissa Waters recently went viral after she made history by becoming the first woman to breastfeed in the country s Parliament.
But Waters resigned today after it was revealed that she has dual citizenship in Australia and Canada, a breach of Australia s constitution for sitting senators.Waters, a member of Australia s Green Party, became an international sensation in May when she breastfed her two-month old daughter in Australia s parliament.
The country had only just legalized the practice in 2016, paving the way for a more family-friendly environment in Australian politics.Waters was born in Winnipeg in 1977 to two Australian parents and moved down under when she was just 11 months old.
Australia s constitution forbids anyone with dual citizenship from serving as a senator.
Waters, who says she was unaware that she held citizenship in Canada, was elected in 2010.
I was devastated to learn that because of 70-year-old Canadian laws I had been a dual citizen from birth, and that Canadian law changed a week after I was born and required me to have actively renounced Canadian citizenship, Waters said at a press conference today.
It is with a heavy heart that I am forced to resign as senator for Queensland and co-deputy leader of the Australian Greens, effective today, she continued.Waters is the second Australian senator who s had to resign in as many weeks.
