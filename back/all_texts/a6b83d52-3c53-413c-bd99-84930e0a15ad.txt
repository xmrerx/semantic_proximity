21st Century Wire says Ben Stein, reputable professor from, Pepperdine University (also of some Hollywood fame appearing in TV shows and films such as Ferris Bueller s Day Off) made some provocative statements on Judge Jeanine Pirro s show recently.
While discussing the halt that was imposed on President Trump s Executive Order on travel.
Stein referred to the judgement by the 9th Circuit Court in Washington state as a Coup d tat against the executive branch and against the constitution.
Stein went on to call the Judges in Seattle political puppets and the judiciary political pawns.
Watch the interview below for the complete statements and note the stark contrast to the rhetoric of the leftist media and pundits who neglect to note that no court has ever blocked any Presidential orders in immigration in the past or discuss the legal efficacy of the halt or the actual text of the Executive Order.READ MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV
