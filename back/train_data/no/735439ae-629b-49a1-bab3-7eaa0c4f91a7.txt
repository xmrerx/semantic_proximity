washington ( reuters ) - the senate judiciary committee ’ s antitrust subcommittee will hear from the top u.s. antitrust bosses next month to discuss a wave of big mergers over the past year , according to a staffer briefed on the hearing .
the justice department ’ s bill baer , the assistant attorney general for the antitrust division , and edith ramirez , chairwoman of the federal trade commission , will testify , the staffer said .
the two divide the work of antitrust enforcement .
the hearing will be march 9 at the senate judiciary committee ’ s antitrust panel , which is headed by senator mike lee , a republican from utah .
one matter that will be taken up is the ftc ’ s use of section five , a portion of its authority that it uses to investigate companies which urge rivals to collude with them on price .
the agencies are looking at a startling number of major , controversial mergers .
the justice department is investigating two large insurance mergers - aetna inc ( aet.n ) buying humana inc ( hum.n ) and anthem inc ( antm.n ) buying cigna corp ( ci.n ) - to insure they comply with antitrust law .
it is also looking at halliburton co ’ s ( hal.n ) purchase of baker hughes inc bhi.n , among a long list of other deals .
the ftc is suing staples inc spls.o in hopes of stopping it from buying office depot inc ( odp.o ) .
it also said in late 2015 that it aimed to stop three mergers of medical centers , one in west virginia , another in chicago and a third in pennsylvania .
