bamako ( reuters ) - five malian soldiers and one civilian were killed in central mali on tuesday during an ambush on a convoy of the president of the high court of justice , the defense ministry said in a statement .
it was not clear who was responsible for the attack , but the high level target and army deaths point to the deteriorating security situation in mali due to the growing reach of jihadist groups that roam country s vast desert expanses .
the convoy of abdrahamane niang was traveling between the towns of dia and diafarab in the mopti region , about 500 kilometers ( 311 miles ) northeast of the capital bamako , when it was attacked .
mr. niang and his wife were recovered by the army .
however , we report 6 deaths : five soldiers of the malian army and the driver of the honorable niang , the statement said , adding that others had been wounded .
no other details of the attack were given .
the rise of jihadist groups some linked to al qaeda and islamic state continues to destabilize mali , four years after french troops beat back an islamist insurgency that began in 2012 .
around 4,000 french soldiers remain as part of operation barkhane , where they work alongside around 10,000 u.n. peacekeepers in mali .
but attacks on peacekeepers , aid workers and the malian military are common .
four u.s. special forces troops were killed earlier this month in neighboring niger by fighters believed to belong to a local islamic state affiliate operating out of mali .
the g5 sahel , an anti-terrorism taskforce of soldiers from mali , niger , burkina faso , chad and mauritania , plans to launch its first joint operations this month to target islamists in the sahel .
