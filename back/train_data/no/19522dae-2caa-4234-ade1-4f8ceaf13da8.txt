brasilia ( reuters ) - brazilian president michel temer on tuesday signed into law a new program for companies to renegotiate their overdue tax bills , providing extra revenue to cover a gaping budget deficit .
the program , known as refis , has collected 10.9 billion reais ( $ 3.4 billion ) in back taxes this year for the treasury .
earlier this month , the senate approved greater discounts to taxpayers in the program , depriving the cash-strapped government of about 3 billion reais .
