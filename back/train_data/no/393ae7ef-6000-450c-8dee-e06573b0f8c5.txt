oslo ( reuters ) - norwegian defence minister ine eriksen soereide will on friday be named minister of foreign affairs , making her the first woman to hold the post , local media reported on wednesday .
if confirmed , she will replace boerge brende , who last month was appointed president of the world economic forum .
citing unnamed sources , public broadcaster nrk and independent tv2 both reported that conservative prime minister erna solberg would promote eriksen soereide to the foreign ministry post .
the appointment would leave the top three government jobs , that of prime minister , foreign minister and finance minister , in the hands of women .
