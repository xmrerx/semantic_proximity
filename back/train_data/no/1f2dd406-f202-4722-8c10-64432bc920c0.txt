rome ( reuters ) - more than 250 migrants were rescued in the central mediterranean during the night between monday and tuesday , italy s coast guard said .
a statement said the migrants , in one large rubber dinghy and two small boats , were rescued in three missions by two ships , one from a non-governmental organization .
migrant arrivals to italy have fallen by two-thirds year on year since july after officials working for the u.n.-backed government in tripoli put pressure on people smugglers in the libyan city of sabratha to stop boats leaving .
italy is also bolstering the libyan coast guard s ability to turn back boats .
last week , the united nations began bringing african refugees to italy from libya , evacuating them from detention centers whose conditions have been condemned by rights groups as inhumane .
