berlin ( reuters ) - germany s domestic intelligence agency said on thursday that minors returning from war zones in syria and iraq could grow into a new generation of recruits in germany for the islamic state group .
more than 950 people from germany went to join islamic state in syria and iraq , some 20 percent of them women and 5 percent minors , the bfv domestic intelligence agency said .
with islamic state losing territory in syria and iraq , many of the women are expected to return with their children .
germany needs to prepare for the risk of the children being radicalized , bfv chief hans-georg maassen said .
we see the danger of children who socialized with and were indoctrinated by jihadists returning to germany from the war zones , said maassen .
this could allow a new generation of jihadists to be raised here .
last year , a 12-year-old german-iraqi boy failed in an attempt to detonate two explosive devices in the western town of ludwigshafen .
