Jared Kushner just spoke out on being accused of colluding with the Russians during the 2016 campaign: President Trump had a better message & ran a smarter campaign.
That is why he won.
Suggesting otherwise, ridicules those who voted for him.
He hit back at the media:THE MEETING WENT VERY WELL : Jared Kushner said Monday that his closed-door meeting with congressional staff investigating Russian meddling in the presidential election went very well.
Kushner added as he was leaving the meeting that he answered as many questions as the staffers had.Prior to the Monday morning meeting, Kushner released an 11- page statement in which he denied colluding with any foreign government during last year s presidential race.
I did not collude, nor know of anyone else in the campaign who colluded, with any foreign government, Kushner said in the statement.
He denied having improper communications with Kremlin officials as well as any knowledge of Trump campaign officials conspiring with Moscow.The closed-door hearing on Capitol Hill came after reports revealed that Kushner joined Donald Trump Jr. and former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort in a meeting with a Russian lawyer, who Trump Jr. believed had incriminating information on then-Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.Kushner is expected to meet with the House Intelligence Committee on Tuesday, which is leading its own investigation into Russia s meddling in the 2016 election.
