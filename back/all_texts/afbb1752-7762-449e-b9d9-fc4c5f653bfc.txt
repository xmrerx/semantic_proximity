Rumors continue to swirl around West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin who told voters during a Facebook live Q & A that he thinks NFL owners should step in and tell players protesting during the national anthem they won t tolerate it.
The Democrat Senator has been brushing off talk that he s switching parties to become a Republican.
He often agrees with the Republican party and has recently commented that he doesn t give a sh*t if he s reelected.
Manchin came down on the side of the president in the NFL controversy and had some heartfelt comments about why he stands for our anthem.
He called on the NFL owners to address the disrespect in kneeling during the anthem:SENATOR JOE MANCHIN: This is something the owners have to address.
The owners of these football teams, that have these contracts with these players and the conditions these players are going to be playing under, has to step in here and say, I m not going to tolerate it.
The only thing that you and I can do right now is turn off the TV if you don t want to watch, don t go to the game if that s a team you don t respect for whatever reason.
I think everyone should stand and show respect for the flag that represents the greatest nation on earth that s shed more blood and lost more lives for the cause of freedom that you and I enjoy.
HEARTFELT COMMENTS ON THE RIGHT THING TO DO Senator Manchin spoke about why he believes this is the right thing to do : When I was a young person it was just taught to me that was the right thing to do.
When I got older and I realized all the sacrifices that were made for me people that went to war, people that didn t return when I realized all of that, I said that s my patriotic duty that I can say thank you for the flag that represents the greatest country on earth.
Well said!
