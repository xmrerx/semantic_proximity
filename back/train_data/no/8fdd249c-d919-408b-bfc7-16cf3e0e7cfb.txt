history has been made ( once again ) in the united states .
hillary rodham clinton after decades in public service , has been officially nominated as the first female candidate for president of the united states from a major political party.sending secretary clinton over the 2,383 vote necessary was south dakota , which awarded 15 delegates to clinton and 10 to senator bernie sanders , who delivered the acclamation that officially cemented clinton s nomination.clinton walked away with 2,838 to sanders 1,843 .
vermont , which had passed , allowed a final tribute to sanders , before walking off the convention floor.just 96 years ago , women ( some of them ) were given the right to vote .
it wasn t until 1965 when all women were truly given the right to vote , freely and democratically .
and today , july 26th 2016 , a woman has been nominated to take on a rampant sexist and misogynist.today is a day america should celebrate.to celebrate this truly historic day , the strongest , most successful women in american politics will speak , including nancy pelosi , the first female speaker of the house , cecile richards of planned parenthood , barbara boxer ( senator from california ) as well as a plethora of female representatives such as lois frankel and kathrine clark , and feminist activist lena dunham.clinton responded on twitter with a moving tribute dedicated to little girls all across america : this moment is for every little girl who dreams big .
