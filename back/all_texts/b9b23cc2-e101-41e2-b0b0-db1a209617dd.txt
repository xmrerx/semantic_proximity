The annual LA Pride parade and Resist March was held on Sunday.
Bonkers Rep. Maxine Waters led the crowd in a chant to Impeach 45 .
At the end of her hateful rant she yelled out STAY WOKE!
THIS IS THE DEFINITION OF UNDIGNIFIED AND UNPROFESSIONAL!Notice how Adam Schiff stands in approval next to Waters.
Mind you, this is while Waters is spewing hate speech towards our president and Schiff is involved in the fake Russia scam going on to try and take Trump down: In fact, Freedom Watch filed an ethics complaint against Intel Committee Member Adam Schiff for obstruction of justice:Larry Klayman of Freedom Watch on Schiff:Klayman Discusses Complaint Against Rep. Adam Schiff for Obstruction of Justice & Ethics ViolationsIsn t this a huge conflict of interest?
It certainly doesn t look good and shows us that Schiff is not to be trusted when it comes to anything Trump.Just in case you didn t hear the disgusting speech given by Maxine Waters: He is not my president.
He is not your president.
He lies.
He cheats.
He s a bully.
He disrespects us all.
If he thinks he can mess with the LGBT community, he better look at what happened right here in West Hollywood.
You deny, you disrespect, and you will find that there are people who have the courage to organize and to take back whatever needs to be taken back.
We resist this president because he stands for the worst of everything.
And guess what, I know that people may not quite be ready.
I know some are a little hesitant.
I know some are saying I m not so sure, Maxine, that what you are saying is the right thing, but I m saying, impeach 45.
Impeach 45.
I love you all.
And I know that we are going to take our country back from HIM.
I know you have the strength.
I know that you have the courage.
I know that each of you knows you have the power!
Stay woke!
