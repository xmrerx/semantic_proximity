Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump decided to attack the family of a U.S. soldier who died in combat in Iraq.
Responding to Khizr Khan s statement at the Democratic convention that Trump had sacrificed nothing for his country while pushing for bans on Muslims, Trump told ABC, I think I ve made a lot of sacrifices.
I work very, very hard.
U.S. Army Capt.
Humayun Khan was a Muslim immigrant who died serving in Iraq in 2004.On Twitter, the dismissive, callous, and insensitive remarks from the former reality TV star and self-described billionaire (an assertion that has not been independently verified) were quickly attacked.The hashtag #TrumpSacrifices became the top trending hashtag in the world and thousands of posts mocking Trump followed.Many of the posts associated with the tag pointed out Trump s well documented luxury life that has been the selling point of his presidential run.Once survived an entire weekend at Mar-a-Lago with just one can of hairspray.

(@SeanMcElwee) July 30, 2016Some #TrumpSacrifices posts discussed the candidate s repeated business failures, which include multiple bankruptcies that completely destroy the mythology of him as a huge business success.#TrumpSacrifices Declaring Bankruptcy And Walking Away pic.twitter.com/v4B2I8AeXm Laurel Davila, CPA (@laureldavilacpa) July 31, 2016The wages of every contractor he has ever employed.

Draft dodger #TrumpSacrifices pic.twitter.com/lTNGooahKC Carolyn Gonzalez (@carogonza) July 31, 2016The hashtag also presented the opportunity to compare Trump s military service or lack thereof to Captain Humayun Khan.
Trump received military deferments during Vietnam and has compared avoiding sexually transmitted diseases to serving in combat.Gave up his 5 spots in the military for another 5 men.
That's generous!
No one thanked him #TrumpSacrifices Sarah (@redpainter1) July 30, 2016Despite the public outcry and condemnation of his comments, senior Republican officials like Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell failed to directly condemn the nominee s attack on a military family, and did not rescind their support for the candidate.Featured image via screen capture
