ankara ( reuters ) - turkey no longer needs to join the european union but will not unilaterally abandon the stalled eu accession talks , president tayyip erdogan told parliament on sunday .
we will not be the side which gives up .
to tell the truth , we don t need eu membership any more , erdogan said .
turkey s 12-year-long accession talks have ground to a halt , with the eu especially critical of ankara s crackdown following a failed coup last year .
tens of thousands of people including teachers and journalists have been detained .
erdogan s government says eu states failed to appreciate the gravity of the threat which turkey faced , and did not respond to requests to extradite coup suspects .
the eu failed us in a fight against terrorism , erdogan said on sunday , though he also suggested the bloc still needed turkey .
if the eu is going to leap forward , there is only one way to do so .
and it is to grant turkey membership and start an action of cultural and economic growth , erdogan said .
german chancellor angela merkel said in an election debate last month it was clear turkey should not join the eu and entry talks should end , despite it being a crucial nato ally .
