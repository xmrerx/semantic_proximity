This past January we all witnessed one of the largest, most significant protests in history as millions of people across the globe took part in the Women s March on Washington, but another group has a message for Donald Trump and has quite literally taken it to the next level.Showing support for the upcoming March for Science which will take place on Earth Day, April 22, the Autonomous Space Agency Network, or ASAN, has launched the first ever protest from space.
While their protest doesn t physically include millions of people, you can bet that millions are supporting it as we are forced to watch Trump s administration withdraw funding from agencies like NASA s Earth Science program which was put in place to protect our planet from climate change, and don t forget that during Trump s presidential campaign, he vowed to do away with the Environmental Protection Agency, saying, We re going to get rid of it in almost every form.
Equipped with a giant tweet aimed directly at Trump, ASAN sent a weather balloon into the stratosphere, with one purpose in mind; To get Trump to look down at what he aims to destroy:.

You want to grab a politician by the scruff of the neck and drag him a quarter of a million miles out and say, Look at that, you son of a b h.' Indeed.
Take a break from trying to kill everyone and LOOK at that, you son of a bitch!
