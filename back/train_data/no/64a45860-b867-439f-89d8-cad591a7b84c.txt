hillary spoke to a very small group of students at temple university .
with a total student population of just under 38,000 , her estimated crowd of 300 would be considered by most , to be a total bust .
unfit hillary wasn t about to let 37,700 disinterested students stand in the way of addressing 300 paid plants students about the benefits of a taxpayer funded education or a president who is willing , on behalf of the american taxpayer , to forgive their debts what the heck is hillary hiding now ?
what is going on with her eyes in this video ?
we looked into symptoms of patients with parkinson s disease and here s what we found : visual motor symptoms of patients with parkinson s disease : some vision difficulties are related to changes in the movement of the eyeball .
these are motor symptoms , similar to other motor symptoms caused by loss of dopamine neurons .
blurred or double vision , and eye strain , because the eyes may have trouble moving together to focus on things traveling toward or away from a person trouble reading , because the eye movements needed to follow the lines of a page are slowed and have trouble starting ( similar to gait freezing in the legs ) a person with pd may need to blink in order to change eye position ; levodopa can helplet s put the eye issue aside for a moment and let s examine why hillary has chosen to talk to this crowd of adults like they re a two year old sitting on her lap , while she reads them a bed-time book ?
no wonder millennials are leaving her in droves .
she s not just a liar , she a a condescending liar as well .
she doesn t have enough faith in these young adults to consider they may care about our national security or about getting a good paying job out of college .
her only concern seems to be how to woo them with the free sh * t vote her former opponent bernie sanders used to build his base.as the gateway pundit reported hillary was given assistance getting up the stairs to get to the stage .
she needed help .
