washington ( reuters ) - u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson will meet lebanese prime minister saad al-hariri in paris on friday , the state department said in a statement on thursday .
the two will meet during a ministerial meeting of the international lebanon support group , a body that includes the five permanent members of the u.n. security council britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
hariri rescinded his resignation on tuesday , drawing a line under a month-long crisis triggered when he announced from riyadh that he was stepping down and remained outside lebanon for weeks .
his coalition government , which includes the iran-backed hezbollah group , reaffirmed a state policy of staying out of conflicts in arab states .
the state department statement said tillerson would encourage the lebanese government and other nations to move more aggressively in limiting hezbollah s destabilizing activity in the region .
