brasilia ( reuters ) - former brazilian president luiz in cio lula da silva extended his lead in the run-up to the 2018 presidential election despite a corruption conviction that could bar him from running , a poll showed on saturday .
the datafolha survey published in the folha de s.paulo newspaper showed lula winning at least 35 percent support from those polled in a first-round vote , up from about 30 percent in a june poll .
two potential competitors , former environment minister marina silva and right-wing congressman jair bolsonaro , trailed with 13 percent to 17 percent of voting intentions .
lula would beat all potential contenders in a runoff vote , the poll said , expect in an unlikely contest against sergio moro , the judge who convicted him of corruption in july .
moro has repeatedly denied being a candidate .
millions of brazilians were lifted from poverty during lula s 2003-2010 presidency .
many detractors blame him for a political graft that flourished under the workers party , calling his bribery conviction the end to his political career .
lula may not be eligible to run if his conviction is upheld by a higher court .
datafolha showed 26 percent of voters would vote for a candidate endorsed by lula in such a scenario .
sao paulo state governor geraldo alckmin and sao paulo city mayor joao doria , both from the brazilian social democracy party ( psdb ) , had 8 percent of voting intentions each .
lula was found guilty last month and sentenced to nearly 10 years in prison for accepting 3.7 million reais worth of bribes from engineering firm oas , the amount of money prosecutors said the company spent refurbishing a beach apartment for lula in return for his help winning contracts with state oil company petroleo brasileiro .
he also faces other graft charges .
