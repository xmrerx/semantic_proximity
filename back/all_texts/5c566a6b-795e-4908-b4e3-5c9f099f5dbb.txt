Alex Jones of the conspiracy theory website Infowars has made a literal career of spreading fake news and acting like a lunatic.
It now seems that said career has come back to really bite him in the ass, since Jones just lost a court battle with his wife regarding which parent is most fit to raise their children.
After more than nine hours of considering the merits of Jones case, a jury returned, giving the estranged couple joint custody of the three children.
Despite having joint custody, though, Jones ex, Kelly Jones, will have most of the power.Prior to this battle, Alex Jones had the kids living with him, with their mother s rights being severely curtailed.
She was only allowed supervised visits before.
The reasons for this are unclear.
She said tearfully to the press: I m so blessed to have such a wonderful support system and I just pray that what s happened to my family that people can understand what parental alienation syndrome is and get an awareness of it so we can stop this from happening to others.
A lawyer for Kelly Jones, Robert Hoffman, said of Alex Jones: Mr. Jones is like a cult leader.
And we ve seen the horrific damage cult leaders do to their followers.
Indeed he is.
Alex Jones whips his paranoid, ignorant followers up into a frenzy and makes them believe all kinds of tomfoolery.
He has promoted the idea that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting never happened, that 9/11 was actually carried out by the United States government, and all kinds of other craziness, and his rabid audience believes every word of it.
Definitely, such a person should not be influencing children.
At any rate, it is good to see that jury made the right choice here, and hopefully Kelly Jones can undo whatever damage her estranged husband did to those poor children.Featured image via screen capture from Infowars
