Except for the walls part, this is a really timeless address to Americans on Thanksgiving from a great leader: My fellow Americans, let us keep this Thanksgiving Day sacred thanking God for the bounty and goodness of our nation.
As a measure of our gratitude, let us rededicate ourselves to the preservation of the land of the free and the home of the brave.
