brunell donald-kyei : we want tougher immigration .
to make sure that our borders are safe !
that we are not fighting illegal aliens and refugees for jobs !
americans are tired of fighting other people for jobs !
that frustration is real .
that hurt is real .
and for the pols and different people to dismiss that ?
it s not right !
the most important issue to me is economics .
because the last eight years the economy the poor people of this nation have suffered .
the middle class has suffered .
and let me tell you something : the american people don t want to be dealing with a president going into office with all the baggage , with all the investigations that are going to be on top of hillary clinton.our nation needs to heal .
we want to heal .
we want peace between the races .
we want to make sure that our youth , whether they re white , black , hispanic have jobs !
we want to make sure that the constitution is protected !
those are american issues !
that has absolutely nothing to do with your race .
that s to protect this nation !
and we want tougher immigration .
to make sure that our borders are safe !
that we are not fighting illegal aliens and refugees for jobs !
americans are tired of fighting other people for jobs !
that frustration is real .
that hurt is real .
and for the pols and different people to dismiss that ?
it s not right !
trust us !
you will love this ! americas sweetheart @ brunelldonald jus took down krauthammer elitist panel !
