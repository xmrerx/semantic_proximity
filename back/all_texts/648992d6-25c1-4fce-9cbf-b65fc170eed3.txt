Please note that this unhinged woman is a middle school teacher!After an eight-month investigation, Yvette Felarca, a middle school teacher in Berkeley, was arrested and charged this week with assault and rioting at a rally in Sacramento last summer.
As it turns out, when she s not filling the minds of impressionable early teens, Felarca is punching Nazis.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuWoQfZgW7MFelarca, 47, is the leader of the fascist antifa group By Any Means Necessary and they were on hand in June 2016 to counter protest a permitted rally by the Traditionalist Worker Party at the California state capitol building.
As fists flew, smart phones recorded and caught Felarca punching a man repeatedly in his stomach and yelling at him to get the f*** off our streets.
What she started, her fascist friends finished, jumping the guy and beating him on the ground before police stepped in.Now, the Sacramento County District Attorney s Office charged her with inciting and participating in a riot and assault likely to cause great bodily injury.
Luckily, she was one of the counter-protesters who didn t cover her face, making her easy to identify.
Over 300 fascists showed up that day to intimidate 30 members of the worker party who had a permit to be there.Fox News reports:In addition to the June clash, Felarca has been prominent at several other events involving the Occupy movement, and more recently between supporters and opponents of President Trump and other conservative leaders.She was also among the people who protested Milo Yiannopoulos appearance at UC Berkeley earlier this year.
During an appearance on Fox News after the protests, she said she was obligated to shut down his racist, misogynistic and homophobic messages.Here s her appearance shortly after the Berkeley riot being indignant and unapologetic with Tucker Carlson:There were others charged in the riot which included multiple assaults and stabbings.
However, it was nowhere near the number the California Highway patrol tallied in a 2000-page report on the incident.
In total, there were 514 misdemeanors and 68 felonies involving 101 people, according to Milo.com.Read more: Truth Feed
