Example #490927 that Trump is terrible with children: While making his way through the crowd at the White House Easter egg roll, Trump was asked by a young child if he would sign his hat.
Somehow he screwed that up.After being stopped, Trump grabs a pen, quickly signs the hat and then throws the hat deep into the crowd.
Some in the crowd literally shout nooo!
as he does it.
Trump, oblivious to the fact that he just screwed this kid over, grabs another hat.
Signs it.
And does the exact same thing.What is going through his head?A kid asks Trump to sign his hat at the White House Easter Egg Roll.
The president signs and then tosses the hat into the crowd.

as if the kid he screwed over wasn t standing right in front of him the whole time.
It s unclear if the original kid ever got his signed hat.Even setting aside this awful moment, Trump s Easter egg roll was a shoddily run event.Other than that, everything was perfect.Featured image via Twitter
