Be careful what you ask for Watch: FBI Director James Comey testified Wednesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee that Hillary Clinton emails containing classified information were forwarded to the computer of Anthony Weiner, the former congressman, by his wife, Clinton aide Huma Abedin.Comey also strongly defended himself on Capitol Hill for his Oct. 28 letter notifying Congress of newly discovered emails appearing pertinent to Clinton s private server investigation, arguing it would have been catastrophic to conceal such a revelation.He explained that his investigative team informed him in late October of metadata from Weiner s computer showing thousands of Clinton s emails on that device, including what they thought might be the missing emails from her first three months at the State Department.Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011 over a sexting scandal and saw a 2013 mayoral run in New York City go up in flames for similar reasons.
The investigation that led to Comey s letter concerned his sexting with an underage girl.
