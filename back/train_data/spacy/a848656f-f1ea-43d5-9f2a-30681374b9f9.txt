wfb north korea first time week reveal plan use -PRON- nuclear arm spacebase electronicsdisrupte emp attack addition direct warhead ground blaststhe official communist party newspaper rodong sinmun publish report monday emp might nuclear weapon outline electromagnetic pulse emp attack produce detonate nuclear warhead space
general strong electromagnetic pulse generate nuclear bomb explosion 30 kilometer 100 kilometer 186 mile 62 mile ground severely impair electronic device electric machine electromagnetic grid destroy electric cable safety device say article author kim songwon dean kim chaek university technology pyongyang
discovery electromagnetic pulse source high yield highaltitude nuclear explosion test process give -PRON- recognition important strike method -PRON- statedthe official discussion north korea plan conduct emp strike likely fuel debate threat
former cia director james woolsey say north korea capable orbit emp nuclear weapon satellitesome liberal arm control advocate dismiss emp threat pyongyang farfetche arm control advocate jeffrey lewis april dismiss threat emp attack laugh reporter question
favorite nightmare scenario small group dedicated people -PRON- tell nprdisclosure north korea intention use -PRON- nuclear force emp attack come us intelligence agency continue analyze late underground nuclear test north korea sept 3 regime say -PRON- first hydrogen bomb explosionsenior administration official say initial assessment nuclear blast northeastern north korea indicate -PRON- large test detonation far much large underground test carry last year
-PRON- regime sixth nuclear testus
nuclear technician make definitive conclusion specific device
specialist try determine test involve hydrogen bomb pyongyang asserted device design emp attack
-PRON- also assess whether test use boost fission technologyhydrogen bomb advanced device use twostage explosion process produce massive explosion
boost fission device less sophisticated technologically require nuclear fuel
-PRON- highly confident test advanced nuclear device -PRON- see far inconsistent north korea claim us intelligence official saidhowever final conclusion type yield blast expect several day
datum test analyze nuclear weapon expert los alamos national laboratory new mexicoalso large explosion perhaps 100 kiloton equivalent 100 ton tn likely produce significant venting radioactive particle airspecial us intelligence aircraft include wc135 nuclear sniffer jet conduct flight near test zone gather sample particle testexpert say emp attack n korea real dark possibilityaccording business insider expert believe realistic threat point time emp attack
make happen north korea launch lowyield nuclear missile submarine ship even balloon explode -PRON- high altitude atmospherethe potential result blackout eastern grid supply 75 power united statesif emp attack take place -PRON- would beyond anything -PRON- see
commission assess threat united states electromagnetic pulse attack establish congress 2001 estimate within 12 month follow nationwide blackout 90 us population could perish starvation disease societal breakdown
electronic armageddonin practical term catastrophic blackout would bad city -PRON- would instantly deprive population access drinking water refrigeration heat air conditioning telecommunication
food store would loot within matter day gas station would cease function without electricitywithout internet access power commerce advanced method communication would stop
would tv radio phone
credit card transaction cash withdrawal bank would impossible
paper money would become worthless bitcoin would cease exist along stock marketnewt gingrich speak senate committee energy natural resource earlier month say emp attack would send -PRON- back 18th century
problem
outside help arrive within day chaos begin reign
civilization rather thin veneer human acquire century mask cover -PRON- hardwire survival instinct
mask slip -PRON- could mean end world -PRON- know itwe illprepare emp attackus politician major utility kick road -PRON- come emp preparation
edison electric estimate shield transformer us grid system could cost 20 billiongrante american power company study way protect -PRON- electronic grid attack tangible result slow comingthe current option emp attack would replace damage destroy transformer
however say scott aaronson manage director cyber infrastructure security edison electric replacement transformer must procure foreign supplier could take 18 monthspeter vincent pry leader task force national homeland security believe north korea close launch emp attack many analyst believe
-PRON- want congress work harder cut red tape allow innovation necessary mitigate threatin pry opinion emp attack would ultimately kill americans direct nuclear blast could
-PRON- book long sunday describe several plausible emp attack scenariospry think first nation use nuclear weapon today even rogue state like north korea iran immediately become feared credible nuclear power world formidable force reckon perhaps dominant actor new world order
sensible way prepare emp attackmaybe stock food water fuel battery emergency always good idea well stash gold coin hard assetswhile -PRON- eat gold prepper say -PRON- kind money prevail millennia
kim north korean technical university dean state highaltitude explosion conduct stratosphere space blast wave limit lack air thinness air
explosion occur altitude large amount electron release result ionization reaction highenergy instant gamma ray radioactive ray -PRON- say
electron form strong electromagnetic pulse emp interaction geomagnetic field
detonation would create strong electric field 100000 volt per meter -PRON- approach ground -PRON- destroy communication facility electricity grid report saidthe emp report publish monday day staterun outlet report visit north korean leader kim jong un nuclear weapon facility also mention plan use nuclear weapon emp attack
-PRON- hydrogen bomb whose power nuclear bomb adjust ten kiloton hundred kiloton accord target strike multifunctional thermonuclear warhead enormous lethality destructibility also even carry superpowerful emp attack expansive area detonation high altitude accord strategic goal report say
