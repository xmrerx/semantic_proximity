Well, he said it.
Trump s fans have long been chanting lock her up at his rallies despite that Clinton has not committed a single jailable offense.
But they re sure that it happened, and their candidate took their conspiracy theories and irrational hatred mainstream during Sunday s sh*tshow of a presidential debate.
I didn t think I would say this but I m going to say it, Trump began.
If I win, I am going to instruct my Attorney General to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation Trump told Clinton that in his opinion the people at the FBI are furious with her because of the email nonscandal.
We re going to get a special prosecutor and we ;re going to look into it because you know what?
People have been, their lives have been destroyed for doing one-fifth of what you have done, he said.Clinton s face the entire time was priceless as we watched her choke back grins and laughter, at times finding it impossible to hide her mirth.
At one point, her face kind of froze as she appeared to daydream about her first day in the Oval Office and one could even see thought bubbles appear over her head: Madame President.
President Hillary Clinton.
Yeah.
That s the ticket.
Then, when it was her turn to respond, she dropped the hammer: Everything he just said is absolutely false but I m not surprised.
Clinton once again reminded Americans that her website is serving as a fact-checking service for the night, calling the daunting task impossible.
It s just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country, Clinton said before Trump shot back, because you d be in jail.
Remember to vote in November otherwise, we get a President who believes his political opponents should be jailed without committing a crime.Watch it below:Featured image via Getty Images/Win McNamee
