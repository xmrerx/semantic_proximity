Republican nominee Donald Trump usually incites violence against his protesters, as well as women and minorities, but last night he went after one of America s most beloved politicians our current Vice President, Joe Biden!At a Florida rally, Trump threatened Biden because he d dared to criticize Trump s disgusting locker room talk and comments about women.
Of course, Trump s only answer to anything is violence.
Trump shouted: Did you see where Biden wants to take me to the back of the barn?
I d love that.
I d love that!
Mr. Tough Guy.
You know, he s Mr. Tough Guy.
You know when he s Mr. Tough Guy?
When he s standing behind a microphone by himself.
And of course, the man-baby then complained that he s going to be held to an unfair standard by saying that: If I said that, they d say he s violent, how could he have done that Trump had been responding to Biden s comments earlier this week, when the Vice President blasted the business mogul s misogynistic behavior and history with women.
Biden s exact words had been: I wish we were in high school and I could take him behind the gym.
Biden further clarified that remark and made sure that everyone knew that physical violence is not how you handle disagreements when you re an adult:But since Trump barely has the maturity of a high schooler, a brawl is a perfectly reasonable way for him to solve an argument.
