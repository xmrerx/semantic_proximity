Thank goodness a police camera captured a Democratic county lawmaker bizarrely screaming, begging, invoking for special privileges, saying she s broke, claiming to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and panting like she s about to keel over while she received a routine speeding ticket for driving 13 miles per hour over the posted speed limit.
The legislator in the disturbing dash-cam video is Jennifer Schwartz Berky, a member of the Ulster County Legislature in Ulster County, New York.Becky obviously doesn t think the rules apply to her The incident occurred back in May.
The video is coming out now just in time for local elections in response to a Freedom of Information Law request (and in spite of appeals by Berky s lawyer to suppress it).You owe it to yourself to watch this woman s epic freakout.
There s groaning and whimpering.
There are excuses galore.Mere words cannot do any sort of justice to the groaning, the whimpering, the excuse-making, the lamentation and the gnashing of teeth over a speeding ticket for going 43 miles per hour in a zone where the posted speed limit is 30 miles per hour.The New York Post has published an even shorter version sort of a CliffsNotes summary of Berky s amazing encounter with local police.Berky who claims in the video that she suffers from PTSD has an undergraduate degree in art history and a graduate degree in urban planning from Columbia University, according to a lengthy biography at the website of Ulster County s local government.She was born and raised in New York City but has lived for several years abroad during her career and studies, and is fluent in Spanish, French and Italian.
She lists three party affiliations in her bio.
In addition to the Democratic Party, there is the Green Party and the Working Families Party, an ultra-progressive leftist group.She has been very been active in supporting her fellow Democrats and Working Families Party candidates in federal, state and local elections.
Wow!
