***WARNING***This video is very disturbing!Try to imagine this brave man who voluntarily enlisted in our US military, traveled halfway around the world to Afghanistan where he risked his life to defend our nation against some of the most evil people on the planet, only to come home to some of the most evil people in America shouting, F*ck off Nazi scum!
in his face.
The saddest part of this video is watching the Afghanistan veteran actually attempt to have dialogue with these anti-American jack-asses, who are likely only there to collect a paycheck from George Soros.The crime of attending the free-speech rally in and of itself, was enough to anger these anti-Americans, but the moment this veteran admitted to supporting President Trump, the angry Alt-Left crowd began to come unhinged.
Would this video of an Afghanistan veteran, who appears to be all by himself in a large group of violent, Soros funded Antifa thugs, be splashed all over every network in America if he was verbally assaulted by this group of masked cowards for defending Barack Obama during his presidency?
If we didn t know better, we d almost think there was a double standard in America.Antifa assembled at the entry point of the free speech rally.

President Trump was correct to not defend these Antifa thugs, who ve been laying low in their parent s basements after they got pummeled by conservatives who fought back against their attacks in California.
