ever the politician and excellent liar , obama was asked about smoking pot during a press event in vietnam .
he must have smoked lots of pot because he forgot about the fact that he said he indeed did smoke pot .
he also must have forgotten that he wrote about it in his book .
remember choom gang ?
we re not condemning him for the pot smoking as much as we re calling him out for blatantly lying in his book or to the questioner in vietnam .
so which is it ?
here s our president totally trying to pull a fast one in an obvious lie at a press event in a foreign country .
nice job obama making america look foolish on a national stage is really what you re best at.obama and his choom gang must have been smoking strong stuff .
now he can t even remember if he smoked it at all .
from his recent trip to vietnam : when a vietnamese attendee at a town hall asked pres .
obama about his weed-smoking past , the u.s. president replied that he didn t know if reports of his marijuana use were true.the exchange : q : thank you .
i m a filmmaker , so i m very interested in personal stories .
and you said before , when you are young you re like fooling around .
and i read on internet i m not sure if it s true or not that you also like smoking weed and things like that .
obama : i don t know if that s true .
if he really doesn t remember , he ought to refresh his memory by reading his own book : in his 1995 memoir dreams of my father , obama writes about smoking pot almost like dr. seuss wrote about eating green eggs and ham .
as a high school kid , obama wrote , he would smoke in a white classmate s sparkling new van , he would smoke in the dorm room of some brother and he would smoke on the beach with a couple of hawaiian kids .
he would smoke it here and there .
he would smoke it anywhere.maybe obama killed too many brain cells and all of a sudden he can t remember how convenient ! read more : moonbattery
