aden ( reuters ) - the saudi-led military coalition fighting against the houthi movement in yemen has reopened a land border crossing , easing a blockade imposed on the country earlier this week , a yemeni official and witnesses said on friday .
the coalition said on monday it would close all air , land and sea ports in yemen to stem the flow of arms to the houthis from iran , after saudi arabia intercepted a missile fired toward its capital riyadh .
the al wadea border crossing , linking saudi arabia with territory in eastern yemen controlled by the saudi-backed government , was reopened on thursday , the official and witnesses said , letting food and other supplies enter yemen .
the united nations has said that a total blockade could cause a famine that could kill millions .
the southern port of aden was reopened on wednesday .
the houthis , drawn mainly from yemen s zaidi shi ite minority and allied to long-serving former president ali abdullah saleh , control much of the country including the capital san aa .
saudi arabia and its arab allies have been waging war against them on behalf of the government of president abd-rabbu mansour hadi , based in aden .
united nations aid chief mark lowcock said on wednesday that if the coalition did not allow humanitarian aid access to yemen , it would cause the largest famine the world has seen for many decades , with millions of victims .
the saudis and their allies say the houthis get weapons from their arch-foe , iran .
iran denies arming the houthis and blames the conflict in yemen on riyadh .
