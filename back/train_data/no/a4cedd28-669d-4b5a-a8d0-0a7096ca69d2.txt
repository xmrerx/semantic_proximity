charles payne and economist liz peek discuss the booming trump economy and why the hateful media won t report on it : payne : these are blue collar jobs maybe that s not sexy to the main stream media.peek : how many of those economists are talking about how the market is up 13 % ? payne is so correct about the media s lack of interest in the booming trump economy .
the american people see it and are feeling it too .
as long as president trump keeps his focus and continues improving the economy , he ll be great .
