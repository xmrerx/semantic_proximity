BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s hard work in trying to ensure the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula is obvious to all, China’s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Beijing was not helping to control North Korea.
Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang, speaking at a regular press briefing, also urged the United States to recognize the sensitivity of the Taiwan issue after Trump left open the possibility of meeting Taiwan’s president if she visits the United States after he is sworn in on Jan. 20.
