stockholm ( reuters ) - a swedish court on monday sentenced a syrian asylum seeker to eight months in prison after he posed for photos with dead bodies during the conflict in his home country .
the man admitted to posing with dead or severely injured people while fighting for the syrian army in 2014 and that he knew the pictures would be used for propaganda , the district court said .
he denied wrongdoing , however , saying he was following orders .
the man has by his actions exposed the five persons , all of whom were protected under international humanitarian law in armed conflicts , for humiliating or degrading treatment aimed at seriously violating their personal dignity , the court said .
the man sought asylum in sweden in 2015 and was detained this year after a member of the public sent the photo to the police .
