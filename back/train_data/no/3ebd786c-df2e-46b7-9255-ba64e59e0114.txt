a first-grader in florida must have been inspired by the anti-american jackwagons in the nfl .
he refused to stand for the pledge of allegiance .
he took a knee a la kaepernick .
instead of tanning his hide , his mother took the side of the disrespectful 6-year-old .
the mother doesn t think that the pasco county school district takes inclusion and diversity seriously.that boy s mother is speaking out because of a text message she received from her son s first-grade teacher about the incident.the text message read : i just wanted to let you know that this morning when it was time to do the pledge of allegiance , ( your son ) went down on one knee .
i knew where he had seen it but i did tell him that in the classroom we are learning what it means to be a good citizen we re learning about respecting the united states of america and our country symbols and showing loyalty and patriotism and that we stand for the pledge of allegiance .
i know its [ sic ] a sensitive issue but i wanted to make you aware .
thanks the mom complained that the teacher doesn t have a right to tell her son to stand : she told him right away , based on what he told me , to stand up and to stop it that s not her right .
standing for the pledge is state law .
no matter ; the pint-sized malcolm x is black .
the whole point of the anti-american antics that now define the nfl is to bully people into accepting that laws should not be enforced when they are violated by persons of politically preferred pigmentation , because racism.the rules apply to everyone .read more : abc
