( reuters ) - the world s fastest-growing humanitarian crisis shows no signs of abating , two months after militant attacks triggered a military crackdown in myanmar s rakhine state .
this week thousands of new rohingya muslim refugees crossed the border into neighboring bangladesh , fleeing hunger and a campaign of attacks by myanmar security forces and buddhist mobs that the united nations has called ethnic cleansing .
exhausted , hungry and destitute , they join more than 600,000 who earlier fled what the military has called clearance operations in rohingya villages after the aug. 25 attacks by rohingya militants .
they have crossed land borders , rivers and treacherous seas to seek refuge in crowded camps in bangladesh , itself a poor country struggling , along with international aid agencies , to cope with the influx .
this multimedia essay uses a combination of reuters graphics , pictures and video to show how the crisis unfolded , the exodus of the rohingya and their lives as refugees in bangladesh .
