The Republican Party is truly screwed if Fox News is thinking like this.During an appearance on the O Reilly Factor on Friday night, Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace delivered a scathing analysis of the GOP Debate held on Thursday, calling it an embarrassment for the Republican Party.
Let me just say first of all- big picture- I thought it was an embarrassment for the Republican party.
There were a lot of shots taken, a lot of shots scored, but there was precious little vision.
Almost no serious discussion of issues, you know, what are are you going to do, how are are you going to improve people s lives?
If you saw someone acting presidentially on that stage, you got better eyesight than I do.
Here s the video via YouTube:Indeed, the GOP Debate was a complete circus that saw every candidate sniping at each other with ridiculous attacks.
Clearly, Trump brought Cruz and Rubio down to his level of gutter politics.Here s a clip demonstrating the debate in a nutshell:// < !

And Republicans only have themselves to blame because they welcomed crazy extremists into the mainstream of the party years ago when they sold out to the Tea Party in 2010.
Now it s coming back to bit them in the ass so hard that not even Fox News can spin them out of it.Featured Image: Screenshot
