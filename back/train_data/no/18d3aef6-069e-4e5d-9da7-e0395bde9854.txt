birds of a feather flock together-dirty politics follows obama and clinton so here s yet another example of these two scumbags doing underhanded deals and lying their way through every situation : obama s state department is blocking correspondence from hillary clinton and her top state department aides about a controversial 12-nation trade deal will not be available for public review at least not until after the election .
the obama administration abruptly stopped the release of clinton s state department correspondence about the so-called trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) , after first saying it expected to produce the emails this spring.the decision came in response to international business times open records request for correspondence between clinton s state department office and the united states trade representative .
the request , which was submitted in july 2015 , specifically asked for all such correspondence that made reference to the tpp.the state department originally said it estimated the request would be completed by april 2016 .
last week the agency said it had completed the search process for the correspondence but also said it was delaying the completion of the request until late november 2016 weeks after the presidential election .
the delay was issued in the same week the obama administration filed a court motion to try to kill a lawsuit aimed at forcing the federal government to more quickly comply with open records requests for clinton-era state department documents.clinton s shifting positions on the tpp have been a source of controversy during the campaign : she repeatedly promoted the deal as secretary of state but then in 2015 said , i did not work on tpp , even though some leaked state department cables show that her agency was involved in diplomatic discussions about the pact .
under pressure from her democratic primary opponent , bernie sanders , clinton announced in october that she now opposes the deal and has disputed that she ever fully backed it in the first place.while some tpp-related emails have been released by the state department as part of other open records requests , ibt s request was designed to provide a comprehensive view of how involved clinton and her top aides were in shaping the trade agreement , and whether her agency had a hand in crafting any particular provisions in the pact .
unions , environmental organizations and consumer groups say the agreement will help corporations undermine domestic labor , conservation and other public interest laws.via : gateway pundit
