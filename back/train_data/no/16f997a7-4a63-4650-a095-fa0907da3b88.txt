speaker of the house paul ryan is officially a total sellout !
he agreed to a $ 1.1 trillion omnibus spending bill with obama late wednesday night that increases unskilled guest workers allowed into america significantly .
under the bloated $ 1.1 trillion bill , the number of h-2b visas will nearly be up as much as four times as the previous levels .
this allows unskilled illegals into this country to drive down wages .
there is always the chance terrorists are embedded in the increase in visas as well .
so it s business as usual in washington where the american people come last # firepaulryan !
the year-end spending deal unveiled early wednesday morning includes a provision that would increase the number of guest worker visas available to unskilled foreign nationals seeking employment in the u.s.according to ian smith , an attorney with the immigration reform law institute , language inserted into the omnibus spending deal would nearly quadruple the number of h-2b visa workers admitted to the u.s. next year to about 250,000.the section of the more than 2,000-page omnibus bill that contains the provision , the immigration reduction group numberusa reports , is on page 701 .
it reads : sec .
565 .
section 214 ( g ) ( 9 ) ( a ) of the immigration and nationality act ( 8 u.s.c .
1184 ( g ) ( 9 ) ( a ) ) is amended by striking 2004 , 2005 , or 2006 shall not again be counted toward such limitation during fiscal year 2007. and inserting 2013 , 2014 , or 2015 shall not again be counted toward such limitation during fiscal year 2016 .
h-2b visas are intended for low-skilled foreign nationals to work temporarily in nonagricultural positions when american workers are unavailable .
according to recent reports , however , some employers have abused the system , devising strategies to hire h-2b visa holders over american workers.via : breitbart
