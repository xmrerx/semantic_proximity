Secretary of State Rex Tillerson was a participant in Rolling Thunder 2017!
What a great show of support!
Candidate Donald Trump was at the event last year.
His speech to the crowd was a heartfelt call for more concern for our veterans and a vow to rebuild the military.Secretaryof State Rex W. Tillerson at Rolling Thunder 2017!!!!

The pick would put to rest weeks-long speculation of who would earn the post as the U.S. s top diplomat, and would place Tillerson fourth in line to the presidency.Tillerson is a surprising choice, particularly for establishment political forces who urged Trump to select Mitt Romney for the job.

Tillerson has spent his life in the private sector, working with Exxon-Mobil and has business relationships around the world.OUR FIRST BIKER SECRETARY OF STATE!TILLERSON COMES RIDING THROUGH THE SHOT AT THE 1:53 POINT:
