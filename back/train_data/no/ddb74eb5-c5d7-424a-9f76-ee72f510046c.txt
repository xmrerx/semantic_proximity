beijing ( reuters ) - denuclearization of the korean peninsula should be achieved through peaceful and diplomatic means , china s foreign ministry said on monday , as the united nations discusses fresh sanctions against north korea following its latest nuclear test .
at a regular news briefing , ministry spokesman geng shuang reiterated china s call for more steps by the u.n. security council , saying he hoped its members could reach consensus .
a u.s.-drafted resolution originally called for an oil embargo on the north , a halt to key textile exports and financial and travel bans on leader kim jong un , but appears to have been watered down , according to a draft seen by reuters .
north korea drew global condemnation for conducting its sixth nuclear test on sept 3 , which it said was of an advanced hydrogen bomb .
