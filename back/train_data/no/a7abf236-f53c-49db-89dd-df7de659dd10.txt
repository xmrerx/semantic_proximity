sydney ( reuters ) - australia s lawmakers have rejected legislation that would tighten citizenship and foreign worker visa rules , a blow to prime minister malcolm turnbull who had sought to stop a loss of his support base to far-right political parties .
in april , turnbull said australia would abolish a temporary work visa popular with foreigners and replace it with a new program requiring better english-language and job skills .
turnbull also announced plans to raise the bar for citizenship by lengthening the waiting period and adding a new australian values test .
but australia s senate , where turnbull s center-right government does not enjoy a majority , rejected the proposal in a late vote on wednesday , with opposition lawmakers insisting the rules were counter to australian multicultural values .
the senate rejection may further drag on support for turnbull , which , according to the widely watched newspoll poll on monday , languishes at its lowest level in more than two years .
the next election is not due until 2019 , but continued poor polling could undermine turnbull s leadership .
mathias cormann , australia s special minister of state , said on wednesday the government will seek to move the legislation through the senate again as soon as they have secured the necessary support .
we will keep working with all non-government senators to secure the necessary support , cormann told australian broadcasting corporation radio .
a spokeswoman for australian immigration minister peter dutton said visa applications would now be considered under the previous rules .
