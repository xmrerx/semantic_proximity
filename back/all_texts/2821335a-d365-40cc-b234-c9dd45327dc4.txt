Donald Trump is going to Mexico, the place where he thinks only some of the people are good but most are rapists and criminals.From the very beginning of his campaign, Trump has repeatedly insulted our southern neighbor, even going so far as to promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border and claiming that he will force Mexico to pay for it.After the Republican nominee descended down an escalator to his podium to officially announce his candidacy last summer, Trump said this about the Mexican people.
When Mexico sends its people, they re not sending their best, Trump claimed.
They re bringing drugs.
They re bringing crime.
They re rapists.
And some, I assume, are good people.
The statement drew outrage across the country and immediately alienated Hispanic voters.But now Trump s words are coming back to bite him in the ass.On Wednesday, Trump plans to visit Mexico and it gave director Rob Reiner the opportunity to hilariously turn Trump s words against him.
Clearly we re not sending our best to Mexico, Reiner wrote on Twitter.
We re sending liars.
We re sending narcissists.
We re sending sociopaths.
Clearly we re not sending our best to Mexico.
We re sending liars.
We re sending narcissists.
We re sending sociopaths.
Rob Reiner (@robreiner) August 31, 2016And this isn t the only time Reiner has slammed Donald Trump.During an appearance on Real Time with Bill Maher earlier this month, Reiner offered an explanation for why Trump is saying all of these offensive things.
It s easy to behave this way when you re mentally ill, Reiner said.
It s not like he s trying to lose.
He can t help himself.
Donald Trump is a racist who is incapable of keeping his mouth shut.
He insults people wherever he goes and if he somehow avoids an international incident while in Mexico it would be miraculous.But this is Donald Trump we are talking about so get ready for him to embarrass himself and America.Featured image via screenshot
