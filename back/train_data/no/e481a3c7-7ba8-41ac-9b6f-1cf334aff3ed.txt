the last accuser who could have been the nail in the coffin for bill o reilly spoke on the view about her sexual harassment lawsuit .
perquita burgess and her lawyer were on the view for their 15 minutes of fame .
attorney lisa bloom should know better than to send her client on to speak out about her allegations .
lisa bloom has a track record as a high profile lawyer for cases like this she should know better but it could be that she s trying to gain sympathy for her client.please listen to the video and let us know what you think about what she said and about sexual harassment in the workplace : o reilly settled with other women over sexual harassment but how do we know if any of them has any credibility ?
how does a man protect himself from such charges ? if this could be brought up on charges , then every high profile man out there needs a witness when he walks around anywhere.are the comments ( if true ) that this woman said bill o reilly made considered sexual harassment to you ?
what exactly is sexual harassment ?
if it s how you feel then men are in big trouble because of all of the offended women out there .
should the definition be broader or should it be more narrowly defined .
we feel with our litigious society , the cases for sexual harassment should be very closely scrutinized .
