President Obama has done something that no other President has ever done on national television, and it s going to drive every Conservative in the country nuts.
During an Alaska shoot with survivalist Bear Grylls to highlight climate change, the President painted his nails.In a gloriously un-macho moment, Bear Grylls offers the President some foraged nail paint, and suggests the President might wish to take advantage of the wonderful shade of fuchsia.
On camera and with zero homophobic mockery, the President applies the paint to his nails (quite deftly I might add) and sits back and enjoys his handiwork.The footage is an outtake from President Obama s shoot with British survivalist Bear Grylls for a special edition of Running Wild with Bear Grylls.
