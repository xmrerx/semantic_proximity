port-au-prince ( reuters ) - haitian authorities said on tuesday a former prime minister and top official have been banned from leaving the country as prosecutors lead a corruption probe in which 12 people , including government officials , have been arrested .
former prime minister jean-max bellerive , who served from 2009 to 2011 , and former justice minister camille edouard jr. , who served in 2016 , can not travel abroad while an investigation proceeds into corruption-related charges , haiti s prosecutor clame-ocnam dameus said .
bellerive , who was premier during a catastrophic earthquake , was ordered to remain within haiti by a judge who is investigating the 2009 disappearance of a public procurement official and the 2012 death of a construction manager allegedly connected to the case .
bellerive denied any connection to either incident , or to other acts of corruption .
i believe all this is part of a political lynching , he told reuters .
no one can show me where i ve enriched myself or acquired unjustified properties .
corruption has plagued haiti for generations and president jovenel moise has pledged to fight it as a way to improve the impoverished caribbean country s social and economic development .
dameus said edouard could potentially face charges of money laundering as well as misappropriation of public funds and properties .
edouard did not respond to a request for comment .
the dozen others arrested between november and december , a group comprised mostly of government officials , face corruption charges that include the misappropriation of public funds , dameus said .
