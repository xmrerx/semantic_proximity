One of the great mysteries of the universe is trying to figure out what makes people who otherwise may seem rational like and support Donald Trump for president.
Appearing on Fox News, actor Scott Baio let us in on why he supports the real estate mogul, and why others should as well.
Although, he seems to just be emerging from the set of a 1940s mob themed movie.When asked why he likes Trump, Baio said: What do I like about Trump?
There s no BS.
I understand him when he talks.
Whomever the Democrat nominee is, he s gonna beat the crap out of em.
Which is what we need.
Instead of the crap beat out of us, and I like his policy proposals.
What policy proposals?
He s been all over the map on pretty much everything, except for his hatred of Muslims and that damn border wall.After being asked why people want Trump, he said: Well I think the thing is that Trump is not a typical Republican.
He s sort of, you can t put a label on the guy, which I love.
And because the media has stigmatized the Republican brand, he s smart to not cozy up to these guys, and he s unique.
He s refreshing.
He s exciting.
I love to hear him talk, and I m excited about the guy.
First of all, refreshing, really?
Secondly, the media has not stigmatized the Republican brand, they did that to themselves by hating every minority group, the LGBT community, women s rights, and the poor.
Blaming the media for reporting what they do is like blaming the guy who called 911 on the fire you set.
Nah, it doesn t work that way.Baio clearly likes Trump, but also clearly doesn t understand anything of which he speaks.Check out the interview here:.
