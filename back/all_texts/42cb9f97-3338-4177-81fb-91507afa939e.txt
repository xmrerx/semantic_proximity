Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz was on MSNBC to make a statement on the 9th Circuit Opinion: He stated that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling against President Trump s immigration order is not a solid decision.
And looks like it s based more on policy than on constitutionality.
Look, this is not a solid decision.
This is a decision that looks like it s based more on policy than on constitutionality.
There are many, many flaws.
He added, I think this court opinion will not ultimately be sustained by the Supreme Court.
Take, for example, the argument that it s an establishment of religion, because it favors Christians or other religious minorities.
In 1944 we passed the War Refugee Act, which specifically was designed to rescue a hundred thousand Jews, and everybody knew the purpose was to rescue jews.
That didn t establish Judaism as the state religion of the United States.
I think the establishment argument will fail in the Supreme Court.
I think the standing arguments may fail in the Supreme Court.
