Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz dropped a big bomb during an interview on CNN today.
She claimed that Jeh Johnson s testimony about the DNC computer hack is wrong in every respect and utterly misinformed.
Whoa!
Who s telling the truth?Schultz told the CNN anchor He s wrong in every respect.
Let me be very clear.
At no point during my tenure at the DNC was I contacted by the FBI, DHS, or any government agency, or alerted or made aware that they believed that the Russians, an enemy state, was intruding on our network.
In case you missed it, former DHS Director Jeh Johnson testified to lawmakers this week that the DNC rejected his agency s offer to protect its network despite receiving warnings about a computer hack.
Instead, the DNC chose an outside cyber security firm to help solve the computer hacks that led to WikiLeaks publishing thousands of its emails.CNN s Bolduan asked Schultz how both accounts could be true: Secretary Johnson says DNC rebuffed the help offered.
You are saying no one contacted you?
Schultz replied with a shocking statement: Secretary Johnson is utterly misinformed.
That is simply not accurate.
Schultz went further and blamed the FBI for not helping: They left the Russians on our network for more than for almost a year before we discovered that they were there.
