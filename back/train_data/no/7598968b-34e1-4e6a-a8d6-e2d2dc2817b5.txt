washington - u.s. president barack obama on saturday laid out a plan to help support the income of workers who lose their jobs and end up in lower paying positions , as part of a push to get unemployed americans back to work .
the proposal would offer experienced workers who now make less than $ 50,000 a form of wage insurance , allowing them to replace half of their lost pay .
the benefit would cover up to $ 10,000 over two years .
“ it ’ s a way to give families some stability and encourage folks to rejoin the workforce - because we shouldn ’ t just be talking about unemployment ; we should be talking about re-employment , ” obama said in his weekly radio and internet address , broadcast on saturday .
the wage insurance proposal will be included in a broader effort to overhaul the unemployment insurance system .
details about the program ’ s proposed funding will be further outlined in obama ’ s budget for fiscal year 2017 expected to be released next month .
obama promised in his state of the union earlier this week to advocate for legislative action on issues with bipartisan support during his last year in office .
during the address , he pointed to wage insurance as one measure where lawmakers may be able to work together .
the white house plan would require states to provide insurance for workers laid off from jobs they had held for at least three years .
the plan would be federally-funded , but it would be administered through state unemployment insurance programs .
other measures proposed by the white house on saturday included a requirement that all states provide at least 26 weeks of unemployment insurance benefits , and the creation of a permanent program that would automatically provide up to 52 additional weeks of federally-funded benefits for states experiencing rapid job-losses or high unemployment .
