shanghai ( reuters ) - a local court in the eastern chinese city of wenzhou is using social media to shame people into repaying their debts , the china daily reported on tuesday .
citizens who ignore court repayment orders have been subjected to targeted advertisements on the popular chinese social media app wechat , notifying their contacts about the amount of money they owe , the paper said .
it said the court in wenzhou s ouhai district had released the names and photos of 20 local defaulters owing a total of 10.7 million yuan ( $ 1.61 million ) .
though china has sought to make more credit available to individuals in a bid to develop a consumer economy , officials have expressed concern about surging levels of household debt , which is estimated to have doubled in less than a decade to reach around 50 percent of gross domestic product .
china s outstanding household consumer loans surged nearly 30 percent by the end of september from a year earlier , and the country s central bank governor recently issued a strong warning about the risks of rapidly rising debt .
with no reliable nationwide credit rating system , authorities across the country are looking for ways to crack down on people who fail to repay .
