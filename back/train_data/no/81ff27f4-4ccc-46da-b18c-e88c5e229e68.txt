it s not a big surprise given her propensity for lying , but when hillary knew she was getting destroyed by trump on her ineffective , embarrassing record as secretary of state , she lied about not being obama s secretary of state during his ridiculous red line comment during sunday night s presidential debate , democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton denied that she was in office as secretary of state when president barack obama refused to punish syrian dictator bashar al-assad for using chemical weapons against civilians after calling chemical weapons use a red line which could not be crossed .
they had a chance to do something with syria , and that was the line , republican nominee donald trump said of his democratic rival and the administration in which she worked .
you were there as secretary of state with the so-called line in the sand .
no , i wasn t , i was gone , clinton replied.president obama delivered his famous red line speech in which he described the use of chemical weapons against civilians by assad as a red line that assad could not cross without suffering serious international consequences in august 2012 .
we have been very clear to the assad regime , but also to other players on the ground , that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized .
that would change my calculus , president obama said at the time.hillary clinton served president obama as secretary of state from january 21 , 2009 to february 1 , 2013 , according to the state department .
she was not in office when assad used chemical weapons yet again in 2015 , violating international law .
the white house did not respond to assad with any direct military retaliation .
