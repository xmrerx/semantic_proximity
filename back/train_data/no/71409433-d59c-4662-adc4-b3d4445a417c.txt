london ( reuters ) - bones , a moldy hot water bottle , a pair of rusty pliers and a pristine pair of women s pants are among the eclectic cast-offs reuters photographer stefan wermuth has found along the river thames .
wermuth spent two months collecting items along the riverside to give a snapshot of the litter that finds its way into the waterway that runs through the heart of london .

today , marine life including seals , porpoises and dolphins have been spotted swimming alongside fish and a hard drive that wermuth found littering the murky waters .
pollution remains a problem .
in march , thames water was handed a record 20 million pound ( $ 26 million ) fine for pumping sewage into the river .
the water company apologized for its failings and said it was working to improve rivers .
london municipal authorities say 4,000 plastic bottles were removed from the river over a one-month period alone last year , demonstrating the scale of the waste problem .
the impact of pollution on marine life in the thames has in recent years prompted campaigns to encourage londoners to make sure their rubbish goes in the bin - rather than the water .
