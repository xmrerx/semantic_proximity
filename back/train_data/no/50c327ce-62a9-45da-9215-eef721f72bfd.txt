are they kidding ?
this was even a lead story on fox news tonight !
a former trump adviser made a very general comment against hillary clinton and the secret service jumped all over him .
you will not believe what he said !
he stated that , hillary clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason does that sound like a credible threat to you ?
no , that s total bs !
the things that have been said against trump are unbelievable and yet nothing happens to those who threaten violence that s much more specific than mr. baldasaro s statement .
might we also mention farrakhan who s constantly spewing hate speech and violent threats .
the secret service is investigating a donald trump adviser who said in a radio interview that presumptive democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton should be shot for treason on a firing line .
al baldasaro , a new hampshire representative who serves on trump s veterans coalition and as a trump delegate at the republican national convention in cleveland , said in an interview with a boston talk radio host that clinton should pay for the 2012 benghazi attack .
she is a disgrace for any , the lies she told those mothers about their children that got killed over there in benghazi , he said on the jeff kuhner show tuesday .
she dropped the ball on over 400 emails requesting back up security .
something s wrong there .
