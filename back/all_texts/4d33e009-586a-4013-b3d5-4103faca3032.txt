PRAGUE (Reuters) - The Czech parliament s lower house voted on Wednesday to allow police to bring charges against Andrej Babis, the leading candidate to become prime minister after an election next month, in a case involving suspected abuse of European Union subsidies.
Babis, a billionaire businessman and founder of the ANO movement, denies any wrongdoing.
He has repeatedly called the police actions against him a political ploy meant to hurt him in the Oct. 20-21 election.
