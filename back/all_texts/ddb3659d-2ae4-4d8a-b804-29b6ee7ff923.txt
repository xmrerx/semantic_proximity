Donald Trump is very upset at the judge overseeing the ongoing lawsuit in which the allegation is being made that his Trump University was nothing more than a sophisticated scam designed to separate regular Americans from their hard earned money.
Despite the Republican nominee s attempts to detract attention away from the case, new revelations keep coming out that show the reality TV star s involvement in unsavory business practices.So Trump has been lashing out at the judge, and in explicitly racist terms.
Trump went there once again in an interview with the Wall Street Journal.Donald Trump is claiming that a judge with Mexican heritage who is overseeing a lawsuit against Trump University has an inherent conflict of interest given the presumptive GOP nominee s rhetoric on immigration.
[ ] I m building a wall.
It s an inherent conflict of interest, Trump told the Journal.So what Trump is saying is that since he is building a wall between the United States and Mexico, he can t be subject to judicial oversight from an American citizen with Mexican heritage.CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin accurately debunked the insanity of Trump s allegation, noting that: The ethnicity of the judge is not in it of itself a grounds for recusal, ever.
And that is a claim that Trump under the First Amendment is certainly allowed to make, but it is completely wrong under the law.
Trump is angry because the documents exposed by the Trump University suit (and ongoing fraud case from the New York state attorney general) show that Trump University sales people were told to target vulnerable customers in order to pressure them to buy expensive and worthless real estate training.
Trump University documents said that struggling parents should be targeted, as should people who clearly could not afford the training who were pressured to increase their lines of credit using high pressure boiler room tactics.In response to the Trump University revelations, Hillary Clinton called Trump a fraud, and now he continues to lash out in a highly racist way, which has been the cornerstone of his presidential campaign.Featured image via YouTube
