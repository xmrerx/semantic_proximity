Barbara Res on her former boss, Donald Trump: "He has to be stopped" #inners https://t.co/gLOKoF3NzK All In w/Chris Hayes (@allinwithchris) May 19, 2016Res, who oversaw the construction of Trump Tower and now supports Hillary Clinton, explained to Hayes that Trump will put our country back thirty years and will be bad for our country.
She added, I don t think he has the experience to be president, or the political knowledge to be president.
Res also said Trump s policies are very backward, very anti-woman, very anti-woman and very anti-progress.
She served as an executive vice-president with the Trump Organization from 1984-1991, and wrote a book a few years ago about her experiences, All Alone on the 68th Floor: How One Woman Changed the Face of Construction.She also recently spoke to the New York Times about the danger she sees in Trump s candidacy.
I couldn t imagine him ever doing a job where he would be beholden not to one person but 300 million, Barbara Res said in an interview with The New York Times.
I think he thinks he s going to be king.
Res, who supports Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, said Trump seems to think he can just decree things that a president can t, noting there are three branches of government that work together.
I don t see him getting away with all these things that he says he s going to do, she said.Over his campaign, Trump has promised to do several different projects that would need Congressional support and spending to execute like building a wall on the southern border or banning Muslim travel to the United States, but has never bothered to explain how he would practically get them done, or even explain if they would be legal.
During the Republican primary, those promises weren t a problem for Trump, but the general election is unlikely to be as forgiving.Featured image via Twitter
