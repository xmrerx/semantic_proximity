TUNIS (Reuters) - Tunisia s powerful labor union UGTT said U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital and decision to move the U.S. embassy to the city was a declaration of war, a statement said on Wednesday.
We call...for mass protests, the labor union said in a statement.
Tunisia s foreign ministry said in a separate statement Trump s move seriously threatens to undermine the foundations of the (Israeli-Palestinian) peace process.
