new delhi ( reuters ) - an indian court on thursday overturned the conviction of a dentist couple for the murder of their teenage daughter and the family servant for lack of material evidence , their lawyer said .
aarushi talwar was found with her throat slit at the family home in the delhi suburb of noida in 2008 .
a day later , the body of the servant , hemraj , was found on the roof of the house .
a trial court convicted the girl s parents , rajesh and nupur talwar , after police alleged rajesh had murdered his daughter and the servant in a rage when he found them in a compromising situation .
the couple , both dentists , were jailed for life .
but a high court overruled the decision saying it was not satisfied with the evidence and ordered the couple be freed , their lawyer tanveer ahmed mir said .
the court found no forensic or material evidence to prove that the talwars had killed their daughter , mir told reporters outside a packed courtroom in the northern city of allahabad .
both parents had denied the murder and insisted they were victims of botched investigations and unfair media coverage , damaging their defense .
aarushi s case was labeled as a kind of crime more often associated with rural , conservative parts of india where honor killings are not uncommon .
every twist in the investigation was extensively reported by the indian press , turning the talwars into household names .
finally my family can lead a dignified life .
the court has upheld the facts and truth , said rajesh talwar s sister , vandana , after the decision .
in 2015 , a journalist who covered the murder wrote a book arguing that the couple were innocent .
the double murder case and faulty probe were used as a theme for a bollywood movie the same year .
