tucker carlson interviews jose antonio vargas , ceo of define america he gave vargas a reality check ! vargas takes offense to the way carlson is framing this ?
it s difficult for this illegal to face reality.he says , i was an undocumented immigrant in this country yet he doesn t think he s illegal.vargas : my protest yesterday was as an undocumented immigrant , one of 11 million who are viewed as criminals , let s pause here for a moment .
.
.
that is one illegal immigrant too many and you are criminals .
.
.
now we ll continue , my own way of protesting was just actually very quietly and respectfully thinking about what it means to be an immigrant in the trump era , right ?
so that , that , that was my way , he stutters on smugly.tucker replied , okay , well thank you for not breaking anything .
.
.
i m not accusing you of setting fires , i m merely saying : where are people who agree with these folks standing up and saying you re not allowed to do this , you can t block traffic , you can t break things , you can t set fires , it pretty simple .
vargas replies , this issue is not just quote-un-quote political , it s personal we re talking about millions of people who are related to undocumented people that you call criminal illegals everyday , right ?
tucker aptly jumps in and asks of vargas , what should i call people who are here illegally ?
should i pretend they re not here illegally ?
vargas , in a flustered state , tries to belittle tucker , you ask me to come on your show , pretty much once a week , and i come here as an undocumented person .
.
.
tucker interrupts vargas : you may be overstating it a little bit , i think this is the third time but here s the point , tucker begins before vargas cuts him off , here s the point , i am here illegally .
.
.
but i , as a person , am not illegal .
tucker jumps in with a perfect line , but i robbed a liquor store yesterday , which is illegal , but i m not illegal .
.
.
i don t even know what the point you re making is , i m not saying you re a bad person , i m saying your status is in violation of the law .
the way your framing it carlson then says , actually i was just playing video from yesterday truth !
spare me the nonsense !
