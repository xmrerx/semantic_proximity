Manufactured protests Hillary, George Soros, Barack and radical union style Yawn Does Trump talking about bringing jobs back to Detroit really scare these protesters so bad that they feel compelled to pick up manufactured signs and pre-printed t-shirts to protest him?

The people in the video wearing #NO Trump Detroit t-shirts were likely issued these shirts when they agreed to be paid protesters.It s not uncommon for Democrats to bus people in from other states to protest when they can t find enough interest in their own backyards.
The printed t-shirts are usually a good way to track the paid protesters to make sure they re doing what is expected of them:They're chanting, "No Trump.
"BUT what they mean is: "This $15/hr protest gig is the ONLY JOB available in Detroit.
