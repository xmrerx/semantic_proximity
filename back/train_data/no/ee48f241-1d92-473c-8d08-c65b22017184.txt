ankara ( reuters ) - iran has banned the transportation of refined crude oil products by iranian companies to and from iraq s kurdistan region , the semi-official tasnim news agency said on friday , after tehran vowed to stand by baghdad following the region s vote for independence .
a directive by the road and transportation organization has temporarily banned carrying oil products from iran to iraq s kurdistan region and vice versa following the latest developments in that region , tasnim reported .
iraq s kurds overwhelmingly backed a call for independence in a referendum on monday , defying neighboring countries which fear the vote could lead to renewed conflict in the region .
a ban on international flights into iraq s kurdish region was being imposed on friday after the baghdad government retaliated against the vote .
almost all foreign airlines suspended flights to erbil and sulaimaniya , obeying a notice from the government in baghdad , which controls iraqi air space .
iran , which has its own kurdish minority , had already halted flights to and from kurdish regions on sunday .
