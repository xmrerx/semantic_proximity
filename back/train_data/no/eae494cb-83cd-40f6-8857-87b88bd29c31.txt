one can only imagine what kind of relationship hillary has with her very close top aide s soon to be ex-husband fox news sunday reported this morning that anthony weiner is cooperating with the fbi , which has re-opened ( yes , lefties : re-opened ) the investigation into hillary clinton s classified emails .
watch as chris wallace reports the breaking news during the panel segment near the end of the show : https : //youtu.be/x13hbws9q2cand the news is breaking while we re on the air .
our colleague bret baier has just sent us an e-mail saying he has two sources who say that anthony weiner , who also had co-ownership of that laptop with his estranged wife huma abedin , is cooperating with the fbi investigation , had given them the laptop , so therefore they didn t need a warrant to get in to see the contents of said laptop .
pretty interesting development .
targets of federal investigations will often cooperate , hoping that they will get consideration from a judge at sentencing .
given weiner s well-known penchant for lying , it s hard to believe that a prosecutor would give weiner a deal based on an agreement to testify , unless his testimony were very strongly corroborated by hard evidence .
but cooperation can take many forms and , as wallace indicated on this morning s show , one of those forms could be signing a consent form to allow investigators to review the contents of devices that they could probably get a warrant for anyway .
we ll see if weiner s cooperation extends beyond that.via : red state
