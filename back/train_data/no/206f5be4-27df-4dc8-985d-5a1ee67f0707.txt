dhaka ( reuters ) - two journalists from myanmar , who had been detained in bangladesh while reporting on the influx of thousands of rohingya muslims , have been released on bail , a police official said on saturday .
the journalists , minzayar oo and hkun lat , were detained in early september in the cox s bazar border region of bangladesh , where refugees are arriving from myanmar to escape a military offensive against insurgents .
a court granted them bail , but they can t go back to their country now , police official ranajit kumar barua , told reuters by telephone , adding that the court would decide whether the two could leave the country at a separate hearing which may take place sometime in the next week .
the two were arrested for violating immigration laws , but no charge sheet against the two has been filed yet , said barua , denying reports that the two had been charged with espionage activities .
a lawyer for the two journalists also confirmed their release , but did not provide any further detail .
bangladesh police had said that the pair were detained for engaging in journalistic work for a german magazine , while on tourist visas .
some 429,000 refugees from myanmar have poured into bangladesh since aug. 25 , when attacks by rohingya militants on security posts triggered a myanmar army crackdown in response .
germany s geo magazine , which had assigned minzayar oo to cover the rohingya crisis , said he had traveled to bangladesh on sept. 6 , and was detained the next day .
minzayar oo is one of myanmar s most prominent photographers and has worked for various media outlets , covering the country s emergence from military rule .
he has previously worked as a contractor with reuters .
hkun lat is also a well-known photographer in myanmar and has won prizes for his coverage of conflict in frontier regions .
