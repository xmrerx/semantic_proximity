Donald Trump kicked off his week with a ridiculous attack on former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates.Yates, of course, was fired after she refused to back Trump s first Muslim ban in court.
It was, of course, later deemed unconstitutional and the administration suffered a fair amount of embarrassment from Trump s decision to fire Yates.
Yates also warned The Donald about Michael Flynn, who was later fired by the administration for allegedly lying to Vice President Mike Pence about his specious contacts with Russia.
Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H.
Council, Trump tweeted Monday morning.Ask Sally Yates, under oath, if she knows how classified information got into the newspapers soon after she explained it to W.H.
Council.

Trump, of course, should have said counsel, but our current POTUS isn t exactly the brightest bulb in the bunch of mixed metaphors.
