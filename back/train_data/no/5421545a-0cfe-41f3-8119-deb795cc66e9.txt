thanks to alternative news sources , dicaprio has been outed more than once for his extravagant energy- wasting lifestyle .
the lifestyles of climate change advocates like dicaprio and al gore are being questioned every day by reasonable people who want to know why these self-appointed climate change czars are asking everyday citizens to adjust the way they live , while these hypocrites continue to travel by jet or on board massive private yachts with absolutely no reasonable explanation.it looks like dicaprio is sick and tired of being called a hypocrite and has traded in the private jets in favor of doing the unimaginable traveling with the common man on a commercial flight.leo dicaprio is currently shoring up environmentally friendly plans for his foundation s annual gala and auction in st-tropez , sources tell us.we hear that the star is ditching any private jets and will fly commercial to the glitzy french f te on wednesday .
