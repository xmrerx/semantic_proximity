Joni Ernst may portray herself as tough in her campaign ads, but in real life she s about as yellow as the bedsheets of a certain Russian hotel after a Trump visit.
Ernst had planned a small veterans roundtable in Maquoketa City Hall in her home state of Iowa, but she found herself met by a packed room with more crammed into the hallways of the building.Ernst slinked in a side door to avoid protesters and called almost exclusively on veterans, but one of them asked her a question that made her turn tail and run: All we hear is repeal and replace, but we don t hear about a real clear plan, other than talking about health savings accounts, which really amounts to your own money, quite frankly.
And he s right.
A Health savings account doesn t quite make sense if you don t have the money to pay into it, or if you suffer chronic conditions, or if you encounter even a moderately expensive health need.
Nevertheless, Ernst went through her preplanned talking points as the audience jeered, booed, and mocked her especially when she got to the part about HSAs being awesome.#Ernst is put on the spot on Obamacare by an enrollee.
Her answer: Cite a couple provisions and tout HSAs.
The audience jeered throughout.
