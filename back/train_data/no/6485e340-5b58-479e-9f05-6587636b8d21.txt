maybe comedy is a better career choice for gary gary johnson , the libertarian nominee for president , had been raring for wednesday night s town hall on msnbc .
he had been cut from the first televised debate after missing the polling threshold , and he had not been invited when the network hosted a commander-in-chief forum with hillary clinton and donald trump .
this was their consolation prize , johnson told the washington post this week when asked about the msnbc special .
it was put to us that , look , you weren t in this initial program .
here s what we d like to offer in lieu of being with the two major-party candidates .
and i said , an hour of prime time chris matthews ?
i ll take it .
but the hour didn t go as planned .
johnson , who had been pilloried for blanking on the relevance of the syrian city of aleppo in another msnbc interview , whiffed his way through an even easier foreign policy question .
who s your favorite foreign leader ?
matthews asked .
who s my favorite ?
johnson replied .

matthews said .
