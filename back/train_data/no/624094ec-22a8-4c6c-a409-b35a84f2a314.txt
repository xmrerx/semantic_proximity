wouldn t it be great to have a president who made our national security a top priority ?
the obama administration will agree to let iran bypass questions about its past nuclear military work under any final deal signed in the coming weeks , according to reports.western officials were quoted as telling the associated press on friday that the united states has given up a major concession to iran on the military front.while senior u.s. officials , including secretary of state john kerry , have long insisted that iran will immediately have to submit to wide-ranging inspections and disclosures regarding its past nuclear work , the new reports indicate that this demand has been cast aside as world powers work to strike a final deal with the islamic republic by the end of june.according to the ap report : after a november 2013 interim accord , the obama administration said a comprehensive solution would include resolution of questions concerning the possible military dimension of iran s nuclear program .
but those questions won t be answered by the june 30 deadline for a final deal , officials said , echoing an assessment by the u.n. nuclear agency s top official earlier this week .
nevertheless , the officials said an accord remains possible .
one senior western official on thursday described diplomats as more likely to get a deal than not over the next three weeks.via : wfb
