If there s one quality Republican voters are looking for in a candidate, it s being a Christian.
You don t have to know much about foreign policy, or domestic issues, or for that matter, the Constitution, but if you say you re a Christian, well, that s your golden ticket into the hearts of GOP voters everywhere.
Knowing this fact, for the past several months Republican frontrunner Donald Trump has been telling people far and wide about how much he s a Christian, how much he loves the Bible, and even that it s his favorite book.
Unfortunately for Trump, his blatant maneuvering to try to convince people that he s a great Christian who follows the Bible is all crumbling down.
This was incredibly evident at a campaign event at Liberty University in Lynchburg, Virginia Monday morning.In front of a large crowd of people who actually do know their Bible verses, Trump says: We re going to protect Christianity.
I can say that.
I don t have to be politically correct Two Corinthians, 3:17, that s the whole ballgame.
He then goes on to call Liberty University Liberty College and it s clear that he s reading something someone prepared for him to say.
Because anyone who s ever gone to church at one point or another in their lives knows that the book of the Bible Trump is referring to is Second Corinthians, not Two Corinthians.
However, if you re reading it off a piece of paper and you re just trying to pander to your crowd, but don t really know what you re talking about, it s going to read Two Corinthians.
The verse he s referring to is Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom, which does indeed sound like the perfect Republican slogan to try to pander to freedom loving Christians everywhere.
However, too bad Trump doesn t actually know what he s talking about.And as fellow candidate Marco Rubio s faith outreach director said, so honestly:"Two" Corinthians It won't matter.
Nothing seems to matter.
