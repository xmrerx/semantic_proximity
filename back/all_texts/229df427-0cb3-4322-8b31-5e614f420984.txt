Texas parents looking to adopt may soon be banned by private and state-funded agencies that object to people who are Muslim, Jewish, single, gay, or interfaith couples, under a proposal from the Republican-controlled legislature, according to a report by the Associated Press.Similar laws have been passed in five states allowing adoption organizations the ability to refuse gay parents or members of certain religions the right to adopt.
The difference is the Texas rule extends the allowable discrimination to state-funded agencies.Republicans say the bill is designed to support foster care provider and adoption agency religious freedom, many which receive funding from the state.Opponents of the proposal are vocal about it robbing children of stable families and using taxpayer dollars to discriminate against hopeful parents.
This would allow adopting agencies to turn away qualified, loving parents who are perhaps perfect in every way because the agency has a difference in religious belief.
It goes against the best interest of the child.
said the Human Rights Campaign senior legislative counsel, Catherine Oakley.
The bill also blatantly violates the Constitution.
As a governmental entity, Texas is bound to treat people equally under the law, states Oakley.
This is a violation of equal protection under the law.
An Austin-based attorney Suzanne Bryant who works with LGBTQ clients explains that in addition to using religious freedom to turn away parents looking to adopt, it could also force foster children to comply with these discriminatory requirements.Unfortunately, this could mean welfare organizations have the ability to send LGBTQ children to conversion therapy, which the American Health Organization considers a serious threat to the health and well-being of affected people.
They could also prevent access to contraception and abortions for young people in the system.This is sad news for hopeful adoptive parents and children in Texas, and a blatant violation of the constitution.Featured image by Joe Raedle/Getty Images
