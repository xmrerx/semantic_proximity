trump is going to win in a landslide , but wouldn t it be a delicious irony to see a male bernie supporter have the power to keep her from assuming a role she stole from his guy several months ago it s the electoral college that determines the president , not the popular vote .
and the electoral college is made up of electors.usually , the electoral college is a formality .
electors vote for whomever won their state.this year , there s a hiccup .
a democrat elector in washington state says he won t vote for hillary.washington state is almost certainly going for hillary.if this man won t vote for hillary , he could keep her from getting the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency.here s what he said : robert satiacum is a bernie fan .
he thinks the democrat primary was rigged .
he thinks hillary cheated .
so he won t vote for her.watch satiacum letting everyone know he s not joking around : the seattle times reported : no , no , no on hillary .
absolutely not .
no way , said robert satiacum , a member of washington s puyallup tribe who had supported vermont sen. bernie sanders as the democratic presidential nominee .
he had earlier told various media outlets he was wrestling with whether his conscience would allow him to support clinton and was considering stepping aside for an alternate elector .
but on friday , he sounded firm , even if the election is close .
i hope it comes down to a swing vote and it s me , he said .
good .
she ain t getting it .
maybe it ll wake this country up .
and the seattle times says there s another elector in washington state who might do the same thing : bret chiafalo , a democratic elector from everett who is also a sanders supporter , said he is considering exercising his right to be a conscientious elector and vote for the person he believes would be the best president .
i have no specific plans , but i have not ruled out that possibility , he said .
