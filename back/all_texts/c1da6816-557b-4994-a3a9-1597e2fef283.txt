We may not agree with MOST of what rapper Azalea Banks has to say, but she is a fierce defender of free speech and as such, has come out with a flurry of in-your-face tweets to the black, typically Democrat voters, announcing her supporting Donald Trump.
Donald Trump can add another member of Hollywood to his list of supporters.Azalea Banks offered her support for Donald Trump in a series of tweets that started out with, I REALLY want Donald Trump to win the election.
She went on to say Trump just wants the U.S. to be lavish for all of us.
Her tweet seems to suggest that Trump wants everyone to have the opportunity to prosper in America.
She followed it up by saying, Hillary talks to black people as if we re children or pets.
i can t stand herrrrr.
When her followers called her out, suggesting Trump was a racist and symbol of hatred, Banks replied:Banks defends her right to her opinion against angry Twitter followers over her endorsement of Trump: It wasn t that long ago Azealia Banks called for the gang rape of Sarah Palin.
We re not so sure her endorsement is one that Donald Trump will embrace.
