During a campaign rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado on Friday, Donald Trump delivered a bizarre theory about the local fire marshal.
Trump was very upset that the fire marshal prevented thousands of people who had come to see him speak from entering the venue, which would have created a huge fire hazard that would have put thousands of his supporters lives in danger.Trump told the audience that these are the types of regulations that are the reason Our country doesn t work.
So I have to tell you this.
This is why our country doesn t work.
We have plenty of space here.
We have thousands of people outside trying to get in.
And we have a fire marshal that said, Oh we can t allow more people.
Trump then went on to blast the fire marshal and the fire department claiming that they don t know how to do their jobs.
The jobs that they are trained to do in order to keep people safe.
As if that wasn t bad enough, Trump then offers the only reason his brain can come up with as to why the fire marshal might be enforcing regulations that were created probably long before his clown show rolled into town.
The reason they won t let them in is because they don t know what the hell they re doing, Trump said.
That s why, okay?
Too bad.
That s why our country has hey, maybe they re a Hillary person.
Could that be possible?
Probably.
I don t think there are too many of them.
I don t think there are too many of them.
This is the kind of thing we have in federal government also, by the way, folks.
Then you wonder why we re going to hell, Trump said, continuing his rant.
That s why we re going to hell.
You know what it is?
It s a thought process, right.
