pc is killing our country .
this is called fighting back while counterculture crackpots are working themselves into a lather over the prospect that , in some places , men who think that they re women can go tinkle in the same restroom where a 6-year-old girl is pulling down her panties , one state legislator has decided that it might be time to push back.indiana state sen. jim tomes , who probably accepts basic biology and believes that people born with a penis are male , proposed a bill that would make it a class a misdemeanor for trannies to use a bathroom that doesn t correspond to their birth gender.last week , tomes uttered the following line that s sure to ignite tempers among the social justice mob : if you were born a man , then you are obliged to use the males restroom .
what s next ?
a hereditary monarchy ? anyone convicted of a class a misdemeanor could face a year in prison and as much as a $ 5,000 fine.it should be noted , though , that the language in the legislation makes exceptions for janitors , first aid providers , and parents accompanying children under the age of 8.the bill does , however , cover schools .
so if it passes and little boy twinkletoes decides that he needs to use the girls locker room after gym class , then he s facing charges.indiana saw some action in the culture war last year when the state passed a religious freedom law .
that law was widely opposed by american liberals , who hate religious freedom.via : downtrend
