Although I disagree with Bill Maher that Donald Trump is not a clown, a conman, or a Klansman, I do think he has a point when he describes Trump as a five-year-old child.
Maher said: What Donald Trump really reminds me of is a spoiled five-year-old throwing a tantrum.
He is the grown-up version of every pain-in-the-ass kid who ever sat behind you on a plane kicking the back of your seat.
While the parents did nothing Little Logan is just exploring.
No, Little Logan is being a d*ck and if you won t shove him in the overhead bin, I will.
Here s the video: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xSSExfcD2cM] There s no doubt that Trump reminds you of such a d*ick and it seems that his voters are his enablers, tolerating condoning, and even applauding many of his crazy antics.
Trump s rise, Maher argued, was not fueled by racism or xenophobia, but by what he called the self-esteem movement.
As proof, Maher played a montage of clips showing Trump saying how he s the best at many things.
He said: Like they say on reality shows, the most important thing is just You doing you.
But what if you is a big a*shole?
Maher said the real reason Trump wants to be president is not to help America but so he can be called president.
Whatever the cause may be to his rise, it s important that the American people say no to this clown come November.
