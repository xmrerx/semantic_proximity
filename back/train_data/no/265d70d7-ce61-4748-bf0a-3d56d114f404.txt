port-au-prince ( reuters ) - protesters in haiti damaged commercial buildings in the capital city and set cars on fire on tuesday , angered by government tax hikes that come at a time when foreign aid is declining .
the port-au-prince protest , called by former presidential candidate jean-charles moise , took many by surprise and represents the biggest outcry against the administration of president jovenel moise since he took office earlier this year .
the revolution has just started .
jovenel moise will have to retract his taxes or he will have to leave immediately , said jacques menard , a 31-year-old protester .
and this is a warning because the next phase can be very violent .
protesters took to the streets in separate groups in several districts in the metropolitan area of port-au-prince , erecting flaming barricades , blocking traffic , and confronting riot police , who fired tear gas and warning shots in the air .
several people were arrested , the police said , but there were no reports of any deaths or serious injuries .
lawmakers last weekend approved an unpopular budget that raises taxes on products including cigarettes , alcohol and passports .
at the same time , foreign aid to haiti is slowing .
the country is one of the poorest in the americas and suffered a devastating earthquake in 2010 and the worst of hurricane matthew last year .
if jovenel moise is intelligent , he should refrain from publishing the budget , otherwise he will have to face a series of street demonstrations that will further complicate the situation , jean-charles moise said on local radio .
government officials were not immediately available for comment , but economy and finance minister jude alix patrick salomon defended the budget over the weekend .
there are people who are blaming many things on the budget that are not true , salomon told reporters shortly after the spending plan was approved .
there are people manipulating the public opinion .
