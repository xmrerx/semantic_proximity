Bernie Sanders had an amazingly touching moment at the 2016 Democratic Convention that brought the usually stoic Vermont senator to tears.
During the roll call of the states to cast their official delegate votes for the presidential nomination, the usual procedure was disrupted when the Democrats Abroad delegation was up for a vote.Bernie Sanders brother, Larry, was part of the Democrats Abroad group, which is comprised of voters who live overseas.
The delegation held back one of their votes after making their official submissions for Clinton and Sanders.Larry Sanders was designated as the person who would deliver the final vote, and he launched into a speech about the parents of the Sanders brothers.
I want to read for this convention the names of our parents, Eli Sanders, and Dorothy Glassberg Sanders.
They did not have easy lives, and they died young.
They would be immensely proud of their son and his accomplishments.
They loved him.
They loved the New Deal of Franklin Roosevelt and would be especially proud that Bernard is renewing that vision.
It is with enormous pride that I cast my vote for Bernie Sanders!
The tearful statement was greeted with loud cheers and applause from convention goers.
Sanders was later featured as Vermont made the last vote in the roll call, as he called for a vote by acclamation to declare Hillary Clinton the nominee.
The motion was accepted, and Clinton became the first woman in American history to be a presidential nominee of one of the two major parties.Larry is Sanders older brother and has lived in Oxford, England since the 1960s.
He is active in UK politics and has served as a spokesperson for the Green Party of England and Wales.
He ran for a seat in the 2015 British election, but came in fifth.Featured image via YouTube
