vienna ( reuters ) - austria s far right freedom party , days before parliamentary elections which are expected to catapult it into government , has suspended a low-level party official over allegations he used a nazi salute .
the party is poised to become part of a coalition after the oct. 15 vote with the conservatives expected to gain around a third of the vote .
both parties campaign with tough rhetoric on fighting immigration and closed islamic communities .
austrian newspaper der standard reported , without citing names , that an independent local councillor in the province of styria complained to her mayor about having seen her freedom party colleague raising his right arm in nazi-fashion and saying the nazi salute heil hitler .
owning objects or making statements that glorify nazism is illegal in austria , where hitler was born and which was annexed into his third reich .
josef riemer , the freedom party parliamentarian for the constituency , said in an emailed statement the party was taking the accusations very seriously and had suspended the official s membership until the case was resolved .
he added the official rejects the allegations and had already hired a lawyer .
the mayor s lawyer dieter neger , who declined to identify the town or anyone involved , said he would officially hand the case , which he said included two witness statements , to prosecutors in the city of graz later on tuesday .
the freedom party , which was founded by former nazis but says it has left its past behind , has repeatedly thrown out officials in recent years over nazi allegations .
party chief heinz-christian strache , who says anti-semitism is a crime , has said christian europe shares an enemy with israel in political islam .
austria s anti-fascist mauthausen komitee , named after a nazi concentration camp , published a brochure this year detailing 60 cases of nazi-related incidents involving freedom party members .
