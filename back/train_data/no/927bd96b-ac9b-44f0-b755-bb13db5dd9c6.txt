quito ( reuters ) - an ecuadorean court on wednesday sentenced vice president jorge glas to six years in jail after finding him guilty of receiving bribes from brazilian construction company odebrecht [ odbct.ul ] in return for handing the scandal-ridden firm state contracts .
a close ally of leftist ex-president rafael correa , glas served as correa s vice president from 2013 and retained the position under current president lenin moreno .
but moreno , who has largely broken from correa , suspended glas in august , accusing him of not being a team player .
an ecuadorean judge in october then ordered pre-trial detention for glas as part of the investigation into odebrecht .
the public prosecutor s office accused him of pocketing a roughly $ 13.5-million bribe from odebrecht via his uncle .
glas constructed , with ( former odebrecht executive ) jose conceicao santos , the awarding of public contracts in return for payment , judge edgar flores said on wednesday as he read the decision .
glas , a 48-year-old electrical engineer , has been accused by senior members of correa s government of corruption while serving as strategic sectors minister and vice president .
his lawyer slammed the decision as unjust and vowed to appeal .
glas downfall highlights how fallout from the massive odebrecht corruption scandal has continued to ripple across south america .
the company , which has admitted to paying bribes to win contracts in a number of countries , has paid $ 3.5 billion in settlements in the united states , brazil and switzerland .
odebrecht allegedly paid $ 33.5 million in bribes to secure contracts in ecuador .
the opposition says that correa s government was slow to investigate , although he rejects that .
