Donald Trump is an unapologetic Islamophobic bigot.
He has called for a ban on all Muslims including citizens who might be abroad entering the United States.
And now, The Donald is insisting on doubling down on the lie that American soldiers killed Muslims with bullets dipped in pig s blood.
This is particularly significant, because according to Islam, eating or coming into contact with pork is forbidden.During a rally on the campaign in Charleston, South Carolina, Trump rallied his army of racist supporters, and doubled down on the blatant the lie that American General John Pershing led the mass murder and added insult to injury at their time of death with the pig s blood: He took 50 bullets, and he dipped them in pig s blood.
And he had his men load his rifles and he lined up the 50 people, and they shot 49 of those people.
And the 50th person he said You go back to your people and you tell them what happened.
And for 25 years there wasn t a problem, OK?
Trump had the perfect crowd to sell his hatred to, as he always does people who hate Muslims with a passion and believe them to be the doom of America.
The whole point behind stoking the fires of anger at that South Carolina rally was to make sure people understood that he has as much contempt for Muslims and their faith as his bigoted followers do.This is a lie that was started during the rise of post- 9/11 Islamophobia, which Trump has happily reignited.
Fact-checking site Snopes notes that the bigoted and untrue idea of subduing militant Muslims by threatening to bury them with pigs has held currency for many years.
Well, despite the fact that none of this is true regarding General Pershing, the idea still persists in the scary era of the very real possibility of Bigot-in-Chief Donald Trump becoming President of the United States.
This is just another reason that Trump s persistent front-runner status should terrify us all.Featured image via screen capture from AI archives
