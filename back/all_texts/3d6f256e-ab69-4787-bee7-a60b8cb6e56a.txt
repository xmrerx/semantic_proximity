ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey may reciprocate a move by Washington and partially ease issuance of visas for U.S. citizens after the U.S. embassy said it had resumed visa processing on a limited basis, a Turkish government source said on Monday.
The U.S. embassy in Ankara announced its decision in an email on Monday, in what could signal a tentative improvement in the ongoing diplomatic crisis between the two countries.
