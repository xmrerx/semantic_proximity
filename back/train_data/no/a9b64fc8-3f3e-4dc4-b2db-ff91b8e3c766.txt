dublin ( reuters ) - the brexit transition period of around two years envisaged in eu draft guidelines on friday is a decent amount of time but a longer period could be needed to ratify a future trade deal , irish prime minister leo varadkar said .
two years is a decent amount of time , we would be happy for it to be longer but we re also comfortable with two years , varadkar told a news conference after hailing friday s agreement on the irish border as a very significant day for the whole of the island .
i would add one word of caution to having a transition phase of two years , obviously what we re going to want to do is negotiate new treaties between the uk and eu .
it can take many years to negotiate treaties and how long the transition phase should be , in my view , must be linked to how long it will take us to secure ratification of those treaties .
