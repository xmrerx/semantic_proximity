WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Tuesday that the United States was willing to begin direct talks with North Korea without pre-conditions, appearing to back away from U.S. demands that Pyongyang first accept that any negotiations would have to be based on North Korean disarmament.
Let s just meet, Tillerson said in a speech to a Washington think tank, offering a new diplomatic opening amid heightened tensions over North Korea s weapons advances.
We can talk about the weather if you want.
We can talk about whether it s going to be a square table or a round table.
Then we can begin to lay out a map, a road map, of what we might be willing to work towards, Tillerson said, suggesting that any initial contacts would be about setting the ground rules for formal negotiations.
