Senator Tim Kaine, the Democratic Party s vice-presidential nominee, has apparently had enough of people trying to interfere in the presidential race and thwart the will of the people.
Kaine is now going on the record about the effort from within that threatens to distort the results of the race and put a thumb on the scale in Donald Trump s favor.Sen.
Tim Kaine (D-Va.) suggested Saturday that some officials at the FBI are actively working to support Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.
[ ]Kaine called the FBI a leaky sieve and criticized director James B. Comey for breaking agency protocol by discussing a politically sensitive case so close to an election.
He also dismissed former New York mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani s decision to back off claims that he was given advance notice of the FBI s plans to possibly reopen the Clinton investigation.The surprise announcement from the FBI director is a violation of the agency s rules, and it ricocheted through the media in a negative light for Clinton.
Follow-up reporting has indicated that many of the emails if not all of them found on former Rep. Anthony Weiner s laptop were not even to or from Clinton.The Trump campaign was delighted to have the news to attack Clinton with on the campaign trail, fueling the desire on the right to chant lock her up, a dangerous idea that many have compared to the third-world tactics of dictators in banana republics.Subsequent reporting appears to indicate a war roiling the FBI itself, which some conservative forces are attempting to use to prevent Clinton s election, while others oppose such blatant interference in the race.Despite the unprecedented nature of the leaks and the director s actions, the political damage to Clinton does not appear to be significant.
Most national polling and analysis of the polls shows a likely win, despite FBI obstruction.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
