LONDON (Reuters) - Talks on restoring a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland are making progress but there are significant gaps between the province s two main political parties, Prime Minister Theresa May s spokesman said on Monday.
The talks are still ongoing, we are still working with the parties on reaching an agreement.
