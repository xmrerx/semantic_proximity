alabama senator jeff sessions has been the lone fighter in the battle against the invasion at our southern border .
this is why the endorsement of trump s immigration policy is a big deal .
sessions is a good man of high character who wouldn t endorse the trump plan if he didn t feel it was worthy .
this is great news ! the senate s leading proponent of enforcing and toughening immigration laws said late sunday that donald trump s immigration outline , his first major position white paper , is exactly the plan america needs .
in a strong endorsement of trump s bid to close the border to illegal immigration , the alabama senator that regular native americans and especially minorities would benefit by being put first in line for jobs .
this plan puts the needs of working americans foremost , and develops an effective strategy for improving their wages and job prospects .
crucially , this plan includes an emphasis on lifting struggling minority communities , including our immigrant communities , out of poverty by preventing corporations from bringing in new workers from overseas to replace them and drive down wages , said sessions in a statement .
