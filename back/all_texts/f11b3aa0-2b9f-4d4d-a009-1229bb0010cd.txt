Saturday Night Live hilariously skewered Donald Trump s misogyny and the women who love his campaign during the sketch show s cold open.The sketch begins with Kate Bolduan, played by Kate McKinnon saying: Welcome back to At This Hour.
I m Kate Bolduan.
I ve got the brain for MSNBC, the hair for Fox News.
So here I am at CNN.
Bolduan then introduces Tea Party News Network host and fervent Trump supporter Scottie Nell Hughes.
During a recent appearance on CNN, the real life Hughes defended comments Trump had made where he said that he would punish women who sought abortions.
She defended him saying that Trump had fallen victim to a trap laid out by the liberal media.Hughes, played by Cecily Strong, joined Bolduan saying, Hi Kate.
As a woman I like Donald Trump, but as a full-blown nutjob, I friggin love him!
Bolduan then questions Hughes defense of Trump s sexism, asking her why she would support someone who tweeted out an obviously sexist picture of Ted Cruz s wife.SNL mocks the sheer length that Hughes will go to in order to defend Trump at any costs and Trump s hand size by having Hughes reply: Actually, that was an accident.
Okay cuz Donald s hands are just so big he can t see what every little tweet his fingers retweet.
After confirming that Hughes is seriously using that answer, she presses the Trump super fan on the matter of Trump s comments regarding abortion.
Hughes then pulls out the first answer she can think fo saying: What that is, was just Donald making an April Fool s joke, cus it was April Fool s. Bolduan responded to Hughes saying that Trump had made the comment on March 30.
Hughes responds while nervously laughing, saying that that is the reason the joke is so funny.You can watch the sketch in full, below.
