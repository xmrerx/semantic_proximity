berlin ( reuters ) - germany said on friday it supported the spanish government in its dispute with separatists in catalonia and would not recognize an independence vote by the catalan parliament .
government spokesman steffen seibert said berlin viewed the escalation of the situation with concern , noting that the unilateral declaration of independence violated the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity of spain .
the spanish government on friday moved to impose direct rule over catalonia , stripping the region of its autonomy less than an hour after its parliament declared independence .
the german government does not recognize such a declaration of independence , he said , adding that berlin supported the clear position of spanish prime minister mariano rajoy in his bid to restore calm and order .
we hope that all involved will use the remaining possibilities for dialogue and de-escalation , he added .
