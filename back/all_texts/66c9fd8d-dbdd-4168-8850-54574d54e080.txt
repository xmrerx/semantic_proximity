The man now advising, coaching, and strategizing with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Roger Ailes, is going to be in a further world of hurt as New York Magazine reports that Gretchen Carlson taped his sexual prowess against her.According to the magazine:Taking on Ailes was dangerous, but Carlson was determined to fight back.
She settled on a simple strategy: She would turn the tables on his surveillance.
Beginning in 2014, according to a person familiar with the lawsuit, Carlson brought her iPhone to meetings in Ailes s office and secretly recorded him saying the kinds of things he d been saying to her all along.
I think you and I should have had a sexual relationship a long time ago, and then you d be good and better and I d be good and better.
Sometimes problems are easier to solve that way, he said in one conversation.
I m sure you can do sweet nothings when you want to, he said another time.Now who does this sound like?For over a year Carlson had been taping these instances and now that physical evidence is known to be in existence, will Trump continue to be an apologist for Ailes?
Remember that back in July, Trump took Ailes side and expressed doubt that Carlson was telling the truth, saying, I can tell you that some of the women that are complaining, I know how much he s helped them, and even recently.
In Trump s world, if a woman is given a promotion, a job to begin with, or sustains employment, there is no possible way that her boss can be a total predator.
Trump, who paints himself to be the law and order candidate, has been taking advice from a man who sexually harassed and coerced female employees for years.This should go over well with female voters, in which Trump has record deficits with.If there s one thing this story can tell us, it s that Ailes and Trump are two peas in the sexist pod.
They both are right-wing ideologues who built empires, and they both have an aura of sleaze that surrounds and follows them.I wonder how long it will take Trump to disavow.Featured image via Rich Polk/Getty Images
