bravo !
polish prime minister beata szydlo just put her foot down !
she told the eu that poland will not be blackmailed into accepting thousands of refugees under the eu quota system .
szydlo hammered the weak eu for allowing the slow death of european culture and its people by taking in millions of refugees that are destroying the western nations financially , socially and culturally .
in a fantastic speech before the polish parliament , szydlo urged lawmakers to protect poland and its children from the scourges of islamist terrorism and cultural suicide : where are you headed , europe ?
rise from your knees and from your lethargy , or you will be crying over your children every day.if you can not see that terrorism has the potential to hurt every country in europe , and you think that poland should not defend itself , you are going hand in hand with those who point this weapon against europe , against all of us.do we want politicians who say we have to get used to terrorist attacks ? prime minister beata szydlo received raucous applause from many members of the polish parliament , who expressed their approval of her no-nonsense call to action .
