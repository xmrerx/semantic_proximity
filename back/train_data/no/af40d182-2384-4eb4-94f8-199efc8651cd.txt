athens ( reuters ) - shots fired at riot police guarding the headquarters of greece s socialist pasok party on monday came from the same gun that one particular guerrilla group has used in attacks , police said .
there were no injuries during the shooting , which occurred at a busy intersection in athens at around 1745 gmt , when some 30 people were inside the party s offices .
no one has claimed responsibility .
police found four shells at the spot and said tests showed they had been fired from a kalashnikov ak-47 rifle .
one bullet passed through a shop window and a second pierced a metal electricity pole .
the same rifle had been used in at least two attacks claimed by left-wing guerrilla group revolutionary self-defense , including one on the pasok offices in 2014 , police said .
the group , which emerged during greece s economic crisis , claimed an attack with a hand grenade on the french embassy in athens last year .
the tests point at a certain direction and the government needs to act , pasok spokesman pavlos christides said .
small-scale attacks on businesses , police , politicians and embassies are relatively frequent in greece .
the country has a long history of political violence and is struggling to emerge from a huge debt crisis that has sent unemployment soaring and cut incomes .
pasok , a once dominant party that signed up to the country s first international bailout in exchange for austerity , holds a leadership contest on sunday .
it has seen its popularity wane since 2009 when it last won a national election with 43 percent .
its headquarters are in the athens neighborhood of exarchia , the scene of regular confrontations between police and anti-establishment protesters .
