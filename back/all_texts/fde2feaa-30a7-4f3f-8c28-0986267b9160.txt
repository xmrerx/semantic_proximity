Just when you thought Republicans couldn t get more deplorable, they go and prove you wrong.The official Twitter handle for the Tennessee GOP just tweeted out a tweet that said: Watch thousands of deplorables chanting: lock her up at Trump rally in Colorado Springs.
Even worse, with the hashtag EvangelicalTrump because you know, that s what Jesus would do.
However, if I recall, Jesus was wrongfully accused, arrested and sentenced as well, but facts and the Republican party don t exactly go hand in glove.Here s the tweet with the video and the a-ok emoji of approval:Watch thousands of deplorables chanting: "lock her up" at Trump rally in Colorado Springs.

That s a real class act right there.Let s stop and think for a moment that the official Twitter account of the Republican party in Tennessee is tweeting like this, so we really can t be at all surprised that they support Donald Trump or his deplorable following.This isn t professional, nor by any means, okay.
However, with Trump winning the nomination, and winning in Tennessee, this tweet seems just about right.Has Hillary Clinton done anything to deserve a lock her up chant?
No, not at all.
Anything she s been accused of by the Republican party or others has been debunked, held absolutely no water, or she s been cleared.If Republicans want to look for someone to lock up, maybe they should look at Trump and his sexually predatory behavior, inability to pay taxes, and fraudulent business practices.
