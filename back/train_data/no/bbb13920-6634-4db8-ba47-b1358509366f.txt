i think having a fresh set of legs in this seat , i think having a fresh perspective , new personnel and new ideas and a new conversation with the american people about issues that may be different a year from now than they were when i started eight years ago , i think that s all good for our democracy , he concluded.it s not the first time obama has signaled confidence that he could win a third term if he wanted to .
