WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on Tuesday that President Donald Trump s characterization of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un as Rocket Man during a speech to the United Nations was risky.
If I were giving the president advice, I would have said avoid using Rocket Man, Schumer said during a press conference at the U.S. Capitol.
We know the leader of North Korea is erratic, to put it kindly.
That kind of language I think is risky.
