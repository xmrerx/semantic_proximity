new york ( reuters ) - democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton extended her lead over republican rival donald trump to eight percentage points , according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on tuesday , from six points on friday .
the bump for clinton followed the democratic national convention in philadelphia last week at which clinton and her supporters painted an optimistic portrait of america , and came amid controversy over trump ’ s comments about the parents of a slain muslim u.s. soldier .
about 43 percent of likely voters favor clinton , 35 percent favor trump , and 9 percent picked “ other , ” according to the july 28-aug. 1 online poll of 1,289 likely voters .
the poll had a credibility interval of 3 percentage points .
trump has faced a barrage of criticism in recent days from political allies as well as opponents after he criticized the parents of u.s. army captain humayun khan , who was killed in iraq in 2004 .
the father , khizr khan , had harsh words for trump at the democratic convention where he spoke on thursday night , saying the 70-year-old businessman and former reality tv star had “ sacrificed nothing and no one ” and railing against his calls to ban muslim immigrants .
trump responded saying khan “ viciously attacked ” him , and suggested the man was repeating lines fed to him by the clinton campaign .
new jersey governor chris christie , who dropped out of the republican presidential primary race and endorsed trump , said on tuesday that trump ’ s criticisms of the khans was “ inappropriate. ” house republican richard hanna of new york said it was “ not enough to simply denounce his ( trump ’ s ) comments , ” and said he would support former secretary of state clinton instead .
trump had a short-lived bump in the polls after the republican national convention in cleveland in late july , when reuters polling showed him slightly ahead of clinton for the first time since may .
