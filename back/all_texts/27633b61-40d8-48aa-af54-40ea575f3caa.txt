Trump says he s never talked to Putin and the allegation that he is working with him to expose Hillary s emails is ridiculous.
Putin has been threatening the release of 20,000 emails from Hillary s private server, and the press is trying to tie his threat to Trump.
Unlike previous GOP presidential candidates s Trump s not going to sit back and allow the press to define the narrative.
He s getting out ahead of this email lie and taking it on Trump style .A popular theory explaining the attack is that the DNC hack is a Russian attempt to embarrass the DNC and influence the election.
Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has speculated that the hack was actually a false flag operation performed by the DNC to cast aspersions on his campaign.
Donald Trump has a message for Russia: find Hillary Clinton s missing emails.The Republican presidential nominee, holding a Wednesday press conference, said that the 30,000 missing emails from Clinton s private email server would reveal some beauties and made an extraordinary plea for a foreign power to locate them.
Russia, if you re listening, I hope you re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Trump said.
I think you ll be rewarded mightily by our press!
