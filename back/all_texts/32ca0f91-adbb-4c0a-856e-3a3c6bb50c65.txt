It appears that several voicemail messages were obtained by the website Gawker showing Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump s extremely close relationship with the supposed liberal media, despite the fact that during many of his rallies he s openly badmouthed the very media he adores covering him.According to Gawker: While Gawker was unable to independently verify their authenticity, the recordings certainly appear to be genuine.
In addition to those from the MSNBC personalities, there were messages from longtime Barack Obama advisor David Axelrod, New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady, and boxing promoter Don King, all of whom spoke to Trump in a friendly and familiar manner.
And this tweet from Joe Scarborough seems to verify that the transcripts seem to be legit:Oh my God.
I just read the transcripts!
Trump must have contributed to a children's charity.
Scandalous!!!
https://t.co/BxcZCdSkQb Joe Scarborough (@JoeNBC) March 4, 2016One woman who identified herself as T. Hall, is allegedly Tamron Hall from MSNBC.
She s reported to have said: I celebrated by going to Gucci, and I m going to use your discount, because there s a green dress that s like $3,000, and I need a discount bigger than the one my discount.
Apparently wanting Trump s discount for the Gucci store that his located inside Trump s 5th Avenue building.
She also apparently said: I hope you re bracing for Romney to get his butt whipped tomorrow by Obama.
Showing that the message clearly dates back to the 2012 election.
An election that Hall was covering.
However, in yet another message, she s clearly upset with Trump over his birther nonsense: I saw the YouTube video today.
I wanted to chat with you about it, since you know that I m a huge fan, and I think the world of you.
But I think that thing today was not good not becoming of who I think you are as a person, as a statesman, like your award.
I just thought it was just kind of crummy.
Other voicemails indicate, as already previously talked about, Trump s relationship with Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski.
It looks as though Trump donated to one of their charities.
Here s the alleged transcript via Gawker:BRZEZINSKI: Hi, Donald.
It s Mika and Joe calling.
Say hi, Joe.SCARBOROUGH: Hey there, Donald.
How you doing?BRZEZINSKI: We re just leaving you a message because we re trying to get in touch with you, but you must be, like, on your jet or something.
We d love to talk to you, so call one of us.
What s your other number, Joe?SCARBOROUGH: I m at [REDACTED].
And the kids want to scream Thank you, to you, Donald.
Say, Thank you, Donald.
CHILDREN: Thank you!SCARBOROUGH: We are so, so grateful for everything, Donald, and we just want to call you and tell you how much it means to us.BRZEZINSKI: It was amazing.
Thank you, Donald.
Hope to talk to you soon.
Bye.Gawker also reported that hackers were able to not only access Trump s voicemail, but change his outgoing message.The original outgoing message is here, via ABC:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/217758973 params= auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&visual=true width= 100% height= 450 iframe= true /]And here is the alleged audio of what the hackers were capable of doing: All of this is very alarming considering Trump is apparently incapable of securing his cellphone and voicemail.
If he allows this sort of thing to happen, what sort of ineptitude would he bring to the White House if elected?
Yet one more reason to remember that no matter who, vote blue.Featured image: flickr
