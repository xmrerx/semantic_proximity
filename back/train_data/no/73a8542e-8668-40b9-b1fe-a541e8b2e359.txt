london ( reuters ) - the world health organization said on friday it had received reports of an attack on medical facilities in eastern syria that had destroyed a store containing more than 130,000 vaccine doses against measles and polio .
if confirmed , the who said , the attack would put thousands of children at risk of these serious infectious , viral diseases .
both can spread rapidly in areas of conflict .
we unequivocally condemn these actions .
vaccines are not a legitimate target of war , the who s representative in syria , elizabeth hoff , said in a statement issued late on friday .
the who said the reports it received were of an attack on a vaccine cold room at health facilities in al-mayadin , near deir al-zor in eastern syria .
the who did not say whether the reports it received gave any detail on who carried out the reported attack .
the store had held 100,000 doses of measles vaccine , 35,000 doses of polio vaccine , plus syringes and other equipment .
until a new cold room is built and the required cold chain equipment - including solar fridges , cold boxes and vaccine carriers - are delivered , this will delay ... routine immunization for vulnerable children in the area , hoff said .
polio - a viral disease that can cripple its victims - and measles - which can cause diarrhea , blindness and can kill - tend to break out in war zones because low vaccine coverage leaves gaps in population immunity , exposing children to infection .
the who previously tackled a polio outbreak in the same area of syria in 2013-2014 .
the un health agency said that in its last polio vaccination campaign in deir al-zor it reached more than 252,000 babies and children .
