Just when you think the right-wing shills at Fox News couldn t possibly get anymore despicable, they go and do just that.
By now, everyone has heard of the tragic crash of EgyptAir flight 804 in the vicinity of the Mediterranean Sea after it disappeared from the radar Wednesday night en route from Paris to Cairo.
While the rest of the world is reeling from this tragic event, Fox Business host Stuart Varney is busy trying turn it into a way to help elect Donald Trump.Appearing on Fox and Friends less than 24 hours later, Varney insisted that this plane crash would somehow encourage the refugee crisis.
He went on to say: I also think this may be good politically for Donald Trump.
He s already tweeted out, saying this is probably terrorism.He s the guy who is saying, hands off, keep Muslims out temporarily whist we figure out who comes in.
An incident of this type is surely a plus for Donald Trump.
So, in other words, it seems that this imbecile is actually glad that this plane crashed and all of these people lost their lives, just since it helps Trump and makes people more determined to ban Muslims from America than ever.
His statements are absolutely disgusting, but, then again, what can we expect from a Trump supporting Fox host?I swear, these people never cease to amaze me with how low they will sink.
For once, Fox needs to do the right thing and make Stuart Varney apologize for these appallingly insensitive statements.Watch the video below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture
