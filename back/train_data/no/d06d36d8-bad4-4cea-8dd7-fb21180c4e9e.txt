until today , not one national poll had clinton leading with male voters .
some have gotten close , but donald trump has always managed to lock it up .
the gender gap that we have seen the last several elections was looking like a repeat for 2016.but now a new poll released the day of the third and final presidential debate shows clinton now for the first time is leading with men .
the newest poll from bloomberg politics shows clinton edging out trump by 2 points with men ( 46 to 44 ) and 9 points overall ( 47-38 ) .the poll was conducted from october 14-17 with responses from 1,006 likely voters.so a week after the game-changing audio tape was leaked in which trump admits to sexually assaulting women men have started to turn against the republican nominee , and for good reason.clinton is already gaining in republican strongholds white , college educated women , cuban-americans , young republicans , vietnamese-americans , and now men .
such gains have turned traditionally red states like arizona , georgia and texas into reachable victories for democrats.with trump under-performing romney in key swing states ( and red states ) , trump can not afford to lose his key voting demographics , but the damage from the tape and the accusations of sexual assault have hurt him tremendously.republican men have distanced themselves from trump after the revelations were leaked , invoking their wives and daughters and granddaughters as reasons they can not support the gop nominee .
it s not clear if the shift in male support for clinton comes from independent or republican defectors , but the numbers are slowly inching clinton s way.with less than 20 days until election day , trump is going to have to pivot hard if he hopes of bringing back all the defectors into his camp .
with early voting already underway , in which millions have already cast their ballots , the window of opportunity may have passed.featured image via justin sullivan/getty images
