On July 4, we celebrate our independence each year, but the Obama family has had another reason to celebrate for the last 18 the birth of the President s eldest daughter, Malia.
This year s annual White House Fourth of July picnic on the lawn had to be canceled due to rain, but the President and Michelle Obama decided to move the party inside where they hosted numerous military families.
Since it was his daughter s birthday, President Obama decided to do what dads do best embarrass her by being her dad.
It just so happens we celebrate our country s birthday on the same day as my oldest daughter s birthday, so just a quick Happy Birthday for Malia, the President told the crowd.
He then broke into a croaky, frankly terrible rendition of Happy Birthday that was somehow perfect in every way.As he wrapped up the song, Malia stepped in to give her father a huge hug in what is possibly the most touching father-daughter moment of the many we have witnessed.Preceding this touching moment between Obama and his daughter were some beautiful remarks about our country.
Obama called the United States a miracle, saying that we are lucky that people generations ago were willing to take up arms and fight for our freedom.
Independence is not something that just happens, he told the crowd.
It s something that we have to fight for every single day.
It s something that we have to nurture and we have to spread the word and we have to work on.
President Obama said that the most important thing about freedom is that we ensure that everyone has opportunities in this country that they can put a roof over their heads and contribute to society.
It is important to recognize imperfections and fight to make things better for everyone, Obama said.Watch this touching scene unfold below:Featured image via screengrab
