You can often figure a lot out about a person by what they pay attention to, and in the age of Twitter, by who they follow on Twitter.
And while Donald Trump follows his kids, his organization, and many higher-ups in the GOP, he also just started following a new profile Emergency Kittens.See here:via TwitterNow, there s the obvious joke that Trump following a profile that claims to critique cats is very befitting, considering he loves to critique women and has referred to a specific body part as, well, you know.
However, let s try to look past that, and look more at the fact that the next president is staring at kittens on Twitter and only following 43 profiles, including that one.What sorts of tweets does Emergency Kittens put out?
Here s a sample:me when mom calls me down for dinner but it's not ready yet pic.twitter.com/e2cvj1eWUQ Emergency Kittens (@EmrgencyKittens) January 2, 2017cats have ruled us since the dawn of time pic.twitter.com/y5G8yVfkvR Emergency Kittens (@EmrgencyKittens) January 1, 2017pic.twitter.com/yik4l0AIVW Emergency Kittens (@EmrgencyKittens) January 1, 2017fat cat just waiting until his shift is over.

Not sure whether to appreciate the fact that he likes looking at adorable kitten photos, proving he may, in fact, actually be human, or be slightly alarmed that the president-elect may need to look at these photos as a means to calm down.
Either way it s still funny.UPDATE: He has since stopped following the kittens.
Too bad, really.
