it s still a few months before the election , so the media has to keep us interested by telling us it s an up and down horse race .
recent polls show donald trump neck and neck with hillary clinton ( okay , done with the horse metaphors ) , but reality paints a much different picture .
recent models show that clinton has a 3 to 1 chance of winning.for example , the most recent nbc poll shows that clinton and trump are virtually tied.the new york times upshot examines state by state polling , rather than overall polling .
they also take past results into account .
with our electoral college , polling a national sampling can be wildly inaccurate , yet that s what most pollsters do.their prediction ?
it s not a lock for clinton , but they say her chances of winning are 76 percent to 24 percent for trump .
read their article .
there are a lot of fascinating interactive charts .
in essence , though , clinton has 945 ways to win .
trump has 72.the always sane nate silver at fivethirtyeight.com agrees , kind of .
silver acknowledges that clinton s lead is now down to just 3 or 4 points , which is kind of frightening , but according to silver , there s a 35 to 40 percent chance that trump can pull it out .
what s particularly disconcerting about that , though , is that clinton has about the same lead in the polls that john kerry did in 2004 , and we all know how that election turned out.one big unknown is whether the spate of violence by and toward the police will continue .
right now , the republican party is waging an effective campaign of telling americans that we are in a race war and the only way for the majority ( white people ) to win , is by voting for donald trump .
then again , there are those of us who believe that the way to start a race war is to elect trump.featured image of hillary clinton by alex wong at getty images | featured image of donald trump by will mcnamee at getty images
