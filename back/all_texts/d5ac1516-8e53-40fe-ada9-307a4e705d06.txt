BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary said on Wednesday a ruling by the European Union s highest court that member states must take in refugees and asylum-seekers was appalling and unacceptable, flagging further legal battles with European authorities over the matter.
The Hungarian government considers today s decision by the European court to be appalling and irresponsible, Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto told a news conference.
This decision jeopardizes the security and future of all of Europe.
Szijjarto said the decision was made based on political rather than legal or professional considerations.
Politics has raped European law and values, he said.
