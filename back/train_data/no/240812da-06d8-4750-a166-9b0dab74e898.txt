( reuters ) - the u.s. missile defense agency and the navy successfully conducted a missile defense test off the coast of hawaii , mda said in a statement on wednesday .
the test , scheduled well in advance , was done from the uss john paul jones and comes a day after north korea fired a ballistic missile over japan .
the test , using standard missile-6 guided missiles , intercepted a medium-range ballistic missile target .
north korea said its missile launch was to counter u.s. and south korean military drills , and was a first step in military action in the pacific to contain the u.s. territory of guam .
the launch was condemned by the united nations as an outrageous act .
the mda said the test gives the naval component of the missile defense system higher ability to intercept ballistic missiles in their terminal phase .
japan has been worried that the united states has so far declined to arm it with a powerful new radar , reuters reported on wednesday .
japan is seeking a land-based version of the aegis ballistic missile defense system , operational by 2023 , as a new layer of defense to help counter north korea s missile advances .
