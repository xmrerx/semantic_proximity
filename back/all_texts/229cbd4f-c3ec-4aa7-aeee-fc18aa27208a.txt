North Carolina governor Pat McCrory lost his re-election bid to his Democratic challenger Roy Cooper three weeks ago.
However, McCrory is trying every trick in the book to re-install himself as governor for another term against the will of the people of the state.
One of those tricks is alleging widespread voter fraud, and McCrory filed several complaints in that direction.Now, remember the North Carolina Board of Elections is run by Republicans, not Democrats right now.
Therefore, one would think this would give McCrory an edge in his crazy attempt to overturn this election by any means necessary, but not so.
Even his Republican colleagues are sick of McCrory s nonsense, and they made the decision to toss his ridiculous voter fraud complaints.
These complaints were designed to make it appear that people who were not eligible to vote had indeed voted, thus costing him the election.
However, the Board of Elections said to get rid of the complaints that merely disputes the eligibility of a voter.
Here is the response from Roy Cooper:All of this comes on the heels of obvious voter suppression efforts on the part of the North Carolina GOP.
The complaints filed by McCrory include the 52 counties in the state where the North Carolina GOP at large started purging voter rolls, accusing people of voting without being eligible.
Despite this, the GOP elections officials are still going against McCrory.McCrory needs to concede.
Cooper now leads him by more than 9,000 votes and counting.
The people of North Carolina do not want him to be their governor any longer.
Instead of accepting that, he is whining and stomping his feet like a child.
He s embarrassing himself, his state, and his Republican colleagues.
This guy is like North Carolina s own Donald Trump in a way too childish and prideful to admit when he s wrong.
If McCrory continues this nonsense, he should be forcibly removed from office when his term is officially over.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
