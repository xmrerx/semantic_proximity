In a move that is seemingly being done as a preemptive strike against Donald Trump s administration and his clear love for the oil industry, President Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau have just put in place actions to prevent drilling in regions of both the Arctic and Atlantic Oceans.The statement from the White House also states that we need to be moving away from fossil fuel.
Donald Trump and his nomination of Rex Tillerson of ExxonMobil for Secretary of State seems to be an effort to double down on oil production.
However, fossil fuels are not infinite and we must move away from oil to a cleaner more sustainable future.The statement reads: Today, in partnership with our neighbors and allies in Canada, the United States is taking historic steps to build a strong Arctic economy, preserve a healthy Arctic ecosystem and protect our fragile Arctic waters, including designating the bulk of our Arctic water and certain areas in the Atlantic Ocean as indefinitely off limits to future oil and gas leasing.These actions, and Canada s parallel actions, protect a sensitive and unique ecosystem that is unlike any other region on earth.
They reflect the scientific assessment that, even with the high safety standards that both our countries have put in place, the risks of an oil spill in this region are significant and our ability to clean up from a spill in the region s harsh conditions is limited.
By contrast, it would take decades to fully develop the production infrastructure necessary for any large-scale oil and gas leasing production in the region at a time when we need to continue to move decisively away from fossil fuels.
JUST IN: Obama and Trudeau move to protect Arctic and Atlantic Ocean from risks of Trump, Tillerson, Pruitt, etc.
