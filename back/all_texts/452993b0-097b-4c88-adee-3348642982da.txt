It s all about Hillary and Bill in their world.
It s also about how much they can skim off the top or gain monetarily in the political world.
Just a couple of grifters Hillary Clinton s greatest strength, the candidate explained in an interview with the morning newsletter The Skimm, is her passionate commitment to helping people.
The passion was on display in 2009, for example, when Clinton personally intervened to help Swiss bank UBS settle a lawsuit with the IRS and thus protect the identities of tens of thousands of Americans who may or may not be evading U.S. taxes through Swiss bank accounts.Clinton was also asked about her greatest weakness.
Here s what she said:Got that?
Clinton s biggest fault is her inability to deal with you idiots who can t comprehend why Hillary Clinton should be president.
You already rejected her once in 2008, and God help you if it happens again.
You wouldn t like her when she s angry.This weakness was on display in 2008 during the Democratic primary, when Hillary was brought to tears upon realizing that Democratic voters might reject her in favor of an inexperienced celebrity like Barack Obama.Via: WFB
