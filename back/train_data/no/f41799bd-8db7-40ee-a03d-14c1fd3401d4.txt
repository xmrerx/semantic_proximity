the media hyped the fact that donald trump used a teleprompter during his speech on tuesday night after winning the final slate of republican primaries ( with no opposition ) .
the speech was more sober and low energy than most trump speeches have been , and used more sophisticated language than trump s traditional events.but he still stuck his foot in it.during the speech , trump made a reference to helping our african-american people who live in the inner city that have been mistreated for so long.coming just a few days after referring to a black man in one of his rallies as my african-american , the comment hit a sour note for many people , especially as it sounded like a possessive reference to ownership.twitter users took trump to task for the comment almost immediately after he said it : trump : it 's gon na be great .
we are going to give `` our african american people '' 3/5 of a vote .

he described mexican immigrants as criminals and rapists , while also calling for a ban on muslim travel to the united states.his campaign has also received support from white supremacists , who have bankrolled robocalls in his favor and a super pac backing his election .
trump was endorsed by notorious former klansman david duke and his campaign arranged for a white supremacist radio show to get credentials to cover them.trump even rejected multiple opportunities in an interview with cnn s jake tapper to denounce and reject support from duke .
instead he stubbornly tried to deflect the question.his most diehard supporters have echoed trump s rhetoric , while the most extreme have even assaulted black protesters at his rallies , and in one instance a latino man was beat up and assaulted by a pair of men who cited trump as they engaged in violence.so , tell us again how the donald is not a racist.featured image via youtube
