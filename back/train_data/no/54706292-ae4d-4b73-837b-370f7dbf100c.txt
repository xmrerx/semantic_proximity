mogadishu ( reuters ) - somalia s islamist group al shabaab on thursday publicly stoned a woman to death in a town in the south for cheating on her husband , an official told reuters .
al shabaab , which has been waging a war for years to topple the horn of africa country s western-backed government , seeks to bring in rule based on its strict interpretation of sharia law .
sheikh mohamed abu abdalla , al shabaab s governor for somalia s jubba regions in the south , said habiba ali isak , a 30-year-old mother of eight children , was killed by stoning in sakow on thursday afternoon .
sakow , a town about 515 km ( 320 miles ) southwest of the capital mogadishu , is in an area entirely under al shabaab s control .
members of al shabaab have in the past handed out harsh punishments for religious infractions including hacking off of limbs for alleged thieves and public executions .
isak lived with her legal husband and children in hagar village in jubba , but cheated on her husband after she told him she was traveling to mogadishu to visit her relatives , abdalla said .
her legal husband , ali ibrahim , subsequently found out his wife did not go to mogadishu but instead had married again and was living with another husband in sakow .
her legal husband brought the case to the court .
she admitted she illegally married a second husband , abdalla said .
according to the islamic sharia she was publicly stoned to death this afternoon .
the offending second husband had fled , according to abdalla .
