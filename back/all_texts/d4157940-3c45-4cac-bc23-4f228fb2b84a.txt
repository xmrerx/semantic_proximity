Donald Trump continues to embarrass himself in a desperate effort to prove that he s a job creator.In yet another self-serving and self-promoting post on Twitter, Trump crowed about an announcement made by Ford Motor Company that it is investing $1.2 billion in three automotive plants in Michigan that will keep and create jobs.Big announcement by Ford today.
Major investment to be made in three Michigan plants.
Car companies coming back to U.S. JOBS!
JOBS!
JOBS!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017However, Ford previously planned this investment back in 2015 while President Obama was still in office.According to The Detroit News,The company said Tuesday it will invest $850 million to retool its Michigan Assembly Plant in Wayne for truck and SUV production; $150 million in its Romeo Engine Plant to expand capacity for several vehicles; and $200 million to build a data center at the company s Flat Rock Assembly Plant.
The investments at the Michigan Assembly Plant and Romeo Engine Plant were negotiated as part of the 2015 Ford-United Auto Workers contract.
The investments at Flat Rock those announced today and those announced in January are new.In short, most of the investments Trump is praising were already going to happen as part of deal between Ford executives and the labor union, which means a labor should get the credit for helping American workers and preventing jobs from being outsourced to other countries.
Trump had nothing to do with it.This isn t the first time Trump has taken credit for investments and job growth companies planned prior to him taking office.Trump also took credit for a Charter Communications announcement to create 20,000 jobs even though that plan was also made in 2015.Of course, while Trump supporters are gullible enough to believe he is responsible for these job gains, everyone else is not buying it.
Twitter users made that clear in their comments.Hey @realDonaldTrump, these are all part of the 2015 Ford-United Auto Workers contract.
Had nothing to do with you https://t.co/TMzR8doV76 Josh S nchez (@jnsanchez) March 28, 2017@realDonaldTrump Every time you make these announcements, we later find out that the deal had been in place months.Sign of desperation.
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) March 28, 2017@MatthewDicks @realDonaldTrump Of course it s been in place for months.
This guy is too busy working on his golf swing.

@realDonaldTrump Thank you!
This is a great reminder of that time Obama saved the entire American automobile industry.

@realDonaldTrump Cut the BS, #trump You can t just take credit for things that you ve had zero to do with.
WTF is wrong with you!?
Andy Ostroy (@AndyOstroy) March 28, 2017@realDonaldTrump Yes.
Trumpers, read the Detroit papers.
This was promised in a union contract from 2015.
Don t let Trump con you, again RiotWomenn (@riotwomennn) March 28, 2017The only question now is what other job announcements made under the Obama Administration will Trump take credit for next?Featured Image: Win McNamee/Getty Images
