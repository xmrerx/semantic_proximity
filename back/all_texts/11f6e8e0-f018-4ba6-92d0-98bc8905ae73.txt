Hillary Clinton broke the internet, or at least one of her sites, when an anti-Trump site, owned by the Clinton campaign went down on Thursday from traffic overload.The site is actually a subdomain of her main site, HillaryClinton.com.
It s called TrumpYourself.org and it s an interactive (but not terribly scientific) sort of hateful Trump quote roulette.
I say not scientific because when I rolled the dice it told me that Donald Trump doesn t think I should be able to get married.
I happen to be among those who have legally been marrying for centuries.
Naturally, though, it is an important issue for my LGBT friends.Here are some samples of what you might get, when you can get on the site:Introducing #TrumpYourself: Discover what @realDonaldTrump thinks about people like you.

Sad!

Well done.

Thanks, @HillaryClinton!

The #TrumpYourself 404 page is pretty great: https://t.co/b1oY1YiiLU pic.twitter.com/kahJRbh84D Rachel Sklar (@rachelsklar) July 21, 2016It even gets better, there s a quote that says, Look at that traffic, is that small traffic?
We guarantee you there s no problem.
We guarantee.
The Clinton campaign seems to have mostly fixed the problems.
Try it out; the site is a lot of fun.
Beware, though, you will be invited to donate to the Clinton campaign (of course) and to add your name and email to her database.Featured image via Hillary Clinton s Twitter
