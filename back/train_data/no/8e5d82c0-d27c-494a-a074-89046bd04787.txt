while much of the nation s attention has been focused on the horrors of the water crisis in flint , michigan , there has been a revolt growing in the state of michigan .
darnell earley , is not only the unelected emergency manager who created the flint water crisis , he also is in charge of detroit s public schools .
earley has done to detroit s schools , what he did to flint s water system.the conditions of detroit s school system are so bad , that teachers are on the verge of going on strike .
they have been increasing their resistance to the attack and mismanagement of detroit s schools over the past week .
they have been engaging in a tactic called the sick-out .
that s a protest where so many teachers call in sick , the school is forced to close.a picture is worth a thousand words .
here are some photos that show the deplorable conditions that students and teachers are being subjected to.does your school look like this ?

it shows what life is like for teachers and students in detroit.detroit s mayor , mike duggan recently went on a tour of dps schools .
he was heartbroken over what he saw .
i saw 4-year-olds in a classroom where it was about 50 degrees , he said .
they told me they usually wear their coats until lunchtime , when they warm up a bit because there s a part of each day they actually expect to have to wear their coats in the classroom .
it s nice to hear that duggan still has enough of a heart left to be broken .
the tour was nothing more than a publicity stunt created to make it look like the state is trying to do something to fix the problem .
now that the nation is watching the state of michigan and the snyder administration s corruption and incompetence that has infected the entire state on every level , they really , really need to convince people that they care.even with the flint water crisis , the detroit water crisis , the shame that is the dps , snyder can not even bring himself to criticize emergency manager earley .
here is what snyder had to say about earley and the teacher protesters last week : he s been doing a good job .
he s been working hard .
if you think about it , our goal is to get the detroit public schools to be successful .
i ve proposed a package that involves an investment of over $ 700 million to improve education in detroit .
i m not sure why people would want to go out and protest against a solution like that .
the state of michigan has been in control of detroit public school system for almost seven f # # king years .
the cries of anyone who have spoken out against the snyder administration have been meet with silence .
snyder s $ 700 million dollar proposal should , at this point , be seen as nothing more than a last-minute attempt to try to bribe his way out of being lynched by a growing mob.snyder and all his cronies must be brought to justice for their crimes against humanity.featured image courtesy : detroitteach via twitter
