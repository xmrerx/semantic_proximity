MSNBC s Casey Hunt was interviewing war-hawk and RINO Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) about the meeting Donald Trump Jr. on Capitol Hill.
Senator Lindsey Graham appeared to be concerned about Trump s decision to meet with the Russian lawyer who ended up only wanting to talk about adoptions.
Graham inferred that Trump Jr. made a rookie mistake saying, On it s face, this is very problematic.
We cannot allow foreign governments to reach out to anybody s campaign and say we d like to help you.
That is a non-starter.
I know that Donald Trump Jr. is new to politics, I know that Jared Kushner is new to politics, but, um this is gonna require a lot of uh questions to be asked and answered.
MSNBC was delighted to hear Lindsey Graham questioning Trump Jr. s judgement in agreeing to take the meeting.
Graham continued to express his feelings about the meeting, suggesting that Trump Jr. should have to testify about what transpired in the alleged meeting.
Graham was then asked by the MSNBC reporter, Do you think the White House has been truthful about the version of events that happened and their meetings that occurred between their associates and the Russians?
Graham responded, It s been very frustrating to find out every couple of weeks about a new meeting.
I m sure they met with a lot of people during the campaign.
I m sure the Clintons met with And just like magic, as soon as Hillary s name was mentioned, Graham s mic was cut!And just like that Boom!
Mic cut.
MSNBC had no issues with their sound while Lindsey Graham (who got less than 1% of support from voters against Donald Trump in a crowded field of GOP candidates during the primaries) was feigning concern over Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with the Russian lawyer, but mention Hillary Clinton, and boom the interview with MSNBC is suddenly over.Watch:
