It looks as though Ted Cruz is really proud of himself for everything he believes he is doing for the nation as he is running for president.
On Monday, he sent out a campaign email explaining all the sacrifices he s making as he s on the campaign trail.
He said, The sacrifices for our campaign are steep, but I m proud to be making them on your behalf.
Then he goes on to list the sacrifices:Now, I don t know about you, but I needed a barf bag to get through his list of sacrifices.
Someone else who was not at all impressed with Cruz s complaints about life for the good of his campaign is Senator Elizabeth Warren from the great state of Massachusetts.
She saw his list of sacrifices and took to Twitter faster than a locomotive to let him know a thing or two about real sacrifice.Yesterday @TedCruz sent a campaign email whining about the significant sacrifice he s made to run for President.

@TedCruz whined about facing constant attacks, nonexistent family time, limited health and sleep, and no personal time.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 19, 2016She even said boo hoo that s when I stood up at my computer and applauded.Are you kidding me, @TedCruz?
We re supposed to pity you because trying to be the leader of the free world is hard?!
2 words: Boo hoo.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 19, 2016Then she goes through his sacrifices one by one and absolutely tears each and every one of them apart with true examples of sacrifice.Know whose health is limited?
Workers w/ no paid leave who can't stay home when sick or caring for kids.
@TedCruz won't support it.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 19, 2016Know whose sleep is limited?
Working parents who stay up worrying about getting kids thru college w/o big debt.
@TedCruz blocked #refi.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 19, 2016Know who gets no personal time?
People who work 2 min wage jobs to support their families.
@TedCruz opposes giving them a raise.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 19, 2016Know who gets no family time, @TedCruz?
Moms w/ unfair schedules who drop kids at daycare & find their hrs cancelled.
@GOP won't help.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 19, 2016Know who s facing "constant attacks," @TedCruz?
Hardworking American immigrants, Muslims, LGBT folks, women.
Your constant attacks.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 19, 2016And @TedCruz?
Working people work more, get paid less, can't save, get mistreated, struggle with illness & family but they don't whine.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 19, 2016They don't throw tantrums or try to shut down their workplace because they don't get their way & then turn around & demand promotions.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 19, 2016Oh, but she wasn t done yet Now she drives it home!You chose to run for President, @TedCruz.
You chose to make your sacrifices.
Working people don't have a choice.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 19, 2016Hey @TedCruz: Maybe you should spend less time complaining about your "significant sacrifices" & more time doing something about theirs.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) April 19, 2016YES!
YES!
YES!
A thousand million kajillion times YES!
Senator Warren, thank you for telling it like it is.
Bravo!
