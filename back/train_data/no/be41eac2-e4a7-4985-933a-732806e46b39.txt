geneva ( reuters ) - fighting and air strikes have intensified in the yemeni capital of sanaa , where roads are blocked and tanks are deployed on many streets , trapping civilians and halting delivery of vital aid including fuel to supply clean water , the united nations said on monday .
some of the fiercest clashes are around the diplomatic area near the u.n. compound , while aid flights in and out of sanaa airport have been suspended , the world body said in a statement following its appeal for a humanitarian pause on tuesday .
the escalating situation threatens to push the barely functioning basic services ... to a standstill .
these services have already been seriously compromised with the latest shock of the impact of the blockade , it said , adding that fighting had also spread to other governorates , such as hajjah .
