venues in new jersey , new york and pennsylvania and now california have all canceled their kathy griffin celebrity run-in shows .
the community arts theater in williamsport , pennsylvania , posted on its website that the show had been dropped due to the recent controversy surrounding kathy griffin and the concern for the safety and security of our patrons and staff .
earlier this week , cnn said griffin would no longer co-host its live new year s eve special from times square and another show was canceled at a new mexico casino .
an endorsement deal with squatty potty also ended.tmz reported that 11-yr old barron trump saw the decapitated , bloodied head of his father while watching tv .
that didn t stop the selfish liberal kathy griffin from attempting to make herself out to be a victim during her press conference where she made a desperate attempt to save her career .
it was revealed yesterday that she admitted in december 2016 that she desired to harm both 11-year old barron trump and his father , president donald trump : it s a question a lot of comedians are asking themselves lately : what should comedy look like during the trump presidency ?
now more than ever we must absolutely go for all the absurdities , kathy griffin told vulture at the equality now gala tuesday night .
for me , that s trump and all things trump .
it s not about trying to be an equal-opportunity offender anymore because hillary got such a beat down .
it s his turn .
so i m happy to deliver beat down to donald trump and also to barron .
you know a lot of comics are going to go hard for donald , my edge is that i ll go direct for barron .
i m going to get in ahead of the game .
