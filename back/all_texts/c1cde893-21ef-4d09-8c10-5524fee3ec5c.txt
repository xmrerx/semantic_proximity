The truth about the air strike on Syria.SHARE: https://t.co/ABMiasgK6D pic.twitter.com/eoEjPeb5w7 Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) April 8, 2017Watson argues that half of Trumps advisors are CFR globalists and that he has NOT yet drained the swamp.Watson also claims the airbase that was bombed was actually protected a nearby Christian town from being overrun by jihadists.
He claims that that town will now be taken over by jihadists, and that the air strike on the air base only cleared the way from them to move in and take over.Watson also questions why Assad would have used chemicals to attack his own people when it would be completely self-defeating?
Less than one week ago, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said a regime change in Syria was off the table .
Now Tillerson is saying regime change is back on the table.
Why would Assad put himself in this position he asks?
Watson believes there is a real chance that Trump has been surrounded and manipulated by neocons in the deep state .
