WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S. presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called the shooting in Orlando, Florida, “an act of terror” that requires the nation to “redouble” efforts to stop similar attacks.
“To the LGBT community: please know that you have millions of allies across our country.
I am one of them,” Clinton said in a statement on Sunday.
