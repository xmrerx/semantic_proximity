brussels ( reuters ) - a belgian judge will decide on the exercising of a european arrest warrant for ousted catalan leader carles puigdemont on dec. 14 , his lawyers said on monday .
puigdemont and four of his ministers left spain after his regional government was sacked by madrid for unilaterally declaring catalonia independent following a referendum on secession that court authorities in madrid had ruled was illegal .
they face an arrest warrant from spain with charges of rebellion and sedition .
paul bekaert , one of puigdemont s lawyers , said a decision on the execution of the arrest warrant would be made on dec. 14 .
a brussels court last month spared puigdemont custody but ruled he could not leave belgium without a judge s consent .
