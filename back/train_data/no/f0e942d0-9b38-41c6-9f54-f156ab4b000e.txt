because what s funnier than tying up the lines for parents who ve lost children to violent crimes by someone who entered our country illegally ?
kate steinle s parents are probably not laughing.the centrepiece is a new hotline that victims can call for support and assistance .
it was set up under the authority of an executive order on immigration from president trump in january.people began making clear exactly what people should not be using the line for.but others noted the hotline was launched on alien day ( a yearly promotional day backed by the alien film franchise s producers ) .and soon , people inevitably said they were beginning to call the hotline to report criminal alien activity of a different kind than that envisioned by homeland security secretary john kelly.he said at the launch of voice on wednesday that the victims were unique , and too often ignored .
they are casualties of crimes that should never have taken place , he said .
because the people who victimised them often times should not have been in the country in the first place .
it s unclear how many people actually placed calls to the hotline , and several twitter users reported long wait times to get through .
but the us immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) agency suggested it had impacted their service .
there are certainly more constructive ways to make one s opinions heard than to prevent legitimate victims of crime from receiving the information and resources they seek because the lines are tied up by hoax callers , a spokesperson told buzzfeed news .
