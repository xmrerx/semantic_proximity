Fox News blowhard Bill O Reilly really doesn t want the future to give us a President Bernie Sanders.
That s no surprise; after all, O Reilly is obviously as far right as Sanders is left.
However, O Reilly has taken his fear of another left-winger as president to a whole other level.
In fact, he says that if Sanders gets in, he ll move to Ireland.On a recent edition of the O Reilly Factor, the bloviating talking head said that things would be even worse than they are under President Obama, because Sanders would take all of Obama s policies and amp them up.
He says that Sanders would dismantle current social programs, specifically Obamacare in the sense that it would be Berniecare and it would be much more than it is now.
That s when he said he ll be leaving the United States if forced to live under such rule.
And you know, look, I m fleeing.
If Bernie Sanders gets elected president, I m fleeing.
I m going to Ireland.
And they already know it.
I shouldn t say it publicly because that will get Sanders more votes.
But I m not going to pay 90 percent of my income to that guy.
I m sorry.
I m not doing it.
Well, I got news for ya, Bill-O.
Look at the clown car that makes up your side of the aisle.
It s gonna be either Bernie or Hillary for the next eight years, if the good people of this nation have any sense at all.
So, you better be packing your bags and getting your affairs in order.
Go ahead, leave.
