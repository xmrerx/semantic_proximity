UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United Nations Security Council will meet at 3 p.m. EDT (1900 GMT) on Friday on the latest North Korea missile test, diplomats said, at the request of the United States and Japan.
North Korea fired a missile that flew over Japan s northern Hokkaido far out into the Pacific Ocean on Friday, South Korean and Japanese officials said, further ratcheting up tensions after Pyongyang s recent test of its most powerful nuclear bomb.
The 15-member Security Council unanimously stepped up sanctions against North Korea on Monday over its Sept. 3 nuclear test, imposing a ban on the country s textile exports and capping imports of crude oil.
It was the ninth U.N. sanctions resolution adopted on North Korea since 2006.
