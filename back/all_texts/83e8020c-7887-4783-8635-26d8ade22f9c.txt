21st Century Wire says Our weekly documentary film, curated by our editorial team at 21WIRE.This film documents a series of early scandals and state corruption surrounding Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton.
The film came under heavy criticism in the US media at the time, with Democratic Party officials and mainstream media labelling it as a partisan hit piece.
While Clinton proponents and critics of this film maintain that it s part of a vast right-wing conspiracy, this film produced by Citizens for Honest Government does cover actual events which took place in and around Arkansas during the Clinton s reign as Governor there, and contains numerous facts and revelations regarding those events including a massive cocaine smuggling operation into Mena, Arkansas under the watch of the Clinton governorship.
