( reuters ) - republican donald trump trails democrat hillary clinton by 10 points in the 2016 presidential campaign , according to a poll released on tuesday , showing little change from a week ago and suggesting his comments about a mexican-american judge had yet to affect his standing in the race .
the latest reuters/ipsos poll came after several days in which trump faced sharp criticism over his insistence that a federal judge who was born in indiana to mexican parents was biased in a case involving the celebrity billionaire .
but the fallout from trump ’ s comments appeared to have done little to help clinton build her lead over the presumptive republican nominee .
the online survey showed that 44.3 percent of likely voters said they would vote for clinton , compared with 34.7 percent who would support trump .
a further 20.9 percent said they would not vote for either candidate .
the results were little changed from last week ’ s survey .
the poll was conducted from friday to tuesday , starting shortly after trump ’ s first comments about u.s. district judge gonzalo curiel , who is overseeing fraud lawsuits against trump university , the new york businessman ’ s defunct real estate school .
trump has suggested that curiel ’ s heritage is influencing the judge ’ s opinion about the case because of trump ’ s campaign rhetoric about illegal immigration .
u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan called trump ’ s comments textbook racism on tuesday , while senate republican leader mitch mcconnell said trump should stop attacking minority groups .
bowing to pressure from fellow republicans , trump said on tuesday he would no longer talk about the judge , adding that his previous remarks about curiel had been misconstrued .
other events , including news that clinton had secured enough delegates and superdelegates to become the first female presidential candidate of a major u.s. political party , occurred toward the end of the poll .
the poll included 1,261 respondents and had a credibility interval of 3.2 percentage points .

[ polling.reuters.com/ # poll/tm651y15_13/filters/likely:1/dates/20160401-20160607/type/day ] for most of the year , clinton has maintained an edge over trump in the reuters/ipsos poll of likely voters .
that edge briefly disappeared in may after trump ’ s remaining rivals for the republican nomination dropped out and party leaders started to line up behind his campaign .
trump ’ s level of support has since eroded as he sparred with his party ’ s leadership and continued to be dogged with questions about trump university .
the reuters/ipsos poll differs from others that are often days removed from when their data was collected .
as a result , the reuters/ipsos poll often detects shifts in opinion well ahead of other surveys .
