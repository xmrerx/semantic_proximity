ankara ( reuters ) - turkish president tayyip erdogan said on friday that the death of hundreds of rohingya in myanmar over the past week constituted a genocide aimed at muslim communities in the region .
nearly 400 people have died in fighting that has rocked myanmar s northwest for a week , new official data showed , making it probably the deadliest bout of violence to engulf the country s rohingya muslim minority in decades .
there is a genocide there .
they remain silent towards this ... all those looking away from this genocide carried out under the veil of democracy are also part of this massacre , erdogan said at his ruling ak party s eid al-adha celebrations in istanbul .
the army says it is conducting clearance operations against extremist terrorists to protect civilians .
erdogan , with his roots in political islam , has long strived to take a position of leadership among the world s muslim community .
he said it was turkey s moral responsibility to take a stand against the events in myanmar .
around 38,000 rohingya have crossed into bangladesh from myanmar , united nations sources said , a week after rohingya insurgents attacked police posts and an army base in rakhine state , prompting clashes and a military counteroffensive .
erdogan said the issue would be discussed in detail when world leaders convene for the united nations general assembly on sept. 12 in new york .
