bangkok ( reuters ) - roadside bombs planted by suspected muslim insurgents in southern thailand killed one soldier on thursday and wounded 20 other people , most of them soldiers and police , security forces said .
the blasts occurred in yala , one of the predominantly ethnic , malay muslim provinces in the deep south where a separatist insurgency has dragged on for decades , with more than 6,500 people killed since 2004 alone .
the first bomb did not result in any casualties , but the other two killed one soldier and wounded 18 soldiers and police and two villagers .
it is believed to be the work of violent groups already creating incidents in the area , pramote prom-in , a spokesman for regional security forces , told reuters .
as with most violence in thailand s deep south , there was no claim of responsibility .
the insurgents are fighting for secession from mostly buddhist thailand .
until they were annexed in 1909 , thailand s three southernmost provinces of pattani , yala and narathiwat were part of an independent malay muslim sultanate .
