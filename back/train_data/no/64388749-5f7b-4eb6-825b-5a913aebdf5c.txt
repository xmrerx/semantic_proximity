senator john mccain took another swipe at president trump .
he claimed that american leadership was stronger under obama .
the senator has been attacking trump non-stop making people wonder what in the world is wrong with him .
president trump has only been in office 5 months ! the hill had this to say about mccain s feelings on trump s leadership : sen. john mccain ( r-ariz. ) said american leadership was stronger under president trump s predecessor , president barack obama , according to a guardian report published sunday.asked if the country stood on sturdier ground under obama s leadership , mccain said yes , according to the report .
as far as american leadership is concerned , yes , said mccain , who also vocally criticized many of the obama administration s foreign policy decisions.mccain also lost to obama when he ran as the gop nominee in the 2008 presidential election.he recently fumbled in questioning former fbi director james comey leaving people to question his mental fitness for the senate : memes like the one below have started to pop up on social media : mccain has become more and more of an obstructionist when it comes to trump s policies .
is this mccain s true colors coming out or a case of his mental ability to reason diminishing ?
we think it s a little of both time to go !
