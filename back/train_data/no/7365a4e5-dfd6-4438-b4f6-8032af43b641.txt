washington ( reuters ) - president donald trump said on tuesday that the united states will take care of the north korea issue after its latest missile launch , and that the basic u.s. approach to dealing with pyongyang will not change .
trump has tightened sanctions on north korea and pressured china to do more to help rein in pyongyang s ballistic missile and nuclear ambitions .
north korea fired what the u.s. pentagon said appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile ( icbm ) that landed close to japan on wednesday .
trump said the missile launch did not change what he called the very serious u.s. approach , a week after he put north korea back on a u.s. list of countries that washington says support terrorism .
i will only tell you that we will take care of it ...
it is a situation that we will handle , trump told reporters during a meeting with republican congressional leaders at the white house .
u.s. defense secretary james mattis , who was also at the meeting , said the icbm launch was a higher trajectory than any test conducted thus far by north korea and called it part of a research and development effort .
it went higher frankly than any previous shots they have taken , mattis said .
he said south korea retaliated by firing some pinpoint missiles into the water to show north korea that the u.s. ally would not be rattled by pyongyang s launch .
north korea has said its weapons program is a necessary defense against u.s. plans to invade .
the united states , which has 28,500 troops in south korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 korean war , denies any such intention .
