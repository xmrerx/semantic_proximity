ankara ( reuters ) - a turkish court remanded amnesty international s local board chairman in custody on thursday , amnesty turkey said , hours after its local director was released by a separate court .
the group s chairman , taner kilic , has been in prison since june in the coastal province of izmir on terrorism charges .
prosecutors say he downloaded bylock , a messaging application used by supporters of fethullah gulen , the u.s.-based cleric turkey says was behind a failed coup last year .
on wednesday an istanbul court ordered the release on bail of eight human rights activists , including the director of the local branch of amnesty international , pending a verdict in their trial on terrorism charges .
the izmir court merged kilic s case with that of the rights activists in istanbul .
the next hearing for all 11 defendants will be held on nov. 22 .
over the last 24 hours we have seen the twin hands of turkey s fickle justice system at play .
while one grants liberty , the other , confronted with no less baseless charges , takes it away , said salil shetty , amnesty international s secretary general .
the release ... late last night restored some faith in turkey s justice system .
today , that faith has been washed away .
separately , prominent activist and businessman osman kavala s detention period has been extended for another seven days , one of lawyers representing him told reuters .
kavala , who took part in several civil initiatives for the protection of human rights and resolutions of the kurdish issues in turkey , was initially detained at istanbul s ataturk airport last week , as part of a secret investigation which drew reaction from ankara s western allies .
turkish president tayyip erdogan has said kavala was behind the gezi uprising , a referral to the 2013 mass protests against erdogan s rule .
