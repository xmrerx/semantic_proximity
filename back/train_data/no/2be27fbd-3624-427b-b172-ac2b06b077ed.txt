bangkok ( reuters ) - a roadside bomb planted by suspected muslim insurgents killed four army rangers and wounded six , including a civilian , in southern thailand on friday , a security official said .
a decades old-separatist insurgency in predominantly buddhist thailand s largely muslim provinces of yala , pattani , and narathiwat has killed more than 6,500 people since 2004 .
the bomb was planted under a road that was being built in pattani , the security official said .
the group that planted the bomb is using old techniques in order to create instability in the region .
they planted the bomb under a road currently under construction , said pramote prom-in , a spokesman for security forces in the region .
friday s blast followed roadside bombs last week that killed two soldiers and wounded more than 20 people in yala .
there was no claim of responsibility for the blast , which is usually the case in thailand s deep south , where insurgents are fighting for secession .
thailand s three southernmost provinces were part of an independent malay muslim sultanate until they were annexed in 1909 .
