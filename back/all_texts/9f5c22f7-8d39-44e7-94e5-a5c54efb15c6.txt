The Clinton Carpetbaggers have moved around doing their influence peddling where the money is they landed in Chappaqua, NY and have managed to make their home into a fortress complete with a huge wall, guards and now a private street.
Seems like traffic is for the little people NEW CASTLE The road where Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, lives in Chappaqua has been made a local-traffic-only street for security reasons and to reduce tourists from flocking to the cul-de-sac.The Town Board this week voted to add Old House Lane to the list of such roads.
Hillary and Bill Clinton have lived on the road for more than 15 years, moving there when she ran for a U.S. Senate seat.Chappaqua is a hamlet within New Castle.
The Town Board also added one other road, Green Lane, to those restricted to local traffic only.
It s a short cul-de-sac that runs parallel to Old House Lane.At Tuesday s board meeting, Town Administrator Jill Shapiro said the police chief had received a request for security reasons.Town Supervisor Robert Greenstein said Friday he was not positive, but assumed the request came from the Secret Service.
I think it s for security reasons and also for privacy concerns for the residents certainly living there as well, Greenstein said.
He said the little cul-de-sac can be turned into a very busy street.
