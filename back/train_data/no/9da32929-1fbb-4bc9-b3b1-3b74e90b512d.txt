dera ismail khan , pakistan ( reuters ) - a suspected u.s. drone strike on thursday targeted a hideout of the haqqani militant network along pakistan s mountainous border with afghanistan , killing four people , officials said .
if confirmed , it would be the fourth such u.s. strike inside pakistan since president donald trump took office in january .
two pakistani intelligence officials and a local government officer said an unmanned aerial vehicle dropped two missiles on a compound housing militants under the command of a senior network commander , abdur rasheed haqqani .
villagers initially reported a blast in the upper kurram area to authorities , said one of the officials , adding , we got it from our informant later that it was a u.s. drone strike that targeted haqqanis .
it was not clear if the commander was among those killed , added the officials , who sought anonymity as the issue is a sensitive one .
trump s new strategy for the afghanistan war calls for a tougher stance with pakistan against militants such as the haqqani network who have bases inside pakistan .
since the afghan policy review , the u.s. has been pushing islamabad for decisive action against the haqqani network militants , who are notorious for using pakistani soil to launch attacks against american-led nato troops in afghanistan .
islamabad denies the allegations , and , instead , blames kabul for not taking out militants who use afghan territory as a base for attacks on targets in pakistan .
pakistan has been facing a deadly islamist militancy for more than a decade .
gunmen attacked a minority shi ite muslim mosque in islamabad , the capital , on wednesday , killing two people .
lashkar-e-jhangvi al-alami , a sunni sectarian group linked with militant group islamic state , claimed responsibility for the mosque attack .
