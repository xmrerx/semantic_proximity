the notion that millennials are stupid , spoiled , uninformed voters who only care about themselves was shredded today after a new poll from the harvard institute of politics showed millennial voters would overwhelmingly back hillary clinton in a general election matchup with donald trump.collecting responses from over three thousand 18-29 year old voters showed democratic front-runner hillary clinton would garner 60 percent to trump s 25 percent , an astonishing 36 point lead , while 14 percent remain undecided.so , in other words , the selfish , uninformed , spoiled millennials wouldn t back the actual selfish , spoiled , uninformed republican front-runner .
go figure.not only do millenials overall have a highly unfavorable view of trump overall , he isn t all that popular amongst young republicans , either .
his bombastic , hateful nature has rubbed some young republicans the wrong way : overall , 60 percent of millennials want to see a democrat occupy the white house in 2017 , up five points from last year , while 40 percent want a republican .
it seems even republicans aren t so keen on having a racist , sexist , bombastic blowhard being their commander-in-chief .
when it comes to sheer image , trump s favorability is negative 57 percent ( 17 percent favorable , 74 percent unfavorable ) .according to politico : harvard iop polling director john della volpe told reporters monday that trump is playing a similar role in helping the democratic nominee as former president george w. bush did during barack obama s 2008 campaign .
i don t think there s a question about that , he said , and there s a lot of evidence that suggests that that s the case .
the day has come when donald trump is more hated than george w. bush .
democrats didn t even have to do anything .
congratulations , gop , you built that.featured image via justin sullivan/getty images
