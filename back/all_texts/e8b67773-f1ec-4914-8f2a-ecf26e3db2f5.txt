GETTING RICH OFF OF THE MISERY OF OTHERS VERY DISTASTEFUL!To commemorate the 10th anniversary of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, Petra Nemcova, a Czech model who survived the disaster by clinging to a palm tree, decided to pull out all the stops for the annual fund-raiser of her school-building charity, the Happy Hearts Fund.She booked Cipriani 42nd Street, which greeted guests with Bellini cocktails on silver trays.
She flew in Sheryl Crow with her band and crew for a 20-minute set.
She special-ordered heart-shaped floral centerpieces, heart-shaped chocolate parfaits, heart-shaped tiramis and, because orange is the charity s color, an orange carpet rather than a red one.
She imported a Swiss auctioneer and handed out orange rulers to serve as auction paddles, playfully threatening to use hers to spank the highest bidder for an Ibiza vacation.The gala cost $363,413.
But the real splurge?
Bill Clinton.The former president of the United States agreed to accept a lifetime achievement award at the June 2014 event after Ms. Nemcova offered a $500,000 contribution to the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation.
The donation, made late last year after the foundation sent the charity an invoice, amounted to almost a quarter of the evening s net proceeds enough to build 10 preschools in Indonesia.Read more: NYT
