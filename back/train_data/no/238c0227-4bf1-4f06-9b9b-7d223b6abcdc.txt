united nations ( reuters ) - the united states on friday told the u.n. security council that it intends to call a meeting on monday to vote on a draft resolution establishing additional sanctions on north korea for its missile and nuclear program , the u.s. mission to the united nations said in a statement .
the united states wants the security council to impose an oil embargo on north korea , ban its exports of textiles and the hiring of north korean laborers abroad , and to subject leader kim jong un to an asset freeze and travel ban , according to a draft resolution seen by reuters on wednesday .
it was not immediately clear how north korean ally china and russia would vote , but a senior u.s. official on friday night expressed skepticism that either nation would accept anything more stringent than a ban on imports of north korean textiles .
chinese officials have privately expressed fears that imposing an oil embargo could risk triggering massive instability in its neighbor .
a security council resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by permanent members britain , the united states , france , russia or china to pass .
tension on the korean peninsula has escalated as the north has stepped up the development of weapons , testing a string of missiles this year , including one flying over japan , and conducting its sixth nuclear test on sunday .
south korea braced for a possible further missile test by north korea when it marks its founding anniversary on saturday .
experts believe the isolated regime is close to its goal of developing a powerful nuclear weapon capable of reaching the united states , something president donald trump has vowed to prevent .
