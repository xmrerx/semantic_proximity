SEOUL (Reuters) - China should play a key and proper role in response to North Korea’s fourth nuclear test as a permanent member of the UN Security Council, South Korean President Park Geun-hye said on Wednesday.
There is still a possibility of further North Korean provocations, including “cyber terrorism” following the isolated country’s fourth nuclear test on January 6, Park told an annual news conference.
