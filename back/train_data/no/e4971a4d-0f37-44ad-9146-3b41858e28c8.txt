bogota ( reuters ) - former marxist farc rebels who have chosen to join drug trafficking gangs instead of demobilizing will face the full power of colombia s military , president juan manuel santos said on thursday , amid worries gangs will stymie security gains .
more than 11,000 fighters and collaborators from the revolutionary armed forces of colombia ( farc ) handed over their weapons this year as part of a peace accord with the government to end more than five decades of war .
the group has kept its initials in its reincarnation as a political party .
but the country s ombudsman says some 800 former guerrillas did not demobilize , a figure in keeping with estimates of security sources and think tanks who put the number of dissident ex-farc members as ranging between 700 and 1,000 .
farc leaders have renounced the dissidents and emphasized that the group will move forward as a peaceful political party .
we re going to throw everything at these dissidents , santos told journalists .
there will be no hesitation .
santos said the number of dissidents is below the 15 percent of fighters that he said usually refuse to demobilize when rebel groups lay down their arms after peace deals .
human rights groups and analysts have expressed worries that a lack of state presence in territory formerly occupied by the farc is allowing the smaller national liberation army ( eln ) guerrilla group and criminal gangs to battle for control of lucrative coca crops and illegal mining sites .
amnesty international said in a report on thursday that despite a reduction in civilian deaths , the conflict rages on in several parts of the country because of the presence of the gangs and the eln .
