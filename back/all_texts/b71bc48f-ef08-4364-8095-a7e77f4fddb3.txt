Donald Trump really should have taken his staffers advise and not tweeted about former national security adviser Michael Flynn because the former reality show star just implicated himself.
I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI, Trump tweeted.
He has pled guilty to those lies.
It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful.
There was nothing to hide!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 2, 2017 Oh my god, he just admitted to obstruction of justice, former Justice Department spokesman Matthew Miller tweeted.
If Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI when he asked Comey to let it go, then there is your case.

There is not a legal issue but rather a trust issue, he said at the time.After Flynn left, Trump defended him, calling the disgraced former national security adviser a wonderful man.
I think he s been treated very, very unfairly by the media as I call it, the fake media, in many cases, Trump said in February.
I think it s really a sad thing he was treated so badly.
When Flynn resigned, he apologized for giving an inaccurate assessment of his conversation with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak to Mike Pence, who, at the time, was the vice-president elect.Pence then said that Flynn had not discussed sanctions with Kislyak.The day after Flynn resigned, Trump, according to then-FBI Director James Comey, asked him to let go of an investigation into Flynn.Trump admitted that he knew Flynn lied to the FBI, then he asked Comey to drop the investigation.
