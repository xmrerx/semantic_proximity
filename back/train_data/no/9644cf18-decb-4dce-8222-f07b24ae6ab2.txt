doha ( reuters ) - qatar s emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani said on tuesday that arab states that had imposed sanctions on his country in june over allegations of supporting terrorism were not interested in a solution to the crisis .
speaking to members of the gulf arab state s shoura council , tamim said his government was preparing for elections to the consultative body .
the necessary legislation would be ready in 2018 .
saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , egypt and bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with qatar on june 5 , accusing doha of financing terrorism and cozying up to their arch-rival iran .
qatar denies the charges .
we express our readiness for a compromise within the framework of a dialogue based on mutual respect for sovereignty and common obligations , but on the other hand we recognize that the indicators that come from the blockade states show they do not want to reach a solution , tamim said .
the four countries have put pressure and published rumors and fabrications against qatar hosting the world cup in 2022 .
tamim , who assumed office in 2013 after his father stepped down , also said his government was currently working on the instruments needed for elections , which he said would be ready in 2018 .
plans for elections to the 45-member body originally envisaged for 2013 were never carried out .
in his speech , tamim also said his government was focusing on completing strategic projects to help the country cope with the sanctions imposed by its neighbors , including ports , water and food security , and to encourage investments .
