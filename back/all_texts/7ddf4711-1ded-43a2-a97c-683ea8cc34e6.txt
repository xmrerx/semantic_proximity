FOX News reporter Mike Tobin interviewed former New Black Panther leader Malik Shabazz who promised violence on the Republican National Convention: Malik Shabazz: From what I know many of the groups on the left, mainly the white left, and others, I know for a fact that there s going to be the blocking of highways and there s going to be arrests and there s going to be some things.
I hear, that s going to go on next week.
It s highly likely there s going to be arrests, there s going to be tear gas.
It s going to be happening.
This is the same man who called police officers occupiers !
