milan ( reuters ) - the remains of victor emmanuel iii , who reigned as italy s king through two world wars and died in exile in 1947 , were flown back from egypt on sunday for reburial at a family mausoleum near turin .
the remains of his wife , queen elena , also returned to italy on friday for reburial with those of the king at the sanctuary of vicoforte , near the piedmont town of cuneo , a spokesman for the sanctuary said .
elena died in 1959 and her remains had lain in montpelier in france .
victor emmanuel iii s 46-year reign , which started in 1900 after the assassination of his father umberto i , encompassed the period of fascist rule in italy under dictator benito mussolini .
he drew criticism for failing to prevent mussolini s seizure of power in 1922 and for fleeing rome in 1944 to avoid an invading german army .
the monarch - known as sciaboletta , or small sabre , due to his stature - abdicated the throne in 1946 in favor of his son umberto ii in a vain effort to avert a plebiscite to decide whether italy should remain a monarchy or become a republic .
after italians voted for a republic , victor emmanuel went into exile in alexandria , egypt , where he died the following year .
italy s post-war constitution barred male descendants of the royal house of savoy from setting foot in italy because of the family s support for mussolini .
the ban was lifted in 2002 .
the grandson of umberto ii , emanuele filiberto , told the italian press recently that he believed the right place for the remains of former italian kings was the pantheon in rome .
