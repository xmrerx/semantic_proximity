Because NYC Firefighters don t have enough to worry about.
They now have to worry about how to properly identify and address their victims based on sexual preference?It must to be a crime to waste these brave men and women s time with this insanity Firefighters and medics will take their first Trans 101 course on Tuesday, learning the correct way to interact with transgender people and even getting a lesson in what LGTBQI actually stands for, a city official said.
(It stands for lesbian gay trans bisexual queer/questioning and intersex.
)The two-hour sensitivity training was launched in March by the city Commission for Human Rights after Mayor de Blasio signed an executive order allowing people to use any public bathroom or locker room they identified with, regardless of their sexual anatomy.The training at FDNY headquarters in Downtown Brooklyn will go over correct terminology and even how to ask for a person s preferred pronoun.
People need to learn to not be afraid to ask someone who is transitioning genders what their pronoun is, said a Commission for Human Rights spokesman.
Employees of city pools have also begun training in time for Wednesday s opening of the summer swim season, where gender sensitivity issues are more likely to arise in locker rooms and bathrooms.
It s especially important for Parks employees [to take the training] because they work in a place that involves changing clothes, a commission spokesman said.So far, 65 city pool employees have taken the class and 200 more are scheduled to take it in the coming weeks, according to Sam Biederman, a Parks Department spokesman.
