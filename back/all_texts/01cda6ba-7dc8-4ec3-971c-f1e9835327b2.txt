BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s president said on Saturday anything Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri has said or may say does not reflect reality due to the mystery of his situation since he quit in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia last week.
Hariri resigned unexpectedly from Saudi Arabia on Nov. 4 and has not since returned to Lebanon.
President Michel Aoun said in a statement from his office that any stance or move by Hariri is the result of the dubious and mysterious situation that he is living in the kingdom.
