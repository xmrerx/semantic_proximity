wow !
open threats that government will kill the president had to be clarified by jake tapper .
but please listen to this unhinged commentator on cnn and tell us the deep state doesn t exist : i found the actual for video you guys decide if this is okay or not .
change agents=threats .
words like this on national tv is not right .
pic.twitter.com/dqkksw47ef bobby axelrod ( @ sirbobbyaxelrod ) august 10 , 2017these cnn commentators were discussing the fact that putin fired embassy employees in russia .
we reported ( see video below ) that president trump said it s fine that putin fired the employees because it saves the u.s. money .
these loose cannons went ballistic and said that government will kill him .
even if it s not literally to kill , it s still a very threatening message !
the entire commentary is disturbing ! here s what the panel was referring to : this is priceless !
president trump just gave the best response ever to a reporter s question !
he said he wanted to thank russian president vladimir putin for reducing his payroll by firing u.s. embassy staff in moscow .
hysterical and so quick !
watch how trump doesn t skip a beat with his response : after sanctions on russia were put in place in july , putin ordered 755 embassy personnel out of russia.president trump was asked today during a press conference what he thought of the firing .
his response was quick and decisive .
he said he wanted to thank putin for the firing : no .
i want to thank him , because we re trying to cut down on payroll .
and as far as i m concerned , i m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll .
he continued : there s no real reason for them to go back .
so i greatly appreciate the fact that they have been able to cut our payroll for the united states .
we ll save a lot of money .
the truth is that the cnn panel knows nothing !
the truth is that most of these employees are russian ! source : bbc
