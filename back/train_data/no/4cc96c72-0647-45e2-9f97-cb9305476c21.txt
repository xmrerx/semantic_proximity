danang , vietnam ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump would want republican senate candidate roy moore to step aside if sexual misconduct allegations against him are true , white house press secretary sarah sanders said on friday .
a woman has accused roy moore , the republican nominee for the u.s. senate in alabama , of initiating a sexual encounter with her when she was 14 years old and he was 32 , the washington post reported on thursday .
moore , 70 , the state ’ s former chief judge , vehemently denied the allegations , calling them “ completely false and a desperate political attack. ” “ like most americans , the president believes we can not allow a mere allegation , in this case one from many years ago , to destroy a person ’ s life , ” sanders said .
“ however , the president also believes that if these allegations are true , judge moore will do the right thing and step aside , ” she said , as trump arrived in vietnam on his 12-day asia tour .
