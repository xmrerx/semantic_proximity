naypyitaw ( reuters ) - pope francis said on tuesday that myanmar is suffering from civil conflict and hostilities that have lasted all too long and created deep divisions , but in a speech in the country s capital he did not refer to the minority rohingya muslims .
the arduous process of peacebuilding and national reconciliation can only advance through a commitment to justice and respect for human rights , he said , speaking after myanmar leader aung san suu kyi had made an address .
religious differences need not be a source of division and distrust , but rather a force for unity , forgiveness , tolerance and wise nationbuilding , the pope added .
the pope s visit to myanmar comes after an exodus of more than 620,000 rohingya from rakhine state to the southern tip of bangladesh following a military crackdown that the united states last week branded ethnic cleansing .
his trip is so delicate that some papal advisers warned him against even saying the word rohingya , lest he set off a diplomatic incident that could turn the country s military and government against minority christians .
myanmar does not recognize the rohingya as citizens nor as members of a distinct ethnic group with their own identity , and it rejects the term rohingya and its use .
pope francis did not use the word in his speech .
