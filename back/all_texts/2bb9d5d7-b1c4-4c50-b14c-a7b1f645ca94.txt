Ah, The Simpsons, the hilarious animated show that s been on television for nearly 30 years now, and is a staple of American comedy.
They ve never been afraid to tackle controversial and volatile issues within the context of the show, and that includes the 2016 presidential election.
And why not?
We have Donald Trump this year.
He s walking cannon fodder.This video deals with the importance of the 3 a.m. phone call at the White House that means the world s about to end, and looks at how both Hillary and Trump would handle it.
They lampoon Hillary here, too, but that s all they do.
However, they tear into, and destroy, any and all illusions that anybody may have that Trump would actually make, well, any kind of a president at all.The spoof asks the viewer to consider who they want to vote for based on how each candidate reacts to that crucial 3 a.m. phone call.
Watch it below, and remember that guffawing at Trump is perfectly okay.Trump likes to pawn an awful lot off onto other people.
Who would he pawn that 3 a.m. phone call off onto while he went back to sleep in the gold-plated bed he ll no doubt have brought into the Lincoln Bedroom following his triumph over Hillary?
In the end, though, what this spoof does is put Trump s (ahem) leadership capabilities under a very uncomfortable microscope, as well it should.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
