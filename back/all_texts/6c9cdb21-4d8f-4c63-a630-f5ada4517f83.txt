After this past Monday s Iowa Caucus where the results on the Democratic side were in a statistical dead heat, many were left wondering how Bernie Sanders couldn t seal the deal and left Hillary Clinton to walk away with the victory.
Well, Saturday Night Live has filled in the gaps and explained what truly may have happened this past Monday in Iowa.SNL created Bern Your Enthusiasm, an obvious play on host Larry David s show Curb Your Enthusiasm.
A show that is greatly missed, but that is neither her nor there.
And on this week s episode of Bern Your Enthusiasm, it showed David as Sanders not fully committing to all his voters who presented themselves to him in precarious situations.Sanders didn t want to shake the hand of one Iowa voter because she sneezed into her hand right before she was about to greet the Senator, thus leaving her and her family just standing there angry.
Then later, as Sanders went to get coffee, because he didn t want the 2% milk his office had for him, he refused to help another one of his voters in a medical emergency.Flash forward to the Caucus results, and it shows Sanders lose by .2% which his staff estimated was about five voters.
In other words, the voters that he pissed off that day.It was the perfect hybrid of Curb Your Enthusiasm and the frustration Sanders must have felt that cold day in Iowa when he lost by just a few votes.Things might be looking up for Sanders in New Hampshire this coming Tuesday, but until then, at least this week s SNL will keep him warm with laughter as he heads back to New England from the Saturday Night Live set where he also had a cameo in another sketch.Watch here for Larry David s spot-on performance as Bernie Sanders:Video/Featured image from YouTube
