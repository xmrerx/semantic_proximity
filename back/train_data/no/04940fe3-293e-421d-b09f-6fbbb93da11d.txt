proving that they really don t want anything to do with improving relations with local law enforcement .
this hateful and divisive movement is about reparations and getting special privileges .
the oakland police department ( opd ) extended an invitation to followers of the black lives matter movement to participate in a barbecue to start a constructive dialogue between the two groups .
however , the police were met with flat-out rejection by a spokesperson who referred to law enforcement as pigs .
a bbq is definitely not going to stop this blockade , karissa lewis , a self-described radical black farmer from east oakland , told local fox affiliate ktvu .
and as a radical-black farmer from east oakland , i eat pigs , i don t eat with them , she said.according to ktvu , lewis used the mic-check call and response technique , which was popularized at many of the occupy protests , in order to rally support for her response from fellow protesters , who also rejected the offer .
ktvu notes that many of the activists , at least at this one protest , seemed to be in agreement with her about the offer .
