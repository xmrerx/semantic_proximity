At this point, every Republican who refuses to have a spine and stand up to Donald Trump s ignorance and tyranny is just as guilty of endangering the country as America s unworthy POTUS and one GOPer is letting them know it.Recently, former U.S. Rep. Bob Inglis (R-SC) trashed his fellow GOPers for being so weak and whimpering when faced with Trump s numerous scandals, particularly Russia s possible interference in the 2016 election.
Directly calling out how weak the Republican Party has been at upholding their own values and loyalty to the U.S. Constitution, Inglis stated that conservatives need to get their act together and actually start taking the Russian meddling seriously.
This is particularly noteworthy because former Director of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson says it s a fact that Russia interfered in the election.
Inglis said: The president needs to understand that this is an investigation of an attack by a hostile power at the very heart of our republic.
If he were wise, he would open up the doors and say, Let s look into it, come and see what all I ve got because we ve got to know what happened here.
While Trump has never been one to take advice from anyone (no matter how much smarter they are), Inglis suggested that the best way Trump could get on America s good side is to simply stop getting in the way of the investigation and actually cooperate for once.Pointing out a double standard in the Republican Party, Inglis stated that if it had been Hillary Clinton as POTUS and she had fired FBI Director James Comey for reopening an investigation on her email server, the GOP would be up in arms.
He said: Republicans would be howling about that, we would be talking about impeachment.
We d be talking about obstruction of justice, but as it is, we re sort of whimpering.
We re not after this thing.
We need to really be after it.
