WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The top U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee Democrat said on Wednesday he would push the panel’s Republican chairman to expand a probe of Russian hacking to include the calls to a Russian diplomat made by President Donald Trump’s former National Security Adviser.
Representative Adam Schiff said he would make his case to Republican Devin Nunes, the committee’s chairman, when he met with him later on Wednesday.
