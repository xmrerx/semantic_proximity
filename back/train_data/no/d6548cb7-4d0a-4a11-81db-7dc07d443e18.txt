har adar , west bank ( reuters ) - a palestinian man with security clearance to work at a jewish settlement in the occupied west bank opened fire at a checkpoint on tuesday , killing two israeli security guards and a paramilitary policeman .
the assailant , who was armed with a pistol and also seriously wounded a fourth israeli , was shot dead , police said .
the incident was unusual in that the 37-year-old man had been issued an israeli work permit - a process that entails security vetting - unlike most of the palestinians involved in a wave of street attacks that began two years ago .
a police spokeswoman said the gunman approached har adar among a group of palestinians who work at the settlement , and aroused the suspicion of guards at the entrance checkpoint .
challenged to halt , the palestinian opened his shirt , drew a pistol and fired at the security staff and troopers at close range , the spokeswoman said .
residents of the settlement told israeli media the man worked as a cleaner .
one of them , moish berdichev , said he had domestic problems - his wife had left him - and speculated he may have carried out the attack knowing he would not survive .
he was a guy with a good head on his shoulders .
it s a shame .
very sad , berdichev told army radio .
the shin bet internal security service identified the man as nimr jamal and said he had severe personal and family issues , including domestic violence .
the man lived in the nearby palestinian village of beit suriq , the police said .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu said in public remarks to his cabinet that the man s house would be demolished and any work permits issued to his relatives would be revoked .
