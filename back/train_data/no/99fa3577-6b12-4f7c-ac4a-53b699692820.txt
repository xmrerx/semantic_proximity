united nations ( reuters ) - more than 120 countries defied president donald trump on thursday and voted in favor of a united nations general assembly resolution calling for the united states to drop its recent recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital .
trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that voted in favor .
a total of 128 countries backed the resolution , which is non-binding , nine voted against and 35 abstained .
twenty-one countries did not cast a vote .
trump s threat appeared to have some impact , with more countries abstaining and rejecting the resolution than usually associated with palestinian-related resolutions .
nevertheless , washington found itself isolated as many of its western and arab allies voted for the measure .
some of those allies , like egypt , jordan and iraq , are major recipients of u.s. military or economic aid , although the u.s. threat to cut aid did not single out any country .
a spokesman for western-backed palestinian president mahmoud abbas called the vote a victory for palestine .
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu rejected the vote .
earlier this month , trump reversed decades of u.s. policy by announcing the united states recognized jerusalem - home to major muslim , jewish and christian holy sites - as the capital of israel and would move its embassy there .
the united states will remember this day in which it was singled out for attack in the general assembly for the very act of exercising our right as a sovereign nation , u.s .
ambassador to the united nations nikki haley told the 193-member general assembly ahead of thursday s vote .
we will remember it when we are called upon to once again make the world s largest contribution to the united nations , and so many countries come calling on us , as they so often do , to pay even more and to use our influence for their benefit , she said .
later on thursday , haley asked the 64 countries who voted no , abstained or did not cast a vote to come to a jan. 3 reception to thank you for your friendship to the united states , according to the invitation seen by reuters .
the status of jerusalem is one of the thorniest obstacles to a peace deal between israel and the palestinians , who were furious over trump s move .
the international community does not recognize israeli sovereignty over the full city .
french u.n .
ambassador francois delattre said in a statement : the resolution adopted today only confirms relevant international law provisions on jerusalem .
france voted in favor .
netanyahu described the resolution as preposterous .
jerusalem is our capital , always was , always will be .
but i do appreciate the fact that a growing number of countries refuse to participate in this theater of the absurd , he said in a video on his facebook page .
israel captured east jerusalem in a 1967 war and palestinians want it as the capital of a future state they seek .
iranian foreign minister mohammad javad zarif said in a tweet the vote was a clear international rejection of the trump administration s thuggish intimidation .
among countries that abstained were argentina , australia , canada , colombia , czech republic , hungary , mexico , philippines , poland , rwanda , south sudan and uganda .
guatemala , honduras , marshall islands , micronesia , nauru , palau and togo joined the united states and israel in voting no .
honduras vote against the motion comes after the united states signaled it would recognize president juan orlando hernandez as the winner of an election the organization of america states said should be scrapped over fraud claims .
since trump s election , mexico has aligned its foreign policy more closely with washington in what diplomats say is an attempt to curry favor in face of threats to withdraw from the nafta free trade agreement .
trump s rhetoric on cutting aid startled some u.s. allies but state department spokeswoman heather nauert said thursday s vote was just one factor that washington would take into consideration in its foreign policy .
i just wanted to reiterate what the president had said yesterday and that that was the u.n. vote is really not the only factor that the administration would take into consideration in dealing with our foreign relations and countries who have chosen to vote one way or the other , she told reporters .
according to figures from the u.s. government s aid agency usaid , in 2016 the united states provided some $ 13 billion in economic and military assistance to countries in sub-saharan africa and $ 1.6 billion to states in east asia and oceania .
it provided some $ 13 billion to countries in the middle east and north africa , $ 6.7 billion to countries in south and central asia , $ 1.5 billion to states in europe and eurasia and $ 2.2 billion to western hemisphere countries , according to usaid .
the general assembly vote was called at the request of arab and muslim countries after the united states vetoed the same resolution on monday in the 15-member u.n. security council .
the remaining 14 security council members voted in favor of the egyptian-drafted resolution , which did not specifically mention the united states or trump but which expressed deep regret at recent decisions concerning the status of jerusalem .
thursday s resolution affirms that any decisions and actions which purport to have altered the character , status or demographic composition of the holy city of jerusalem have no legal effect , are null and void and must be rescinded .
the u.n. action comes a year after the security council adopted a resolution demanding an end to israeli settlements .
that was approved with 14 votes in favor and an abstention by former u.s. president barack obama s administration , which defied heavy pressure from longtime ally israel and trump , who was then president-elect , for washington to wield its veto .
