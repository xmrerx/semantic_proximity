Democrat Senator and fake Indian Elizabeth Warren took to Twitter to criticize the evil Republican s plan to replace Obamacare.While her tweet in and of itself, is just more of what we expect from the Democrats, it s what s sitting on a side table next to her coffee maker that has everyone laughing.I'm reading the latest way that Senate Republicans plan to rip health care away from millions of people.
I'll share my thoughts soon.

Of course, any sane person who follows the biased and very fake news network CNN shouldn t be surprised to see their new favorite Democrat sporting their mug in her Senate office.
We d like to offer a special thank you and well done to @TheALX who, according to his profile, lives in fake Indian Elizabeth WArren s home state of Massachusetts.Looks like @SenWarren is a friend to @CNN just like Hillary!
Watch out for #FakeNews !

Our guess is that Congresswoman Maxine Waters (D-CA) would have already called for his impeachment.
