If Mitt Romney and his former team have the energy to fight Trump s nomination, why didn t they take their fight to Obama when they had the chance?
America was begging for Romney fight back, but he chose to back down from the challenge.
Suddenly, he s found the will to take the fight to the GOP Presidential frontrunner Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump may have a new opponent in the race for the White House and he s not even running.A cadre of former Mitt Romney aides and advisers, some going back to 2002, have reportedly reunited to take on a new political mission: stopping the seemingly unstoppable freight train known as the Trump campaign.
We are united, said one former Romney aide who did not wish to be identified, according to the Boston Globe.
It s a common goal, and not just for Romney people, but for anyone invested in Republicanism, conservatism, and anyone who gives a flying [expletive] about what we re trying to do here.
Even if you re not getting paid, this isn t good for anybody, he said.
Fox & Friends Weekend co-host Tucker Carlson quoted the Boston Globe piece during a telephone interview with Trump Saturday.
Well, I m disappointed in Mitt Romney, Trump replied.
He is the one that s leading it, and he was a failure, Trump replied.
This is pure Romney trying to get back in to politics.He called Romney s 2012 presidential run a disaster, adding that Obama won an election that should have been won by the Republicans.
