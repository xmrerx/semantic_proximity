It s pretty obvious at this point that Donald Trump duped his working and middle-class voters.
He ran on a ridiculous slogan of drain the swamp.
Meaning, he would rid Washington D.C. of business as usual politics and be the supposed outsider to change things up.Well, now that Trump has won, albeit only by a slim electoral advantage with Hillary Clinton winning the popular vote by 2.7 million votes, he s showing all of us that his drain the swamp slogan was absolute bullsh*t.With cabinet pick after cabinet pick, Trump is showing all of us that not only is he not draining the swamp but instead filling it to the brim with politics as usual.
He s filled his cabinet with millionaires and billionaires, and putting them in roles they are not at all suited for.Pointing out how outrageous Trump s picks are is none other than the legendary entertainer extraordinaire, Cher.On Twitter, Cher wrote: How many Goldman Sachs, Billionaire Execs, Does it take to run America!?
These Men didn t become Billionaires by looking out for Working men and women.
How Many Goldman Sachs, Billionaire Execs,Does it take2 Run??
These Men didn t become Billionaires by looking out 4 Working men & Women Cher (@cher) December 9, 2016And she s exactly right.
These billionaires are only out for one thing, themselves, and maybe their business cronies.Republican voters, hopefully, will one day learn that they re not voting in their best interests, but that day was most certainly not this most recent election day.Featured image via Gustavo Caballero/Getty Images
