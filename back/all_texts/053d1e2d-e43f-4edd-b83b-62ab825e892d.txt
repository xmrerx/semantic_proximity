This is why we cannot do deals with Democrats We re worlds apart in what we want for America.
New Jersey Dem Senator Corey Booker is all for freebies in every way He thinks healthcare should be a right for all and believes we should build bridges and tunnels, not walls for illegals I think the wall is a dead end, and I think that people in New Jersey know.
Why would we spend billions of dollars to build a wall that even southern states congress people and senators know wouldn t do anything to really add security to this country?
Booker said to NJTV News.
In a time when we should be building bridges not walls, building tunnels in this region, not walls.
Booker s appearance was supposed to be about his announcement that he would be co-sponsoring Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders single-payer health care bill.SINGLE PAYER THE END-GAME FOR DEMOCRATSThe plan is called Medicare for All, and would expand the federal health care program that covers those over 65 to all Americans.Under a single-payer system, the federal government cover medical expenses, which Booker supports.
You should not be punished because you are working-class or poor and be denied health care.
I think health care should be a right to all, said Booker.
This is something that s got to happen.
Obamacare was a first step in advancing this country, but I won t rest until every American has a basic security that comes with having access to affordable health care.
Remember Gruber?
Obamacare Architect Admits Public Option Was the Pathway to Single Payer YES, THIS WAS THE SCHEME ALL ALONG.
DOES ANYONE TRUST THE DEMOCRATS ANYMORE?
