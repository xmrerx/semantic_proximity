berlin ( reuters ) - germany will wait for israeli prosecutors to conclude all investigations in a corruption scandal involving prime minister benjamin netanyahu before delivering three submarines in a $ 2 billion defense deal , german magazine der spiegel reported .
the weekly magazine reported that the german government had signed a memorandum of understanding ( mou ) with israel under which a declaration by the israeli government would not be regarded as sufficient evidence that the affair was concluded .
the 2016 deal has been under public scrutiny since it emerged that netanyahu s personal lawyer also represented the local agent of the german conglomerate thyssenkrupp marine systems set to build the vessels .
