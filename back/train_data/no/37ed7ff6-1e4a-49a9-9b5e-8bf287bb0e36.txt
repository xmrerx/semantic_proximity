i haven t had an abortion , but i wish i had lena dunhamactress lena dunham says she has never had an abortion , but wishes she had because it s a sign of bravery and self-knowledge .
i always thought that i myself didn t stigmatize abortion , dunham says in the most recent episode of her podcast , titled choice .
i m a uh abortion rights activist , it s a huge part of who i am , she added , but then said she had distanced herself from the issue of abortion in the past.she continued : but one day , when i was visiting a planned parenthood in texas a few years ago , a young girl walked up to me and asked me if i d like to be a part of her project in which women share their stories of abortions .
i sort of jumped .
i haven t had an abortion , i told her .
i wanted to make it really clear to her that as much as i was going out and fighting for other women s options , i myself had never had an abortion.and i realized then that even i was carrying within myself stigma around this issue .
even i , the woman who cares as much as anybody about a woman s right to choose , felt it was important that people know i was unblemished in this department .
so many people i love my mother , my best friends have had to have abortions for all kinds of reasons , dunham said .
i feel so proud of them for their bravery , for their self-knowledge , and it was a really important moment for me then to realize i had internalized some of what society was throwing at us and i had to put it in the garbage .
now i can say that i still haven t had an abortion , but i wish i had , she said.as newsbusters notes , dunham has now become an avid supporter of abortion.read more : breitbart
