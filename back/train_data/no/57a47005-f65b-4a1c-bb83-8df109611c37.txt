erbil , iraq ( reuters ) - iraqi kurdish leader and ex-iraqi president jalal talabani died on tuesday at age 83 , iraqi state tv said , a week after iraq s autonomous kurdish region held a referendum on independence .
talabani , a veteran leader of the kurdish struggle for self-determination , stepped down as president in 2014 , after a long period of treatment following a stroke in 2012 .
talabani died in germany , according to erbil-based rudaw tv , which reported earlier in the day that his health had deteriorated .
he often went to germany for medical treatment .
his wife and companion in political struggle , hero , and his patriotic union of kurdistan ( puk ) party voiced only lukewarm support for the sept. 25 referendum that delivered an overwhelming yes to secession from iraq .
unlike kurdistan regional government ( krg ) leader massoud barzani of the rival kurdish democratic party ( kdp ) , the puk has had traditionally good ties with iran and iranian-backed shi ite groups which are effectively ruling in baghdad .
the baghdad government , iran and turkey all strongly opposed the referendum .
talabani was born near erbil , now the seat of the autonomous krg in northern iraq , in 1933 .
he lived in sulaimaniya , a stronghold of his puk , the main rival of barzani s kdp .
he was the first non-arab president of iraq , elected in 2005 , two years after the u.s.-led invasion that toppled dictator saddam hussein , a sunni arab .
fuad masoum , a kurd from the puk , replaced talabani in the iraqi presidency , a largely ceremonial post in the political system established after saddam s overthrow that concentrates power in the hand of the prime minister , now haider al-abadi , an arab shi ite muslim .
one of talabani s sons , qubad , is the current deputy prime minister of the autonomous kurdish region in northern iraq .
