ramallah , west bank ( reuters ) - palestinian president mahmoud abbas said on wednesday that jerusalem was the eternal capital of the state of palestine in response to u.s. president donald trump s announcement that he was recognizing the city as israel s capital .
in a pre-recorded speech played on palestine tv , abbas rejected trump s announcement which included a decision to move the u.s. embassy to jerusalem , a move he said was tantamount to the united states abdicating its role as a peace mediator .
