manila ( reuters ) - philippine president rodrigo duterte s eldest son quit as vice mayor of the southern city of davao on monday , citing his being linked to a drug smuggling case by opponents and personal problems from a failed marriage as reasons for the move .
paolo duterte announced his resignation during a special session of the davao city council .
davao is president duterte s hometown and its mayor is paolo s younger sister , sara duterte-carpio .
there are recent unfortunate events in my life that are closely tied to my failed first marriage , the vice mayor said , in a statement made available to media .
these , among others , include the maligning of my reputation in the recent name dropping incident in the bureau of customs smuggling case and the very public squabble with my daughter .
paolo testified at a senate investigation in september into a seized shipment of around $ 125 million worth of narcotics from china after opponents of the president , who has instigated a fierce crackdown on the drugs trade , said they believe his son may have helped ease the entry of the shipment at the port in manila , the philippine capital .
paolo has denied any involvement .
more recently , he has been involved in an online spat with isabelle , his 15-year-old daughter from his first wife .
paolo has called her embarrassing on facebook after she complained on twitter about being treated badly by her father .
the president s office , the mayor s office and other members of paolo s family did not immediately respond to reuters requests for comments .
