when it comes to limiting our free speech , nothing this lawless government does should surprise us .
under normal circumstances , i would question the validity of this claim , but we are no longer living under normal circumstances amazon.com staff are telling irate customers that the company was ordered by the federal government not to sell items featuring the confederate flag in the aftermath of the charleston shooting.amazon made the announcement this week , along with ebay , sears and walmart , that it would no longer sell products bearing the rebel flag , but according to a conversation posted on youtube between a customer and an amazon sales rep , the decision could have been made as a result of pressure from the government.at first the amazon staffer claims that the items were banned because they were deemed to be offensive , but when pressed by the customer , the sales rep tells a different story .
is this a political statement by amazon.com or is this a directive that you re following , that the government said you know we want you guys not to sell these anymore ?
asks the caller .
the government is not allowing us to sell this confederate flag , responds the staffer .
so the government is not allowing you .to sell it ?
asks the caller , to which the sales rep responds , yes .
so amazon is not making a political statement , this is something the government told you to do ?
questions the caller .
exactly , responds the staffer.via : infowars
