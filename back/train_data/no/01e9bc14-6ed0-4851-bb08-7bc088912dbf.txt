luanda ( reuters ) - the veteran leader of angola s largest opposition party said on wednesday he would step down to allow someone else keep the new government of president joao lourenco to account .
isaias samakuva , who has led unita since 2003 , said a new leader should take the party forward through the new political cycle .
he announced his departure a day after lourenco was sworn in as only the third president of angola since independence from portugal in 1975 , ending 38 years of rule by jose eduardo dos santos .
samakuva had previously said he planned to step aside , but had appeared to seesaw on the decision in recent months .
during the campaign , i said i would leave the presidency of unita to serve the party in another function .
i maintain and reaffirm that decision , samakuva told a meeting of the party .
samakuva took over the leadership of unita - the national union for the total independence of angola - after the death of founder jonas savimbi who led the movement during 27 years of civil war .
savimbi s death brought peace and the transition of unita into a political party .
under samakuva s leadership unita increased its proportion of the national vote from 10 percent in 2008 to 27 percent in 2017 .
among those slated to succeed him are adalberto da costa , who was the party s leader in parliament under the previous administration , rafael massanga savimbi , son of unita s founder , and lukamba paulo , a former secretary general of the party who lost a leadership election against samakuva in 2003 .
