Donald Trump has long been known for his offensive remarks about America s so-called inner cities.
He has touted his supposed concern for these areas as his efforts at African-American outreach.
However, any Black person who isn t a complete and total Uncle Tom realizes that it is really just tone deaf racism that Trump is spewing.
No matter how many people tell him that his remarks are offensive, though, Trump refuses to stop.
Hell, he even once tweeted false murder statistics that originated on a white supremacist website with the clear intention of painting black people in a bad light.
Now, he is continuing his clear Twitter racism and flirtation of white supremacy as the president-elect.
Case in point his Monday morning tweet regarding the murder rate in Chicago, in which he demands that the mayor bring in the feds to stop the gun violence.
Trump tweeted:Chicago murder rate is record setting 4,331 shooting victims with 762 murders in 2016.
If Mayor can't do it he must ask for Federal help!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017I ve got news for you, Donald Trump.
The mayor of Chicago is not required to bring in any federal help whatsoever.
He knows more about his city than you ever will.
Further, you and your GOP stooges don t have the slightest clue as to how to stop gun violence.
All you do is stand behind racist murder statistics and say you care about black people when the opposite is clearly true.
You ll never be anything but a clear racist who knows NOTHING of the lives of black Americans.
That became clear the second you insisted that we are all living in hell.
This is just more racist icing on the cake of bigotry you baked for your ignorant followers to get elected.
Go back to your glass tower and your life of rich, white, male privilege and stop trying to pretend you actually give a rat s ass about anything or anyone other than yourself.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
