It s more so about love, he said of the red, white and blue gown.
We all live on this planet.
I ve never been in the political area.
However, it s just so crazy that people are getting beat up because they voted for Trump, or this and that, someone wants to bomb the White House .I am an American, I moved here from the Philippines and I highly believed in the trueness of what this country can bring.
It s about bringing people together, that s the message.
Soriano skirted questions regarding the meat of his political beliefs, but said he is proud American and believes that he is an example of the American Dream.
He was first discovered on Rihanna s Bravo reality show, Styled to Rock, and launched his label in San Diego in 2013, selling ready-to-wear and red carpet looks online only.
He is a naturalized citizen.
There are a lot of people that are in power that really misconstrued what this country stands for, he said.
I love this country.
I m from the Philippine islands, I am a proud American.
I really love this country.
I am a minority, Joy is black.
America is about immigrants.
BillboardFox and Friends interviewed gay, immigrant designer Andre Soriano this morning.
