( reuters ) - an estimated 370,000 rohingya muslim refugees have fled to bangladesh to escape violence in neighboring myanmar since late august , a spokeswoman for the u.n. refugee agency , vivian tan , said on tuesday .
at least 457,000 hungry and traumatized refugees have sought refuge in bangladesh since october 2016 .
they have joined many thousands of refugees from previous violent episodes in myanmar .
here are details gathered from u.n. sources working in the cox s bazar district of bangladesh , on the myanmar border , where many of the refugees end up .
- the jump in the number of arrivals from sunday to monday was fueled by the movement of many refugees from so-called transit sites into new settlement areas , where they are counted .
- authorities have been broadcasting messages along crowded roads telling people to move to a proposed camp at a settlement called kutupalong .
- an area of about 1,500 acres ( 607 hectares ) to 2,000 acres ( 809 hectares ) , north of kutupalong , has been set aside for new arrivals .
- a survey to identify children aged 4 to 14 has been started , so as to enroll them in learning centers .
- people , in particular , children , are becoming susceptible to waterborne diseases due to an acute shortage of clean water and sanitation facilities , as well as the common cold and fever .
- facilities are improving gradually , for example , two 5,000-litre ( 1,100-gallon ) water tanks have been installed at a settlement called unchiprang .
- some rice is now being distributed , in addition to high-energy biscuits .
- the world food programme ( wfp ) has provided more than 68,800 people with high-energy biscuits since aug. 27 as they arrive seeking shelter in cox s bazar .
- about 77,600 people have received warm meals through community kitchens run by aid agency action contre la faim .
these kitchens provide meals for about 5,300 people a day .
- the wfp is especially concerned about women and children arriving hungry and malnourished .
nearly 3,000 pregnant women , new mothers and children under five have received a special , high-nutrient porridge made of wheat and soya flour .
- some families have taken children out of school , fearing they will get lost in the throng of people , but teachers are trying to reassure them .
