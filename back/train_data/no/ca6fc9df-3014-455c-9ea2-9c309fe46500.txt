haifa , israel ( reuters ) - eighty years after he missed the jewish coming-of-age ceremony , 93-year-old holocaust survivor shalom shtamberg celebrated his bar mitzvah on thursday with his family and friends in the northern israeli city of haifa .
shtamberg was born in warsaw , poland , and should have celebrated his bar mitzvah when he turned 13 , but instead he was taken to a warsaw ghetto with his family .
he survived - unlike most of his family - by training as an electrician and acquiring skills that made him valued as a good worker .
on thursday , shtamberg was picked up from his home by trainee police officers , who drove him to a synagogue in haifa where he was welcomed by cheering crowds and flower bouquets .
he was given a prayer shawl and read from the torah scroll before breaking into dance with guests , including his wife .
i haven t fulfilled my mission yet because i still have things to do , shtamberg told reuters .
one of those things is to detail in lectures the horrors of the nazi camps he survived , unlike his parents and five brothers who were killed .
recalling his time in the ghetto , he said : in the beginning i did not speak , i said and told nothing because i stayed a child , aged 13 , 14 , and ( living in ) warsaw ghetto was extremely difficult , every day .
