riyadh ( reuters ) - saudi arabia has expressed hope the united states would not recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel and warned such a decision would have serious implications , state news agency spa reported on tuesday .
the recognition will have very serious implications and will be provocative to all muslims feelings , spa said quoting an unnamed official source at the saudi foreign ministry .
the united states administration should take into account the negative implications of such a move and the kingdom s hope not to take such a decision as this will affect the u.s. ability to continue its attempt of reaching a just solution for the palestinian cause , the statement added .
on monday , saudi arabia s ambassador in washington prince khalid bin salman said any u.s. announcement on the status of jerusalem before a final settlement is reached in the israeli-palestinian conflict would hurt the peace process and heighten regional tensions .
the kingdom s policy - has been - and remains in support of the palestinian people , and this has been communicated to the u.s. administration , prince khalid said in a statement .
u.s. president donald trump is weighing whether to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital but has not yet made a decision , his son-in-law and envoy for middle east peace jared kushner said on sunday .
a senior administration official said last week trump could make such an announcement on wednesday .
israel considers all of jerusalem to be its capital .
palestinians want the eastern portion of it to be the capital of a future state .
u.s. policy for decades has been to reserve judgment on both claims until the parties agree jerusalem s status in a settlement of the israeli-palestinian conflict .
