CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - A senior aide to U.S. President Donald Trump has scrapped plans to visit Canada for talks with officials in Prime Minister Justin Trudeauâ€™s team, a Canadian government source said on Monday.
The source said the planned visit by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner had hit logistical problems.
A separate source had earlier said Kushner intended to meet Trudeau aides on the margins of a cabinet retreat in Calgary.
