this is just too rich !
the democrats threw tons of money into this race and then the republican candidate body-slammed an obnoxious reporter .
it seemed like the dems really couldn t lose this one .
bernie s socialist candidate would win in montana .
the democrats were sure they could run leftists and win in red states not so fast ! republican businessman greg gianforte won montana s sole house district in a special election thursday , keeping a seat in republican hands despite facing assault charges for allegedly attacking a reporter who d asked him about the gop s health-care bill : the best ever quote from the body-slamming incident is when gianforte spoke for all americans : i m sick and tired of this !
after he won he commented on the incident in his victory speech i shouldn t have treated that reporter that way , he told supporters at his rally here.please check out gianforte s twitter page !
it s full of great photos of things he s done .
he makes his own sausage and even gave his wife a sausage maker for christmas .
he posts photos of his wild game dinners that look amazing .
this guy is a blast !
