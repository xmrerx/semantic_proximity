here s what politico s headline today looked like : here s what the leftist anti-american rag politico had to say about angela merkel s visit to the us to meet with our new president donald trump : this time the media hype surrounding a white house meeting is no wild exaggeration .
when president donald trump and german chancellor angela merkel finally get together on friday , the leaders of the west s two most powerful countries are sure to come off more like an odd couple than two close allies chewing over plans for some joint enterprise .
and for good reason .
merkel and trump are not only polar opposites as people , but they share little in terms of international outlook.their styles reflect their vastly different backgrounds .
merkel , germany s first and only female chancellor , was raised by a pastor in communist east germany , where she earned a doctorate in physical chemistry .
although she is the longest-serving and most powerful leader in europe , she is unfailingly modest , competent and consensus-oriented .
trump s all-about-me mentality , queens upbringing and brash , tabloid-and-reality-tv personality couldn t be more different .
could one even imagine the outrage if a piece like this was published about barack obama within his first 60 days in office ?
the mentality of the unhinged left is on display for every american to see and if they keep this up , even for a few more months , they will never win another election .
here s how nigel farage , the british rock star who was behind brexit feels about merkel s visit to the white house : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=eqncksyldgq
