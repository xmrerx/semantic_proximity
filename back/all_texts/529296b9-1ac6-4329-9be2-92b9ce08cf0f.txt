We recently reported on how it has now come to light, thanks to the wonderful investigative reporting at The New Yorker, that Donald Trump is involved in some seriously shady business dealings.
In one instance, he has a hotel that seems to be nothing more than a front for shady ties to the Iranian Revolutionary Guard, which is considered to be a sponsor of terrorism.
The people who signed off on the hotel deal also are corrupt as all hell, and seem to get their money by laundering it via government corruption.
Well, there is one person in the news business who always breaks this stuff down in the best way possible: MSNBC s Rachel Maddow.On Thursday s edition of the Rachel Maddow Show, the fiery host explains the situation with Trump and his family s ties and how it could make Trump vulnerable to blackmail by these dangerous foreign terrorists.
Of course, with Trump being president, that means the danger also extends to the American people.
According to Maddow, this deal is so potentially dangerous that Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH), actually wants a whole new investigation just for this shady sham of a hotel deal.Another interesting tidbit that Maddow points out is the fact that it is illegal for American business people to do business with foreign entities that have been sanctioned due to terrorist ties.
In fact, it s seen as such an egregious crime that if caught, one faces serious jail time.
Hopefully, Trump s clear incompetence forces him to slip up on this one, and he winds up in prison, right where he belongs.There s no one like Rachel Maddow to explain something like this, though, so, without further ado, here is the video:Featured image via video screen capture
