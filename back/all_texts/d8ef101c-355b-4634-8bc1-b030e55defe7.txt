I was offended, he said.
I think anybody who read it would be offended.
It was horrible.
It was very offensive.
According to Luttrell, he was informed about the posts on Friday.
His department decided to investigate Barber before firing him and he then resigned on Tuesday.
The mayor said that Barber apologized but still may have been fired if he had not decided to resign on his own.
He was very contrite, very apologetic.
He recognized that he made a mistake, Luttrell said.
I don t know [why he did it].
That s a question only he can answer.
Luttrell added that even though the posts were written on Barber s personal Facebook page, that page also identified him as a government employee.
This was an action by an employee who should have known better.
What he did, his behavior was intolerable; it was offensive.
We afforded him his rights and due process.
He recognized his discretion and [resigned], Luttrell said.Luttrell noted that he isn t sure Shelby County currently has a formal social media policy.
But he said if they don t, they will very soon.Luttrell s interview can be seen here: Watch more on this story, here: | WBTV CharlotteFeatured image via Local Memphis
