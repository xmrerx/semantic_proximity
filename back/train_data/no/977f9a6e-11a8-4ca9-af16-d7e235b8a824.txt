london ( reuters ) - british prime minister theresa may said it was possible that the european court of justice could continue to arbitrate trade disputes during a transition period after britain has formally left the bloc in march 2019 .
we want to have a smooth and orderly process of withdrawal ... that s why we want that implementation period and we have to negotiate what will operate during that implementation period , and yes that may mean we will start off with the ecj , may told parliament .
the jurisdiction of the european court is a inflammatory issue for some brexit campaigners within may s conservative party .
citing sovereignty as a benefit of brexit , they argue that leaving the eu should offer supremacy to british courts .
britain also said it will seek to negotiate trade deals with countries outside the eu during a transition period , but it would not bring any such deals into effect if they clashed with the transition terms .
in a document setting out its post-brexit trade plans , the government said it would seek to transition all existing eu trade agreements and other eu preferential arrangements to provide continuity for exporters and investors .
