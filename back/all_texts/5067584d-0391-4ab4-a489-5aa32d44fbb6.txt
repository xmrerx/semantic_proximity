WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland s lower house of parliament on Friday approved changes to the country s National Judiciary Council, a part of a broader overhaul of the courts system pushed by the ruling conservatives.
Under the new rules, which still need Senate and presidential approval, parliament will have the responsibility for choosing members of the council which in turn nominates all judges.
