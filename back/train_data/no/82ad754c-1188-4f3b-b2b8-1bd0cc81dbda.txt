this is such a huge opportunity and the feds probably just scratched the surface.the current state of some american institutions of higher learning , flush with debates about trigger warnings , sexual assault and affirmative action , have left some critics wondering whether college students have time to learn anything anymore .
but on the campus of the university of northern new jersey ( unnj ) , nestled in idyllic cranford about 20 miles from the hustle and bustle of manhattan , no students were concerned with such matters because the school , as authorities just announced , was an elaborate front used by undercover federal agents to trap people illegally trying to score fake visas for foreign nationals.now , the unnj sting is over , but leaves quite a wake : the indictments of 21 brokers , recruiters , and employers from across the united states who allegedly conspired with more than 1,000 foreign nationals , as the department of justice explained , to keep them in the country under the auspices of an ersatz alma mater .
some who purchased fake papers ended up working at facebook or working for the u.s. military , as abc reported .
pay to stay schemes not only damage our perception of legitimate student and foreign worker visa programs , they also pose a very real threat to national security , new jersey u.s. attorney paul j. fishman said in a statement .
today s arrests , which were made possible by the great undercover work of our law enforcement partners , stopped 21 brokers , recruiters and employers across multiple states who recklessly exploited our immigration system for financial gain .
