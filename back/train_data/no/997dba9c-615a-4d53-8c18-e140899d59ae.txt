beijing ( reuters ) - china on monday criticized a visit by india s defense minister to the remote state of arunachal pradesh , which china claims , saying it would complicate efforts by both sides to maintain peace along the disputed border region .
the latest row over arunachal pradesh in the eastern himalayas that china claims as southern tibet suggests the neighbors remain far apart , despite recent attempts to defuse tension .
on sunday , indian defence minister nirmala sitharaman took stock of defense preparedness in arunachal pradesh along the line of actual control , the de facto , but disputed , border between the two countries .
sitharaman also tweeted pictures of her visit , including her meeting with indian army officers .
china lashed back on monday .
an indian official going to a disputed region on the china- india border will perhaps make the issue even more complex , and is not beneficial to efforts by both parties to maintain peace and tranquillity on the border , chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said .
india s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
in the past , new delhi has reacted strongly to any attempts challenging its sovereignty over arunachal .
china and india have tried to develop two-ways ties in recent years but there is still deep distrust over the border dispute .
in april , china slammed india s decision to host tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama in the region , saying it could cause serious damage to relations .
china hoped india could meet it half-way to resolve their differences , hua said .
we hope india can work with china to continue to use talks to appropriately resolve the border issue via negotiation and create good conditions and atmosphere , she added .
