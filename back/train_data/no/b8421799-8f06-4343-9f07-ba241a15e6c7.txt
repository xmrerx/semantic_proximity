this is going to get very interesting.the federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) has successfully recovered personal and work emails from hillary clinton s private email server , according to a new report.sources told bloomberg news that some of clinton s emails have been extracted from the server , thus disproving the claim that clinton managed to wipe her server clean after she deleted all of her emails earlier this year.therefore , some of the emails that clinton deleted the ones that she determined were not relevant to federal investigations are now in the hands of the fbi.the federal investigation , therefore , is now out of clinton s control.outside computer specialists have said the fbi has the technical capability to recover deleted e-mails .
the exact number of personal e-mails recovered by the fbi could not be learned .
once the e-mails have been extracted , a group of agents has been separating personal correspondence and passing along work-related messages to agents leading the investigation , the person said .
