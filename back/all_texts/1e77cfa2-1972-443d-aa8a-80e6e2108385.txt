Our country deserves a HUD Secretary with the relevant experience.
Dr. Carson is a disturbingly unqualified choice.

WEReally?
So Trump s new HUD Secretary s responsibilities have something to do with racial tension issues with police?
Twitter users hammered Pelosi over her racist remarks:Nanacy Pelosi must be a racist Amy 0311 Mom (@Amyloukingery) December 5, 2016so your saying that a minority HUD secretary will not be able to help the needs of other minorities?

OVERQUALIFIED.
Diane Seaman (@dianejseaman) December 5, 2016Mike Huckabee had the best response as he excoriates Nancy Pelosi for her ignorant comment here:Ben Carson is first HUD Sec to have actually lived in gov't housing.
Fancy Nancy Pelosi says he's not qualified; is she racist or just dumb?
Gov.
