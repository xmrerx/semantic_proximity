Now that the Bundy terrorists have been arrested, federal investigators have begun the painstaking task of collecting evidence of crimes committed during the 41 day-long occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge.According to Oregonlive, federal officials have discovered numerous explosives, firearms and a large trench, filled with human feces.During the standoff, members of the terrorist group recorded a video of themselves riffling through boxes of Native American artifacts.
As you likely remember, the terrorists claimed that the federal government was disrespecting Native American culture and heritage, by storing boxes of artifacts in the basement of one of the buildings on the refuge.While the video made by the militants was meant to convince the public that the group cared about the history and culture of the Paiute people, according to federal officials, the terrorists excavated a road on or adjacent to grounds containing sensitive artifacts.
They also dug a trench in the same area, and then shit in it.According to Assistant U.S.
Attorneys Ethan Knight and Geoffrey Barrow, the FBI Evidence Response Team has found a significant amount of human feces located on or near these sacred grounds.In a memo released on Tuesday, officials said the FBI crime unit continues to gather evidence of additional crimes committed by the terrorists on a particularly sensitive cultural site, where the group also chose to set up their outdoor camp.Federal investigators released the information in response to requests by defense attorneys, who are representing the Bundy terrorists, asking the government to preserve evidence in the case.
Oregonlive also reports that,The government further will make all evidence seized in the investigation available for inspection at the FBI field office in Portland, prosecutors said.Would that include evidence from the trench of human feces the militants left behind?A better idea might be to box it all up and send it directly to the terrorists in their jail cells, in lieu of snacks.Image credit from DonkeyHotey via Flckr
