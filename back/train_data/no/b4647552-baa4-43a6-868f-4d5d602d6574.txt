chicago ( reuters ) - former u.s. house speaker dennis hastert , convicted last year of a financial crime , asked on friday for a delay in his sentencing due to poor health .
hastert pleaded guilty in october to a federal charge of “ structuring ” - evading bank reporting rules by withdrawing large amounts of cash in smaller increments - in a hush-money case stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct .
the 74-year-old , once one of the country ’ s most powerful politicians , was hospitalized in november and was treated for a spinal infection requiring surgery , a severe blood infection and a stroke , his lawyers said in a motion filed on friday .
the lawyers have not been able to meet with hastert to prepare for the scheduled feb. 29 sentencing due to his health problems , the motion said .
the lawyers requested a march 7 status hearing before u.s. district judge thomas durkin .
hastert faces up to five years in prison but prosecutors have recommended a sentence of six months or less , in exchange for his guilty plea .
hastert admitted to paying $ 1.7 million in cash to an individual he had known for decades to buy that person ’ s silence and compensate for past misconduct toward that individual .
prosecutors did not spell out the misconduct , but unnamed law enforcement officials have told media that it was sexual and involved someone hastert knew when he was a high school teacher and coach in his hometown of yorkville , illinois , in the 1960s and 1970s .
