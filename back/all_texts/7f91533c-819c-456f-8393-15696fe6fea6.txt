Throughout Donald Trump s entire campaign, it s been the Donald Trump show.
What does that mean?
He s made it all about himself.
How well HE is doing.
What poll numbers HE is getting.
What HE can do for the country.
How great HE is.
He s been saying all of these things as if he s doing all of this on his own without any help from anyone.Well, in a turn of events, Trump just tweeted out something on Twitter that seems to acknowledge, at least in parentheses, that he hasn t clinched the Republican nomination for president completely on his own.
There were actually voters involved.He wrote: I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary by a lot and with many states left to go!
Thank you.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2016This is YUUGE for The Donald to recognize that he s not actually moving forward to the general election based upon himself alone.
He actually needed votes to get there, and it s nice that he kinda-sorta-maybe in parentheses alongside himself acknowledged the people who got him to where he is.Trump s narcissism knows no bounds, but maybe, just maybe he finally figured out how elections actually work.
And because the rest of us already knew, we need to make sure he gets nowhere near the White House come November.Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images
