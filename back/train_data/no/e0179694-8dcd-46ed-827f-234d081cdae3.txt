moscow ( reuters ) - russia s defence ministry on saturday criticized german defence minister ursula von der leyen , saying it was bewildered by her assertion that moscow planned to send more than 100,000 troops to war games on nato s eastern flank this month .
on thursday , the german defense minister said the war games , code named zapad or west , were a clear demonstration of capabilities and power of the russians .
anyone who doubts that only has to look at the high numbers of participating forces in the zapad exercise : more than one hundred thousand , von der leyen told reporters at an eu defense ministers meeting in tallinn .
russia has said that its joint war games with belarus will be purely defensive in nature , rejecting what it called false allegations that it might use the drills to train for invasions of poland , lithuania or ukraine .
we are bewildered by the statements of ursula von der leyen , publicly talking through her hat and making arbitrary allegations about 100,000 russian troops ... and about hidden threats to europe , russia s military said in a statement .
russia has said around 13,000 troops from russia and belarus and almost 700 pieces of military hardware will be used in the exercises to be held in belarus , the baltic sea , western russia and russia s exclave of kaliningrad on sept. 14-20 .
general valery gerasimov , chief of russia s general staff , used a meeting on thursday with general petr pavel , chairman of the nato military committee , to reassure him about the upcoming war games .
it is hard to imagine that ursula von der leyen s colleagues from nato , other competent german ministries or her own subordinates deliberately misled her , russia s defense ministry said .
it is much easier to suppose the opposite .
