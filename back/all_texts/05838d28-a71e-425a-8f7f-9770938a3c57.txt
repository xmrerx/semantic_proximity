If you listen to Senator Marco Rubio, ISIS is outside your door and is about to attack your family, and the only way to defend against this threat is to buy a gun.Senator Rubio needs the support of diehard conservatives if he is to make any headway in the Iowa caucus or New Hampshire primary, and they are almost as suspicious of his conservative bona fides as they are of figures like Jeb Bush.So in order to get those voters on board, Senator Rubio has to do what he does so well pander.That s why when he appeared on CBS Face the Nation on Sunday morning, Rubio went into detail about the latest revelation from the campaign trail his Christmas Eve purchase of a gun.Rubio told host John Dickerson that he bought a gun in order to defend his family from ISIS.Rubio explains why he purchased a fire arm recently.
Explains that it is the last defense between his family & ISIS https://t.co/2AkdTHZ5yh Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) January 17, 2016He explained: I m a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, I have a right to protect my family if someone were to come after us, in fact, if ISIS were to visit us or our communities at any moment, the last line of defense between ISIS and my family is the ability that I have to protect my family from them or from a criminal or from anyone else that seeks to do us harm.
Rarely does a politician so blatantly pander to a constituency group that he or she needs to be viable, but Rubio has gone there.His rhetoric echoes the fevered donation-seeking fantasies of the NRA, who has recently told their followers that they need to have a gun in the house to defend against an ISIS attack just outside their homes.Of course, the unfortunate reality is Senator Rubio and other gun owners are far more likely to hurt themselves or members of their family than to engage in a fantasy shoot-out with an ISIS terrorist.But keeping this level of fear up continues to benefit the right in many ways.
Telling people to go out and buy guns creates a false sense of security, and fills the coffers of the gun manufacturers who then donate to Republicans and help to keep them in office, resulting in lax gun legislation or opposition to new laws.
Everybody benefits, except public safety and security.Marco s got a gun.Featured image via Twitter
