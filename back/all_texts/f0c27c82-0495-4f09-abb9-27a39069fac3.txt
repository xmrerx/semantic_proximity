WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate John Kasich’s campaign on Monday denied a report that Mitt Romney, the party’s presidential candidate in 2012, would endorse the Ohio governor on Monday.
A Wall Street Journal reporter said Kasich answered in the affirmative to a question about Romney’s endorsement.
Kasich spokesman Chris Schrimpf said, “This is not true.
Kasich was responding and acknowledging a different question.” A Romney endorsement would have provided Kasich with a boost on the eve of Ohio’s primary in which he and front-runner Donald Trump are running a close race for first place.
