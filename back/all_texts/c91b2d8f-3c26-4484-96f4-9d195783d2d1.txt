Despite some noises being made by some Republican detractors, for all intents and purposes the party is stuck with Donald Trump as its nominee and the choice will be official at the party s upcoming convention.While some major Republicans like George W. Bush and Mitt Romney have announced their opposition to Trump, not as many have gone all-in and endorsed Hillary Clinton for President, instead preferring to simply oppose Trump without offering up a serious alternative.Former Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson has gone a step further, and in an op-ed published in the Washington Post, is now endorsing Clinton.He doesn t mince his words:The GOP, in putting Trump at the top of the ticket, is endorsing a brand of populism rooted in ignorance, prejudice, fear and isolationism.
This troubles me deeply as a Republican, but it troubles me even more as an American.
Enough is enough.
It s time to put country before party and say it together: Never Trump.Paulson just absolutely blasts Trump s supposed business prowess noting, he takes imprudent risks and, when his businesses fail, disavows his debts.
Citing his first-hand experience with passing TARP after the economy began collapsing and the need to get Democrats and Republicans to agree on it, Paulson notes: This requires a president who exhibits an ability to compromise and basic civility neither of which Trump displays.
It isn t as if Paulson has become a liberal overnight.
He points out that he still supports Republicans at the state level, and the overall tone of his essay is that he would support a standard-issue Republican if Trump were one.But he isn t, and as a result he lays out the case for Clinton as better for business even if he disagrees with some of her philosophy.He concludes:I ll be voting for Hillary Clinton, with the hope that she can bring Americans together to do the things necessary to strengthen our economy, our environment and our place in the world.
To my Republican friends: I know I m not alone.Featured image via YouTube
