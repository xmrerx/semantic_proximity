The idea of a Donald Trump presidency is scary as hell for most of us.
However, one Florida man has a more positive take on things.
The unidentified man, who Politico reporter Michael Grunwald interviewed and described as a 32-year-old Latino Democrat, plans to vote for Trump for the most hilarious of reasons: he wants to see how nutty things can get.
The man said to Grunwald: The whole system is fucked.
Why not vote for the craziest guy, so we can see the craziest shit happen?
To make you scratch your head even more, the man said that he voted for President Barack Obama in both 2008 and 2012, and would do so again if he could.
However, he will not be tossing his vote toward Hillary Clinton this go around, because he seemingly just doesn t give a fuck.
The man went on to say as to why he won t be going for Clinton in 2016: We got ISIS, we got Zika, we got this, we got that.
At least Trump is fun to watch.
Politics sucks, man.
All I can say about this is that while his answers are funny, they are also absolutely terrifying.
Donald Trump is dangerous as hell, and fun to watch right now or not, I know that I m not willing to roll the dice on the future of the nation and the world and allow that narcissistic lunatic into the White House.
Now, this guy could have been fucking with the Politico reporter, but somehow I seriously doubt it.
He sounds like he s more entertained by the whole Trump Train fiasco than he is frightened.
Perhaps he hasn t thought this through, because if Trump wins, we ll be entering a nuclear war in short order.
We ll be alienating all of our allies along the way, with likely no way to survive the absolute catastrophe that the orange buffoon would most certainly create.Hopefully, this is the only Democrat out there who is planning to vote for Trump for the lulz, because this isn t remotely funny.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images
