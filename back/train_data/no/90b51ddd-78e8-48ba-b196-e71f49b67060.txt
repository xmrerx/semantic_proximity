less than one month before the 2016 presidential election , the new york state s attorney general s office ordered the trump foundation to cease and desist fundraising activities in the state , and said calls for a similar investigation into the family foundation of trump s opponent , hillary clinton , are without merit.a trump campaign spokesman accused schneiderman of being a partisan hack for investigating the trump foundation , saying it amounted to nothing more than another left-wing hit job .
the two have sparred publicly in the past over schneiderman s investigation of trump s defunct real estate academy , trump university.schneiderman said concerns about the clinton foundation s fundraising did not rise to the level of an investigation.he said compliance issues with the clintons foundation amounted to ministerial , routines stuff such as late filings or missing paperwork , and that the foundation is properly registered and properly filed , unlike trump s foundation.critics of the clinton foundation have called for an examination of the hundreds of millions of dollars from individuals who met with the then-secretary of state after either donating or promising to donate in the future , which included funding from foreign governments .
politicodespite his best efforts , president trump won the election .
liberal hacktivist ny state attorney general eric schneiderman has now turned his attention on bullying and eliminating the free speech rights of 9/11 survivor and pro-life preacher angela braxton.the thomas more law center has announced they will defend braxton against the pro-life bully and democrat activist , ny state ag eric schneiderman.ms .
braxton , whose iconic photo as a survivor of the 9/11 world trade center terrorist attack hangs in the smithsonian national museum of african american history and culture , is one of fourteen pro-life sidewalk counselors sued by the attorney general who alleges they harassed and intimidated women at the entrance of an abortion facility , choices women s medical center , in jamaica , new york.the attorney general petitioned the court to create a sixteen-foot buffer zone around the abortion premises and levy fines , attorney fees and compensatory damages against the defendants.braxton , who did not consider herself very spiritual at the time , had a life-changing experience on 9/11 when the first plane struck while she was on the 80th floor of world trade center 1 .
looking back on that fateful day , angela recalls : she did not die .
a few years later she fully committed herself to jesus christ and the pro-life cause.jay combs , the thomas more law center attorney handling the matter , commented : rather than fulfill his duty as attorney general to protect the first amendment rights of angela braxton , the attorney general , in his press conference , lamented what he called a sense of entitlement by protestors to run their mouth .
this chilling statement shows that the new york attorney general is so blinded by his desire to see abortions performed that he has forgotten that the entitlement to speak on behalf of the lives of unborn children is a constitutional right protected by the first amendment .
