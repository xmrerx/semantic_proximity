VIENNA (Reuters) - Austrian conservatives led by Sebastian Kurz have reached a coalition deal with the anti-immigration Freedom Party, a source said on Friday, paving the way for Austria to become the only western European country with a far-right party in government.
The deal, in the wake of an Oct. 15 parliamentary election dominated by Europe s migration crisis, brings the Freedom Party back into government for the first time in more than a decade.
A person familiar with the talks confirmed that a deal had been reached shortly after it was initially reported by Austrian news agency APA.
