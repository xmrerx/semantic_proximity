dubai ( reuters ) - iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei said on wednesday u.s. president donald trump would fail in his hardened stance towards iran , saying tehran was stronger than during the time of the more powerful and smarter ronald reagan .
reagan was more powerful and smarter than trump , and he was a better actor in making threats , and he also moved against us and they shot down our plane , khamenei said in a speech carried on state television .
in 1988 , a u.s. warship shot down an iranian passenger plane over the gulf , killing all 290 aboard , in an incident which washington said was a mistake .
tehran said it was a deliberate attack on iran , then at war with neighboring iraq .
but reagan is gone and , according to out beliefs , he now faces god s retribution ... while iran has made great advances in all areas since reagan s time , khamenei added .
this trend will continue under the current american president and any hopes on their part that the islamic republic would back off or weaken is futile .
trump refused in october to certify that tehran is complying with its 2015 nuclear deal with world powers and warned he might ultimately terminate the agreement .
he announced the shift in u.s. policy in a speech in which he detailed a more aggressive approach to iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs and its support for militant groups in the middle east .
under the nuclear deal , sanctions on iran were lifted in return for tehran rolling back technologies with nuclear bomb-making potential .
