Congressman Al Green (D-Texas) thinks, like a lot of Americans, that Donald Trump should be impeached.
Rep. Green, though, is African-American, so to Trump voters, that only means one thing.
He should be lynched.Green, a seven-term congressman and member of the Congressional Black Caucus, made his call for impeachment after Trump tweeted warning former FBI director James Comey not to leak details of their conversations with the press.
Green told the audience he believes that Trump s actions amounted to an admission of obstruction of justice, and the tweet constituted intimidation.
It is imperative, he said, that the House move to indict Trump; nothing less than the rule of law is at stake.Source: Mother JonesIn a town hall meeting on Saturday, Green played some of the threatening voicemails that have been left at his office by Trump supporters.

Try it and we will lynch all of you, the caller said.Some of the callers called him the n word.
Others said he should be lynched and at least one mentioned the debunked fake news story that Democratic National Committee staffer Seth Rich was murdered by Hillary Clinton.Here are some of the audios, which may be NSFW:Green won t let these freaks stop him from doing his job, though.
We are not going to be intimidated, Green said Saturday in southwest Houston.
We are not going to allow this to cause us to deviate from what we believe to be the right thing to do and that is to proceed with the impeachment of President Trump.
