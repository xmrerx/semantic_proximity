This woman should be in a jail cell not sitting around laughing and opening pickle jars on the Jimmy Fallon show.
Judicial Watch s release this week of 725 pages of State Department emails involving Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin demonstrates the Obama administration considers a large percentage of the emails sent through Clinton s private server too sensitive for Congress or the American public to read.Of the 725 pages, more than 250 pages were 100 percent redacted, many with PAGE DENIED stamped in bold.Judicial Watch said the new cache includes previously unreleased email exchanges in which former Abedin provided influential Clinton Foundation donors special, expedited access to the secretary of state.
Judicial Watch added that in many instances, the preferential treatment provided to donors was at the specific request of Clinton Foundation executive Douglas Band.
The Abedin emails reveal that the longtime Clinton aide apparently served as a conduit between Clinton Foundation donors and Hillary Clinton while Clinton served as secretary of state.
In more than a dozen email exchanges, Abedin provided expedited, direct access to Clinton for donors who had contributed from $25,000 to $10 million to the Clinton Foundation, Judicial Watch said in a statement announcing the release.
