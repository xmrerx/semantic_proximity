It can likely be said that Iowa is one of the whitest states in the entire nation.
So white, in fact, that it seems many of the people in the state haven t come into too much contact with any people of color to notice that, no, they don t all look the same.
Proof of this can be found in Triumph the Insult Comic Dog s Ben Carson Social Experiment.
According to Hulu: Triumph goes to Iowa to discover if white people tell the difference between SNL comic Tim Meadows and presidential candidate Ben Carson?
Spoiler alert: Not so much.
In fact, the people who Meadows came into contact with while dressed as Carson really didn t seem to notice the difference between the men whatsoever.
He spoke with several people at a local diner.
Some who even seemed very excited to finally be meeting who they though was Carson.Meadows was so convincing that he was able to persuade one of the folks at the diner to stab him in the belt buckle, just like from the infamous fable Carson had told time and time again from his childhood.
However, this time, Meadows made it seem like he was actually stabbed and left the diner in a hurry to go to the hospital.
By the end of the segment, the SNL alum even had an entire arena full of people fooled as he sang the Star Spangled Banner before a basketball game.All in all, it seems as though far too many people in Iowa can t tell the difference between Carson and just any random black man.
Which is sad, yet somehow not at all surprising.
