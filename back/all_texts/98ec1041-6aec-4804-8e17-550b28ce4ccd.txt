Donald Trump is already making the Republican Party insane, and it hasn t even been a week yet.
While many GOPers found Trump s Twitter use concerning, it s reached an entirely new level considering that Trump is unavailable to them by all other means.On Wednesday, the Republican Party suffered another humiliating blow when Senator Chuck Grassley (R-IA) was forced to go on Twitter and beg Trump in front of everyone to force his executive branch to answer Senators requests so that oversight could be performed.
Grassley tweeted: Pres Trump pls issue order to all in ur executive branch ppl to answer all Senator requests for RECORDS so we can do oversight.
This was followed by several pathetic attempts to get Trump to respond, probably because Trump and his team wouldn t play by the rules and answer more conventional methods of communication (no surprise there).Grassley tried everything to get Trump s attention he even tried to educate the 45th President of the United States about how important oversight is, probably because Grassley realizes Trump doesn t know anything about how the government actually works Grassley even tried to diss former President Barack Obama in hopes that Trump would respond!
Hours later, Grassley s pleas for Trump to do his job had gone unanswered, and things got a little testy:Damn!
But honestly, what did the GOP expect from Trump, the guy who took the weekend off from being president after his inauguration?!
This is a man who obviously doesn t care about doing the work of a president; he just wanted the title.Trump s first week has been such a disaster, and it s not even over.
He s not only becoming a nightmare for all of Americans and Democrats he s a liability to his own party.
The fact that a Republican senator had to publicly tweet at Trump in order to get his attention is extremely embarrassing, but that s what they signed up for when they nominated him.Featured image via Steve Pope/Getty Images
