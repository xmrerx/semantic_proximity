WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Britain’s Queen Elizabeth has invited U.S. President Donald Trump for a state visit later this year and he has accepted, British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Friday.
May was speaking at a news conference in Washington during the first visit to the White House by a foreign leader since Trump’s inauguration a week ago.
