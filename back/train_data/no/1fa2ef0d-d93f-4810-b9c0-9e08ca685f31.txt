phnom penh ( reuters ) - cambodians on thursday marked the 64th anniversary of the country s independence from france by releasing doves and balloons into the sky at the independence monument in the capital phnom penh .
late king norodom sihanouk declared cambodia s independence from france in 1953 after seizing power a year earlier in a bloodless coup , but maintained good relations with the european nation .
thursday s independence ceremony was attended by current king norodom sihamoni and prime minister hun sen , who has ruled cambodia for more than 30 years , and was attended by thousands of school children , civil servants and foreign diplomats .
cambodia was under french rule for almost a century before its 1953 independence .
hun sen in a facebook post credited king norodom sihanouk with devoting his life to fight for the independence .
november 9 is the day that brought independence , territorial integrity , peace and development , hun sen said .
hun sen s ruling cambodian people s party has cracked down on the opposition in recent months in the lead up to a 2018 election .
his government has asked the supreme court to dissolve the main opposition cambodia national rescue party .
a court ruling is expected to decide the matter next week .
