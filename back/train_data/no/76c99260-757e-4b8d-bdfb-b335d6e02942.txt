this fed up driver was not going to be bullied into submission by these ignorant protesters .
was he wrong to keep driving when these people know they re blocking traffic and putting themselves in grave danger standing in front of traffic ?
how do these fools know what circumstances of each one of the drivers may be facing as they re blocked by a pack of ignorant people ?
someone may be rushing their child to the hospital or trying to get to work on time for fear of losing their jobs .
no one should never have to sit behind a wall of human protesters on a busy highway it doesn t matter what you re protesting that s just common sense to stay off the highways and roads.the best part of this whole video is when one of the brave protesters announces to everyone that he got the license plate number so he could report him to the cops they re standing in traffic to protest !
