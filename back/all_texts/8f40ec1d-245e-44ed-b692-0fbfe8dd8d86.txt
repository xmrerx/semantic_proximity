FINALLY!
The H-1b Visa program has been so abused by American companies like Disney!
It s about time that an employee will testify to tell his story of total humiliation at having to train his replacement after being LAID OFF.
Can you imagine?
This is obviously all about bringing in cheap labor to replace American workers.One of the workers Disney fired and forced to train his foreign replacement is scheduled to testify before Congress Thursday, when he will share his story and plead with lawmakers to recognize it as part of a nationwide problem with the H-1b visa program.
This situation at Disney is not an anomaly, Leo Perrero says in prepared testimony obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation.
This same abuse of the H1B program is happening nationwide.
Perrero was laid off just ahead of the holidays in 2014 and then forced to train his foreign replacement on an H-1b visa, before he and hundreds of other IT workers at Disney in Florida left their job.
He had been at Disney for more than 10 years and received outstanding performance reviews, and actually thought he was being called in for a pat on the back when his boss laid him off.
This year Leo was instrumental, reads one of the reviews Perrero cites in his testimony.
Leo saved the company over $10,000, another read.
Leo continues to provide value to our team.
THIS IS NOT ABOUT A LACK OF TALENT HERE IN THE U.S IT S A VERY COMMON PRACTICE USED FOR CHEAP LABOR:Like Disney, Southern California Edison, Fossil Group, and Catalina Marketing have hired outsourcing firms that rely heavily on H-1bs and then laid off dozens or hundreds of tech workers, some of whom were expected to train their foreign replacements.
In these and undoubtedly other cases, the laid off workers are threatened with the removal of benefits if they talk to the press about training their replacements.Read more: Daily Caller
