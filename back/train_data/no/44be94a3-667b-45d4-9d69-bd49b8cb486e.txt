yangon ( reuters ) - the number of refugees arriving in bangladesh from myanmar since aug. 25 has risen to 480,000 , international aid bodies said on tuesday , adding that the figure had risen because 35,000 new arrivals had not been included in a previous tally .
the refugees are fleeing a myanmar military offensive launched in response to about 30 coordinated attacks by rohingya muslim insurgents on aug. 25 .
the change in the new arrivals figure ... is due , in large part , to the additional estimated 35,000 new arrivals settling in the two refugee camps , which was not reported in the last situation report , the inter-sector coordination group of aid agencies said in a statement .
