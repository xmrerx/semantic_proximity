Our First Lady has taken time out from her self-appointed role as America s Food Nazi to fulfill her new role as First Propagandist in Obama s coordinated Race War on America First lady Michelle Obama used a speech Monday that was supposed to be celebrating the opening of a new museum to instead dig deeper the racial divide that s been growing ever wider during her husband s presidency.
Museums and concert halls, she said, just don t welcome non-white visitors especially children the way they welcome whites.
Speaking at the new Whitney museum in New York City s meat packing district last week, Obama said she grew up thinking that museums were not places for someone who looks like me.
You see, there are so many kids in this country who look at places like museums and concert halls and other cultural centers and they think to themselves, well, that s not a place for me, for someone who looks like me, for someone who comes from my neighborhood.
In fact, I guarantee you that right now, there are kids living less than a mile from here who would never in a million years dream that they would be welcome in this museum.
And growing up on the South Side of Chicago, I was one of those kids myself.
So I know that feeling of not belonging in a place like this.
And today, as first lady, I know how that feeling limits the horizons of far too many of our young people.
According to Twitchy, Obama s remarks went largely unnoticed outside of the event, until a local radio host reported on Museums as White Spaces.
The first lady likely won t be answering that question any time soon.
The tone of her speech was eerily similar to her husband s remarks during the launch of My Brother s Keeper Alliance in New York City on Monday.
In the wake of racial tension and turmoil that has prompted riots throughout the country, President Obama unleashed some of his most overt commentary on race yet, as documented by Twitchy.
