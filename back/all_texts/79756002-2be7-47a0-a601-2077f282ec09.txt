In an unreal feat, Trump managed to have two humiliating interviews come out on the same day.
While much of the country (and indeed, the world) was laughing at Trump for his insane screed about the Civil War, CBS News released their own interview with Trump which showed the president descending into sheer madness when pressed to support his (false) claim that President Obama wiretapped him.
For those worried about the mental stability of the person currently within arm s reach of America s nuclear arsenal, it was perhaps the more disturbing of the two interviews.You can almost hear Trump s staffers groan when he, out of nowhere, brings up the wiretap claims.
Sensing a moment to finally press Trump on these unsubstantiated smears of his predecessor, CBS s John Dickerson asks Trump pointblank whether he still stands by the accusations that Obama is a bad and sick guy who had committed felonies on par with Nixon s Watergate scandal.
Since making the claims, Trump s arguments have been repeatedly debunked and zero evidence to support him has emerged.
Has he changed his mind?Just the opposite.
He appears to have become even more delusional: I think our side s been proven very strongly and everybody s talking about it and frankly, it should be discussed.
Trump added, We should find out what the hell is going on.
Dickerson: I m asking you because you don t want it to be fake news.
I want to hear it from President Trump.
Trump: You don t have to ask me.
You don t have to ask me.
Dickerson: Why not?
Trump: Because I have my own opinions, you can have your own opinions.
Dickerson points out that Trump s own opinions are kind of important because he s the president of the United States.
At this point, Trump shuts down completely, ending the interview and running to his desk.
The last shot the camera captures is Trump visibly fuming.
Facts, it seems, irritate him.Featured image via CBS News
