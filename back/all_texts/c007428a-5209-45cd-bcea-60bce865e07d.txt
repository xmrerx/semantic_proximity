When it gets down to it, what this sheriff said is the heart of the problem.
He nails it!Spokane County Sheriff Knezovich was brutally honest after a school shooting last September: You started glorifying cultures of violence you ve glorified the gang culture, you ve glorified games that actually give you points for raping and killing people.
Gun didn t change.
We changed.
Of course, he was brutally attacked for telling the truth.
They said he blamed everything but the gun Yes he did.This young gentleman got sucked into a counterculture of violence, a culture that is enamored with school shootings.
And media, you are to blame for that, because you keep giving these people headlines.
You keep using their names.
You have made them heroes to some people.
If I had my way, none of these people s names would ever be remembered.Where did we really go sideways in raising our kids?
Perhaps we taught them to glorify the wrong things.
All this violence that they constantly consume has come home to pay a major price.
It is time for each and every one of us to say no more to the hate that we see, to the violence that we see.Lawmakers on both the right and the left, you re both enamored by radicalized hate.
You seem to hate everybody and everything.
It s time for you to end that too.They [the federal government] have pushed this problem to the local level, and the local level is not equipped to deal with it.
This is a state and national issue that they better wake up and start dealing with.You started glorifying cultures of violence.
You glorified gang culture.
You glorified games that actually give you points for raping and killing people.
