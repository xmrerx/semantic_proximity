tucker carlson is spot on in his commentary regarding cnn s coverage of the russia scam .
it gets even better when mark steyn joins tucker to comment on the idiocy of cnn s reporting on a nothing burger .the metaphors are many elmo , potato chips cnn is flying the network into a black hole and the only plot twist left is anderson cooper and elmo in a spaceship trying to repair a rupture in the space-time continuum in case you missed it : van jones calls the russia scam a nothing burger the russia thing is a big nothing burger mark steyn s previous commentary on the testimony regarding russia is spot on : mark steyn is fantastic !
he was on tucker carlson to discuss the intel hearing today on the russia investigation .
he sees through all of the total bs the dems were throwing out in their testimony on trump and russia .
