Bill Clinton just watched his wife accept the nomination for President of the United States.
His wife, a former Senator and former Secretary of State, has literally made history as being the first woman nominee for a major political party.No doubt Bill Clinton must have been immensely proud of this extraordinary lady.
His gleaming face said it all during her speech, and during his daughter, Chelsea s.Aside from everything just accomplished by Hillary, Bill seemed to be really smitten by one thing in particular: the balloons.As Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine walked up and down the stage, with their families by their sides, thousands of red, white and blue balloons were released from the rafters, pouring down on the Clintons and the Kaines.And Bill had the time of his life.Watch just how giddy former President Bill Clinton got, courtesy if Now This Election:Users from Twitter and other social media outlets had a field day with the former president s excitement:bill: hey hill check this out hillary hey hillary hill hey hillary check this out hillary look what i hill hillary pic.twitter.com/MAbRFW1yeY Ingrid Ostby (@ingridostby) July 29, 2016 if you need me today, i ll be looking at photos of @billclinton staring at balloons with childlike wonder pic.twitter.com/4fw0LUIuxc Emma Gray (@emmaladyrose) July 29, 2016find someone who loves you as much as @billclinton loves balloons pic.twitter.com/d2e6NOu9Lw Morgan Anderson (@themorganleigh) July 29, 2016This is why we love Bill Clinton.
Of course conservatives attacked him for having just a little bit of fun after history was just made.But after ushering in the largest economic expansion in U.S. history, keeping our nation safe, and overseeing more Americans put back to work than any other modern president, he deserves a little fun.
And quite frankly, he probably doesn t care what anyone thinks about him at this point, nor should he.And let s be honest: there isn t anyone who didn t wish they were on that stage playing with those balloons.Featured image via Andrew P. Bernstein/Getty Images
