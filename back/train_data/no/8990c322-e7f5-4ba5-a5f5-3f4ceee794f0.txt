you can often figure a lot out about a person by what they pay attention to , and in the age of twitter , by who they follow on twitter .
and while donald trump follows his kids , his organization , and many higher-ups in the gop , he also just started following a new profile emergency kittens.see here : via twitternow , there s the obvious joke that trump following a profile that claims to critique cats is very befitting , considering he loves to critique women and has referred to a specific body part as , well , you know .
however , let s try to look past that , and look more at the fact that the next president is staring at kittens on twitter and only following 43 profiles , including that one.what sorts of tweets does emergency kittens put out ?
here s a sample : me when mom calls me down for dinner but it 's not ready yet pic.twitter.com/e2cvj1ewuq emergency kittens ( @ emrgencykittens ) january 2 , 2017cats have ruled us since the dawn of time pic.twitter.com/y5g8yvfkvr emergency kittens ( @ emrgencykittens ) january 1 , 2017pic.twitter.com/yik4l0aivw emergency kittens ( @ emrgencykittens ) january 1 , 2017fat cat just waiting until his shift is over .

not sure whether to appreciate the fact that he likes looking at adorable kitten photos , proving he may , in fact , actually be human , or be slightly alarmed that the president-elect may need to look at these photos as a means to calm down .
either way it s still funny.update : he has since stopped following the kittens .
too bad , really .
