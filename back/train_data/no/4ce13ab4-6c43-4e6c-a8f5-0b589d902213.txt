madrid/barcelona ( reuters ) - spanish authorities have done enough to discredit and prevent a planned referendum this sunday on independence in catalonia , two senior government officials told reuters on monday , though they may now let a secession party happen .
there may be a party on sunday at which , on squares and in streets , some voting stalls may be installed and a mock vote may take place .
but it will not be a referendum , one of the officials said on condition of anonymity .
the officials said catalonia lacked a proper election commission , ballots boxes , ballot papers , a transparent census and election material , and other material needed to hold the vote .
they also said the result of the vote or a potential unilateral declaration of independence afterwards would not be granted any international recognition or legitimacy .
not even venezuela or north korea will recognize it .
and if they do , i am not sure it would help the independence campaign a lot , the official said .
