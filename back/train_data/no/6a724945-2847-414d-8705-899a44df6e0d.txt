another item obama can check off his bucket list more than a quarter million muslims have become registered voters since the last presidential election , a muslim group reported on tuesday.in june there were 824,000 registered muslim voters whose first , middle or last names matched a list of 43,538 traditionally muslim names , according to the council on american-islamic relations , which used a private national database of voter information .
that number represents a significant bump from the 500,000 voters the group accounted for in 2012 , using the same method.one reason for the surge , cair suggests , is increased political involvement resulting from rhetorical attacks on that faith community by public figures .
while the press release does not mention gop presumptive nominee donald trump by name , it does contain two links to articles about how the candidate is attacking muslims and fueling prejudice , hate incidents .
cair government affairs director robert mccaw applauded the muslim community for its efforts to get out the vote , and slammed hostile proposals made by trump over the course of his campaign , including a ban on muslims entering the united states .
as a community under the pressure of hostile political rhetoric calling for profiling of american muslims , muslim immigration bans and warrantless surveillance of mosques , we must utilize all the tools of positive civic engagement to preserve religious freedom and other constitutional rights , said mccaw.earlier in the month , cair launched a nonpartisan voter campaign , titled muslims vote , to encourage increased participation by american muslims in the 2016 election cycle .
the campaign looks for ways to get american muslims involved in a number of activities , including volunteering , voter registration and hosting candidate forums .
