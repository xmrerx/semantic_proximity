The earliest actual poll to come out of last night s debate was a CNN/ORC poll showing that 62 percent of respondents believed Hillary had won the debate.
However, there are a ton of polls that were conducted online that say Trump won in a landslide.
How can that be?Here s The Huffington Post to answer that question:Are polls like this an accurate measure of how the electorate responded to Monday s debate?
Huffington Post (@HuffingtonPost) September 27, 2016Why is this obvious joke of a poll so damning for all the online polls claiming Trump destroyed Hillary?
Because this shows how online polls are meaningless.
CNN actually contacted people.
Anybody and everybody can answer an online poll.
The results generally skew heavily to one side or the other, depending on the outlet s usual audience and which organizations/social media channels post poll links.There s also the fact that Trumpkins from both 4chan and Reddit were stuffing last night s poll boxes, proving how easy it is to manipulate online polls.Of course, the Trumpkins aren t happy with HuffPo at all for blowing those delusions out of the water:@HuffingtonPost someone s upset that #Trumpwins Jim (@Jimbags12) September 27, 2016@HuffingtonPost are middle schoolers doing reporting for you guys?

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016Such a great honor.
Final debate polls are in and the MOVEMENT wins!#AmericaFirst #MAGA #ImWithYouhttps://t.co/3KWOl2ibaW pic.twitter.com/sfCEE3I5pF Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 27, 2016He tweeted a story from the Daily Mail, too, that carries a headline saying, Majority of snap polls show Trump won debate by a landslide despite CNN s overwhelming victory for Hillary in biggest official survey.
They actually looks like they re calling the results of the CNN poll into question with screencaps of every online poll in existence.Self-selecting polls aside, the result is pretty damn clear.
