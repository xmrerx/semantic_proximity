tokyo ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump and japanese prime minister shinzo abe agreed in a telephone conversation on wednesday that pressure should be maintained on north korea , a senior japanese government official told reporters .
the two men also agreed that dialogue for the purpose of dialogue was meaningless , the official said .
in recent weeks north korea has launched two missiles over japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test , and may be fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland .
u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said last weekend that washington was directly communicating with pyongyang on its nuclear and missile programs but that pyongyang had shown no interest in dialogue .
trump later dismissed any prospect of talks with north korea as a waste of time .
during the 12-minute telephone conversation , abe also offered condolences over the mass shooting in las vegas , and told trump that japan was 100 percent behind the american people .
trump will be traveling to japan , china , south korea , vietnam and the philippines next month .
