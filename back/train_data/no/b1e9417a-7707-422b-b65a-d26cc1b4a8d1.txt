unlike our racist , anti-american president , this brilliant louisiana state senator , elbert lee guillory is color blind .
he is not however , blind to obama and his radical agenda .
his comments represent what so many americans believe about obama and the liberal democrat party .
his plea for obama to stop leaving america vulnerable to terrorists and nations who hate us is heartbreaking history will remember you , mr. president as a weakling .
from his facebook page : today america is at war with isis .
they attack our soldiers , our homeland and our friends .
when our law abiding citizens need to protect our streets and communities most , president obama chooses this same moment to limit our gun rights .
this is my response to his unbelievable position .
