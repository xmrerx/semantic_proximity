jesus f * cking christ our president * is a moron .
not satisfied with simply wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on a border wall , the donald wants it to be see-through too not to preserve the view of scenery but because he s afraid people might be killed by gigantic sacks of drugs that are totally going to be thrown over it on a regular basis ( thus negating his argument that the wall will somehow curb drug trafficking ) .
as horrible as it sounds , when they throw the large sacks of drugs over , and if you have people on the other side of the wall , you don t see them they hit you on the head with 60 pounds of the stuff ?
it s over , the president said aboard air force one wednesday according to the official white house transcript .
as cray as that sounds , you need transparency through that wall .
trump says border wall with mexico should be transparent so that people are n't killed when drug couriers throw 60-lbs .
bags over it .
pic.twitter.com/0gxjuhjpxs gregory korte ( @ gregorykorte ) july 13 , 2017it s unclear if trump actually said cray or if the white house stenographer made a typo , but the idea that we will be so beleaguered by so many flying 60-pound sacks of drugs that the border wall needs to be transparent is pretty cray .
now , trump could have argued that there are a number of reasons for transparency to see those dirty brownish people he hates coming , for instance .
but he chose the dumb one that involves throwing a 60-pound bag of heroin over a 20-foot fence.naturally , americans find this hilarious : the bad hombres are very strong .

tinz ( @ tinzrules ) july 13 , 2017likelihood that trump heard someone say we need transparency on the building of the wall and didn t understand ?

north korean propaganda of course or what seems like north korean propaganda until you realize it s a parody account : six innocent children killed by south korean criminals hurling huge sacks of illegal drugs over inter-korean demilitarized zone wall .
pic.twitter.com/bfnnlbis4e dprk news service ( @ dprk_news ) july 13 , 2017if you re thinking this is disgraceful even for trump , you probably should be aware that we have not yet seen the depths to which he is willing to sink in his quest for power.we need to face the fact that our president is completely cray and let the gop know they need to do their jobs and remove him from office now.featured image via getty images/screengrab
