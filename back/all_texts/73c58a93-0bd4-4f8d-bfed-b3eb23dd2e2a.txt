Republican governor Rick Scott of Florida had a big smirk on his face and was talking with confidence during an interview with Morning Joe co-host Joe Scarborough.
The fun Scott seemed to be having abruptly ended when Scarborough asked him one simple question: Would you tell your friend Donald Trump that he should walk back his statements that Muslims, that Islam, hates America?
Do you think Muslims in the state of Florida hate America?
Scarborough was referencing Trump s recent statement that Muslims hate America.
Not only did Rick Scott refuse to refute Trump s statement, but he dodged the question multiple times, talking about how great his state is in terms of being a melting pot and other stupid statements.
Scarborough pressed Scott again: I want you to answer the question!
Do you personally think that Islam is a religion that hates America?
Scott again refused to answer the question with more red herrings and continued to talk more about his state.
No, no.
That s not answering any questions, jumped in co-host Mika Brzezinski.
She then cut him down, had his mic shut off and when Rick Scott attempted to speak again, it became clear his mic had been shut off.
Back from commercial, Brzezinski stated to the viewers, That s just not what we do on our show.
It was an amazing display of a journalist taking control of an interview.
More importantly, Brzezinski sent a message that refusing to condemn hate speech is no different than actually spewing it when she kicked this idiot off the show.Watch Here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZI-gLvJePlQ] Featured image via video screenshot.
