how much longer before cops stop coming into the neighborhoods to help the people who hate them ?
the following is a statement from ebonie riley , washington dc bureau chief of the national action network : we are disappointed in the decision of the court but unfortunately not surprised .
as we have seen throughout the years , when officers opt for a trial by judge rather than by a jury , acquittal is the result .
we have been through this with sean bell and far too many other cases in the past .
this is exactly the reason we are calling for lowering the bar for federal prosecution , and greater involvement of the federal government in cases like this .
in federal court , a jury trial can not be waived without the consent of the prosecution and we believe that is a fairer , more just process .
we continue to stand with the gray family as they fight for justice for their son .
