Oh, Mr. Spicey.
Our favorite press secretary because we love to hate him.
His gymnastics around Donald Trump s antics and gaffes (along with his own) are already the stuff of legend, and not in a good way.
It makes his relationship with the press acrimonious, and he may well have just about had it with that.
Today, he turned chickenshit, tucked his tail between his legs, and ran away from his own press briefing, leaving the White House Press Corps absolutely stunned.Cries of, Sean!
Hey Sean!
Seeeeeean!
Ah come on, Sean!
He walked away!
are among just a few of the loud and disappointed protests coming from a press corps that undoubtedly had a squillion uncomfortable questions for him.Watch below:.

pic.twitter.com/2xHZdKhTkm (@slickvandal) May 2, 2017Some of the media are unhappy with this development, too, and really not afraid to say so.
Mother Jones called it the soundtrack for a presidency.
The Hill said that Spicer stunned reporters.
Market Watch noted that the press was left volleying questions toward an empty podium: Sean?
Sean?
Hey, Sean, come on!
What about the Putin call, Sean?
The caption under their photo reads, It just like concluded.
The Root had its own take: Perhaps Spicer needed some time to compose the alternative facts he knew he d have to present after Salmon-Skin Stalin said Tuesday that the new budget has enough money for a down payment on the wall, and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), the Senate Appropriations Committee s ranking Democratic member, responded on Twitter with, To be clear, there is NO funding in this bill for ANY kind of down payment on construction of a new border wall.
Or, maybe Spicer was nervous about responding to Trump s tweets from earlier Tuesday insisting that the government needed a good shutdown.'
While some blindly loyal Trump supporters are saying that he just owned the press, unfortunately for their narrative and for Spicey here, answering questions he doesn t necessarily like or want to answer is part and parcel of his job.
He doesn t get to run away when he doesn t want to talk, or without explaining that his time is getting cut short for something else.
Really, Spicer just got owned here.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
