what you need to know : in all 50 state capitals and the district of columbia , electors chosen by the state parties of the candidate who carried their state , trump or hillary clinton will meet to cast their ballots .
there s no national meeting of the electoral college .
instead , electors gather in each state usually in the capitol.under federal law , though , electors must gather on december 19 .
and each elector must sign six copies certifying their votes for president and vice president.two ballots go to the national archives .
one goes to the president of the senate .
two go to their state s chief elections officer .
and one goes to a local judge .
after monday s votes , there is still one last step : on january 6 , congress has to officially count the electoral votes .
vice president joe biden will preside over the count .
lawmakers can technically object in writing , with objections signed by at least one house and one senate member to individual electoral votes or entire states results .
if the house and senate support that objection , the vote or votes in question are thrown out .
but that has never happened .
after the votes are counted , the results are final , and trump is officially set for his inauguration at noon on january 20.read more : cnn
