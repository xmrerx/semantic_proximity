ankara ( reuters ) - turkish security forces killed five kurdish militants in the southwestern province of mugla on thursday , broadcaster ntv said , marking a rare clash in an aegean coastal region popular with foreign tourists .
security forces carried out an operation against a group of seven militants from the outlawed kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) in mugla s koycegiz district , ntv said .
two of the militants were still being sought , it said .
on wednesday , security forces captured four kurdish militants and three others helping them near mugla s seydikemer district , ntv said .
mugla is the site of major tourist destinations , including bodrum and marmaris on turkey s southwest coast .
nearly all of the fighting with the pkk happens in the mainly kurdish southeast on the opposite side of the country .
on wednesday mugla hosted the highest profile case related to last year s abortive putsch , in which the court found 42 former soldiers guilty of trying to kill president tayyip erdogan .
it was not immediately clear if the militants presence in mugla was related to that case .
the autonomy-seeking pkk , considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union , has waged a three-decade insurgency against the turkish state .
more than 40,000 people have died in the conflict .
