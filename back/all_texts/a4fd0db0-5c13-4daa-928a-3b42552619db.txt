Donald Trump thought he could distract America from his insane, self-destructing campaign by releasing what he called a policy proposal.
He thought wrong.See, Trump s latest proposal only did one thing it highlighted the sheer irony of the entire Trump campaign/manifesto/ideology.
While himself being an anti-gay, anti-woman, anti-rule of law candidate, Trump wants to put in place a litmus test for immigrants (mostly Muslims) that asks them, point blank, if they support women s rights, gay rights, and the rule of law.Well that didn t go over so well for a lot of people, including Hillary Clinton.
While Trump thought he could have everybody fooled, Clinton reminded the public just who he really is an idiot:You oppose reproductive rights, support conversion therapy, and proposed a Muslim ban.

That term is subjective anyways, with a wide range of applicability being considered.Hillary Clinton has done a good job of pointing out Trump s faults whether they be his taxes, his fraud of a university, his proposals and so forth.Featured image via Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images
