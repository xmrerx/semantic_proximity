What a funny guy!
I m sure every woman on that campaign plane that he violated with his repulsive, narcissistic, denigrating behavior was really impressed.
Thank God Trump didn t do that.
It would have been career ending.
For Obama however, it was just all fun and games, and apparently not even worth CNN s time to release the tape until his two terms were up As Donald Trump weathers a storm of controversy over randy comments he made to TV celebrity reporter Billy Bush in 2005, new video to emerge from the 2008 presidential campaign shows now-President Obama appearing to behave just as salaciously.
Aboard a campaign flight, then-Senator Obama is talking on a cellphone as he arises from his seat; nearby a female reporter catches a glance of something that makes her uncomfortable, sending her skirmishing to the back of the plane.Obama, rather than downplay the awkward display, instead plays it up, positioning himself so the gathered reporters have little choice but to take in his chauvinistic performance.Meanwhile, a female voice can be heard ordering everyone to sit down, ostensibly so they can get a better look.
The gathered female reporters laugh at the scene, further encouraging Obama s bawdy behavior.The video, originally shot by CNN cameras, emerged Tuesday onTwitter, where it spread quickly.Via: Grabian
