brussels ( reuters ) - the future free trade agreement between the european union and britain will have to be along the same lines as the one the eu has with canada , the eu s chief brexit negotiation michel barnier said on friday .
barnier said that there was no other option , given britain s terms for a future relationship with the eu , after it leaves the bloc in 2019 .
britain does not want to be part of the eu s single market , customs union or be subject to rulings by the european court of justice .
if you take that - what are you left with ?
just one thing : a free trade agreement on the canadian model , barnier told a news conference .
