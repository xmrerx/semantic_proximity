Martin Sheen channeled his President Jed Bartlett character from The West Wing to call upon voters to tell Senate Republicans to obey the Constitution.As conservative groups mobilize and begin spending massive amounts of money to keep Republicans to their word that they will refuse to even hold hearings on any of President Obama s Supreme Court nominees to fill the vacant seat Antonin Scalia leaves behind, People For The American Way is fighting back with a campaign of their own.
The strategy is to use Sheen in a series of robocalls designed to urge voters to shame Republican senators from Wisconsin and Pennsylvania into doing their jobs.Specifically, the calls target Senator Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and Senator Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania.
Our Constitution is very clear about what happens when a vacancy occurs of the Supreme Court, Sheen says in the call.
It says the President shall nominate a new judge and that the Senate will give that nominee a fair consideration.
But as you may have heard, Republicans are playing politics with out Constitution and with the Supreme Court.
Sheen then goes after Johnson for saying that he doesn t think Senate Republicans should even give a hearing to any nominee.
That s clearly irresponsible and it puts partisanship above the law, Sheen says before asking voters to call Johnson and tell him to put his constitutional duties first and give fair consideration to President Obama s nominee.
Here s the audio of the Wisconsin robocall via Talking Points Memo.This isn t the first time Martin Sheen has urged voters to stand up for American values.
In 2014, he appeared in an ad asking Kentucky voters to elect Alison Lundergan Grimes over Mitch McConnell so that Social Security and Medicare will continue to be safe and made stronger.As we all know, McConnell ended up winning another term in the Senate, which he is now using disgracefully to disobey the Constitution and politicize the Supreme Court instead of doing his job responsibly by holding confirmation hearings for whoever President Obama nominates to fill Scalia s seat.Hopefully, voters won t ignore Sheen s call this time around.
