When Hillary Clinton called about half of Donald Trump s supporters a basket of deplorables, she was a bit off-base not because she insulted them by calling them what they are, but because half is far too generous.Recently, a seven-year-old girl in Aleppo that s the place Gary Johnson doesn t know about has been getting quite a bit of attention with her tweets about the horrors of her existence.
Bana, like many others, is trapped in the Eastern part of the city with dwindling supplies and a constant fear of death and her tweets about her daily reality are both horrifying and endearing.Tonight we have no house, it's bombed & I got in rubble.
I saw deaths and I almost died.

In between death and life now, please keep praying for us.
#Aleppo Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) November 28, 2016We have no home now.
I got minor injury.
I didn't sleep since yesterday, I am hungry.
I want to live, I don't want to die.

Bana pic.twitter.com/6fXX2Me8ZB Bana Alabed (@AlabedBana) November 29, 2016On Sunday, the little girl disappeared from social media, leaving an ominous message behind indicating that she is not safe.
But fortunately, the BBC reports that she and her mother, who often tweets on her behalf, managed to escape to an undisclosed location.
Bana s story has touched many, including J.K. Rowling, whose Harry Potter series Bana loves, and the world is in awe at the child s bravery well, aside from ISIS and the American Right.
They don t like her too much at all.While many have expressed sympathy for Bana s plight and have left messages of love and hope, the Basket has been relentlessly trolling the little girl because they really aren t joking when they call them selves Deplorable Dave and other appropriated insults.
They wear the title give to them by the former Secretary of State as a badge of honor.
@VivaSyrianAA @AlabedBana Her father won't let her have a good life.
Uses her as a Wahhabi terrorist propaganda ploy.

All they know is that she s a Muslim, which means she s not human enough for anything approaching whatever level of compassion of which they are capable.Watch an interview with Bana below:Featured image via Twitter
