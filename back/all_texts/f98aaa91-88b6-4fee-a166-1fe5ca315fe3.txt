Much to the Republican party s dismay, bigotry and intolerance doesn t sit well with even the most God-fearing American voters anymore.
According to data from a new Pew poll on religion and this year s election, the GOP is actually striking out with Catholic voters a demographic that the party used to have in the bag.
And it gets worse not only are Catholic voters leaving the GOP in droves, but they re opting to support Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton instead.Pew reported that Clinton is leading Trump among Catholic voters, and Trump is partially to blame much of the demographic that is supporting her are Latino Catholics, which Trump has insulted and offended throughout his campaign:Currently, Clinton also holds a 17-point advantage among Catholic registered voters, driven largely by overwhelming support for Clinton among Latino Catholics.
By contrast, at a similar point in the 2012 campaign, Catholics were closely divided between support for Obama (49%) and Romney (47%).
Exit polls conducted on Election Day in 2012 found that Catholics ultimately split their votes between Obama (50%) and Romney (48%).Here s a chart that outlines how different religious groups are currently voting, compared to the 2012 election between President Barack Obama and former presidential candidate Mitt Romney:Thanks to his divisive campaign and moronic behavior, Trump is striking out with every demographic that should be his strong point as a GOP candidate.
He s succeeded in dividing the Republican party and turning conservative voters away from the GOP, and now he s turning off religious voters that are usually very receptive to conservative values and talking points.It s entirely possible that when election day comes, Trump won t even be considered a threat to the former Secretary of State.
If he cannot rise to the performance level of Romney in 2012 in winning over America s religious voters, he doesn t even have the slightest chance.
Currently, Clinton is ahead of Trump by 17 Catholic voters and 42 unaffiliated voters.
