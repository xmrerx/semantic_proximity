ankara ( reuters ) - iraqi kurdish leader massoud barzani s decision not to postpone an independence referendum later this month is very wrong , turkish president tayyip erdogan said on friday .
speaking in an interview with broadcaster a haber , erdogan said turkey would announce its official position on the referendum after its national security council and cabinet have convened on sept. 22 .
earlier on friday barzani said the vote would not be delayed , despite pressing requests from the united states and other western powers worried that the tensions between baghdad and erbil would distract from the war on islamic state militants , who continue to occupy parts of iraq and syria .
