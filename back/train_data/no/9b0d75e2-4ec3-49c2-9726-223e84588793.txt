in 1998 , i lost my reputation and my dignity .
i lost everything and i almost lost my life -monica lewinsky , 2015here is monica lewinsky , now a 41 year old woman who is actually being paid to address audiences about how her affair with then president bill clinton destroyed her life .
what price did bill clinton pay for destroying this young girl s life ?
what price did hillary pay for enabling his behavior ( that bordered on pedophilia given the age difference between bill and monica ) ?
this young girl was slut shamed by the entire world while bill and hillary , unconcerned with her well-being , huddled together to work out the details of how they would deceive the world with lies and save their political careers and ambitions .
hillary even went so far as to call monica a narcissistic looney tune .
does anyone really believe the audience at this event had any desire to hear what monica lewinsky had to say about the age of media , and how it affects people s lives ?
they wanted to hear about what it was like to have an affair with the former president of the united states of america , who also happens to be a serial philanderer , and is still married to a woman who pretends to be a champion for other women .
the clinton machine made sure monica lewinsky didn t receive any compassion from the media .
she was made into a public joke , and humiliated by a rabid press who was looking for someone other than the clinton s to blame for the shame that bill clinton brought to the office of president of the united states.the clinton s never gave a damn about this young girl they only cared how about how they could spin it with the media , so as not to affect hillary s presidential ambitions
