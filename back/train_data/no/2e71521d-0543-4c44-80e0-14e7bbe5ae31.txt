beijing ( reuters ) - china s air force has carried out exercises near the korean peninsula , practicing to defend against a surprise attack coming over the sea , chinese state media said .
the exercises came days after north korea s sixth , and most powerful , nuclear test fueled global concern that the isolated nation plans more weapons tests , possibly of a long-range missile .
an anti-aircraft defense battalion held the exercises early on tuesday , near the bohai sea , the innermost gulf of the yellow sea that separates china from the korean peninsula , an official military website said .
troops traveled to the site from central china before immediately beginning drills to fend off the surprise attack simulating real battle , it said .
the troops rapid response capabilities and actual combat levels have effectively been tested .
it was the first time certain weapons , which the website did not identify , had been used to shoot down low-altitude targets coming over the sea , www.81.cn said , without elaborating .
the drills do not target any particular goal or country , and were part of an annual plan intended to boost the troops capability , china s defence ministry said on its website late on wednesday , in a response to media .
after weeks of rising tension over north korea s actions , south korea and the united states have been discussing the deployment of aircraft carriers and strategic bombers to the korean peninsula .
china is deeply suspicious of any u.s.-backed military build-up in the region , and has repeatedly expressed anger at the deployment of a u.s. anti-missile defense system in south korea .
