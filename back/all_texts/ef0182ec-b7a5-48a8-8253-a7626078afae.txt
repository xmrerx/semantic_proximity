VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s parliamentary election on Sunday involves three large parties polling above 20 percent and a host of smaller parties that polls show on roughly 6 percent or less, with 4 percent being the threshold for obtaining seats.
The frontrunner, the conservative People s Party, has been polling on roughly a third of the vote, and it is highly unlikely any party will obtain a majority.
The winner will probably need to form a coalition with another large party to govern.
Below are policies of the three biggest parties in parliament, taken mainly from their campaign programs.
