On Monday evening, Democrats held the Senate floor in protest of Trumpcare, the cruel GOP bill that would strip millions of their health care.
The American Health Care Act has been kept secret since it hit the Senate, with only 13 Senators working on the bill.
Most of the other senators, including both Republicans and Democrats, have not even been able to lay their eyes on the bill and have no idea what they are being asked to vote on.Republicans want to vote on the bill as early as possible and intend to keep the plan secret until they are sure they can push it through.
Democrats are crying foul and demanding that Republicans post the bill online and give the American people 30 days to review it before a vote is held.It is estimated that if the AHCA were to pass, more than 23 million people would lose their health care.
The bill guts protections for those with pre-existing conditions and is especially cruel to the elderly, who would find their premiums skyrocketing.
Make no mistake, if Republicans repeal and replace Obamacare with Trumpcare, people are going to die.
Lots of them.Senator Elizabeth Warren posted live video of Senate Democrats waging war against Trumpcare on the Senate floor.
At the time of this writing, they had held the floor for more than three hours.
