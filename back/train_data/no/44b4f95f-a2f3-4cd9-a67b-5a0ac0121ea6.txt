the obama family continues to rack up huge bills on transportation alone when they take the thinly veiled humanitarian vacations at the taxpayer s expense .
the bill for air transportation is huge !
i can only imagine what the grand total will be.michelle obama s june trip to italy and the united kingdom cost taxpayers more than $ 200,000 on air transportation alone , according to documents released by a government watchdog group.the documents , obtained by judicial watch after filing a freedom of information act request june 22 , found that the first lady s international trip in june ran $ 240,495.67 in airfare costs .
obama , who was accompanied by her mother and daughters , took the six-day trip in late june and made stops in london , milan , and vicenza .
according to the air force documents , the flights to london , england and milan , venice , and vicenza , italy , for the june 15 21 , 2015 , trip totaled 20:35 hours at the cost of $ 11,684 per hour , bringing the flight expense total to $ 240,495.67 , judicial watch writes.the watchdog also notes that despite the white house billing the event as a part of michelle s let girls learn and let s move campaign , michelle and company did their fair share of sightseeing on the trip and even sat down for tea at kensington place with prince harry.tom fitton , president of judicial watch , said that if obama wants to have tea with prince harry , she is entitled to do so but not on the taxpayers dime .
the obama family continues to bill the taxpayers for costly tourism jaunts thinly disguised as humanitarian crusades , said fitton .
if michelle obama wants to take tea with prince harry or enthuse over da vinci s the last supper , she is certainly entitled to do so , but not at taxpayer expense .
