berlin ( reuters ) - germany has tightened security at christmas markets across the country a year after a deadly truck attack on a berlin christmas market , with conservative chancellor angela merkel under fire from victims relatives for her handling of the case .
anis amri , a failed tunisian asylum seeker with islamist links , hijacked a truck on dec. 19 , killed the driver and then plowed it into a crowded berlin christmas market , killing 11 more people and injuring dozens of others .
about 2,600 christmas markets reopened in late november with added security staff on patrol and concrete barriers to protect shoppers .
merkel this week paid a surprise visit to the site of the attack , where a permanent memorial for victims will be unveiled on tuesday .
she will meet on monday with relatives of victims , many of whom say they felt neglected by the government after the attack .
in an open letter to merkel published in der spiegel magazine this month , victims and survivors complained that the chancellor had not met with them personally .
kurt beck , a social democratic politician who is representing victims and survivors , told reporters merkel s handling of the tragedy stood in contrast with how the french government had responded to terrorist attacks in paris .
he also blasted what he called an unbelievable case in which the family of one victim was sent a bill for an autopsy and then hounded by bill collectors .
there are incidents which must not be repeated , beck said , urging the government to increase hardship compensation for the victims relatives and the survivors .
german officials say they have tightened security and increased information sharing among security forces after investigations exposed a range of failures in the amri case .
but experts say much work remains to be done .
cooperation between intelligence agencies and between police authorities must be improved , said malte roschniski , a berlin security expert .
