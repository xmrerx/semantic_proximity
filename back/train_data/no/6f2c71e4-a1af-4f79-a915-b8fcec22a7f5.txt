black lives matter but only when white cops are responsible for their deaths .
when blacks kill other blacks not so much .
kudos to the fred l. davis insurance company for telling the truth about who s really doing the killing in black communities.that s the statement on a billboard in memphis , tennessee .
however , there s more to it.the full message reads : black lives matter .
so let s quit killing each other .
it s a statement directed against black-on-black crime.normally , liberals take umbrage at the idea that somebody might evaluate problems caused within the black community by other blacks because it doesn t suit the narrative .
however , the author of this message has a background that will make it difficult for people to attack him like that.fred davis is a civil rights activist who reportedly marched with dr. martin luther king , jr .
he s also the man behind the message .
we re going to have to wake up , davis said .
we re going to have to say to ourselves that black lives matter , and we re going to have to refrain from killing each other out of our own frustration .
i can speak , not from reading a book about the history , because i was a part of the history , he said .
i think that gives me a license as an experienced observer to push and to advocate to the black community let s stop it .
fred l. davis is no stranger to controversy .
here is one of his previous billboards : via : downtrend
