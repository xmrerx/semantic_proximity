berlin ( reuters ) - german police on monday published videos showing three former members of the red army faction ( raf ) militant group taking part in a 2016 armed robbery in northern germany , and called for public help to track them down .
the left-wing militia , which arose out of the student protests of the late 1960s , was suspected of killing 34 people between 1972 and 1991 .
the group formally disbanded in 1998 with many members slipping back into ordinary lives .
the three former members being sought - two men and a woman aged between 49 and 63 - have been on the run for more than 25 years .
since 2011 , they have been suspected of involvement in robberies in which more than 370,000 euros have been stolen from supermarkets and money transfer stores .
the new security camera videos from july 2016 , show two men strolling into a supermarket in the central city of hildesheim with their faces covered , before they suddenly raise a gun at one of the employees and force him into a room .
the other video showed the two standing in a bus in osnabruck , lower saxony , carrying bulging backpacks .
[ goo.gl/7u811o ] german police officers have visited more than 4,000 car dealers to trace the suspects , who buy cheap cars weeks before their robberies .
a reward of 80,000 euros has been offered to anyone who provides significant information about them .
the raf captured world headlines in 1977 with their kidnapping and killing of industrialist hanns martin schleyer .
they hoped to secure the release of guerrilla comrades held in a high security prison in stuttgart .
twenty years ago , german authorities said they believed most of raf s members were either dead , in jail or now living ordinary lives .
