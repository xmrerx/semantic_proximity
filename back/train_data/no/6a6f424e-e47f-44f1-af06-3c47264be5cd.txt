london ( reuters ) - britain s leading business and union bodies jointly urged the british government and european union on thursday to guarantee their citizens rights after brexit takes place in march 2019 .
the uncertainty facing four million expatriate european and british citizens has become intolerable , said the heads of the confederation of british industry ( cbi ) and trades union congress ( tuc ) - who often sit on opposite sides of the corporate negotiating table .
millions of workers and thousands of firms are today united in their call to leaders on both sides to find an urgent solution , the cbi s carolyn fairbairn and the tuc s frances o grady said in a joint statement .
the issue of expatriate citizens rights has become a stumbling block in bilateral talks over britain s divorce .
chief eu negotiator michel barnier said concessions made last week by uk prime minister theresa may went in the right direction , but not far enough to move negotiations forward .
describing the current situation as human poker , fairbairn and o grady said a clear guarantee of the right to remain for citizens in britain and the eu was needed within weeks .
the cbi and tuc said eu citizens accounted for 10 percent of registered doctors and 4 percent of nurses in britain .
millions more work in the public and private sectors delivering public services and making a vital contribution to our economy , they said .
eu citizens giving evidence to a scottish parliamentary committee on europe said they had missed job opportunities in the uk due to confusion among employers on the need for a permanent residency card , which costs 160 pounds ( $ 215 ) and can only be obtained by filling out an 80-page form .
but it is unclear whether the card will be valid post-brexit when they will then need to apply for settled status , under proposals currently being discussed .
