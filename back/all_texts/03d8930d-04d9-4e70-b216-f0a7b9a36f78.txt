A timer was attached to the homemade bomb used in the Parsons Green terror attack, according to reports.The improvised explosive device may have been detonated on the rush-hour Tube train remotely, security sources told the BBC and Sky News.The bomb, which injured at least 22 people, is thought to have failed to properly ignite.Police are combing through CCTV footage from the London Underground network after launching a manhunt for the person planted the device, which was carried inside a Lidl freezer bag.Pictures posted on social media appeared to show wires emerging from a bucket filled with chemicals on the floor of the carriage.Explosive experts told the BBC the images appeared to show deflagration in which a substance burns away rapidly rather than detonation, which would have killed anyone nearby.It is believed police could be helped considerably by the fact the device was not destroyed by the blast.Detectives are investigating whether the attacker left the District line train before it reached Parsons Green or fled amid the chaos as the blast sparked a stampede among panicked commuters.Passengers were pushed and trampled on as they sought to escape from the train, according to witnesses.Most of the 22 people taken to hospital suffered flash burns in the explosion, said Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley.

Must be proactive!
