As Donald Trump continues down his path of self destruction (which is bringing the Republican Party down with him), members of the GOP controlled Senate are running scared and they should be.
Trump is literally ruining the Republican s hope of keeping their majority.One Senator in particular is making it his mission to distance his re-election bid from the monstrosity that is Donald J. Trump.Pennsylvania Republican Pat Toomey, who resides in a swing state very weary of Trump s antics, told reporters that voters should separate his run from Trump when they go to the ballot box in November and that they can see for themselves that the two are not similar.Pennsylvania voters are really quite sophisticated and they know for sure that Donald Trump is really in a category unto himself.
So they will make their decision about the presidential race, and then they will make a completely separate decision about the person they want representing them in the Senate.Toomey has not endorsed Trump as of yet, but did say he is waiting and watching before he makes a decision.According to RealClearPolitics, Toomey and Katie McGinty, his formidable Democratic challenger, are tied.
The McGinty campaign didn t waste time in quickly tying the two together, saying, Pennsylvanians understand that it s a Trump-Toomey ticket, and added:If he opposes Clinton, as he says he does, he s by definition supporting not only Trump, but the policies and values Trump would bring to the White House.So now instead of refusing to endorse, Republican candidates are literally telling voters not to think about Trump when voting for them.
Republicans are now asking voters to pretend Donald Trump isn t on the ballot.
They re asking the electorate, in a presidential campaign election, to disregard their down-ballot obligations are create two brands of conservatism to suit the GOP s needs.Let that all sink in.
That s how desperate they have become.If Toomey were serious about keeping his seat and holding on to any shred of dignity he might have once had, he would quickly and unequivocally denounce Trump and the vile things that have come out of his mouth.
As Clinton leads the state by 8 points (and growing), Toomey needs all the respect he can get.The implosion is going strong, and they are tearing each other apart.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
