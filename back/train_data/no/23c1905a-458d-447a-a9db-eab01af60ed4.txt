seoul ( reuters ) - north korea congratulated china on its 19th communist party congress on wednesday amid increasingly frayed relationships between the traditional allies , as china tightens sanctions over pyongyang s nuclear weapons program .
the central committee of the north s ruling workers party of korea said that china had made great progress in accomplishing the cause of building socialism with chinese characteristics under the correct guidance of the communist party .
we are greatly pleased over this , the party central committee said in the message carried by the official kcna news agency , adding that it sincerely wished the china congress satisfactory success .
chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said that many foreign political parties , organizations and dignitaries had sent their congratulations , including the workers party of korea .
this all shows that the international community is paying close attention to the 19th party congress .
we express our thanks for this , lu told a daily news briefing .
officials and experts in south korea had worried that pyongyang may conduct a weapons test to coincide with the opening of the twice-a-decade congress in beijing , but there was no sign of that as chinese president xi jinping gave his opening speech .
while the united states and its allies , and many people in china , believe beijing should do more to rein in pyongyang , the acceleration of north korea s nuclear and missile capabilities has coincided with a near-total breakdown of high-level diplomacy between the two .
china , pyongyang s sole major ally and which accounts for more than 90 percent of world trade with the isolated country , has said it will strictly enforce u.n. security council sanctions banning imports of coal , textiles and seafood , while cutting off oil shipments to the north .
