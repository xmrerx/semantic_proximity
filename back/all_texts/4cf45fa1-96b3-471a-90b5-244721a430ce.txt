With Bernie Sanders winning the Democratic Primary in West Virginia, it s left Donald Trump in quite a quandary.
It seems as if he s a bully with no direction.
Now he doesn t know if he should keep making up nicknames for Hillary Clinton, who is the Democratic frontrunner, or Bernie Sanders who is still putting up a mighty fight in the race.Although, it looks as though he s playing his cards very carefully, because he has still put in the time and effort to give Bernie his own nickname.
You know, just in case he needs it for later.Trump took to Twitter in yet another sophomoric hissy fit after the West Virginia primary, and said: I don t want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary.
His time will come!

Although, it seems his voters are doing more to hurt Hillary than Bernie in West Virginia, with four out of ten voters who voted for Bernie saying they d vote for Trump over Clinton in the fall.Nonetheless, pretty much every nickname Trump s handed out to people have been nicknames better suited for himself: Tiny Marco, Lyin Ted, Crooked Hillary, Goofy Elizabeth Warren, and now Crazy Bernie.
Maybe he believes if he projects his insecurities onto others, people won t notice it about himself.
Or is that too sound of a piece of logic?Trump truly seems to believe that he can bully himself into the White House and no one will notice that he s not at all qualified for the job of Commander-in-Chief.
He needs to realize that foreign policy and diplomacy are a lot harder than getting a clothing line into Macy s.Featured Photos by Chip Somodevilla, Alex Wong/Getty Images
