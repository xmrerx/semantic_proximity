Donald Trump has his sights set on a voting bloc he has not a chance in hell of winning: black people.
Despite Trump s blatant racism and other assorted forms of bigotry, he made the crazy claim that if elected, he d have 95% of the African American support by the time he runs for reelection in 2020.
Of course all sane people know this to be false.
It also seems that his own running mate thinks such an idea is pretty funny, too.Vice presidential candidate Mike Pence appeared on Fox News with host Ainsley Earhardt, and she asked him about The Donald s extraordinary statement.
Pence, of course, tried to spin and cover up his chuckling, and actually pretended he believes Donald Trump cares about black people.
Well, that s Donald Trump.
He has a heart for every American and he also, he s a truth-teller.
He speaks the truth.
It s been the failed policies of Democrat politicians that have, that have harmed people living in the cities in this country now for generations.
And it s had special impact on the African-American community.And his optimistic view about 2020 when he s running for reelection, that s pure Donald Trump.
He s speaking the truth but s also doing what a leader should do.
As President John F. Kennedy] said, We re going to advance policies that cause all ships to rise, to create new opportunities for every American.
Haha, good one, Governor Pence.
You know good and damn well that Donald Trump doesn t care about anyone but Donald Trump, and his lengthy and well documented history of racism shows that he especially doesn t care about black people.
You might be fooling yourself here, but you re sure as hell not fooling us.Watch the exchange below, via The Hill: Why are you laughing?
My god, this video of Pence on Fox News is incredible.
