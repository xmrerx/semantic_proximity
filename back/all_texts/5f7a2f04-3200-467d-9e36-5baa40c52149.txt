A new parody video from the Gregory Brothers shows a rendition of the 2016 State of the Union we all wish could be real.
In autotune, President Obama sings about his accomplishments in Obama Mic Drop.

Really can t believe he brought a dance team.
So far the video has been viewed over 3 million times on YouTube and Facebook and the song is now being sold on iTunes as a single.The Gregory Brothers are Michael Gregory (drums and vocals), Andrew Rose Gregory (guitar and vocals), Evan Gregory (keys and vocals), and Sarah Fullen Gregory (bass and vocals).
The group is probably best known for their series of videos parodying current events called Auto-Tune the News.
Their most well-known video was the music video Bed Intruder featuring Antoine Dodson, in which an interview he did with a local news station was auto-tuned and set to music (the chorus was Hide your kids, hide your wife ).
It was the most popular YouTube video of 2010 and currently has over 130 million views.
The single based on that video sold over 1 million copies and was certified platinum by the RIAA.Featured image via screen capture
