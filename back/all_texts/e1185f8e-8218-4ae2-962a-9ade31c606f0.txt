As you are probably aware, Donald Trump decided to pop into Detroit for an ill-advised attempt to form a false, vote-getting connection with the African-American community.
Currently, the Donald is doing worse with minorities than even Mitt Romney did during his presidential run against Barack Obama, and his previous outreach efforts telling African-Americans they are poor, uneducated, and have nothing to offer the world as well as his tight connections with the Ku Klux Klan and other white supremacist groups are not doing him any favors.After Trump s embarrassing, scripted interview with a Detroit pastor was leaked, Trump knew he had to step it up.
So he went out into the community to visit the neighborhood of his former rival-turned-paid-servant Ben Carson (yes, the one in which he tried to stab someone only to be thwarted by a belt buckle).
CNN caught up with Carson after Trump left and asked him what was apparently a difficult question.
We just saw Mr. Trump here and I asked him how did it go and he said Great.
He said he learned a lot of things.
What do you think he took away from today?
CNN reporter Jeremy Diamond asked.That s right he asked Carson if Trump learned something from spending a few minutes around black people.
This led Carson to have a Rubio moment, but with luggage rather than a water bottle.
Carson s face twisted into a look of concern, then terror:Then he walked away, successfully avoiding the question.How did Donald Trump do during his visit?
Not only was the church he visited virtually empty, but one woman who lives in Carson s childhood home told the Detroit Free Press that Trump s visit was clearly a photo-op.
Her takeaway from his obvious and meaningless attempt to pander to the African-American community while offering nothing substantive is that people should vote Democratic.
