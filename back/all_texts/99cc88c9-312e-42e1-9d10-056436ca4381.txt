BEIRUT (Reuters) - Saad al-Hariri, who announced on Nov. 4 from Saudi Arabia that he was quitting as Lebanon s prime minister, suggested on Sunday he could rescind his resignation.
Speaking from Riyadh in an interview with Future TV, a station affiliated with his political party, Hariri said he planned to return to Lebanon to confirm his resignation in accordance with the constitution.
But he also said that if he rescinds his decision to quit, the Hezbollah movement must respect Lebanon s policy of staying out of regional conflicts.
