A portrait of Punk Hillary set off two security dogs at an Art Miami tent we think they know a criminal when they see one.
The truth is that the police still don t have an answer of on this mystery.
We just want to know who would pay $4,000 for such a horrendous portrait of Crooked Hillary .Via Tampa Bay Times:When two security dogs reacted to a suspicious crate before an Art Miami tent opening early Saturday morning, Miami police officers briefly shut down the area for a few hours to investigate the possible threat.But when they opened up the offending crate, officers found something else instead: a punky portrait of Hillary Clinton in a studded jacket and shaggy pink haircut, in a neon picture frame to match.Fair director Nick Korniloff said that the two dogs reacted to the crate during a pre-show check shortly after 8 a.m., prompting organizers to clear the site.
Both the Art Miami tent and a tent for Context, connected by a tunnel, were closed off.
The package was then searched and the painting of the former Democratic presidential candidate was found inside.Police officers ran the 16 inch by 20 inch acrylic-on-wood artwork through an X-ray machine, which turned up no suspicious material.
We had to err on the side of caution, Korniloff said.
Both tents eventually reopened around 10 a.m.After the delay Saturday morning, both paintings were hung side-by-side in the Context tent, in a booth for a gallery called Spoke Art based in both New York and San Francisco.Gallery owner Ken Hashimoto said police still were unsure Saturday morning what about the art had caused the dogs to react.WE THINK THEY KNOW A CRIMINAL WHEN THEY SEE ONE READ MORE: TAMPA BAY
