It s time for the media to start doing their job.
Instead of making baseless claims about Trump to fulfill their insatiable desire to label him a racist, perhaps they should be questioning Hillary about her DOCUMENTED racist history Dolly Kyle, a long-time friend of the Clinton s, wrote a scathing tell all book exposing the sickening hidden truth about Bill and Hillary Clinton.
Hillary s war on just about anyone who is beneath her, or who would dare to get in the way of her ascent to the White House.Kyle claims that when the Clinton s were behind closed doors they were a very different couple than the public sees.
Behind the Reverend Jesse Jackson s back, the Clinton duo called him, That G**damned n****r .When will the media do their job and report the truth about this horrible opportunist?
