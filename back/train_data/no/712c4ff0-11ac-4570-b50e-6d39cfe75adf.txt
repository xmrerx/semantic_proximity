united nations ( reuters ) - french president emmanuel macron said it would be a mistake to pull out of the 2015 nuclear pact between iran and world powers after the trump administration indicated it had objections to aspects of the deal .
according to me we have to keep the 2015 agreement because it was a good one , macron told reporters at the united nations .
it would be a mistake to annul the nuclear agreement without anything else , he said , and declined to say whether u.s. president donald trump had told him of his decision on whether to keep the united states as a party to the accord .
