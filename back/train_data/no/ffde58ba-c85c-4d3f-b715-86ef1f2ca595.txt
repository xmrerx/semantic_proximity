of course hillary manages to turn the question around and make it appear as though the congressman never asked her a direct question .
her answer to the congressman was an admonishment asking the question was somehow calling the credibility of the diplomatic security professionals working in the state department hillary clinton is a highly skilled liar who always manage to dodge the actual question and leave you wondering , how the hell did she just get out of answering that question !
former secretary of state hillary clinton said that she doesn t believe ambassador chris stevens had her personal email , even though sidney blumenthal did in testimony before the benghazi select committee on thursday.hillary was asked by representative rep. lynn westmoreland ( r-ga ) you got a lot of emails from sidney blumenthal , and you say that mr. blumenthal was a friend of yours , and he had your personal email address .
you say chris stevens was a friend of yours .
he asked numerous times for extra protection .
now , if i had been mr. stevens , and i think anybody out there , anybody watching this , would agree , if i had been mr. stevens , and i had had a relationship with you , and i had requested 20 or more times for additional security to protect , not only my life , but the people that were there with me , i would have gotten in touch with you some way .
i would have let you know that i was in danger , and the situation had deteriorated to a point i needed you to do something .
did he have your personal email ?
she answered , congressman , i do not believe that he had my personal email .
he had the email , and he had the direct line to everybody that he d worked with for years .
he had been posted with officials in the state department .
they had gone through difficult , challenging , dangerous assignments together .
he was in constant contact with people .
