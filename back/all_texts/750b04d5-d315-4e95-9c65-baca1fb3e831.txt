BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Sacked Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont on Tuesday said he accepted the snap elections called by Spain s central government in Catalonia and he was not seeking asylum in Belgium at a press conference given in Brussels.
Puigdemont said he was not trying to escape from justice after the state prosecutor recommended charges for rebellion and sedition be brought against him.
He did not clarify how long he would stay in Belgium, adding he would return to Catalonia when given guarantees by the Spanish government.
