This CANNOT be a good thing if you are running for president, but it sure is damn hilarious.Republican presidential wannabe Ted Cruz has run smack dab into a serious image problem that threatens to sink his already sinking campaign permanently.Not too long ago, an Internet rumor began circulating that Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer, a serial killer who terrorized Northern California in the 1960s and 1970s.And even though it is impossible for Ted Cruz to be this serial killer since he was born in 1970, apparently a growing number of people are beginning to believe it anyway.The issue is even important enough that Public Policy Polling asked Florida voters in a survey if they think Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer or not.
And here s where the hilarity begins.According to the PPP poll, nearly 40 percent of Florida voters think Ted Cruz might be the Zodiac Killer,with 10 percent actually saying he is the Zodiac Killer and 28 percent saying they aren t sure.Here s a screenshot of the question and results.Yes, Floridians actually believe it is possible that Ted Cruz is the Zodiac Killer, and thus far, the Texas Senator has neither confirmed nor denied that he is the infamous murderer.But presents Cruz with an enigma to solve.
With the Florida Republican Primary scheduled for March 15th, Cruz has to figure out how to convince nearly 40 percent of voters in the state that he isn t a creepy guy who stabs canoodling young couples to death.However, there is another good thing coming out of this Ted Cruz conspiracy theory beyond making us laugh out loud.As it turns out, Texas man is selling Ted Cruz Was The Zodiac Killer t-shirts to help women pay for abortions in the state, and so far, he is selling them fast which is allowing him to donate $35,000 to West Fund, which helps low-income women get the abortion they need.This is a story that really does keep on giving.Featured Image: Flickr
