With the primaries indicating that Donald Trump is coming closer and closer to securing the Republican nomination for president, the reality of a Trump presidency is actually starting to sink in for many.
If that reality terrifies you, you re likely in the majority.
If you welcome the idea, what the f*ck is wrong with you?Trump is as racist as he is narcissistic, and he s pretty damn into himself.
All the proof you need is at any rally where he makes his talking points about himself, and spends no time actually speaking in-depth on any policy positions.
It s always about how much people love him and how great he is, or how great he ll be for the nation.
Just count how many times he says I, me, or my.
Although, you ll likely lose count after around 1,000.Speaking on behalf of all sane and logical-minded individuals worldwide is none other than the brilliant comedian Patton Oswalt.
He took to Twitter on National Poetry Day with the quintessential poem most would like to read to Trump.Oswalt perfectly tweets: via Twitter Is it crude?
Yes, it sure is.
As is Trump if you weren t already paying attention.
In fact, Trump isn t only crude; he is vile in his contempt for the other.
He s scapegoats all the nation s, or for that matter, the world s problems on anyone but those who are just like him.
It s always someone else s fault, and he gets his band of merry morons to fall in line and believe him.
It s pathetic, it s sad, and kinda scary.So, kudos to Oswalt for telling it like it is.And with the best response that is indicative of how we all likely feel:@pattonoswalt pic.twitter.com/CRLes5OSPp Alexandra Cruz (@SweetTale4u) March 22, 2016Brava!Featured image via YouTube
