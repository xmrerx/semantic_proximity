the astounding hypocrisy of the leftist media has been left unchecked for decades .
all of that is about to change .
and no matter what side of the aisle you find yourself on , forcing the media to do their jobs and report the news is a benefit to every single american .
it s not their job to be popular amongst their peers or to have opinions their readers agree with .
their job is to report the news .
perhaps this little video or nugget of truth slipped their minds ? despite mounting criticism for donald trump s failure to disavow former ku klux klan grand wizard david duke s support , democratic front-runner hillary clinton once heaped praise for late klan leader sen. robert byrd.in a video uploaded to the state department s official youtube page on june 28 , 2010 , clinton commemorated late sen. byrd by saying , today our country has lost a true american original , my friend and mentor robert c. byrd .
via : daily callerand when the former kkk member , senator robert byrd died , barack obama gave the eulogy : president obama lauded the late sen. robert c. byrd today for keeping faith with his family , his state of west virginia and his beloved u.s. constitution .
he was a senate icon , he was a party leader , he was an elder statesman , and he was my friend , obama told thousands who gathered for byrd s funeral on the steps of the golden-domed west virginia statehouse .
that s how i ll remember him .
