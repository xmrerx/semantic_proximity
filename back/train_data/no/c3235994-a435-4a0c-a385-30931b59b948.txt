new york ( reuters ) - democratic presidential hopeful hillary clinton posted an 11 percentage point lead over her republican rival donald trump , according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on tuesday , a small decline since late last week .
the june 24-28 poll showed that 45.3 percent of likely american voters support clinton while 34.1 percent support trump , and another 20.5 percent support neither .
clinton ’ s lead was 14 points on friday , though she has generally been widening her advantage over the new york real estate magnate since mid-may , when the two were nearly tied .
the former secretary of state , senator and first lady was bolstered in recent days by endorsements from members of the republican establishment , including henry paulson , treasury secretary under former president george w. bush .
her democratic rival bernie sanders , a u.s. senator from vermont , said last week he would vote for her to stop trump even though his campaign said this was not a formal endorsement .
clinton is struggling to win over sanders supporters after a hard-fought campaign for the nomination .
critics have assailed her over her handling of emails and a 2012 attack on a u.s. mission in libya while secretary of state .
trump got a brief boost in the days after the june 12 mass shooting in florida , coming within nine points of clinton as he fine-tuned a campaign promise to temporarily ban the entry of muslim immigrants to shore up national security .
his level of support so far in june , however , lags behind what his predecessor , republican white house hopeful mitt romney , received in the same period in 2012 .
he has sparred with republican leaders over his off-the-cuff rhetoric and lagged behind clinton ’ s campaign organization in both size and fundraising , worrying some of his allies .
the poll included 1,099 likely voters and has a credibility interval , a measure of accuracy , of 3.4 percentage points .
