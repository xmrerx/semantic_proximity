Once again, Donald Trump is totally predictable.On Tuesday morning, Trump lashed out at Bill Clinton on Twitter over comments that the former president made about him at a bookstore.
You would need to have a single-digit IQ not to recognize what was going on, Clinton said when asked about Trump s defense of Russian meddling in our political process.When asked if Trump is smart, Clinton said, He doesn t know much.
One thing he does know is how to get angry, white men to vote for him.
Clinton also talked about how Trump called him after the election and acted like they were still buddies as if Trump never spent months trashing him and his wife Hillary.Well, Trump apparently read the remarks and decided to embarrass himself once again by throwing a tantrum about it on Twitter.Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election.
Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations).
He doesn t know much Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 20, 2016especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more).
They focused on wrong states Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 20, 2016Seriously, this what Trump is choosing to focus on instead of getting ready to take over the presidency.
Trump just demonstrated once again that he has thin skin and is easily provoked by even the smallest slights.And Twitter users were quick to roast him for it..@realDonaldTrump You are going to be THE PRESIDENT.
Stop tweeting every congratulations you ve received and go get a security briefing.

It s not like you re the President-elect who should be above that.

@realDonaldTrump While misery in Syria continues, Italy tries to save its banks, and China issues smog alerts, this is what you care about.
Simon Hedlin (@simonhedlin) December 20, 2016@realDonaldTrump shouldn t you be focusing on the attacks that have happened in the past 24 hrs, not a who-called-who argument?
Isabella Carapella (@Bella_Carapella) December 20, 2016@realDonaldTrump this is what s on your mind right now, not the state of the world & the shit that went down yesterday Mike Denison (@mikd33) December 20, 2016@realDonaldTrump what?
Are you 6?
David Tarp (@TarpCPH) December 20, 2016Donald Trump needs to stop tweeting petty insults and start focusing on his national security and intelligence briefings instead.
Because at this rate, World War III is going to start under his watch because he was too busy throwing a temper tantrum like a petulant toddler on Twitter.Featured image via Wonkette
