what the what ?
i had to start firing people , people that i counted as my friends , best friends , partners .
and the process that i began was the hardest process of my life .
yeah , almost as hard as picking myself up off of that carpet when i was facing suicide , that carpet that smelled like soup .
but this time i had something i didn t have before : i had you .
i knew you existed .
i knew that you believed in the same principles i believe and that we no , that i had made a promise to you .
our lives , our fortunes , and our sacred honor .
