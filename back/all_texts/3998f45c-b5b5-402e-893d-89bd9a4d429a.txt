Donald Trump has just been screwed over by members of his own party, thanks to his insistence on a border wall that is absolutely pointless and won t actually work.At Congress has been at a standstill over including Trump s border wall in government spending, Republican lawmakers are now agreeing with Democrats by supporting a clean spending bill so the government won t have to stop working on Friday.
This push takes Trump s border wall out of the running for funding.Josh Gottheimer (D-NJ) said: Ideological litmus tests on a spending bill like this simply create partisan roadblocks.
With so many pressing issues facing our country, we need to work together to keep the lights on and avoid another expensive shutdown that weakens not only our economy but our national security.
Mick Mulvaney, who is Trump s budget director, tried to make a deal with Congress by promising that Obamacare would get more funding if Trump s wall was funded.
Clearly okay with manipulating Americans into funding a wall that no one wants, Mulvaney said: We d offer them $1 of CSR [Obamacare] payments for $1 of wall payments.
Right now that s the offer that we ve given to our Democratic colleagues.
No one in the Democratic party actually wants this border wall to be funded and Chuck Schumer pointed out exactly why.
These are points that even Republicans can t argue with:A spokesman for Schumer blasted the Trump administration for trying to use Obamacare to bribe lawmakers into funding Trump s wall: The White House gambit to hold hostage health care for millions of Americans, in order to force American taxpayers to foot the bill for a wall that the President said would be paid for by Mexico is a complete non-starter.The US government is supposed to take care of its citizens and, according to the President, Mexico is supposed to pay for the wall.
If the administration would drop their 11th hour demand for a wall that Democrats, and a good number of Republicans oppose, Congressional leaders could quickly reach a deal.
Trump needs to just admit that the border wall he promised his brainless supporters was a flawed idea, and it is only going to cost America in the end.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images
