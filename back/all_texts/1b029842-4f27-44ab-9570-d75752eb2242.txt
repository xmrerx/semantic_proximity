WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday called the appellate court ruling that upheld the suspension of his order restricting travel from seven Muslim-majority countries a “political decision,” and vowed his administration would ultimately prevail.
“We’ll see them in court,” Trump told reporters who had gathered outside his press secretary’s office.
“It’s a political decision.” Trump said he did not view the ruling as a major setback for his White House.
“This is just a decision that came down, but we’re going to win the case,” he said.
