HANOI (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Sunday that he was prepared to mediate between claimants to the South China Sea, which include Vietnam and China.
If I can help mediate or arbitrate, please let me know, Trump said in comments at the start of a meeting in Hanoi with Vietnam s president, Tran Dai Quang.
Trump acknowledged that China s position on the South China Sea, nearly all of which is claimed by Beijing, was a problem.
I m a very good mediator and arbitrator, he said.
He also said that China was helping to resolve tensions over North Korea and added he hoped Russia would do the same.
