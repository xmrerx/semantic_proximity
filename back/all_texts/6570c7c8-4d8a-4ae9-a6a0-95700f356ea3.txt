While a group of Americans were vacationing in Cancun, Mexico for Spring break, they broke out in chants of Build that wall!
earlier this month and even though there were complaints, they refused to stop, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reports.A Mexican newspaper, The Yucatan Times, blasted the group in an editorial Friday, calling the students behavior while on a ship unacceptable.
The paper said this is not an isolated incident from young spring breakers and noted that there have been other acts of xenophobia and discrimination against Mexicans within their own country.
The paper wrote that in recent days many Spring Breakers have been offensive, rude and haughty towards Mexican people.
According to witnesses, the Build that wall chant grew increasingly louder.
In the face of such stupidity, one doesn t know how to immediately react, one woman who was on the boat with her husband and witnessed the incident wrote on Facebook.
We were stunned.
The whole thing seemed implausible.
I have always been tolerant of the countries of the world and I have wanted to believe that human stupidity and ignorance is characteristic of a small group of people, Anaximandro Amable wrote.
But there are things with which one cannot be tolerant, such as discourse that incites hatred.
The paper adds that This situation is far from being an isolated incident, and it adds to the growing number of complaints from tourism sector workers.
While Trump was on the campaign trail his crowd of supporters routinely broke out in Build the wall chants.In 2015, Trump said, I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me.
I will build a great, great wall on our southern border.
And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.
And now, Mexico is not paying for the wall.
We, the taxpayers, are.Hey Trump supporters, if you guys could quit embarrassing the rest of us, that d be great.
