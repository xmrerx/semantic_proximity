cairo ( reuters ) - islamic state has claimed an attack on an egyptian military airport that killed one officer and wounded two near the town of arish in north sinai on tuesday , the group s amaq news agency said in a statement .
security sources meanwhile said an army officer and five militants had been killed in clashes as security forces carried out arrest raids near the arish air base on wednesday .
the amaq statement said islamic state fighters used a kornet anti-tank missile in the tuesday attack that targeted the interior and defense ministers who were visiting the area .
neither minister was harmed , a security source said .
islamic state s sinai branch has for years waged attacks against security forces , and in the past year expanded targets to include christians and other civilians .
an attack on a mosque last month which killed more than 300 people , the deadliest in egypt s modern history , was widely attributed to islamic state , but the group did not claim it .
president abdel fattah al-sisi ordered security forces to use heavy force to stamp out the sinai insurgency within three months after that attack .
