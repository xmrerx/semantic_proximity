It wasn t even a month ago that a company run by the family of Jared Kushner, son-in-law of President Donald Trump, were conducting a presentation in a Beijing ballroom, where Kushner s sister was pitching a real estate project to wealthy Chinese investors that would make it easier to get US visas.
Now it has emerged that another relative of Kushner is using his ties to the president in the hope of securing foreign property investors.The KRE Group, a real estate company run by Jared s uncle, Murray Kushner, pitched a Jersey City apartment project to Chinese investors, using images of Donald and Ivanka Trump, as well as Jared, in their presentation in an attempt to seal the deal.
Work hand-in-hand with Trump son-in-law Kushner, said the pitch, telling attendees that if they invested $500,000, they could qualify for a U.S. resident visa through a program known as EB-5.The EB-5 visa allows rich foreigners to immigrate to the USA if they are willing to invest large amounts of money into US job-creating projects.Although neither KRE or Murray Kushner have officially commented on the presentation, one partner in the project, Dave Barry, pinned the blame on the Chinese marketing company they used, Noah Visa.
However, Eric Yuan, manager and part owner of Noah Visa, didn t initially agree with Barry s side of the story, first denying the inclusion of the pictures of the Trumps and Kushner.
When it became apparent that screenshots were available from the presentation, Yuan changed his tune and also tried to pass the blame.
The media did that to push hot topics; we didn t do it, he said in a phone conversation.
Jared has nothing to do with the project.
Yuan also stated that Noah Visa no longer promotes the property, located at 235 Grand Street, and claimed that a further presentation scheduled for May 13 was canceled due to lack of interest.
When informed of what Dave Barry had said, that the subcontract was ended because the promotion was misleading, Yuan simply hung up the phone.And to think that many republican voters said they wanted a businessman in the White House.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images
