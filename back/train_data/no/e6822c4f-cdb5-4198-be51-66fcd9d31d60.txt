dubai ( reuters ) - bahrain will not attend december s summit of the gulf cooperation council if qatar does not change its policies and qatar should have its membership in the six-nation group suspended , bahrain s foreign minister said .
bahrain , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and egypt cut diplomatic , transport and trade ties with qatar in june , accusing it of financing terrorism .
doha denies the charges and says the boycott is an attempt to impinge on its sovereignty and rein in its support for reform .
if the situation remains as it is we won t attend this summit , khalid bin ahmed al khalifa said on twitter , referring to the gcc meeting in kuwait .
the right step to preserve the gcc is to freeze qatar s membership in the council , he said .
founded as a bulwark against neighbours iraq and iran , the western-backed gcc is a loose association of the six gulf arab countries .
qatar has pursued policies aimed at the security of member states of the gulf cooperation council ... qatar has proved that it does not respect the charters , treaties and ties established by the gcc , saudi state tv channel quoted bahrain s king hamad bin isa al khalifa as saying on monday .
bahrain believes qatar is fomenting unrest in the island kingdom by supporting protests and even sporadic shooting and bombing attacks aimed at security forces .
in an interview with u.s. broadcaster cbs news broadcast on sunday , qatari emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani said he wanted an end to the dispute and warned against any military escalation .
