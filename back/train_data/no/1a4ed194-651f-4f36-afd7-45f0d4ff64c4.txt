a bi-product of obama s divided america the lgbt community has been fighting a decades-long culture war to be included in the fabrics of american society and it s winning.yet when it comes to their graduation ceremonies , it seems they d prefer exclusivity.more than 100 colleges and universities this spring will be holding separate graduation ceremonies for the lgbtq population and their allies , according to the human rights campaign ( hrc ) .
this includes georgetown university , duke university , harvard university and boston college , among others.the graduation ceremony is called the lavender graduation , signifying pink triange that gay men were forced to wear in concentration camps and the black triange designating lesbians as political prisoners in nazi germany , according to hrc.the special ceremony was started in 1995 at the university of michigan by dr. ronni sanlo , a jewish lesbian , who said she was denied attendance at her children s graduation because of her sexual orientation .
these events provide a sense of community for minority students who often experience tremendous culture shock at their impersonalized institutions , hrc says on its website , explaining the need for such ceremonies .
for many students they are the payoff for staying in school , and friends and families find the smaller , more ethnic ceremonies both meaningful and personal .
they deem it a cultural celebration , that recognizes lgbt students of all races and ethnicities it acknowledges their achievements and contributions to the university as students who survived the college experience .
