The hell with parody, this should be a real campaign ad.Donald Trump has a long and sordid history when it comes to talking about women.The Republican nominee especially enjoys insulting women s looks from calling women pigs to calling women who have small breasts unattractive to criticizing their body shape.
He has even said on camera that he can t say that he treats women with respect.And all of these recorded quotes came back to bite Trump on the ass in a parody ad starring comedian Kathy Griffin.In the video, Griffin is shown applying makeup and getting dressed as Trump s voice booms out some of the nasty things he has said about women over the years.
At first, Griffin merely tells Trump to f*ck off, but as Trump s insults get more annoying Griffin only gets angrier.
Oh, f*ck off you piece of shit!
she says at one point.
Then she flips him off using the double bird.At the end, Griffin apologizes to Michelle Obama for taking the low road.
Sorry, Michelle, when he goes low, I go lower.
A screen then pops up asking, Is Donald Trump the president we want for our daughters?
But Griffin took one last shot at Donald before the video ended.
Seriously, f*ck off, Donald.
Here s the video via YouTube.Griffin, along with millions of other women across the country, have every right to be pissed off at Donald Trump.
He s a scumbag who clearly has no respect for women.
He treats them like sexual objects meant to be conquered, even by force.Trump has openly bragged about groping women against their will and even had the audacity to attack the various women who have come forward to accuse him of sexual assault by saying that they are not pretty enough for him to assault.This man is incapable of respecting women and he will only treat them like shit as president.
And that is unacceptable.Featured Image: Screenshot
