Meet William Quayle Jr., who is trying to give Sarah Palin a run for the worst thing to ever come from Alaska.Quayle is a man who is voting for Donald Trump (but would have preferred Ted Cruz and previously criticized The Donald for his hateful rhetoric and lies) because he s angry about the state of our country and running for Juneau s city assembly because things need to change, dammit (or something).
And boy, does he hate that Hillary Clinton lady largely because he buys into right-wing conspiracy theories that paint her as so sick she s likely to die any day now.Quayle s Facebook timeline is filled with right-wing memes and messages, including frequent references to convicted felon Dinesh D Souza s latest propaganda film, Hillary s America: But his obvious stupidity the climate change post, really?
is not what is bringing this normally unimportant person into the spotlight it s his Twitter account, where he shares his love of large, full-figured women and their full-figured breasts and, of course, where he sends some of these women insanely creepy messages.
The GOP candidate seems to spend much of his time harassing women most commonly model Chelsea Charms about fattening themselves up, inviting them to come live with him, and even encouraging them to get pregnant so their boobs would get much bigger : I do not wish to discuss about my fetishes, I am a heterosexual male and that is that, Quayle told KTOO-FM when asked about the posts.
I do have original ideas that my competition does not have.
All they want to do is tax and cut budget.
He does not deny the account is his, and even at one point auto-posted some of his more awkward messages to Facebook:It s perfectly OK for someone to like large-breasted women.
It s not OK to harass women whose photos you look at while you do unspeakable things to your little soldier (it can be safely assumed that this is the case based on his public messages).The election is Tuesday.
May God have mercy on our souls if this guy manages to win.Featured image via Facebook/Twitter
