Irish journalist and documentary filmmaker Ann McElhinney took down a clueless liberal student during a discussion on global warming Ann is the quickest and smartest at debate.
This liberal picked on the wrong person The student insults Ann with the following comment: I can t take anything you said seriously because you said that washing machines were more liberating than the birth control pill, the student yelled as a friend tried to calm her.
You don t know anything!
You are the least credible human being I ve like ever encountered in my life.
She then called Ann a Goddamn idiot.
Ann proceeded to give this student a BIG reality check on the EU and then American exceptionalism.
Bravo Ann!On a side note- If you ever have the chance to hear Ann McElhinney speak, DO IT!
