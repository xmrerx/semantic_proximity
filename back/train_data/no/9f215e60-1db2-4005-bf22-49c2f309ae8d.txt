lame ! the united states expelled two russian officials on june 17 in response to an attack by a russian policeman on an american diplomat earlier in the month , the state department said friday .
on june 17 , we expelled two russian officials from the united states in response to this attack , state department spokesman john kirby told reporters .
he would not provide any further detail.kirby said a russian guard attacked an american diplomat outside of the u.s. embassy compound in moscow on june 6 .
he described the attack as unprovoked and it endangered the safety of our employee .
the russian foreign ministry said the diplomat was a cia agent who hit the guard in the face .
instead of the cia employee , who was in disguise , as we understand , it could have been anyone a terrorist , an extremist , a suicide bomber , said maria zakharova , russian foreign ministry spokeswoman.kirby responded to moscow s accusation by telling reporters , the russian claim that the policeman was protecting the embassy from an unidentified individual is simply untrue .
the state department has said that russia has harassed u.s. diplomats in the past , a claim the kremlin denies.relations between moscow and washington have been especially strained since russia annexed the crimean peninsula from ukraine in 2014 .
you won t believe this !
