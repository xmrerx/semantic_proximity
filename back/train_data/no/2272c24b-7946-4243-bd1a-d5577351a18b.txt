in mid-october 2016 , james o keefe exposed many of the democratic operatives working in the underbelly of their party to coordinate and commit violent and illegal activities in order to defeat trump and use any means necessary to make hillary clinton our next president .
click here to see the undercover video.one of the key figures in o keefe s report was convicted felon and husband of rep. jan schakowsky ( d-il ) , robert creamer who oversaw a check-kiting scheme so elaborate that his employees followed a written manual complete with detailed instructions on when and where to float checks totaling millions of dollars.as it turns out , convicted felon robert creamer was a frequent visitor of the white house .
between 11/21/2009 and 6/24/2016 , robert creamer appears to have visited the white house 342 times , 340 times as robert creamer and twice as bob creamer .
he logged in times and was either a guest of barack obama or his lovely wife michelle .
one can only wonder what business michelle had with this criminal .
hmmm republicans would have distanced themselves from anyone who even had the appearance of taking part in criminal activity that could be tied to their party , but true to form , the democrat party gives them front-row seats .
just look who showed up in the front row at obama s farewell speech none other that democratic operative , felon and his wife , democrat us house member , jan schakowsky .
these people have no shame and live in a world where the rules the rest of us are all forced to live by simply don t apply to them.watch : why is @ rbcreamer front row at @ barackobama 's farewell speech ?
