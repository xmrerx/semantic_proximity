london ( reuters ) - the number of people arrested in britain on suspicion of terrorism offences rocketed by 68 percent in the last year to the highest figure on record during a period when the country suffered four deadly attacks , figures showed on thursday .
statistics from the home office ( interior ministry ) showed there were 379 arrests in the year to june , up from 226 from the 12 previous months , and the most since 2001 when the data began to be collected .
britain is on its second-highest threat level , severe , meaning an attack is highly likely and 36 people were killed in terrorist incidents in the first six months of 2017 .
among the arrests , 12 came after an attack in march on london s westminster bridge when a man drove a car into pedestrians killing four , before he stabbed a policeman to death outside parliament .
another 23 followed a suicide bombing at a pop concert in manchester in may , and the following month police arrested 21 suspects after three islamist militants drove into pedestrians on london bridge before stabbing people at nearby restaurants and bars , killing eight .
one arrest followed an attack in north london when a van was driven into worshippers near a mosque which left one man dead .
britain s most senior counter-terrorism officer mark rowley has said police have been arresting a suspect every day .
he said this week that there had been a shift in the threat level rather than an isolated spike .
in the three years until march this year , police foiled 13 potential attacks but in the next 17 weeks , there were the four attacks while the authorities thwarted six others , rowley said .
the pace has continued to be almost as challenging since then , he told a conference in israel .
the official figures showed that among the 379 arrests , 123 people were charged with an offense , of which 105 were terrorism-related , while 189 were released without charge .
