washington ( reuters ) - president donald trump on wednesday will deliver remarks about his decision on whether to move the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem from tel aviv , white house press secretary sarah saders said on tuesday , adding that trump is pretty solid in his thinking on the issue .
trump notified arab leaders on tuesday that he intends to make the major change in calls to palestinian president mahmoud abbas , jordan s king abdullah , egyptian president abdel fattah al-sisi and saudi arabia s king salman .
many of the leaders warned that unilateral u.s. steps on jerusalem would derail a fledgling u.s.-led peace effort and unleash turmoil in the region .
