You gotta hand it to her Whether you love or hate Trump Fox News Andrea Tantaros is right on the money with her assessment of the National Review s unabated hate for Trump National Review s Rich Lowry gleefully bashed Trump on Outnumbered for coming in second in Iowa.
Tantaros let him have it.Rich Lowry: He went to Iowa and HE LOST!
And he was beaten fair and square by Ted Cruz.
And if this thing would have gone one more day Rubio probably would have clipped him.
It s because he skipped the FOX debate, he insulted one of the anchors Andrea Tantaros: This is what I don t understand.
The party has shifted into a nationalist mode and the voters are angry and they ve been discounted and insulted by your publication.
It s really, really rude Tell me this logic.
This is the logic I m hearing from you.
Third place is a win.
Second place is a loss and first place is irrelevant?Via: Gateway Pundit
