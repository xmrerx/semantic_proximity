donald trump went on a whining rant about the media on tuesday morning and got totally humiliated.as he usually does , trump woke up and immediately took to twitter to attack democrats , the courts , and the media.he accused democrats of being obstructionists and once again declared that the affordable care act is in a death spiral , a spiral he himself caused by attacking the law through executive orders.trump also bitched about the 9th circuit court blocking his muslim ban.but he saved most of his vitriol for the media.the fake news media has never been so wrong or so dirty .
purposely incorrect stories and phony sources to meet their agenda of hate .
sad !
