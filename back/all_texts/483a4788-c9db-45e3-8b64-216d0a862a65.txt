Coming into Tuesday s Republican primary in Indiana it was pretty much do or die for Ted Cruz.
He had to win or his campaign for the presidency was effectively over.
And boy did he try.
He put all he could into trying to win over the Hoosier state, but try as he might, he failed miserably.
Donald Trump won with over 50 percent of the vote and Ted Cruz was left with a tough decision to make.By the end of Cruz s speech after his Indiana loss it was pretty damn clear that he was about to suspend his campaign.
He spoke in broad, sweeping conservative analogies that had nothing to do with becoming president.
And what seemed obvious became reality when he told everyone that he was pulling out of the race.One person, however, saw the delicious irony in Cruz quitting early, and that person was Full Frontal s Samantha Bee.
She took to Twitter to tell Cruz what he should have done with his campaign.Bee wrote: Shouldn t Ted Cruz have been forced to carry his unviable campaign to term?
Shouldn't #TedCruz have been forced to carry his unviable campaign to term?
Full Frontal (@FullFrontalSamB) May 4, 2016Of course, this being a play on Cruz s ridiculous stance on abortion rights.
The man claims he stands up for women, but apparently that means loving women so much that he s the person to make all of their health decisions.
He s also been one of the key reasons the Planned Parenthood myth of baby body parts has gone on for so long.Ted Cruz is a liar and a smarmy salesman that just couldn t figure out how to sell himself to the American voting public.
He was so bad, in fact, that he couldn t even make himself look good next to Donald Trump.Bee also tweeted:At least the #TedCruz campaign died as it lived under Trump's heel while Republicans looked on with indifference.
