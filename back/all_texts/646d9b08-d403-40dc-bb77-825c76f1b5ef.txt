WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has designated White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney to be acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau until a permanent director is nominated and confirmed, the White House said on Friday.
The six-year-old bureau, which has been controversial since its creation, had been led by Richard Cordray, who formally resigned on Friday.
