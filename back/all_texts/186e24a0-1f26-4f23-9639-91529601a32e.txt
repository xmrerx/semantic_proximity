MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday he had all grounds to believe that Moscow, along with Damascus, would soon defeat terrorists in Syria.
He said that the Syrian peace process was developing in a positive way, though there were still problems.
He said there was a proposal to hold a Congress of Syrian peoples, bringing together representatives of all ethnic groups in Syria.
