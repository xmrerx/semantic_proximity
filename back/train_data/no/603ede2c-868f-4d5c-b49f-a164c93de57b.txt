sant julia de ramis , spain ( reuters ) - spanish civil guard police in riot gear burst into a polling station minutes before catalan regional leader carles puigdemont was due to vote in a referendum on catalan independence from spain that has been declared illegal by madrid .
police used axes to smash a window at the sports center being used as a voting center and forced open the door in the province of girona .
live tv pictures showed police with black berets and riot shields fanning out through the voting station , apparently searching for ballot boxes , while would-be voters , fists raised in the air , defiantly sang the catalan anthem .
puigdemont had announced he would vote at the polling station near girona at 0930 am ( 0730 gmt ) , around the same time as the police entered , but there was no sign of him in the television footage .
