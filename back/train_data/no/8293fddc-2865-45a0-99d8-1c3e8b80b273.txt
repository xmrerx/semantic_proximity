berlin ( reuters ) - german foreign minister sigmar gabriel said turkey s decision to release a sixth german citizen from jail on thursday gave hope that relations between the two nato allies could improve after plumbing new lows following a failed coup in 2016 .
the decision to allow pilgrim david britsch to return to germany follows the release earlier this week of german journalist mesale tolu after nearly eight months in prison .
decisions such as these give hope that we can rebuild trust step by step and relax the bilateral relationship , gabriel said in a statement released late on thursday .
gabriel said he had agreed with his turkish counterpart mevlut cavusoglu to continue talks given the difficult issues that still had to be resolved .
germany is home to some 3 million people of turkish heritage .
following recent rulings in turkey , six persons have now been released from prisons or allowed to leave , gabriel said .
and in the case of the imprisoned journalist deniz yucel , the turkish judiciary has at least made the conditions for detention easier .
the next urgent step here is the presentation of an indictment .
the releases come two weeks after german federal prosecutors dropped an investigation against a dozen muslim clerics who were suspected of spying in germany on behalf of the turkish government .
tolu was charged with being a member of a terrorist organization and publishing terrorist propaganda following the july 2016 coup .
she was released on the condition that she does not leave the country .
german politicians have been outspoken critics of turkey s security crackdown since the coup .
tens of thousands of turks have been jailed , including around a dozen who hold german citizenship .
ankara has criticized berlin for not handing over asylum seekers it accuses of involvement in the failed coup .
it says u.s.-based cleric fetullah gulen was the mastermind of the coup , but gulen denies involvement .
