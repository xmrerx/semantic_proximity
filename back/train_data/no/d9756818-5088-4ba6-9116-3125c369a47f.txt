us swimmer lilly king gave a russian swimmer a lesson in swimming clean when she raced and beat the swimmer who wagged her finger at her the night before .
the interview after the finger wagging was great !
lilly basically said the russian swimmer s record of not passing the drug test was not cool .
soooo lilly went out today and kicked some russian booty the american beat yulia efimova in the 100-meter breaststroke and set an olympic record , too a night after she called out the russian for bragging after failing a drug test.efimova was .57 seconds behind king , who finished in 1 minute , 4.93 seconds .
american katie meili won bronze [ ] king s victory made a statement , too .
asked if she thought the win made a statement to efimova , king said : i hope i did , that we can still compete clean .
that s how it should be .
