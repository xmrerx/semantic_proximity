Are you tired of seeing pictures and videos of Trump supporters being beaten and bloodied by Soros paid thugs and Antifa terrorists?
Apparently these Trump supporters are also tired of seeing those images and decided to let these domestic terrorists know that their freedom of speech will not be taken away by a bunch of basement dwellers.Watch this video as Trump supporters clear the streets of the anti-Trump attackers and send them running back to their parents basements Listen near the middle of the video where one of the reporters tells viewers, They re kicking out Antifa.
Na, na, na, na, na, nah Hey, hey Yeah.
Goodbye!

We are the champions!
No time for loser ANTIFA because we are the champions of the world.
We won Berkeley!
So tired of all this winning!
