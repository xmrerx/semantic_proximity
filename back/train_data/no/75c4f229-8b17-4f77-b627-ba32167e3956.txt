beijing ( reuters ) - china s ruling communist party has expelled a former party boss of northwestern gansu province , the country s anti-graft agency said on friday , after an investigation showed he received bribes and was involved in superstitious activities .
in a statement on its website , the central commission for discipline inspection ( ccdi ) said wang sanyun , who was appointed as gansu s party secretary in late 2011 , had been passive in implementing the party s key policies , seriously derelict in his duties and accepted bribes and gifts in exchange for offering promotions .
the case has been referred to prosecutors , it said .
wang , 64 , had violated disciplinary regulations by frequenting private clubs , the statement said , adding that he had also been involved in superstitious activities over a prolonged period of time , without elaborating .
it was not possible to reach wang or a representative for comment and it was unclear whether he had been allowed to retain a lawyer .
wang was demoted from his post in gansu in april to serve on a less prominent special committee of the national legislature , before being detained and placed under investigation in july .
separately , the commission said that the former president of the country s second-largest coal producer china coal energy company ltd , gao jianjun , would also be prosecuted for suspected graft after a party investigation found he took bribes and abused his power .
it was not possible to reach gao or a representative for comment .
the company did not answer calls out of business hours early on friday evening .
gao was put under investigation in may .
president xi jinping has presided over a far-reaching anti-corruption drive since coming to power in 2012 , punishing more than a million party members , jailing top military figures and retired security tsar zhou yongkang , the most senior official toppled for corruption since 1949 .
