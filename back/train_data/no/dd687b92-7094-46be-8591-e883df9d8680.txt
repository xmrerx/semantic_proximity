brussels ( reuters ) - u.s. recognition that jerusalem is israel s capital would be important for israel even if it delayed moving its embassy there , israel s minister for public security , gilad erdan said on wednesday .
this declaration is very important for us , but we only see it as a reflection of what is happening on the ground in reality , no game-changer , erdan told reporters in brussels .
in reality , nothing is going to change .
we don t think this is an excuse for a new wave of violence and we won t be afraid of this , he continued .
