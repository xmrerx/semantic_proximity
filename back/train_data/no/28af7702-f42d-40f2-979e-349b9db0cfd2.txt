since the colin kaepernick and his fellow players started their black lives matter kneeling campaign , social media has been lit up with photos of empty stadiums , proving that fans are not interested in supporting players who disrespect our flag and our law enforcement officers .
the photos seem to suggest that every week more and more seats remain empty in nfl stadiums across america .
