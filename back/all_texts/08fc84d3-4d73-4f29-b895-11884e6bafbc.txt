WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump is evaluating the situation surrounding U.S. national security adviser Michael Flynn and is speaking to Vice President Mike Pence about it, White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Monday.
Spicer’s statement, read to reporters, left Flynn’s status in doubt.
Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway had said an hour earlier that Flynn had the full confidence of the president.
