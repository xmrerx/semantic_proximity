washington ( reuters ) - the united states on tuesday announced sanctions on two north korean officials for their roles in developing the country s ballistic missiles , the latest step in a campaign to press pyongyang to give up its nuclear and missile programs .
the u.s. treasury named the officials as kim jong sik and ri pyong chol .
it said kim was reportedly a key figure in north korea s efforts to switch its missile program from liquid to solid fuel , while ri was reported to be a key official involved in the country s intercontinental ballistic missile ( icbm ) development .
treasury is targeting leaders of north korea s ballistic missile programs , as part of our maximum pressure campaign to isolate ( north korea ) and achieve a fully denuclearized korean peninsula , treasury secretary steven mnuchin said in a statement .
these actions follow friday s united nations security council resolution , which imposed strong new sanctions on north korea further shutting down its ability to raise illicit funds .
the u.n. security council imposed new sanctions on north korea last week over a recent icbm test .
the sanctions sought to limit the country s access to refined petroleum products and crude oil and its earnings from workers abroad .
north korea , which has been working to develop nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the united states , declared those steps to be an act of war and tantamount to a complete economic blockade against the country .
