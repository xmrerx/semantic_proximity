washington ( reuters ) - the white house is preparing a $ 29 billion disaster aid request to send to the u.s. congress after hurricanes hit puerto rico , texas and florida , a white house official said on tuesday .
the request is expected to come on wednesday .
it will combine nearly $ 13 billion in new relief for hurricane victims with $ 16 billion for the government-backed flood insurance program , the white house official told reuters .
the white house wants congress to forgive $ 16 billion of the debt that the national flood insurance program , which insures about 5 million homes and businesses , has racked up .
the request comes as the program is close to running out of money , congressional aides said .
the program had racked up nearly $ 25 billion in debt before this season s major hurricanes .
the trump administration is also proposing more than a dozen reforms including new means testing and an extreme-loss repetition provision , aides said .
some homes insured under the program have gotten payments repeatedly from the program after multiple storms .
the flood insurance money is aimed primarily for areas impacted by hurricanes harvey and irma , which struck texas and florida , aides said .
congressional aides say the national flood insurance program is expected to run out of money the week of oct. 23 .
the $ 12.77 billion in hurricane aid is expected to last through the end of the calendar year , administration officials said .
they said earlier this week the government had about $ 10 billion on hand for disaster relief .
the trump administration is also seeking $ 576.5 million for wildfire suppression funding .
aides said the administration will acknowledge the need for a long-term fire borrowing fix and forestry management reforms , congressional aides said .
