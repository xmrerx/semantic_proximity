The attack on the pipeline ... was followed by the suspension of the pumping of oil to the State of Bahrain, the Saudi Ministry of Energy, Industry and Mineral Resources said.
The Ministry of Energy also confirmed that it has increased its security precautions at all its facilities, and that all these facilities enjoy the highest levels of protection and safety, it added in a statement.
