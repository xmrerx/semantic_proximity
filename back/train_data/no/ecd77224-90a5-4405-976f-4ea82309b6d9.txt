harare ( reuters ) - zimbabwe opposition leader morgan tsvangirai suffered severe vomiting after a party meeting and was airlifted to a johannesburg hospital , a senior party source said on saturday .
tsvangirai - who is due to challenge president robert mugabe in elections next year - was stable , the source said , dismissing reports in the media that he was dangerously sick .
the 65-year-old s symptoms came on suddenly at a meeting of his opposition coalition , the movement for democratic change ( mdc ) , on thursday evening in kadoma , a city around 160 km ( 100 miles ) southwest of the capital harare , the source said .
two other zimbabwean political sources confirmed the details of his sudden illness and airlift on friday to south africa .
but the mdc said in an official statement that tsvangirai was in south africa for a routine medical procedure .
morgan tsvangirai ... is in a very stable condition contrary to morbid media reports that he is critical and is battling for his life , the mdc statement said .
the announcement came a month after vice president emmerson mnangagwa , seen as a favorite to succeed 93-year-old mugabe , was rushed to south africa for emergency medical care .
mnangagwa , who has since returned , dismissed local media speculation that he had been poisoned .
tsvangirai said last year that he was being treated for colon cancer .
the party source said on saturday the sudden illness was not related to that condition .
