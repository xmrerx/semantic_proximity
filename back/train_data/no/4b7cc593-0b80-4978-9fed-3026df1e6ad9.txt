caracas ( reuters ) - venezuela has arrested the state oil company s boss for the western region and eight other executives at pdvsa , according to an internal company memo and a half-dozen sources in the opec member s oil industry .
it was not immediately clear why gustavo malave and the other employees were apprehended , though a series of corruption probes are under way at pdvsa and have entangled other employees .
the sources said malave was arrested on monday in zulia state , venezuela s traditional oil-producing region near colombia , in what would be one of the highest-profile detentions of a pdvsa executive .
pdvsa , the prosecutor s office , and malave did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
separately , venezuela s new chief prosecutor tarek saab on thursday announced he was investigating spectacular overpricing in a dozen contracts in the nation s orinoco oil belt , on the other side of the country .
the reputation of pdvsa - short for petroleos de venezuela sa - has been tarnished in recent years by graft investigations involving high-profile staff .
the company has blamed the problems on a small group of employees and executives , and promised a war on corruption .
last year , the opposition-led congress said $ 11 billion was lost at pdvsa between 2004 and 2014 , when rafael ramirez was in charge of the company .
he denied the allegations .
the caracas-based company is the financial motor of leftist president nicolas maduro s government , but is reeling from low oil prices , mismanagement , and lack of investments .
