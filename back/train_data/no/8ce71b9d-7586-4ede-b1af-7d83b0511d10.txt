( reuters ) - a lobbyist whose firm made payments to a law firm employing the son of late new york state senator thomas libous , at a time it regularly lobbied the once-influential politician , agreed to pay $ 10,000 to settle ethics charges related to a corruption probe .
the state ’ s joint commission on public ethics on friday said fred hiffa arranged for payments totaling $ 50,000 over one year to the westchester county law firm santangelo , randazzo & mangone , which employed libous ’ son matthew .
hiffa was accused of violating the gift ban provision of a new york lobbying law by causing his former albany-based firm ostroff , hiffa & associates inc to make the payments starting in 2006 , while he lobbied the senator on behalf of clients .
prosecutors have said the payments were meant to defray the cost of matthew libous ’ salary and a lease of a range rover .
mark glaser , a lawyer for hiffa , declined to comment .
once the state senate ’ s second-highest ranking republican and chairman of its transportation committee , thomas libous was found guilty by a federal jury in july 2015 of lying to federal bureau of investigation agents investigating the law firm ’ s hiring of his son .
the former senator , from binghamton , was later sentenced to six months of home confinement , after he had been diagnosed with terminal prostate cancer .
he died in may 2016 at age 63 .
matthew libous was separately convicted in january 2015 on tax charges , and sentenced to six months in prison .
hiffa ’ s former firm is now known as ostroff associates inc .
it had no immediate comment .
