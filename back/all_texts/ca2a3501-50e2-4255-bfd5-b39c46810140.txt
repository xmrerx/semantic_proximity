White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer was completely humiliated by MSNBC s Hallie Jackson during Tuesday s White House briefing.
Jackson wanted to know why Donald Trump would call on Congress to investigate the supposed wiretapping at Trump Tower when he claims to already have this very information.
This was a question Spicer couldn t answer.
All he could do was squirm.
You said the president stands by his tweets Saturday morning that President Obama ordered this wiretap, Jackson stated.
You ve also said that the president wants Congress to investigate.
Some members of Congress, by the way, have asked the White House and asked the president to come forward with the information.
So bottom line, why would the president want Congress to investigate for information he already has?
she asked.Spicer started blubbering about the importance of separation of powers but came nowhere near actually addressing the issue at hand.Jackson wasn t about to let him off the hook that easy, though.
She continued to press Spicer, wondering if the president has the info, Sean and I guess that s what I m trying to get to if he s sitting on this information that he found out, he s now directing or asking or recommending that the intelligence committees look into this.
And you talked about they have resources and staff, which they do, but why expend those resources and staff if the President found out this information and has it?
Spicer then explained that Trump thinks Congress asking the Justice Department to conduct an investigation might add credibility to the look of Trump s bogus accusation that former President Obama tapped his phones during the election.
I think we ve made it very clear how he wants this done, Spicer finally concluded when he could think of nothing better to say.Watch Sean Spicer be completely humiliated by MSNBC s Hallie Jackson:Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images
