Is Rand trying to separate himself from the crowded pack of GOP presidential contenders by ratcheting up the anti-war rhetoric that gained so much attention for his dad?
As the first GOP presidential debate approaches, Republican Senator and 2016 presidential candidate Rand Paul just launched a bomb against the crowded field, attempting to differentiate himself from the other candidates.Senator Paul told the leftist Washington Post in Iowa over the weekend that he s the only GOP candidate who doesn t want to blow up the world and that is a significant difference between him and the rest of the GOP field, and that he plans to make that case at the first debate on Thursday.According to the Post, Paul said that the debate will pit him against the other GOP candidates who want to send half a million of your sons and daughters back to Iraq and that he will ask the other GOP candidates whether they want to always intervene in every civil war around the world.
