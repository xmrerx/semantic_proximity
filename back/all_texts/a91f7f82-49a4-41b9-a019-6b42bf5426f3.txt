Isn t it a conflict of interest that Clinton is giving money to the DNC?
Ya think!Thanks to Breitbart News for finding an email that exposes the money transfer from the Clinton Campaign to the DNC.
The DNC hasn t responded so it would be a great idea to get a Freedom of Information request to see just how much is bring funded to the party since they re $8 million in debt.
Yes, the DNC is asking taxpayers to fund their convention no kidding!The Hillary Clinton campaign is quietly making cash transfers to the Democratic National Committee (DNC) to fund state party efforts in the South.
Hillary Clinton s deputy national political director Brynne Craig, 30, sent money to a state party chairman.
Craig assures the chairman that the Clinton campaign will be making another transfer to the DNC.
Then Craig said she would follow up to let you know the amount that is transferred.
The email sheds new light on the relationship between the financially insolvent DNC, led by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, and the Clinton campaign.
The Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)16% camp is suing the DNC in federal court ahead of Saturday night s debate in Goffstown, New Hampshire after the DNC banned the Sanders camp from its voter targeting data after it accessed data on Hillary Clinton voters, which was originally supposed to be shared over all of the Democratic campaigns.The Clinton campaign is clearly gearing up for the Southern Democratic Party s vaunted SEC primary in March, where Hillary Clinton lost her lead for the nomination in 2008 to then-Senator Barack Obama.Asked to comment, the Clinton campaign did not immediately respond with an answer that provides information about how much money the Clinton campaign transfers to the DNC.
The DNC also did not immediately provide that financial information.Here s the email:From: Brynne Craig <******@hillaryclinton.com> Date: November [], 2015 at **** PM CST (To: [] Cc: Richard McDaniel <*********@hillaryclinton.com>, Charles Olivier <********@hillaryclinton.com> Subject: Next Week {} I hope this email finds you well.
Happy early Thanksgiving!
I wanted to check in since December is quickly approaching.
We are planning to do another transfer to the DNC on December 1st.
We will follow up to let you know the amount that is transferred.
Please let us know if you have any questions.
Thanks, BrynneVia: Breitbart News
