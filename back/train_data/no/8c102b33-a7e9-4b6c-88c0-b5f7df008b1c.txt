london ( reuters ) - britain s electoral commission said on tuesday it has fined the liberal democrats party 18,000 pounds ( $ 24,069 ) for breaching campaign finance rules in the 2016 european union referendum .
the party was fined 17,000 pounds for failing to provide acceptable invoices or receipts and 1,000 pounds because some payments were reported in aggregate rather than as individual payments , the commission said in a statement .
the reporting requirements for parties and campaigners at referendums and elections are clear , that s why it is disappointing that the liberal democrats didn t follow them correctly , said bob posner , the electoral commission s director of political finance .
