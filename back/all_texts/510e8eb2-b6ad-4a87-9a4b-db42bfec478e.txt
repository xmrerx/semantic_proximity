Somehow we don t think this is what the Queen of the Clinton Crime Syndicate expected at this stage of her campaign The latest Q-poll numbers have dropped and there aren t really a lot of surprises in the top lines.
(Well there are a couple of exceptions but we ll get to those in a minute.)
What was really startling, though, was the results of the open ended questions about several of the candidates.
Most specifically, the massively leading, top of the list responses for Hillary Clinton have to be giving her team nightmares.
(Connecticut Post emphasis added)Clinton leads the Democratic field with 45 percent, down from 55 percent July 30, with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont at 22 percent and Biden at 18 percent.
No other candidate tops 1 percent with 11 percent undecided.
This is Sanders highest tally and closest margin.Clinton tops the Democrats no way list with 11 percent.
Liar is the first word that comes to mind more than others in an open-ended question when voters think of Clinton.
Arrogant is the word for Trump and voters say Bush when they think of Bush.
Here s the high end of the list.Holy cow.
You get 394 responses just by combining the top three results of Liar, Dishonest and Untrustworthy.
You pretty much have to add up all of the other words on the list to catch up with those three.
And this isn t just a list of responses by Republicans that s everyone.
What s truly amazing is that this is clearly the prevailing American perception at this point and yet, Clinton is still the Democrat frontrunner.
I m not sure if that says more about her or the party.
