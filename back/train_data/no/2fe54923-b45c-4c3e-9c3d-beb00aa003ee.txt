nashua , new hampshire ( reuters ) - u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton said on tuesday that she would consider making investment income taxable through social security deductions in a bid to keep the government program afloat , the wall street journal reported .
clinton , the front-runner for the party ’ s nomination in the nov. 2016 contest , made the comments while campaigning in iowa , where her lead has slipped in recent weeks ahead of the state ’ s early voting contest .
“ i am worried about certain recipients because i think it ’ s important to enhance the benefits , ” the journal reported clinton as saying at a campaign event in the city of decorah .
“ we do have to extend the life of the trust fund and that ’ s going to take some new funding , ” she said .
the newspaper reported that clinton would consider raising to an undisclosed amount the maximum income that would be subject to the 6.2 percent social security tax .
under the current rule , money made from investments , as well as pensions , annuities and interest , are not considered income , and only the first $ 118,500 wages are subject to the tax .
fears over the solvency of the social security system have made it an important election issue .
clinton ’ s main rival for the democratic nomination , bernie sanders , has described social security as the nation ’ s “ most successful government program , ” and has called for its expansion , which he says will be paid for by lifting the cap on taxable income above $ 250,000 .
voters in iowa will cast some of the country ’ s earliest ballot ’ s in the caucus nominating contest on feb. 1 .
