What would a Saturday morning in the Trump administration be without yet another unhinged rant from Liar-in-Chief Donald Trump?
After yet another devastating week for The Donald, he wants the American people to ignore the dumpster fire and realize that despite the plethora of problems he has caused for himself, everything is just fine.
Don t believe the main stream (fake news) media, Trump tweeted.
The White House is running VERY WELL.
I inherited a MESS and am in the process of fixing it.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 18, 2017What Trump actually inherited was an unemployment rate of 4.7% much lower than what Obama inherited from George W. Bush and a steadily-growing economy that CNBC notes may be Obama s biggest parting gift to The Donald.Trump s presidency has been a wild ride so far.
The guy we kinda-sorta elected has already threatened to send troops to Mexico to deal with bad hombres, messed up diplomatic relations with Australia (the cuddly teddy bear of U.S. relations), and embarrassed Americans daily with his unhinged ravings.
Multiple members of his administration have already been outed as subversive Russian stooges, he drained the swamp straight into his cabinet and hired a bunch of white supremacist bloggers and other insane people to run the federal government, and the people he is supposed to lead have no confidence in his ability to do so.Naturally, Trump s decision to scream FAKE SMOKE when there s a real fire didn t go over well:@realDonaldTrump You attack the press as the enemy.
Journalists in war zones have been killed serving the cause of truth.

@realDonaldTrump You inherited a traitorous National Security Advisor?
You didn't even know you had to hire your OWN staff!

Mike P Williams (@Mike_P_Williams) February 18, 2017@realDonaldTrump you are also holding a rally today, one month in power.
It may be Florida not Nuremberg but still very dictatorial.

It was more like a shitshow Barry Friedman (@Vuzvilla) February 18, 2017@realDonaldTrump What are stream media?
And which are the main ones, please?
Noel Cowley (@noelcowley) February 18, 2017Trump didn t inherit a mess.
He inherited a steadily-improving country but decided to spend his time attempting to keep Muslims from entering the country, diverting your hard-earned money to pay for his stupid wall, and making life easy for our nation s enemies by reviewing secure documents in the middle of his Florida home, which he now calls the Winter White House.
Trump and his administration are a joke unfortunately, no one is laughing.Featured image via Getty Images (Joe Raedle)/screengrab
