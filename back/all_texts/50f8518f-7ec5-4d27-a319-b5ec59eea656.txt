March 15 saw yet another Super Tuesday battle waged, and Hillary Clinton swept Florida, Ohio, and North Carolina by wide margins.
The contests are still undecided in Missouri and Illinois, with an especially tight margin in the latter.
Here is a breakdown of those Illinois demographics between the two Democratic candidates, via CBS News:Women are breaking for Clinton (54 percent), while men are going for Sanders (56 percent).
Just over a quarter of voters (27 percent) are African American, Clinton is getting about 69 percent of them, while 30 percent are for Sanders far higher than his margins in most other states that have voted thus far.
Sanders currently has the backing of 60 percent of white voters.Clinton has a slight edge as to who would make the best commander-in-chief, with 51 percent of Illinois primary voters naming her.
The majority (64 percent) say Clinton would have the better chance in defeating Donald Trump in November.
Still, more Illinois primary voters say Sanders (55 percent) inspires them about the future than Clinton (44 percent).Clinton also congratulated Bernie Sanders on the impressive campaign he is running during a victory speech in Florida.
The former Secretary of State is likely sweeping the south because of the fact that most Democratic voters in this area of the country are African American, and the Clintons have long had a great relationship with this community.
Women are also going for Clinton, while younger voters tend to like Sanders.Either way, both candidates are running classy campaigns, in sharp contrast to the childishness, mud-slinging, and dangerous rhetoric being displayed on the Right.Thank you, Secretary Clinton and Senator Sanders for keeping it classy and keeping it real.
