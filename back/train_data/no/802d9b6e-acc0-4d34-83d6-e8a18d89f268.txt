paris ( reuters ) - french president emmanuel macron said on sunday he would not follow germany s example by phasing out nuclear energy in france because his priority was to cut carbon emissions and shut down polluting coal-fired production .
i don t idolize nuclear energy at all .
but i think you have to pick your battle .
my priority in france , europe and internationally is co2 emissions and ( global ) warming , he told france 2 television in an interview .
macron , who has worked to establish his role as a global leader since his election win in may , presided over a climate summit in paris last week to breathe new life into a collective effort to fight climate change .
but renewable energy only amounts to a tiny share of french electricity production , which is dominated by nuclear for 75 percent of it .
nuclear is not bad for carbon emissions , it s even the most carbon-free way to produce electricity with renewables , macron said .
the 39-year old , who has sought to forge strong ties with german chancellor angela merkel , did not show any enthusiasm for her decision to phase out nuclear energy , one of her landmark policies .
what did the germans do when they shut all their nuclear in one go ? , macron said .
they developed a lot of renewables but they also massively reopened thermal and coal .
they worsened their co2 footprint , it wasn t good for the planet .
so i won t do that .
macron said he wanted to boost the growth of renewable energy but would wait for the french nuclear watchdog s opinion before shutting ageing nuclear reactors or upgrading others .
the asn nuclear regulator said last month it would rule on a potential lifespan extension of france s 58 nuclear reactors - all operated by state-owned edf - in 2020-21 .
this is what we ll base our decisions on , macron said .
so it ll be rational .
so in the face of that , we ll have to shut some plants .
maybe we ll have to modernize others , he said .
