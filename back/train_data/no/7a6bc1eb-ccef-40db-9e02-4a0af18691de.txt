karl rove is suggesting hillary suffered brain damage following her blood clot.on sunday , hillary clinton s campaign manager would not commit to releasing her health records during the 2016 campaign.face the nation host john dickerson pointed out that hillary clinton had a big health scare when she was secretary of state and asked campaign manager robby mook , will she release her medial records as part of this campaign ?
i will let hillary decide that , mook answered .
but i can tell you she has been hitting the campaign trail hard .
in 2012 , clinton had to delay her benghazi testimony to congress after she fell and suffered a concussion .
she later was treated for a blood clot in her brain , which experts said could have been life threatening .
though clinton joked about her cracked head in emails that the state department recently released , bill clinton revealed last year that hillary s injuries required six months of very serious work to get over .
on the stump this weekend , clinton tried to deflect concerns about her age by saying that she would be the youngest woman president if elected to the white house.via : breitbart news
