The investigation into Donald Trump and his associates possible collusion with the Russian government to fix the 2016 presidential election is moving at lightening speed now.
With Trump s openly admitting that he fired FBI Director James Comey due to the Russia investigation hell, he even admitted it to the Russians it looks like we may have a pretty clear case of obstruction of justice on the part of this alleged president, and it seems that the White House Counsel s office knows it, too.According to CNN, the White House Counsel s Office, headed up by Don McGahn, is now actively consulting experts on what the impeachment of Donald Trump might look like.
Apparently, it is simply in the internal research phase at this time, and the White House Counsel thinks that the GOP-controlled Congress will cushion the blows and cover for Trump.When pressed for comment on this development, the White House simply says, it s not true.
That comes as no surprise, though, because that is what they always say when it comes to news stories that are unflattering to them or their orange leader whether said stories are true or not.I am personally more inclined to believe the reporting from CNN, which says:The legal discussions are part of a broader internal effort to bolster the president s legal defense, which has become more complicated with the Justice Department s appointment of a special counsel to pursue the investigation into Russian meddling in the 2016 election.In other words, they realize that the special counsel who has been appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein in the form of former FBI Director Robert Mueller will not be bullied, intimidated, or manipulated.
They also realize what it would look like if Trump just up and fired Mueller the way he did James Comey, so that particular trick is off the table at this point.Trump and his cronies are in deep shit, and their days are numbered.
If we re lucky, the whole treasonous, corrupt bunch will be chucked out of our White House and hauled off to jail by the time this is all said and done.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
