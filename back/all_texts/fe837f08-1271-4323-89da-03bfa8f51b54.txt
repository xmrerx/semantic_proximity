Who knew the Middle East had a prestigious school for fake inventors who bring fake bombs to school on 9-11?
Clock kid Ahmed Mohamed and his family announced Tuesday in a news release that they will move to Qatar, less than 24 hours after the 14-year-old met with President Barack Obama at the White House.
Our family has been overwhelmed by the many offers of support we have received since the unfortunate incident of Ahmed s arrest.
From the White House to Sudan, to Mecca, we have been welcomed by a variety of individuals, businesses and educational institutions, which have all provided Ahmed with real encouragement and the ambition to continue to work hard, the family said in a statement.
After careful consideration of all the generous offers received, we would like to announce that we have accepted a kind offer from Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development (QF) for Ahmed to join the prestigious QF Young Innovators Program, which reflects the organization s on-going dedication to empowering young people and fostering a culture of innovation and creativity, the family continued.
This means that we, as a family, will relocate to Qatar where Ahmed will receive a full scholarship for his secondary and undergraduate education, the family concluded.Mohamed said he was really impressed with everything that Qatar Foundation has to offer and the campuses are really cool.
I got to meet other kids who are also really interested in science and technology, he said after accepting the scholarship.
I think I will learn a lot and also have lots of fun there.
