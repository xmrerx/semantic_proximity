WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Spain s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy told journalists on Tuesday they opposed a referendum in Spain s Catalonia region scheduled for this weekend, which the Spanish government has tried to thwart.
I m just for a united Spain, said Trump, who cast doubt on polling data predicting a yes vote for independence will win.
I really think the people of Catalonia would stay with Spain.
I think it would be foolish not to.
