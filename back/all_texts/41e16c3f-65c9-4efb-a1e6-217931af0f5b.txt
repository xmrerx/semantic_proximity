Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of playing the woman card, minimizing the employment record of the former Watergate lawyer, First Lady, Senator and Secretary of State.
But it also seems to have been a way of signaling his fellow Republicans to unleash sexist attacks against the likely Democratic nominee.Cue the official with the Florida Republican Party, a key swing state with a ton of electoral college votes.Bob Sutton, chairman of the Broward County GOP Executive Committee, suggested Clinton would be easy to debate in the general election.
I think when Donald Trump debates Hillary Clinton she s going to go down like Monica Lewinsky, Sutton told the Post.Kristin Matheny, secretary of the Broward County Republican Party in Sutton s county, told the Sun Sentinel newspaper that Sutton should apologize.Clinton has already turned the sexist attack from Trump into an advantage for her campaign.
On Thursday, the Clinton campaign solicited donations and in exchange said it would send supporters a woman card to show off.The candidate herself, in her victory speech after winning four out of five primaries on Tuesday night, told Trump that if the woman card meant standing up for equal rights, pay, etc., deal me in.
Trump goes into the general election already facing huge deficits in support in nearly every slice of the demographic pie, but none worse than among women.The reality TV star turned Republican frontrunner claims that he can make up the gap by election day, but before Democrats have even run any negative ads, his history of sexist and misogynist comments has already frightened members of the Republican establishment.The Republican Party has lost the women s vote in every election since 1988, losing the key demographic even in years it which it won the overall race, like in 2004.President Obama has excelled with women voters, earning 13% more of the vote in 2008, and 11% more in 2012.
Especially with a female candidate on the top of the Democratic ticket, Republicans are playing with fire by attacking Clinton in this way.Featured image via Flickr
