Mike Pence, the right-wing nut who is running alongside Donald Trump for the vice presidential position, had a few words for President Obama after his speech at the Democratic National Convention when he called Trump a homegrown demogauge among other things: I don t think name calling has any place in public life, and I thought that was unfortunate that the president of the United States would use a term like that, let alone laced into a sentence like that.
You read that right.
Mike Pence, who s running alongside Donald Trump, is offended that President Obama would resort to name calling in public.The irony is just too rich with this one.
Coupled with Trump having his feelings hurt by speakers at the DNC, the hypocrisy from the Trump camp could not be more rank.Thanks to the New York Times, we know that Donald Trump has insulted, personally, over 250 people, places and things just on Twitter alone.While Pence is offended by the homegrown demogauge line, he seems perfectly fine with words and lines like: corrupt; crooked; dopey clown; goofy; Pocahontas; perv; sleazebag; disgrace; dummy; irrelevant clown; moron; loser; wacko; crazy; waste of time and energy; low-life; phony; hokey garbage; sloppy; grubby; buffoon; bimbo; dog; bitch; truly weird.The list, as documented by the NYT, goes on and on.So, to Mike Pence, please do us all a favor and shut up.
If you really don t want name calling in politics, maybe you should talk to your running mate first, considering that right after Bloomberg s speech, Trump revived his little insult once given to Marco Rubio.Trump and Pence are buckling under the pressure of public opinion, and their inability to see past their own hypocrisy is turning Republicans against them (as well as Independents).Featured image via Sarah D.
