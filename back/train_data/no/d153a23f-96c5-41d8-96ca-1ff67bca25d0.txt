when he was running for president , donald trump made locking up hillary clinton for her criminal behavior a centerpiece of his campaign .
just the mere mention of her name would send supporters at his massive rallies into a wild chant , as they screamed , lock her up !
trump s supporters weren t chanting to be cute .
trump supporters were chanting because after decades of evading the law , americans were quite serious about expecting candidate donald trump to follow through on his campaign promise to hold her accountable , and make her pay for her crimes , just like any other american would be expected to do .
when we told @ realdonaldtrump to lock her up !
we weren t asking mr. president , please deliver on your promise .
