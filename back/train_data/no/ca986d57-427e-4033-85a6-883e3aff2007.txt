leave it to a democrat to waste everyone s time and money by putting forth legislation she knows has no chance of passing , as a means to convince legislators they need to make it easier to kill an unborn child .
a kentucky lawmaker has put forward a bill that would require men to visit a doctor at least twice and obtain a signed permission slip from their wives before they could obtain a prescription for the erectile dysfunction drug viagra.state rep. mary lou marzian , a democrat , acknowledged to the louisville courier-journal that the bill has no chance of passing .
however , she said the bill was a response to several anti-abortion measures , including a recently ratified law that requires a woman seeking an abortion to get counseling at least 24 hours in advance from a health professional.in an opinion piece , marzian said her bill is meant to illustrate the absurdity of government encroachment into women s personal and medical decisions currently running amok in the kentucky general assembly and [ gov .

marzian s bill specifies that only married men can obtain viagra and a prospective patient must make a sworn statement with his hand on a bible that he will only use a prescription for a drug for erectile dysfunction when having sexual relations with his current spouse .
other state lawmakers have filed similar bills to make political points .
in 2012 , a bill from an ohio state senator required men to get a psychological evaluation before getting a viagra prescription and last year a south carolina state representative filed a bill that would require men to wait 24 hours before getting a prescription.marzian has also said she would file a bill requiring potential gun buyers to undergo counseling from victims of gun violence 24 hours in advance of the purchase .
