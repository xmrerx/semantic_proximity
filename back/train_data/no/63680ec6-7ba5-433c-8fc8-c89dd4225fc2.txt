of course obama the putz blames too little government for the poisoned water crisis in flint obama to congress on flint aid : # doyourjobon a trip focused on letting flint residents know they have not been forgotten , president barack obama put pressure on congress to move a bill that would bring aid to flint , mich. and other communities at risk of lead contamination in their water systems.as pro s annie snider reports , both houses are out of session until next week , but the senate could , in theory , take up a water infrastructure bill that includes assistance to flint and other cities with lead-pipe distribution systems .
the bill easily passed out of the senate environment and public works committee 19-1 .
obama would like to see that bill move sooner rather than later .
congress , led by your congressional delegation , needs to act in a bipartisan fashion , do their job , make sure flint has the necessary resources , obama said wednesday in a speech in flint.president puns it like me , calls small-government philosophy corrosive : the president used the speech to broadly attack the conservative philosophy of less-government-is-good-government , saying an anti-government attitude was at the root of the problems in flint .
i do think that part of what contributed to this crisis was a broader mindset , a bigger attitude , a corrosive attitude , that exists in our politics and exists in too many levels of our government , he said .
it s a mindset that believes that less government is the highest good , no matter what .
boos for snyder , but not from obama : gov .
rick snyder also spoke at the event amid boos from the crowd of over 1,000 people .
but obama held off from attacking the governor , even trying to quiet the boobirds .
no , no , obama said .
we re doing some business here .
