tokyo ( reuters ) - japan s prime minister shinzo abe may have won a major election victory on sunday , but half the people surveyed post-election by the asahi newspaper don t want him to stay prime minister .
it seems the election victory has boosted the approval rating for abe s administration , but not him .
public support rate for abe s administration grew to 42 percent in the survey , conducted between oct. 23 and 24 , up from 38 percent in its previous survey in mid-oct .
but 47 percent of respondents don t want abe to continue as prime minister , exceeding 37 percent who want him to stay , said the survey published on wednesday .
abe s disapproval rating slipped to 39 percent from 40 percent , according to the asahi s survey .
abe is due to remain prime minister until september 2018 when his tenure as liberal democratic party ( ldp ) leader ends and a new vote for ldp leader is held abe s ldp-led coalition won a combined 313 seats in sunday s national election , keeping its two-thirds super majority in the 465-member lower house , local media said .
several experts noted the ruling bloc s win was less a victory for the long-ruling ldp than a defeat for a divided opposition .
the asahi s survey also showed 51 percent of respondents said the number of seats the ruling bloc s won was too many , while 32 percent expressed the seat number was good .
and 54 percent of respondents said they were concerned about abe s policies , exceeding 29 percent who said they have positive expectations , the asahi said .
a yomiuri newspaper survey on wednesday showed the approval rating for abe s administration was up at 52 percent from 41 percent in its previous survey early this month .
asked reasons for the ldp s winning majority on its own , only six percent said it was high hopes for abe , 10 percent said appreciation of ruling parties achievements while 44 percent cited fragmentation of opposition , the yomiuri said .
