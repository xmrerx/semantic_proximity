diyarbakir , turkey ( reuters ) - the turkish military killed three kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) militants in a clash in northern iraq near the border with turkey on thursday evening and one turkish soldier was also killed , security sources said .
the sources said four turkish soldiers were wounded in the firefight in the kanimasi area of iraq s dohuk region , across the border from turkey s cukurca district .
the clash occurred as turkish and iraqi troops hold military exercises some 100 km ( 60 miles ) to the west at the habur border gate , part of coordinated steps by the two countries in response to the iraqi kurdish independence referendum .
turkish soldiers have for years been deployed in various parts of northern iraq , including at kanimasi , to prevent pkk militants crossing the border into turkey , security sources say .
commanders of the pkk , which is designated a terrorist group by turkey , the united states and european union , are based in the mountains of northern iraq .
turkish warplanes frequently carry out cross-border air strikes against pkk targets there but reports of clashes on land there are rare .
more than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict since the pkk launched its separatist insurgency in 1984 .
