Jimmy Kimmel started out his interview with guest comedian Tim Allen on the Late Show Thursday night by asking him if he went to Trump s inauguration.
Allen seemed a bit taken back by Kimmel s opening question that put him on the defense, and potentially set the tone for what could ve been a rough interview.
Allen responded: You get in this town you gotta be real careful around here, or you ll get beat up if you don t believe what everyone believes.
It s like 30 s Germany.
If you re not part of the group, you know what we believe is right!'
Allen was quickly able to change the subject and move away from Kimmel s obvious desire to embarrass Allen for his support for our President.
That Jimmy Kimmel he sure is a funny guy No wonder his ratings are in the toilet
