CNN s Anderson Cooper has pretty much had it with Trump surrogates.
Last week, he became a viral internet meme when he rolled his eyes at Kellyanne Conway.
Now, he s about to become another internet meme with his hilariously disgusting and inappropriate comment to Trump sycophant Jeffrey Lord.Cooper was interviewing Lord on Friday afternoon.
Lord was defending Trump s telling Russian officials that he fired Comey to take the pressure off his administration.
Cooper became just frustrated enough with the BS that was being spouted that Cooper, on live cable news TV, said, If he told a dump on his desk, you would defend it.
Cooper realized that the might have wandered outside the norms of professionalism (don t we all these days) and sort of apologized.
He even offered Lord a bit of flattery if you can call it that: I mean, I don t know what he would do that you would not defend, Cooper continued.
I mean, you re a loyal guy, I think that speaks well of you.

It was unprofessional.
I am genuinely sorry.

If he was in the studio I would have theoat punched him Marine Zograbyan (@TAINTEDLUVV) May 20, 2017@andersoncooper I would hold the apology until after Trump apologizes for calling for the state execution of the innocent Central Park 5 kids.

It doesn t inform anyone.
