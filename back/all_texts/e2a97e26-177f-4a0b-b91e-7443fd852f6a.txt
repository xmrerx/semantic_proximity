Hillary Clinton s campaign manager dropped a bombshell in his prediction for the winner of the 2016 elections and it s not Hillary.
It s a signal that the Democrats need to get serious about a candidate to run against some very strong competition.
The Drudge poll from last night s debate has Trump killing the competition in a YUGE way.
No matter what candidate you support, it s great to have the Democrats worried.
I think they need to be!In a stunning admission, Hillary Clinton s campaign manager predicts in an email that Donald Trump will become president if he wins the Republican nomination.
If Donald Trump takes the Republican nomination, our party will lose more than the presidency, Robby Mook writes to supporters.
Years of progress will be ripped away.
Obamacare will be repealed.
Marriage equality will be rolled back.
Get excited to visit the wall on the Mexico border and get ready to pay for it if President Trump can t magically get Mexico to cough up the cash for it.
While Mook stokes fear over an apparently inevitable Trump presidency, he s also panicking over a surging Bernie Sanders.Late last night, Bernie Sanders campaign announced they d raised $1.4 million from 50,000 donations in a single day.
The day before, they announced that the Reddit community had contributed more than $1 million to his campaign.There s no denying this: His supporters are stepping up.
They see a chance to win in Iowa and they re willing to go all in for their guy.Via: Gateway Pundit
