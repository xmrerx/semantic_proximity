President Trump spoke to a huge and enthusiastic crowd tonight in Phoenix, AZ.
It wouldn t be Donald J. Trump if he didn t call out our dishonest and very fake news media.
Trump told the crowd, Media doesn t want to report that I spoke out against violence and bigotry in reference to his comments following the horrible clashes in Charlottesville, VA, where in the aftermath, Trump blamed both sides.
The media quickly condemned him and tried to twist his words to make it appear as though he refused to condemn the KKK, simply because he wasn t willing to let the violent George Soros, anti-American group Antifa or the violent domestic terror group, Black Lives Matter off the hook for their part in the violent conflict.PRESIDENT TRUMP: "Media doesn't want to report that I spoke out against bigotry and violence."
