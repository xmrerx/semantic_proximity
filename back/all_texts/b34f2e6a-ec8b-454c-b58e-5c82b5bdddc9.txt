CNN commentator Van Jones stood by his praise of President Trump on CNN s New Day Wednesday.
After Trump s Joint Address to Congress, Jones called moments of the speech extraordinary and said that Trump became President of the United States.
Asked by New Day host Alisyn Camerota if he wanted to amend his comments at all, Jones declned the opportunity.
In that moment, I m proud, I m human, I can still get teary-eyed even in a Trump speech, Jones said.Via: Weasel Zippers
