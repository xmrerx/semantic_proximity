The initial run of Megyn Kelly s Sunday newsmagazine show will reportedly be taken off the air at least two episodes earlier than scheduled because of her disastrous ratings.
Last week, Sunday Night with Megyn Kelly set another viewership low with just 2.71 million total viewers.
In the last three weeks, her show has failed to beat the years-old Dateline rerun the network ran in her show s time slot when Kelly took a week off during the Fourth of July holiday weekend.According to the New York Post, Kelly s ratings-challenged Sunday show was announced as a limited run that would return after the football season.
The network was reportedly angling for at least ten episodes but apparently decided to end Kelly s misery after eight episodes as Kelly s downward spiral in the ratings did not stop.An NBC spinmeister claimed that Kelly s show was going off the air after this week s show because she needs to be freed up to focus on her morning show.
Translation: Kelly needs to do all she can to not ruin NBC s crown jewel Today franchise.
Network executives, who reportedly have been freaking out about Kelly s poor ratings, are probably praying that Kelly simply does no more harm than she has already done in her short time at the network.
