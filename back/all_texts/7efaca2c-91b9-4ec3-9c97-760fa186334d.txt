MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday that President Vladimir Putin and Saudi Arabia s King Salman had discussed military cooperation in talks on Thursday and said other countries should not worry about such ties.
Work on this will be continued, Peskov told reporters on a conference call.
The improvement of military cooperation between Russia and Saudi Arabia ... is not directed against a third party and we believe it s groundless to express concern about this issue.
