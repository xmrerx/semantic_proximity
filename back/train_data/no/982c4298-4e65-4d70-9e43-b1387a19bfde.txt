washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. budget deficit is expected to grow to $ 590 billion in fiscal year 2016 due to slower than expected growth in revenues and higher spending for programs including social security and medicare , the congressional budget office said on tuesday .
the estimate , which is $ 56 billion larger than cbo â€™ s forecast in march , shows the deficit increasing in relation to economic output for the first time since 2009 .
cbo said the deficit is expected to be $ 152 billion higher than in 2015 and will equal 3.2 percent of economic output .
the deficit peaked at $ 1.4 trillion in 2009 and shrank to $ 485 billion in 2014 .
the nonpartisan research agency also said that debt held by the public will amount to nearly 77 percent of gross domestic product by the end of 2016 , three percentage points higher than last year and its highest ratio since 1950 .
the 2016 federal fiscal year ends sept. 30 .
revenues have increased by less than 1 percent in 2016 , while government outlays are predicted to rise by 5 percent as a result of mandatory spending for social security and medicare , the federal retirement and healthcare programs for the elderly .
the cbo said the forecast indicates tepid u.s. economic growth of only 1 percent for the first half of calendar year 2016 but predicted the economy would expand more robustly in coming months and create growth of 2 percent for the year and 2.4 percent for 2017 .
faster growth will spur hiring , increase wages and put upward pressure on inflation and interest rates .
but over the next 10 years , cbo said economic output would be restrained by a relatively slow increase in the u.s. labor supply .
