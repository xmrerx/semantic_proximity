manila ( reuters ) - a joint session of the philippine congress on wednesday approved a one-year extension of martial law on the southern island of mindanao , backing a move by president rodrigo duterte to tackle muslim extremists .
security officials had earlier told congress militants loyal to islamic state were regrouping and recruiting young fighters to launch attacks in the region of 22 million people , home to the country s muslim minority .
opponents had said one year was excessive and the measure did not satisfy a constitutional requirement for a rebellion to be taking place .
