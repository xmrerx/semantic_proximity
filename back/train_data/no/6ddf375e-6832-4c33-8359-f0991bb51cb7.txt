so let it be said so let it be done.i don t remember anyone asking if americans were okay with the month of june being dedicated to homosexuality .
how quickly we mere citizens have morphed into nothing more than serfs in king hussein-obama s kingdom lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender pride month , 2016by the president of the united states of americaa proclamationsince our founding , america has advanced on an unending path toward becoming a more perfect union .
this journey , led by forward-thinking individuals who have set their sights on reaching for a brighter tomorrow , has never been easy or smooth .
the fight for dignity and equality for lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( lgbt ) people is reflected in the tireless dedication of advocates and allies who strive to forge a more inclusive society .
they have spurred sweeping progress by changing hearts and minds and by demanding equal treatment under our laws , from our courts , and in our politics .
this month , we recognize all they have done to bring us to this point , and we recommit to bending the arc of our nation toward justice.last year s landmark supreme court decision guaranteeing marriage equality in all 50 states was a historic victory for lgbt americans , ensuring dignity for same-sex couples and greater equality across state lines .
for every partnership that was not previously recognized under the law and for every american who was denied their basic civil rights , this monumental ruling instilled newfound hope , affirming the belief that we are all more free when we are treated as equals .
