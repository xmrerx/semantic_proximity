MOSCOW (Reuters) - If the United States withdraws from the Iran nuclear deal, this will have extremely negative consequences, and Iran is likely to quit the agreement as well, the Kremlin said on Friday.
Certainly, this will damage the atmosphere of predictability, security, stability and non-proliferation in the entire world, President Vladimir Putin s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.
He said Russia would continue its policy to ensure the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons.
