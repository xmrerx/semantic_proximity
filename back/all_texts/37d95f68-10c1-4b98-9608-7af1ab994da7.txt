This is a MUST watch from start to finish.
There has never been a leftist who can defeat the brilliant Dinesh D Souza in a debate.
He is a gift to conservatism and if we are ever going to win the war against the Left, it is in everyone s best interest to listen to what this brilliant man has to say and learn how to turn the argument back on these faux moralists.
The best part of the discussion between this leftist Amherst student and Dinesh D Souza comes at the 5:40 mark and again at the 10:15 mark: History is very complicated.
Let me give you an example of India, so we can look at this at the level of theory.
India was invaded by the British, and earlier by the Afghans, and the Persians and the Mongols.
So you have all these successive invasions.
Right?
Are you actually saying that you believe in a rule of social justice today, that says globally lets look at this as a global rule of justice I m gonna figure out whose ancestors did what to whom and I m going to return goods that were illicitly taken from the beginning, to the people who had it originally.
Do you believe that s a viable way to organize our society?
Do you believe, if I can ask you a direct question, that you are the benefit of white privilege here at Amherst?
The rest is pure gold Since you are an acknowledged beneficiary of illicit white privilege.
Would you be willing to step aside, voluntarily, putting your own moral mouth where your self-proclaimed virtue is, and give your seat, your seat, not my seat, I realize you may be super generous with other people s advantages and favor affirmative action so other white kids who apply to Amherst are turned away to open spaces for minorities.
But I m not talking about you acting out you acting out your virtue on them.
I m talking about you acting out your virtue on you.
Are you willing to give up your illicit seat, that you don t deserve here at Amherst to make room for a disadvantaged minority?
Yes or no?
