Hours before the third and final presidential debate, even Trump s own daughter is trying to distance herself from her father s failing campaign.During Fortune s The Most Powerful Women Summit, Ivanka Trump was asked about the role she has taken on as one of the most visible members of the inner circle of a Republican nominee who just in the last two weeks has body shamed a Miss Universe contestant and appeared in that [Access Hollywood] tape and suggested that other women that accused him were too unattractive [for him] to have assaulted.
My brand was launched far before the presidential cycle commenced, Ivanka responded.
And I ve always tried to maintain complete separation between that and the campaign.
I hate the word surrogate, she added.
Because what does that mean?
When people talk about I m his confidante at one point, major newspapers were writing that I was a vice presidential candidate.
I m saying, no, I m a daughter.
She also said that except for childcare and women s rights, she keeps her views on policy to herself.
She then reiterated that she does not consider herself to be a Republican.
But I m not a surrogate, she insisted.
I m a daughter.
I stood in front of the [Republican National Convention] and shared that I m an independent, which is very consistent with many other millennials.
But I do dismiss this idea of a surrogate because I don t think it appreciates the role that I m playing as my father s daughter I m not the campaign mastermind.
