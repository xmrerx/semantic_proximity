Another person was attacked at a Trump rally in what has become a theme at Trump events since the billionaire businessman threw in his hat for the Republican nomination for the presidency.This time, a young Latina woman had a poster denouncing Trump s stance on immigration ripped out of her hand by two men.
The men were praised by Trump for their courage.
In fact, Trump was so elated that he gleefully recounted the entire attack.
I saw fists start to fly, Trump said, calling her a rough cookie.
He then gave praise to the attackers, saying.
I love people with courage.
But, it gets crazier than that.
After the protester is escorted out of the building (she flipped Trump off with two her two middle fingers), Trump invited the attackers on stage to make speeches.
After some cuddling and hugging between Trump and his two heroes, one man took the mic and said: Do not let them intimidate you.
They will say anything, they will do anything to keep in power.
We don t need who is in there now.
We need to get some fresh bunch up there, some fresh blood.
As the crowd roared and cheered, the second man, an Iraq war veteran, said: If it wasn t for Mr. Trump right here, I don t think any of us would have the voice that we have.
This is the only man who is really going to bring America back.
This is not the first time that Trump has praised attacks on protesters.
When a protester from Black Lives Matter was roughed up at a Trump rally, Trump defended the actions of his supporters: Maybe he should have been roughed up.
It was disgusting what he was doing.
In August, when two men inspired by Trump s racism beat and urinated on a Latino man, Trump put a different spin on things: They love this country and they want this country to be great again.
Trump rallies are indicative of what a Trump presidency would look like: chaotic, racist, and violent.Watch Video Here:Featured image from video screen capture
