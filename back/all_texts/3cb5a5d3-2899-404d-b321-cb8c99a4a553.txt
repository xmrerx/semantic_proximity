(Reuters) - The Standing Rock Sioux tribe in a statement on Tuesday said it opposed U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive order that would allow the Dakota Access Pipeline to move forward.
The tribe, in a statement, said the $3.8 billion project would contaminate U.S. and tribal water supply, and that it intends to take legal action against the decision.
Separately, a lawyer for the tribe said the action was being done “hastily and irresponsibly.”
