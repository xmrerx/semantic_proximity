beirut ( reuters ) - a hezbollah member of the lebanese parliament said on thursday that proposed new u.s. sanctions against the powerful iran-backed group aimed to provoke unrest in lebanon .
the u.s. house of representatives on wednesday endorsed new sanctions on the shi ite hezbollah militia , part of an effort to increase pressure on iran .
the new sanctions have not yet become law .
the sanctions law ... is a blatant interference in lebanese internal affairs , a violation of its national sovereignty and an unacceptable targeting of the lebanese people , hezbollah parliamentarian hassan fadlallah said in a televised statement .
america aims , through this aggressive behavior in legislation , to subjugate lebanon , to stir unrest and deprive its people of development , fadlallah said .
hezbollah is in lebanon s delicate , national unity government and fights alongside syrian president bashar al-assad in syria s more than six-year long conflict .
it is classified as a terrorist group by washington and on wednesday the house of representatives passed a resolution urging the european union to do the same .
one of the measures passed by the house of representatives was an amendment strengthening the 2015 u.s. hezbollah international financing prevention act ( hifpa ) which aimed to sever the group s global funding networks .
when hifpa was introduced it caused alarm in beirut where the government feared major damage to the banking sector that underpins lebanon s economy .
but lebanon s central bank governor riad salameh told reuters on tuesday lebanon had mechanisms already in place to deal with any new sanctions .
salameh also said this week the american treasury appeared content with how lebanon was applying sanctions regulations .
they consider the measures which lebanon s central bank has put in place to be sufficient , he said after a visit to the u.s. , in a statement distributed by lebanon s presidential media office .
