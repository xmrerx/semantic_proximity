Salisbury City Councilwoman April Jackson posted a Facebook status last Thursday proclaiming that President Trump is RETARDED.
Ya lls President is RETARDED ..He s far pass the Holly Center, Jackson wrote on her Facebook page.For those that don t know, the referenced Holly Center is a state-operated, 24-hour residential training facility for individuals with developmental disabilities.
That s right.
Jackson not only called the President of the United States retarded, she then made it worse by comparing Trump to a facility where mentally disabled or challenged people try to make their lives better.Here s the original deleted post:Meanwhile, the woman who calls President Trump RETARDED appears to struggle when it comes to putting a complete sentence together on many of her Facebook posts:Anyone else notice that Jackson either liked, laughed or loved her own post?
Pathetic.Not to be outdone, Jackson commented on the controversy surrounding her comments, and as far as I can tell, she apologized for nothing.
Watch below:Local news station WBOC-TV 16 tried to contact Jackson to ask her about her post on Facebook.
Not surprisingly, Jackson didn t respond.WBOC-TV 16, Delmarvas News Leader, FOX 21 Via-MRCTV
