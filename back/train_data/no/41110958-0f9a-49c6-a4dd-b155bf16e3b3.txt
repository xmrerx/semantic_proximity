jerusalem ( reuters ) - israel on monday approved building plans for 31 settler homes in hebron in the west bank , a spokeswoman said , a first such move in the israeli-occupied area for some 15 years .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu has felt increased pressure for settlement expansion from the rightist flank of his coalition , though construction is not imminent as a bureaucratic process must still run its course .
his government has made numerous announcements of settlement building recently , angering palestinians seeking a state on land israel captured in a 1967 war but no longer eliciting serious u.s. criticism with president donald trump in the white house .
still , settlement advocates say that despite a string of announcements for construction of thousands of settler homes in the west bank , only a fraction might be built eventually .
hebron is the largest palestinian city in the occupied west bank with a population of some 216,000 .
about 1,000 israeli settlers live in the heart of the city , which for decades has been a focus of religious friction between muslims and jews .
israeli anti-settlement watchdog peace now detailed the project s plans in an area of hebron where the settlers live and its web site showed a graphic of what the prospective four-storey , stone-clad apartment block would look like .
it said that the last time settler homes were built in this area was in 2002 .
hadar horen , a spokeswoman for the israeli body that runs civilian affairs in the west bank , could not confirm the details issued by peace now and said the planning committee decision would be published later .
