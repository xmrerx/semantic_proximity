the term fake news has become attached to some of america s major news outlets .
now a ymca in valparaiso , ind. , has decided to ban cnn from its tvs after customers complained the news network falsifies stories .
in order to eliminate perceived political bias associated with national news outlets , the valparaiso family ymca will only be showing local news channels in the future , the valparaiso ymca said in a statement.chicago tribune reporter/columnist jerry davich said he asked valparaiso ymca ceo robert wanek to elaborate on why the decision was made , and wanek responded , i can not pinpoint the change origins , only to add that we get dozens of requests to change channels every day from numerous interest groups .
we just want the y to be a haven for wellness where people come together and have a sense of belonging , gain new relationships and achieve their personal goals , wanek added .
we will display local news moving forward .
davich complained that the y s decision to remove all national news outlets from its televisions says more about its leaders than its members .
you d think this story would be just another example of fake news .
sadly , it s not .
he said he wondered if the company was simply exercising its right to appease as many members as possible , or is the new donald trump-led america already flexing its muscles ?
ymca member greg quartucci told cbs chicago the decision to remove cnn from wellness center tvs was made shortly after trump confronted cnn white house correspondent jim acosta , calling his network terrible and fake news .
