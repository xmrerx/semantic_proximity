With Donald Trump making a bad guy of anyone with brown skin, and claiming to even want to put a wall along the entire border of Mexico, it s stoking the flame of an already ridiculously racist part of America that is now feeling free to come out of the woodwork.One of Trump s racist supporters just lost his damn mind.The unhinged rant was caught on camera, and threats of violence were even made.
The Trump supporter said: Made it USA, bitch.
Made it fucking USA.
Go fucking cook my burrito, bitch Go fucking make my tortilla motherfucker, and build that wall for ME!
TRUMP!
I love Trump!
Fuck you!
I love my country!
I ll fuck at least ten of you up you re lucky all these cops are here It s become more than clear that this supporter, alongside so many others thinks that this sort of behavior is perfectly acceptable.
Not only that, there s a sense of white pride entitlement that is so blindingly apparent.We simply cannot allow Trump to be president, because if he wins, be ready for much, much more of this.
And that thought should terrify everyone.Watch the ridiculously racist rant here: Go cook my burrito, Bitch!
-Racist Trump supporter.
