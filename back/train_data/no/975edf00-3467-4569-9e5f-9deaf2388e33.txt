berlin ( reuters ) - the german military , buoyed by 45 million views of its previous social media reality show the recruits , is to launch a new show on monday that shows the lives of eight soldiers serving in u.n. peacekeeping mission in mali .
the six-week show provides a realistic and authentic look at an actual military deployment , including the crash of an airbus tiger helicopter in july that killed both crew members , a defense ministry spokesman said on friday .
it will be shown mondays through thursdays on youtube , facebook and instagram , with a chatbot sending messages several times a day about the soldiers activities .
colonel holger neumann said the accident would play a role in one of the later episodes and would be treated with the necessary sensitivity .
the military last month resumed flights of the tiger helicopters , but continues to investigate the cause of the crash .
the show cost 6.5 million euros to produce and market , neumann said , describing it as part of the military s drive to make the military a more attractive career option .
the last show , which showed how new recruits were trained , sparked a 40-percent increase in traffic at the ministry s career website and a 25-percent boost in calls to a recruitment hotline , he said .
ilka hoffmann , a board member at the gew union that represents about 280,000 teachers , social workers and education workers , said the new program s action film aesthetic was clearly targeting young people and glamorizing war .
not everything is as positive as it is portrayed .
people can die during this deployment or come back traumatized , she said .
the bundeswehr can t want people to sign up out of a sense of adventure .
she said the union , the nonprofit group terres des hommes and other groups have also protested the military s school outreach program aimed at 16- and 17-year-olds , saying it viewed the recruitment drive as a violation of u.n. convention on children .
