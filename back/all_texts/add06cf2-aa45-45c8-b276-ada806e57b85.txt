Do you agree with Switzerland s decision?
Should America follow suit with European countries who are saying no to the burqa?Women who wear burqas and full face veils in public in a Swiss state could be fined up to $9000 under new rules imposed after a local referendum.Females muslims will be banned from wearing the burqa in shops, restaurants or public buildings in the Italian-speaking canton of Ticino.The local government in the southern Swiss state approved the ban after a referendum in September 2013 saw two in three voters backing the move.According to the Local, the Ticino government had wanted to ban burqas and niqabs as well as masks worn by demonstrators and balaclavas.
