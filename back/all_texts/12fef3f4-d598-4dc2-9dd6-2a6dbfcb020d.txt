Senate Republicans voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act in the middle of the night with no replacement and Donald Trump is celebrating.Millions of Americans across the country woke up on Thursday morning to discover that Republicans voted to take their health care away.Indeed, as Democrats tried to stand against the repeal effort, Republicans shouted them down and used budget reconciliation rules to jam the resolution down America s throat and rejected proposed amendments that would have kept provisions in place to protect contraceptives coverage, insurance for people with pre-existing conditions, and to continue allowing parents to keep their kids covered with their plans through the age of 26.And despite earlier opposing repealing Obamacare without a replacement, Donald Trump praised Republicans on Thursday for stabbing Americans in the back.Congrats to the Senate for taking the first step to #RepealObamacare now it s onto the House!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017Trump literally just celebrated a move that will take health care away from millions of Americans, including conservatives in red states who rely on the program.
Not only will repeal cause the uninsured rate to skyrocket, it will add hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit and debt and sentence many Americans to death because they will no longer be able to afford health care.And Twitter users ripped Trump s throat out for his heartlessness.
@realDonaldTrump Congratulating the Senate for doing something that will result in tens of thousands of additional deaths each year Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) January 12, 2017@realDonaldTrump >>> I m not.
An estimated 36,000 additional Americans will die each year if the ACA is repealed.

Not until there is guaranteed coverage for those with pre-existing conditions.

@realDonaldTrump By removing an exemption for pre-existing conditions you basically kill people.
How is THAT making America great?
MeredithGould (@MeredithGould) January 12, 2017@realDonaldTrump They must be so proud of taking away health care from millions while they keep their taxpayer funded healthcare.
Mark Pygas (@MarkPygas) January 12, 2017@realDonaldTrump Not sure taking insurance away from 20 million people is worth celebrating.
Wonder how they ll vote next time?

@realDonaldTrump Translation: Congrats on stripping healthcare from 8M children and denying women contraception and maternal care coverage.
