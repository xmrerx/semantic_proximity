PALM BEACH, Fla. (Reuters) - Boeing Co Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg met with President-elect Donald Trump on Wednesday to address concerns about the replacement costs for Air Force One, which Trump has complained would top $4 billion.
“We’re going to get it done for less than that,” Muilenburg told reporters after the meeting, saying that he discussed a “range of topics” with Trump.
