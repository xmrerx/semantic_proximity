The City of Biloxi, Mississippi tweeted out a notice to all its residences Friday afternoon saying that non-emergency offices will be closed this coming Monday.
Monday is when the country is officially observing Martin Luther King, Jr. s birthday, so that makes sense.
But their notice didn t say MLK Day, Martin Luther King Day, Martin Luther King, Jr. s birthday, or anything like that.
No, they tweeted out the following:Image via TwitterYes, seriously, they re calling MLK Day Great Americans Day.
So Twitter is busy blowing them to smithereens for it, as well they should:@CityofBiloxi (Even the state calendar of holidays doesn t say it.
Maybe you got mixed up with Six Flags Great America?
Good coasters there) pic.twitter.com/p1NoR0uyCC Cabel Sasser (@cabel) January 14, 2017@CityofBiloxi delete your account Luke Beard (@LukesBeard) January 14, 2017.
@CityofBiloxi Because if you accidentally say MLKs name 3x, he ll appear & force you, against your will, to be a decent human being.
Allison Robicelli (@robicellis) January 14, 2017@CityofBiloxi you are a bunch of fucking racists.

@CityofBiloxi I m terrified to learn what you call Black History month Roland Scahill (@rolandscahill) January 14, 2017One would think that Biloxi would take an opportunity to say something like, Sorry, we screwed that up, we apologize for being a bunch of racists here, but they didn t. Noooo they said this instead:Image via TwitterThe funny thing is that the state s website doesn t say Great Americans Day under their list of state holidays, and a quick search on Google reveals a whole ton of nothing.
There are Great Americans Days everywhere, but they re celebrated all year long.
So who renamed MLK Day if it wasn t Biloxi?There might be some interesting goings-on in Biloxi next Tuesday.Featured image by Chris Graythen via Getty Images
