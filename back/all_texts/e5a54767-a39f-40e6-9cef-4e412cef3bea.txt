Just like her dad, Ivanka Trump s hypocrisy knows no bounds.Donald Trump s daughter pretends to be a great champion for women and women s issues, but the reality is that she is complicit in the harm her daddy is doing to women across the country with his policies.In 2014, President Obama signed an executive order known as the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order.The law required companies that receive federal contracts to enact pay transparency so women can better fight for equal pay and ended the practice of companies forcing female employees into secret arbitration if they file sexual harassment claims.Well, Trump signed yet another executive order on March 27th to reverse that order and he did it quietly.But women definitely noticed, especially on Tuesday as the nation recognizes Equal Pay Day.However, there s not a lot to celebrate this year since Trump s order gives companies the ability to once again hide pay discrepancies from their female employees and force female employees who are sexually harassed or assaulted on the job to remain silent about it.Frankly, it sounds like another women s march on Washington is necessary, but for now, women directed their outrage at Ivanka Trump, who had the gall to celebrate Equal Pay Day on Twitter all while knowing what her father has done.#EqualPayDay is a reminder that women deserve equal pay for equal work.
We must work to close the gender pay gap!
https://t.co/CcwsoBXWdF Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) April 4, 2017It s kinda hard to close the gender pay gap when Ivanka s own dad is working to widen it.And women were quick to remind Ivanka of that fact..@IvankaTrump you can start by talking to your daddy-boyfriend pic.twitter.com/jPyz4BKiOk Jess Dweck (@TheDweck) April 4, 2017@IvankaTrump You may need to share with your dad how you feel, he quite obviously doesn t support #EqualPayDay #EqualPayhttps://t.co/UixxN2JDts ACTIndivisible (@ACTIndivisible) April 4, 2017@IvankaTrump Tell that to your father.
He doesn t believe in raising the minimum wage, is anti-union, & we all know how he feel about women s bodies B.L.

@IvankaTrump If only you could literally just walk down the hall and do something about it pic.twitter.com/pFjI0zGSpl Jess Dweck (@TheDweck) April 4, 2017@IvankaTrump Except that your father just cut the Fair Pay and Safe Workplaces order.
Since we re no longer protected, how DO you plan to close that gap?

Spare me your hypocritical feminism.
Kim (@DancinKim76) April 4, 2017Ivanka Trump is a hypocrite who enables her dad at every turn.
If she really cared about women, she would stop him every time he tries to do something that hurts them.
But she doesn t because she s a traitor to her gender.
She s complicit and she should be ashamed of herself.Featured image via Joe Scarnici/Getty Images
