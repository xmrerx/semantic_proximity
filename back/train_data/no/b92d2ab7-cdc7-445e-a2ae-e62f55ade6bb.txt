the anniversary of 9-11 reminds us of the danger we face when foreign terrorists commit crimes against our citizens .
unfortunately , thanks to obama s war against america , we have a new enemy who may be just as dangerous , as these domestic terrorists driven by hate , act out their crimes in the same cowardly way as the terrorists of 9-11 .
since the fbi refuses to do anything to stop domestic terrorists within the # blacklivesmatter movement who have publicly called for open season on crackers and cops , a national movement called # opdethrone has just launched in an effort to stop this group , before any more innocent people lose their lives.over the past several weeks , we have watched in horror as directives from this group have been carried out , as police officers and white people across the nation have been randomly targeted and brutally executed .
and now this group is planning another act of terror this coming 9/11 .
although the final details of the event are shrouded in mystery , we do know that this group is planning something big on 9/11 , and they are directing their followers to bring their guns and convene at stone mountain , where they proclaim that things are about to go down .
although the fbi has been alerted , it appears that nothing has been done to stop this terror organization .
in the meantime , this group continues to gain momentum and supporters .
in a last-ditch effort to warn his fellow americans and beacon the fbi to intervene , investigator hannibal from illwriteit.com has compiled a short documentary video highlighting this group s acts of terror .
hopefully this video will help put an end to the group s activities before anymore of their violent calls to action come to fruition.we are asking that everyone watch and share this video , as this is our final attempt to stop this group before they carry out their violent plans on 9/11 .
it is quite lengthy at over 18 minutes long , but every detail is incredibly important , and vital for telling the full story and making all the connections.via : universal free press
