BAGHDAD (Reuters) - A prominent Iraqi militia backed by Iran, Harakat Hezbollah al- Nujaba, said on Thursday U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital could become a legitimate reason to attack U.S. forces in Iraq.
Trump s stupid decision ... will be the big spark for removing this entity (Israel) from the body of the Islamic nation, and a legitimate reason to target American forces, the group s leader Akram al-Kaabi said in a statement.
