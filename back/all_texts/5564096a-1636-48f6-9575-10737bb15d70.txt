Wow just wow!
This is what happens when political candidates divide nations by color to secure minority voting blocks, while White people are shamed into going along with a divisive, mean-spirited movement Parenting magazine Baby & Family has told readers to beware of families who are inconspicuous and cheerful , as these warning signs indicate they are right wing and thus dangerous .
Depicted with illustrations featuring solely blonde women and children, the report says ordinary parents must take action against right-wing families and make clear that their ideology has no place in the world.Asserting that the term right wing stirs up anxiety and brings to mind burning refugee homes , skinheads, and the National Socialist Underground (NSU) group who carried out a string of violent attacks on foreign people, Baby & Family notes that people rarely connect it with women, family and children .This, the high-circulation German magazine declares, is precisely the great risk as such people are just as dangerous if not more so as gangs of Nazi skinheads.
The identifying features of right-wing families, it contends, are that they are inconspicuous, blond, cute and engaged .
First of all, [right-wing families] are nice and dedicated Michaela K ttig, sociologist and researcher of right-wing extremism at the Frankfurt University of Applied Sciences, alleges.Researcher of right-wing politics, Eva Prausner, says a huge danger of right-wing families is that they seem normal.Because of this, she says many parents will already have established good relations with them to the point that they are no longer marginalised and at worst, get support .While there are different types of right-wing families, Baby & Family asserts that daycare centres should always seek help when dealing with them.Despite asserting that such children are not outspoken, the experts wheeled out by the magazine warn that a sinister aspect of right-wing parenting is that they instil self-confidence in their progeny.They do this, Prausner posits, in hope that their offspring will later confidently carry their ideology into the world .K ttig explains that right-wing families are not unlike ordinary families in that they teach their own values.
The important difference with extreme right-wing groups, however, is that these values are strongly geared at Germanic customs and traditions .Mothers and fathers should get involved in the parents council to take action against right-wing parents, Baby & Family notes.
They should not be afraid to confront [right-wing parents] directly , it states.For entire story: Breitbart News
