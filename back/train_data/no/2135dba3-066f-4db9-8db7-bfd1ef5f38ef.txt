what will the world be like post-donald trump ?
a new hashtag , # aftertrumpimplodes , is working its way through twitter , carrying people s predictions about what such a world will be like .
this is especially on target right now because trump is , in fact , imploding , and he s taking the gop with him .
that s inevitably good for a strong social media lashing.of course , there are predictions about what will happen to the gop : # aftertrumpimplodes i ll sell the leftover scraps of the gop on ebay .

aegreallive ( @ aegreallive ) august 6 , 2016it s pretty clear what people think of a trump implosion .
there are some trumpkins trying to fight the onslaught by saying that he won t implode , that it s hillary who s imploded , and blah blah blabbity blabbity blah the typical delusional ranting from that crowd .
they re mostly being drowned out by people who see trump for who he really is.featured image by spencer platt/getty images
