london ( reuters ) - ireland wants re-assurance from britain there will be no regulatory divergence between it and northern ireland after brexit , foreign minister simon coveney told bbc radio on friday .
he said ireland wanted to achieve before a dec. 14 eu summit an agreed wording whereby we can agree the parameters within which we can find a solution that prevents the re-emergence of a border on the island of ireland .
avoiding a so-called hard border on the island of ireland is the last major hurdle before brexit talks can move to negotiations on britain s future trade relationship with the eu and a possible two-year brexit transition deal .
coveney said ireland can not be asked to leap into the dark by the uk .
