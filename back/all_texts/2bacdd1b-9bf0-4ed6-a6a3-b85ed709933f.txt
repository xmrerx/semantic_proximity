Donald Trump is all about free speech, as long as it means that he can verbally abuse anyone who gets in his way without having to pay consequences.
Unfortunately, for Trump, though, the media, whose job it is to vet presidential candidates, isn t always sympathetic to his verbal tirades and his twitterrhea.
He wants to put a stop to that.In an interview with Miami s WFOR, Trump was asked by the reporter if it should be easier to sue media and whether the First Amendment provides too much protection.
Trump didn t specifically say yes, but he did talk about England.Well in England they have a system where you can actually sue if someone says something wrong.
Our press is allowed to say whatever they want and get away with it.
And i think we should go to a system where if they do something wrong I m a big believer tremendous believer of the freedom of the press.
Nobody believes it stronger than me but if they make terrible, terrible mistakes and those mistakes are made on purpose to injure people.
I m not just talking about me I m talking anybody else then yes, i think you should have the ability to sue them.Here s the video:Let s recap that for a moment.
Trump says, if they make terrible, terrible mistakes and those mistakes are made on purpose to injure people.
I m not just talking about me I m talking anybody else then yes, i think you should have the ability to sue them.
We already have that system in place.
Trump literally described libel laws.
Unfortunately for him, though, public figures, especially those running for public office, have a much harder time winning a libel suit, although if a publication knowingly writes incorrect and damaging information, he can sue.The problem for Trump, though, is that the media hasn t lied about him.
They quote him directly, which for a man who clearly can t control what comes out of his mouth, is a problem.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images.
