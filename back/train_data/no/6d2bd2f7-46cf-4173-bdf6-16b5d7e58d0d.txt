hey mainstream media when are you going to take a break from manufacturing news about a trump connection to russians and actually report on the billions of us taxpayer dollars obama gave to leftist organizations via of all places , our department of justice ?
aren t these the same tactics union leaders use when they force union members to contribute dues , and then use those dues to fund democrat candidates and leftist radical causes that many of the union members don t agree with ?
the obama administration funneled billions of dollars to activist organizations through a department of justice slush fund scheme , according to congressional investigators .
it s clear partisan politics played a role in the illicit actions that were made , rep. john ratcliffe , r-texas , told fox news .
the doj is the last place this should have occurred .
findings spearheaded by the house judiciary committee point to a process shrouded in secrecy whereby monies were distributed to a labyrinth of nonprofit organizations involved with grass-roots activism .
