rome ( reuters ) - former prime minister matteo renzi said on thursday that if he wins next year s election he will slash taxes and sharply raise italy s budget deficit rather than lower it as european union rules require .
we ll take the deficit back up to 2.9 percent ( of gross domestic product ) , cutting taxes by 30 to 50 billion euros ( $ 59.14 billion ) , renzi , the leader of the ruling democratic party ( pd ) said in an evening television interview .
italy has committed to cutting its deficit to 1.6 percent of gdp next year from a targeted 2.1 percent this year , and to balance its budget in 2020 .
brussels says reining in the annual deficit toward zero is necessary to bring down italy s huge public debt of 132 percent of gdp , the highest in the euro zone after greece s. ahead of the election to be held by may , all the main parties have come out strongly against the eu s so-called fiscal compact , agreed in 2012 , which sets tough deficit and debt-reduction goals for high-debt countries like italy .
renzi resigned as prime minister in december last year after losing a referendum over his plans for constitutional reform , and was replaced by his former foreign minister paolo gentiloni .
he first floated the idea of hiking the deficit in a book he published in july , but the suggestion drew a cool response from italian government ministers and the eu .
the pd is running neck-and-neck with the anti-establishment 5-star movement , according to opinion polls , but the surveys suggest no party or coalition is likely to win a working majority in parliament .
