21st century wire says nato s ugly stepchild , turkey , has been having trouble of late.after shooting down a russian jet back in november and then lying about it after-the-fact , turkey was then exposed for its seedy role in facilitating the flow of oil stolen by isis from syria , and then sent into turkey.in addition to shifting isis oil , it was then revealed how weapons and terrorists have been moving freely into northern syria from turkey with the full knowledge of the turkish security services .
the turkish mp who broke this story was then charged with treason by the erdogan government .
if that wasn t enough , turkey then began a campaign of state oppression by targeting journalists and newspapers who were critical of leader recep tayyip erdogan s political machine ( still clinging to power in ankara ) .
the embattled authoritarian regime then took its act on the road , to a city which always welcomes its dictators with open arms washington dc.unfortunately , erdogan s henchmen thought they were still in ankara when they attacked journalists and protesters yesterday in the nation s capital .
erdogan s thugs forgot they were in the us , where some press and citizens still have rights.as expected , total silence on the incident by president obama and his us state department .
silence is consent .
of course , if this happened at a donald trump event , we would never hear the end of it from the media and the obama administration but because it s by a nato member ( and an actual fascist government ) , well then , that s perfectly acceptable for mandarins in washington.clearly , turkey s media crackdown knows no borders rtthe security detail for turkish president recep tayyip erdogan clashed with opposing activists for the second day in a row in washington , dc , removing journalists and even confronting city police after law enforcement refused to remove protesters from the area.with erdogan set to give a speech at the brookings institute on thursday , a group of protesters opposing his crackdown on free speech in turkey , his government s treatment of the country s kurdish population , and what they say is his tolerance of islamic state , gathered near the dc-based think tank to express their opposition.protesters chanting '' # erdogan is commander in chief of isis '' outside the brookings where he is speaking soon pic.twitter.com/ee1akssheo paulina leonovich ( @ polly_evro ) march 31 , 2016the scene quickly devolved into chaos as demonstrators tried to get closer to brookings , with journalists tweeting that erdogan s security scuffled with protesters.erdogan s security detail became physical with reporters , removing one journalist from brookings , kicking another , and throwing a female reporter to the sidewalk , according to foreign policy magazine.journalist adem yavuz arslan has been kicked out of # brookings building by erdogan 's men .
