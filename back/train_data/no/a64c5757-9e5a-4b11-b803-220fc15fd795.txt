president obama on isis : they re a bunch of killers with good social media .
they are dangerous and they ve caused great hardship to an overwhelming majority of people .
really barry ?
they ve caused a great hardship ?
when someone you love has their head chopped off , or they re burned alive , or nailed to a cross and tortured , or when one of your young daughters is raped repeatedly and then taken away in a cage to be sold to the highest bidding muslim pedophile as a sex slave do you call that a hardship ?
because the rest of america calls it an evil that needs to be exterminated .
and guess what barry ?
we hired you to protect and defend the citizens of the united states from all enemies , foreign and domestic .
we didn t hire you to start a war within our own country by manipulating our young sons and daughters in colleges and universities across america .
where did you get the idea that your top priority as our commander in chief was to divide our nation down lines of race and social class ?
even the mainstream media is not going to sit back and allow you to lie about our enemies or skew intelligence to hide the fact you are a weak and incompetent leader .
the idea that the nyt s would actually expose your lies makes us fear that the situation is even worse than what is being reported.richard haas , an american diplomat and president of the council on foreign relations , said on monday there are serious implications if a recent new york times report suggesting the obama administration cooked intel on the islamic state turns out to be true .
i hope it s not true .
i hope it s not true , haas said .
the principle requirement of intelligence analysts is to speak truth to power .
it s not to make them comfortable , it s to make them smart and aware .
he continued , if it is true , it d be very interesting to know exactly where the pressure is coming from because it s corrosive .
it means you can t then trust what policy is based on .
so it is truly , truly a bad thing if , again , it is true .

the officials , speaking only on the condition of anonymity about classified matters , said that the recently opened investigation focused on whether military officials had changed the conclusions of draft intelligence assessments during a review process and then passed them on.haas also criticized the white house for downplaying the challenge of defeating the islamic state in the face of the deadly paris terrorist attacks .
