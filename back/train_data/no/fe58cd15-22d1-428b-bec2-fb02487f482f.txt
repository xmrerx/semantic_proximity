( this sept 8 story corrects headline , clarifies timing of request in paragraph 3 . )
by fanny potkin and michael martina london/beijing ( reuters ) - britain s cambridge university press has rejected a request from its chinese state-owned importer to block online access in china to scholarly articles from the american political science review .
a request was indeed made by the chinese importer , but was not acted upon by cambridge university press , so no content was blocked , a spokeswoman for cup said in an emailed statement .
cup later clarified that the request had been made early last month .
china s state council information office told reuters on friday that importers of foreign publications must verify that the products are legal .
in august , cup , the publishing arm of the elite cambridge university , reversed a decision to block online access in china to several hundred articles and book reviews in the china quarterly , a leading academic journal on chinese affairs that has been published since the 1960s .
it said it had blocked the articles , which covered sensitive topics including the 1989 tiananmen square democracy protests , the 1966-76 cultural revolution and tibet , in order to keep its other academic and educational materials available in china .
academics called the decision an affront to academic freedom .
the state council information office , responding by fax two weeks after a reuters request for comment , said that publishers choose for themselves to import materials based on market demand and the law .
all publications imported into china s market must adhere to chinese laws and regulations .
publication importers are responsible for checking the content of their imported publications , it said , without mentioning cup .
