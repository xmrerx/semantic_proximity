Have you noticed that Donald Trump has opted to not attack or retaliate against Elizabeth Warren for quite some time?
That s because the Massachusetts Senator is a professional truth teller whose epic tweetstorms put the Republican nominee in his place each and every time.Indeed, every time Trump has insulted Warren on Twitter she has absolutely destroyed him.
But Warren didn t shred Trump this time over mere insults against her.
She did it because Trump is trying to undermine our democratic system by calling the election rigged against him.Despite the fact that study after study encompassing many years and over one billion votes has found that voter fraud is exceedingly rare in our country, Trump has repeatedly claimed that the media and Hillary Clinton have fixed the election in her favor.Well, Warren has something to say about Trump s whining and she used strong words to call him out, calling him a sore loser who is acting like a petulant child who isn t getting their way.Give me a break, @realDonaldTrump.
You re not losing because it s rigged.
You re losing because we see through your creepy bullying.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 19, 2016Anyone with children knows that whining about imaginary cheating is the last refuge of the sore loser, @realDonaldTrump.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 19, 2016You can t run a campaign based on hating women, African Americans, Muslims & immigrants & expect to win, @realDonaldTrump.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 19, 2016It s not rigged, @realDonaldTrump.
You re losing fair & square.
Put on your big-boy pants because this is what accountability looks like.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 19, 2016But @realDonaldTrump didn t come up with the rigged election himself.
It s a longtime effort by the @GOP to delegitimize @TheDemocrats.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 19, 2016It s fascinating, @realDonaldTrump: voter fraud only seems to plague places where lots of people might vote for @TheDemocrats.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 19, 2016And @realDonaldTrump s antics like attacking judges & calling for his opponent s imprisonment echo the @HouseGOP s witch hunts.
