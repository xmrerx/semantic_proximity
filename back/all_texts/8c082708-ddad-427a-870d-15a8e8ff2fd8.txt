Sean Hannity made a bizarre implication during a segment of his conservative talk radio show The Sean Hannity Show on Friday.
During the segment, Hannity called into question the motives of Philando Castile s girlfriend, Diamond Reynolds .The conservative pundit is curious to know why the woman decided to live stream Castile s death to Facebook rather than do something to help her boyfriend rather than help him.
We ve had two instances where these police shootings have gone down.
One is in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, the other one in Minnesota.
I ve never saw more bizarre video in my life than the one in Minnesota, where a woman is with her boyfriend, he s shot by the policeman, and she s live facetiming this thing to the world, commenting on it I m just like, how about helping the person that s been shot?
We ll figure out the particulars later, but it was more important I guess to get the video, Hannity said.
The implication that Hannity is making, as far as I can tell, is that Castile s girlfriend was more concerned with using the situation to further the agenda of the Black Lives Matter movement than Castile himself.Which would, of course, be complete nonsense.
What exactly else is one supposed to do in a situation like that?
She was in a car sitting next to her dying loved one who was just shot multiple times at close range.She did what nearly anyone else would do in that situation.
She bore witness and gathered as much evidence as she could to show the world the tragedy that just occurred in front of her.The right wing is so desperate to try and vilify the victims of police brutality and to discredit the Black Lives Matter movement they will try and spin every story of a POC s death at the hands of the police to fit their narrative.You can watch a video capture of the segment below.Featured image from Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images
