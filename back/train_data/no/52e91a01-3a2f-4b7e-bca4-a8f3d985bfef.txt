beirut ( reuters ) - the syrian government delegation has postponed its departure to u.n.-backed peace talks that are due to resume on tuesday in geneva , the pro-syrian government newspaper al-watan reported .
the office of u.n. syria envoy staffan de mistura said it would not comment on the travel plans of the syrian government .
the al-watan report cited diplomatic sources in geneva saying the syrian government was annoyed by a statement that emerged last week from a syrian opposition meeting in riyadh .
syrian opposition groups stuck by a long-standing demand that president bashar al-assad be gone from power before a political transition .
damascus viewed the statement as a return to square one , al-watan reported .
