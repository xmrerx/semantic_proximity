Does anyone remember when Trump, at the Republican National Convention, asked Russia if they could possibly find the 30,000 or so emails that Hillary supposedly deleted from her private server?
Many Republicans who wish that the sane world would drop the whole Russian hack thing don t, but the rest of us who are grounded in reality do.
And tonight, on The Daily Show, Obama directly accused Trump of being responsible for Russia s interference.Obama spent some time talking about the ACA and why it shouldn t be repealed, but that s not really what makes this episode a must-see.
Obama went so far as to blame Trump s request to Russia however much his sycophantic dick-blowers were when they claimed he was joking at the RNC for the results of our election.Noah asked Obama about the intelligence on Russia, and the rush to get it out, and Obama said: [W]hen the DNC got hacked, we immediately assigned our intelligence community, our law enforcement, to investigate what had happened.
And we determined and announced in October that it was the consensus of the all the intelligence agencies and law enforcement that organizations affiliated with Russian intelligence were responsible for the hacking of the DNC materials that were being leaked.So that was a month before the election; this was not a secret.
And the reason that I have called for a review is really just to gather all the threads of the investigations; the intelligence work that has been done over many months so that the public and our elected representatives, going forward, can find ways to prevent this kind of interference from having an impact on the elections in the future.
He went on to explain how this wasn t a big surprise, whatever Trump decides to tweet about it.
During the RNC, it was like King Cheeto assumed that Russia already had the 30,000 emails the conspiracy asshats claimed were missing from Hillary s server, and was blatantly asking them for assistance in bringing those to light so he could win our election.In fact, if nothing else, there s an extremely good chance that FBI Director James Comey s letter to Congress about whether to re-open the investigation into Hillary s emails, or not, decided the election.NOT the American people, as we are supposed to do.Watch Obama tell it like it is below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
