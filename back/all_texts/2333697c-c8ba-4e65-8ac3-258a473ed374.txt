NEW YORK (Reuters) - Donald Trump’s spokesman on Thursday rejected media reports that said the Republican president-elect was planning to restructure the nation’s intelligence agencies, calling the reports “100 percent false.” “There is no truth to this idea of restructuring the intelligence community infrastructure,” Trump spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters in a conference call.
“All transition activities are for information gathering purposes and all discussions are tentative.”
