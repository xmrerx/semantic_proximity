You may not have noticed, but Donald Trump is an egomaniacal narcissist who has no concept of reality.
This can be seen in almost every tweet, meltdown and decision that he makes.
He has no clue what he s doing and belongs nowhere near the Oval Office.All that being said, he personally thinks he s wonderful and likely believes his sh*t smells like a spring meadow.However, he s also a bit of a dumbass, and all of these Trump qualities perfectly came out in a statement he just made aboard Air Force One overheard by NBC News reporter Peter Alexander.According to Alexander, Trump said: I think we ve had one of the most successful 13 weeks in the history of the presidency.
BREAKING: Pres Trump on AF1:"I think we ve had one of the most successful 13 weeks in the history of the presidency."
Peter Alexander (@PeterAlexander) April 6, 2017First of all, let s point out the obvious.
Well, no, there s a lot obviously wrong with that statement, but let s begin by pointing out that it s only been eleven weeks since his inauguration as *president.Secondly, Rep. Maxine Water (D-CA) said it best with this tweet:#Fakenews pic.twitter.com/kma51XCWk7 Maxine Waters (@MaxineWaters) April 6, 2017It really doesn t get much faker than that.It s hard to believe that it s only been eleven weeks since Trump took office.
So hard to believe, in fact, he doesn t seem to realize it himself.Trump is not only one of the most chaotic forces to ever inhabit the White House, but he s also seemingly equally as divisive and destructive.
What about these eleven weeks does he deem a success?
If being the best at being the worst is deemed successful, then job well done.At least we know that when no one is around to stroke his ego, he has no problem doing it himself.
You know, because that s a quality you want in someone who was hired to serve others and be selfless.
