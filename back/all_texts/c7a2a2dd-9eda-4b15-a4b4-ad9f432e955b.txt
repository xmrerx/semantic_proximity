While speaking with the ladies from The View via satellite from Anaheim, CA, where he s been campaigning, Bernie Sanders was asked about Donald Trump and how Trump has been hammering the Clintons.
He was asked if it s fair to go after Hillary Clinton for what her husband may or may not have done.
Bernie immediately said it is not okay, and then goes on to tell the truth about Donald Trump.He flat-out calls Trump a demagogue and a bigot, which got audible loud cheers from the studio audience in attendance.Bernie also added: He has nothing to say about the important issues facing our country.
He also made clear that Trump cannot be President of the United States.When pressed about the fact that some of his supporters have said they would vote for Trump over Hillary if he doesn t get the Democratic nomination, Bernie said not to believe the polls this early on.
He seems to know that as the general election draws closer, and if Hillary is to be the nominee, many of his supporters will realize what s at stake and vote for Hillary, because the alternative is not only bad for the nation, but the entire world.Bernie Sanders genuinely wants what s best for the nation, and he knows that a Trump presidency would be catastrophic.Watch the segment here:.
