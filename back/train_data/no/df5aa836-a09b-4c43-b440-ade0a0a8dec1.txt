berlin ( reuters ) - german police said on saturday they had arrested a suspect in the case of an alleged extortionist who attempted to force supermarkets into coughing up tens of millions of euros by slipping a potentially lethal poison into baby food .
police in the south-western lakeside city of konstanz said they would ask a judge to approve an extension of custody for the 55-year-old german man arrested by police special forces late on friday , after concluding he was a prime suspect .
the suspicions have solidified , they said in a statement .
in mid-september , a suspect was recorded on security cameras placing quantities of poison in products for sale in some southern german supermarkets .
he told the police via email that he done so , and threatened to do it nationwide and elsewhere in europe unless given money .
police said they had found some baby food spiked with ethylene glycol , a colorless , odorless liquid used in the manufacture of antifreeze , which can be deadly if consumed .
police added that , despite the arrest , the public should remain vigilant for signs of tampering when buying food .
