fresh off its humiliating six-year-long debacle in syria , and with very few viable wars within its grasp , the pentagon , along with the israeli lobby-led us congress and senate are now trying to tighten the noose on iran.for the last 3 weeks , hawkish republican senators have been pressuring president donald trump to decertify the iran nuclear deal in october , and to reimpose harsh sanctions despite the fact that iran is in full compliance with the international p5+1 brokered nuclear containment agreement.according to the terms of the deal as recognized by congress , the president must re-certify the deal every 90 days.little marco : it s clear that marco rubio is firmly in the pocket of the israeli lobby.chief among the israeli-led senators is florida senator marco rubio .
during the presidential campaign , rubio was humiliated by trump who dubbed him little marco .
soon after , the slighted senator was forced to drop out of the race due to a lack of support for his campaign.see also : retired us general picks apart sen. cotton s scarlet letter to iranon its face , trump and the israel first hawks policy to crush the jcpoa nuclear agreement makes little sense .
business insider explains : john glaser and emma ashford respond to trump s latest attack on the nuclear deal : iran is clearly abiding by the deal s requirements , as president trump himself has twice formally acknowledged .
but the president appears determined to ignore u.s. allies , his own intelligence community and the international atomic energy agency , which has affirmed eight separate times in detailed reports that iran is in compliance with the deal.as is usually the case , the us hawks ( also supported by iran s economic and geopolitical regional rival saudi arabia ) are hoping to trigger retaliatory rhetoric from the iranian hawks and use those words to justify a call for escalation of tension , and a full range of new sanctions against iran : this desire to withdraw from the jcpoa is difficult to explain .
whatever trump s reasoning , this much is clear : all of america s options outside the jcpoa carry unacceptably high risks and threaten to exacerbate the very behavior iran hawks hope to forestall.desperate to fabricate their case against iran , the us ( instructed by the israeli lobby ) are now trying to brand iran s military as an international terrorist organisation.rt international reports iran has vowed a firm and crushing reaction should washington decide to include the elite wing of its army , the islamic revolutionary guard corps ( irgc ) , on its list of terrorist organizations , according to the country s foreign ministry.the comments came from iranian foreign ministry spokesman bahram qasemi on monday as cited by tasnim news agency .
we are hopeful that the united states does not make this strategic mistake , qasemi stated during a news conference .
if they do , iran s reaction would be firm , decisive and crushing , he said , adding that the us would have to accept the consequences.earlier it was reported that washington is preparing tougher sanctions on tehran , including the possible designation of the islamic revolutionary guard corps ( irgc ) as a terrorist group.us president donald trump has taken a tough stance on the islamic republic , criticizing it for supporting terrorism and vowing to put an end to iran s continued aggression and nuclear ambitions .
on sunday , irgc chief mohammad ali jafari warned that if the reports are confirmed , the military wing will treat us troops , especially in the middle east , as they would islamic state ( is , formerly isis/isil ) terrorists .
if the news is correct about the stupidity of the american government in considering the revolutionary guards a terrorist group , then the revolutionary guards will consider the american army to be like islamic state all around the world , particularly in the middle east , jafari stated.washington s reported threats have prompted france to speak against actions that could exacerbate the current crises in the face of regional instability .
with this in mind , regional states have a specific role to play and must show restraint and a sense of responsibility , french foreign ministry spokeswoman agnes romatet-espagne stressed , when asked whether paris would endorse such a step.the landmark iranian nuclear agreement , officially known as the joint comprehensive plan of action ( jcpoa ) , was signed by the p5+1 group ( china , france , germany , russia , the uk , and the us ) and the european union in 2015 .
according to the deal , iran is to limit its nuclear program for 15 years in exchange for easing the pre-existing sanctions.read more : world will change : trump likely to pull out of iran nuclear deal next week german fmduring his election campaign trump repeatedly vowed to scrap the agreement , and during his presidency he has continued to accuse iran of violating the spirit of the deal .
