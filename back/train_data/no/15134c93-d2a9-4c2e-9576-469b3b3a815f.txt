vatican city ( reuters ) - pope francis and jordan s king abdullah on tuesday discussed u.s. president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital , a move that both say is dangerous to middle east peace .
abdullah and the pope spoke privately for about 20 minutes at the start of the king s visit to the vatican and france .
a vatican statement said they discussed the promotion of peace and stability in the mideast , with particular reference to the question of jerusalem and the role of the hashemite sovereign as custodian of the holy places .
king abdullah s hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the muslim holy sites in jerusalem , making amman sensitive to any changes of status of the disputed city .
when trump announced his decision on dec. 6 , the pope responded by calling for the city s status quo to be respected , saying new tension in the middle east would further inflame world conflicts .
among an outpouring of international criticism , jordan also rejected the u.s. decision , calling it legally null because it consolidated israel s occupation of the eastern sector of the city .
the united states was further isolated over the issue on monday when it blocked a u.n. security council call for the declaration to be withdrawn .
both the vatican and jordan back a two-state solution to the palestinian-israeli conflict , with them agreeing on the status of jerusalem as part of the peace process .
palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future independent state , whereas israel has declared the whole city to be its united and eternal capital .
the statement said both sides wanted to encourage negotiations .
