Fox News and the O Reilly Factor are well-known for their blatant racism, but they completely outdid themselves when they decided to visit Chinatown and create their most racist segment to date.Correspondent Jesse Watters took a little trip down to New York City s Chinatown to discuss the GOP nominee and this year s election.
The result was one of the most offensive news segments to ever grace Fox News, which is really saying something.Mother Jones reports:The segment, which opens with stereotypical Chinese music, is spliced with movie clips featuring Asian actors speaking in exaggerated accents.
Watters approaches a number of men and women in the street, some of them elderly residents who do not speak English.
He then silently mocks them for their inability to answer his questions many of which wander from the presidential race to lame caricatures of Asians masquerading as humor.
Is food in China just food?
Do you know karate?
Things actually manage to go downhill when Watters makes it back to the studio for a sit-down with the show s host, Bill O Reilly.
Yes.
Things actually managed to get worse.O Reilly notes that the majority of the people interviewed seemed to have a good understanding of what is going on in American politics.
Watters seemed stunned.
You thought people knew what was going on?
he asked with a laugh.
They re such a polite people, he said, pulling out yet another stereotype of Asian people.
They won t walk away or tell me to get out of here.
They just sit there and don t say nothing!
It isn t hard to see why Republicans have been losing support among the Asian community.
O Reilly himself added that he knew there would be backlash for the racist segment and he is fully expecting to be bombarded by angry letters.
Eventually, though, they came to the conclusion that who gives a f*ck because it was all in good fun.
