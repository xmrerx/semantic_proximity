Phil Vander Ploeg says that he is a Christian apologist.
Well, if that is so, then he needs to get down on his knees and apologize to the atheists of the world for telling lies about us from his pulpit at the First Baptist Spartanburg in South Carolina.
Vander Ploeg says: Why doesn t God just walk into the room one day and say, Hello, I m God, I m real, and then leave?
God has revealed himself far more than some people want to acknowledge.
It s obvious.The only atheists in the world live in America and Europe.
Everyone else knows there s a god.
But we ve developed a worldview in the West that justifies our actions.
That s why we don t believe in God.
Well, no, sir, that isn t true at all.
According to Gallup (which, by the way, is much more reliable than some nutty preacher), there are more atheists in China than anywhere in America or Europe.
Last I checked, that s not the western world.
Here is what Gallup International had to say about the concentration of atheists in China: China has the highest amount of atheists living in a single country with nearly 50 per cent of its population describing themselves as non-believers.
Around 47 per cent of people living in China describe themselves as atheists compared to an average of 13 per cent across the world.
Methinks Pastor Vander Ploeg has gotten his facts wrong.
Further, he also says that people are only atheists because they want to live their lives their way, rather than God s way.
Wrong again!
People are atheists because they don t believe in a deity, pure and simple.Watch the insanity in action, below:Featured image via video screen capture
