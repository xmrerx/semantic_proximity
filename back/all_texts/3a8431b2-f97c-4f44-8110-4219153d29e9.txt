Throughout the presidential campaign and beyond, Melania Trump has had no reservations whatsoever when it comes to showing the world that she hates her husband just as much as we do.
There was the miserable look she wore at his inauguration, the obvious shade she threw after the infamous Access Hollywood tape was leaked by wearing a Gucci Pussy Bow blouse to the debate, and the numerous reports that she is absolutely miserable as First Lady.
Oh, and, of course, there s the fact that she has flat-out refused to live in the White House with her ugly orange husband.
Well, now, Melania has trumped (pun intended) all of those instances by humiliating The Donald on the world stage.When Melania arrived on the red carpet in Tel Aviv, Donald Trump tried to hold her hand as they walked along.
Since this is Trump s first world trip as the so-called president, of course it s a big deal.
Melania obviously knew the cameras were rolling from every angle.
That mattered not to her, though, as she slapped The Donald s stubby little hand away instead of taking it.It was absolute gold.
Perhaps Trump told Melania that if she stuck the presidency out with him, he d give her the divorce she so obviously wants.
After all, at this point she isn t even trying to hide how repulsed she is by him.All we can do is hope he doesn t abuse her for humiliating him in such a global and public way once he gets her alone.Watch this amazing moment below:LOL!
Melania in Tel Aviv is as MISERABLE, as Melania in the U.S. Watch her push away the CREEP s hand.
PRICELESS??
?This guy is DISGUSTING!
