Americans have been spending well over $2 trillion on Christmas since at least 2000, with that number topping $3 trillion in recent years.
But if you ask Donald Trump, Americans rather typical spending this year is all thanks to him.Seriously he took credit for Christmas.The world was gloomy before I won there was no hope.
Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 26, 2016Yes, all those thoughtful gifts you bought your family weren t because you would do that any year they were all because less than half of the country kinda-sorta elected The Donald to lead the country for the next four years (if we last that long).Trump s delusions of grandeur are at this point something that invites nothing but mockery and Twitter, as usual, delivered spectacularly.The world is gloomy AF since you won.
And as far as the markets Thanks Obama!

@realDonaldTrump Honey, I know I said to buck up, but attributing everyone's Christmas presents to your big win is going a little too far.

@realDonaldTrump's actually taking credit for regular holiday consumer habits Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) December 26, 2016@realDonaldTrump to himself: "You're responsible for all the gifts people bought for their families!
You did it!"

@realDonaldTrump Do you think that people are buying more this year because it may be our last Christmas?
Jon Donahue (@JonDonahue) December 26, 2016.
@realDonaldTrump Are you seriously taking credit for Christmas?
Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 26, 2016@realDonaldTrump Christmas spending has been over 2 trillion dollars since 2000.
But go ahead, take the credit.

@realDonaldTrump Obama is still in office, junior.
Let's see what happens within your first term Jonathan Sadowski (@sadowski23) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump Spending money is not the only gauge of whether people feel hopeful.
I had a lot of hope before the election.
Raymond Braun (@raymondbraun) December 26, 2016@realDonaldTrump Are you trying to take credit for Christmas happening?
You are literally one of the saddest people alive.
Jon Bershad (@JonBershad) December 26, 2016@realDonaldTrump lol chill bro, literally no one is buying more gifts because you re president-elect Zach Holman (@holman) December 26, 2016@realDonaldTrump you single handily saved Christmas!
Whiteboy7thst (@Whiteboy7thst) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump You're praising yourself for things that you had nothing to do with.
Worse, you don't even realise that.
Anirvan Ghosh (@anirvanghosh) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump why don't you also take credit for curing polio, you played a big role in that too Shit Britain (@ShitBritain) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump Suicides are up too, taking credit for that?
Happy Holidays (@thelukeleal) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/LltQFFPMyw andrea (@twennywonpilots) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump have you convinced yourself you saved Christmas?
You're truly awful.
bob clendenin (@bobclendenin) December 27, 2016It takes a special level of delusion to genuinely believe that you saved Christmas because you were elected President especially when spending is on par with previous years.
But sorry little Johnny and little Susie, your presents aren t under the tree because your parents want to make you happy or even because of Santa.
They re there because America threw away anything resembling a moral center and elected a racist, xenophobic hatemonger to office.As for stock prices, they ve been fairly steady since about 2010 but you won t hear Trump saying that, and you won t catch his idiot followers believing it.Featured image via Getty Images (Drew Angerer)/screengrab
