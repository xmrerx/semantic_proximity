what the heck do you even call this ? the u.s. department of agriculture s myplate service handed out advice on sunday , and said strawberry s mores are a treat that kids will love .
but expectations for the kids might need to be set in advance , since these s mores don t have any chocolate or marshmallows in them.instead , usda encourages people to plop some low-fat vanilla yogurt on a graham cracker , and then top the yogurt with strawberries .
top it off with another graham cracker , and you have a s more that looks a lot like a regular s more , except when you bite into it , you won t get any ooey-gooey chocolate all over your fingers .
kids will love that they can make it themselves , and parents will love that it s an inexpensive and healthy treat !
