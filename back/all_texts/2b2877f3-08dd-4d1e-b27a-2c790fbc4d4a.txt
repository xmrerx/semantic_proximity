Ed Klein: For the past 100 years every president who is outgoing has packed up his stuff gone home and not criticized his successor.
This is not what the Obamas are planning to do.
They rented an eight-bedroom mansion in the section of Washington near Joe Lockhart, Bill Clinton s last press secretary.
In that house there s enough room for Valerie Jarrett and Michelle and the kids.
A place for ten cars to park.
They are setting up what they are calling a shadow government.Pete Hegseth: The Obamas claim it is because the children want to stay in D.C..Ed Klein: That s not the real reason they are staying there.
They are staying there because despite what the president said in his press conference, he s in a sense of outrage over this incoming Trump Administration, which he thinks is going to wipe out his legacy.
So he s setting up this kind of almost insurgency, picking people in foreign affairs, labor, abortion, union matters and setting them up to start appearing on television, making speeches and doing op-ed pieces for next four years, you re going to see not only a Trump Administration but you re going to see a shadow government opposing the Trump Klein said it was an insurgency by the left starting on Inauguration Day with the mass demonstrations organized by Michael Moore.
