MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan police declared a false alarm on Tuesday following a bomb scare that had led agents to cordon off Barcelona s Sagrada Familia church and send in a bomb squad to check a parked van.
Police said on Twitter that there had been no arrests as a result of the incident and that the area had returned to normal.
