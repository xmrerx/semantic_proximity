dubai ( reuters ) - five suspected al qaeda militants were killed by a drone strike in yemen s marib province early on sunday , residents said .
the men were hit while traveling in a car in raghwan district , residents said , adding that their bodies were charred beyond recognition .
there was no immediate statement from the militant group or from u.s. forces who have repeatedly launched drone and air strikes against yemen s al qaeda branch , known as al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) .
the group has taken advantage of a more than two-year-old civil war between the iran-aligned houthi group and president abd-rabbu mansour hadi s saudi-backed government to strengthen its position in the impoverished country .
aqap operates in several provinces in south and eastern yemen , including in abyan , shabwa and al-bayda .
