At a town hall in Frost, Texas last week a voter expressed concerns about violence against women but Rep. Joe Barton was not interested in hearing them.The constituent asked Barton to work with Rep. Jackie Speier, a Democrat, to sponsor legislation that could combat violence against women a topic that has not much interested the Congressman in the past: Given your voting record opposing legislation protecting women from violence, will you make a commitment to us today, make a promise that you will reach out to Congresswoman Jackie Speier and work with her to see this bill successfully through Congress?
Barton says he voted against the bill because he believes violence targeting women which happens literally everywhere is a state issue, not a federal issue.
His audience was not pleased.
The crowd responded with a chrous of boos.
Violence against women, that s a national issue!
one person yelled in response.
That s an issue that impacts everyone everywhere, not only in this country, but everywhere!
But Barton wasn t done.
Pointing his finger at the man who had the audacity to suggest that he take a moment to care about women, he demanded: You, sir, shut up.
You don t tell anybody to shut up!
the man shouted back.
You work for us!
Close to 1,000 people attended the town hall.
It s safe to say that most of them left knowing for whom they are not voting in the next election.
