washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. state department said on tuesday that municipal elections in cuba over the weekend were flawed because authorities used intimidation , arcane technicalities and false charges to keep independent candidates off of the ballot .
the elections that took place further demonstrate how the cuban regime maintains an authoritarian state while attempting to sell the myth of a democracy around the world , state department spokeswoman heather nauert told a briefing .
despite courageous efforts by an unprecedented number of independent candidates this year , none were allowed on the ballot .
