republican congressman david brat wasn t sitting back and waiting for msnbc host craig melvin to attack him or republican president donald trump .
much to the msnbc host s surprise , rep brat ( r-va ) immediately went on offense telling melvin , but non one gets to play the innocent here !
brat went on to explain how the media funds the democrat party and yet they expect americans to believe they are being objective when they report the news .
brat used media donations to hillary s presidential campaign as an example : hillary raised $ 2 billion dollars in the hillary foundation from foreign money and cnn and all the biggies never found anything on that .
the washington post is great on watergate , but they missed clintongate .
it may be because 97 % of the donations from mainstream folks ( media ) go to the democrat party .
gee i wonder if that could , ya know , influence the news at all ?
msnbc host craig melvin attempted to blame the new york times and washington post for the alleged media bias .
melvin then tried to convince his small audience that media bias doesn t exist : even if that bias did exist which , i mean , dave , it doesn t even if it did brat shot back : if it exists ?
now , you got to come clean with me on that one .
brat s best line in the exchange however , came near the end , when melvin mockingly said , all of us are in cahoots together .brat responded : no , you just have a systematic bias toward liberal outcomes and growing the federal government .
it s okay it s america i don t know if it s illegal .
