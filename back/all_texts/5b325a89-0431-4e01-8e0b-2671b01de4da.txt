On Friday, a jury did something that will certainly anger Donald Trump s hamburger delivery boy, Chris Christie handed down a decision against two of his top staffers in the Bridgegate case.Bridget Anne Kelly, Christie s former deupty chief-of-staff, and former senior official at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, Bill Baroni, found themselves facing nine counts of conspiracy and wire fraud for their roles in orchetrating a 2013 bridge closure as an attack against one of Christie s political enemies.
The two were indicted Friday after David Wildstein another former Port Authority executive and the mastermind of the plan named them as he pleaded guilty to his role in the lane closures.The most serious charges in the indictment could land the two behind bars for up to 20 years according to the U.S. Attorney s office.
Wildstein says his intent was to punish Fort Lee Mayor Mark Sokolich for failing to endorse Christie for President.
Public officials must use government resources for proper government purposes, U.S. Attorney Paul Fishman said of the indictments.
The indictment alleges, and Wildstein admitted, that the three defendants used Port Authority resources to exact political retribution against a public official who would not endorse the Governor for re-election, and concocted and promoted a bogus cover story to execute their plan and to cover their tracks.
Attorneys for both Kelly and Baroni call Wildstein a liar, despite his confession, and promise that they will clear their names.
The charges they face include conspiracy against civil rights, deprivation of civil rights, wire fraud, conspiring to intentionally misapply property of an organization receiving federal benefits and others.
They are scheduled to be arraigned on Monday the day before we decide if Christie s friend Trump or Hillary Clinton will become the next President.Read the court documents below:Featured image via Getty Images (Justin Sullivan)
