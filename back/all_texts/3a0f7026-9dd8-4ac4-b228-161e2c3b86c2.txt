WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Navy said on Friday that it was moving the aircraft carrier Abraham Lincoln into position to provide humanitarian relief from Hurricane Irma if needed.
The Navy said in a statement that the Abraham Lincoln, along with the amphibious assault ship Iwo Jima and transport dock ship New York, had been ordered to get underway on Friday and that a destroyer would join them.
These ships are capable of providing medical support, maritime civil affairs, maritime security, expeditionary logistic support, medium and heavy-lift air support, the statement said.
