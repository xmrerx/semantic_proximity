Here we go again another student art contest that brings with it a controversial painting.
Remember the Cops as Pigs painting that caused a stir in the Capitol?
This painting is taking the iconic symbol of the Statue of Liberty and making it a religious symbol of islam with the hijab.
Congressman Correa needs to take this painting down!A student painting that depicts the Statue of Liberty wearing a Muslim hijab, displayed in congressman Lou Correa s Santa Ana office, is being attacked as an unpatriotic violation of the separation of church and state by members of We the People Rising, a Claremont-based activist group that advocates stricter enforcement of immigration laws.The group, which includes several Orange County participants, has asked without success that Correa remove the painting, which hangs with other finalists from the Democratic congressman s annual student art competition.Because of the complaint, Correa said he asked the House Office of Legislative Counsel for advice and was told there was no legal issue.
