berlin ( reuters ) - european sanctions imposed on russia over its role in the ukraine crisis should be phased out gradually if an internationally agreed ceasefire deal was implemented , german foreign minister sigmar gabriel said on monday .
the conflict between ukrainian forces and russian-backed separatists has claimed more than 10,000 lives since it erupted in 2014 .
germany and france have tried to convince both sides to implement a peace deal agreed in minsk in 2015 but with little success .
the official agreement is : only if there is 100 percent peace , then we ll lift 100 percent of the sanctions , gabriel said during a panel discussion organized by german business daily handelsblatt in berlin .
gabriel said , from his point of view , this was a totally unrealistic position .
we introduced the sanctions gradually and we ll lift them gradually - this is actually a commonly known fact , gabriel said .
he said that if there was a lasting ceasefire in eastern ukraine , then the united states probably would also be willing to take similar steps .
gabriel is a senior member of germany s social democrats ( spd ) , junior partners in chancellor angela merkel s ruling coalition and historic advocates of dialogue with russia .
germany is heading toward a sept. 24 federal election .
merkel has insisted that european sanctions against russia could only be lifted if the minsk peace deal was fully implemented - not only the ceasefire agreement which is one part of the broader minsk peace plan .
merkel and french president emmanuel macron last month called for russia and ukraine to increase their efforts to implement the fragile ceasefire .
kiev accuses moscow of sending troops and heavy weapons to the region , which russia denies .
