LONDON (Reuters) - Britain wants Zimbabwe s new rulers to show clear resolve to place the country on a more democratic and prosperous path after the fall of Robert Mugabe.
Zimbabweans suffered for too long as a result of Mugabe s ruinous rule, Britain s minister for Africa, Rory Stewart, said on arriving in Harare.
The events of the last few days have given people here real hope that Zimbabwe can be set on a different, more democratic and more prosperous path.
What comes next must be driven by Zimbabweans - it must be in line with the Zimbabwean constitution and will be impossible without clear resolve from the incoming government, he said.
