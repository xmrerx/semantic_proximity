after a year and half of doing nothing but dividing americans on the campaign trail , donald trump is now whining about how divided this country has become.once again using twitter as his platform to display his hypocrisy , trump had the gall to forcefully and angrily complain that america is too untrusting and divided and declared that things will change when he takes office on january 20th .
you know , because trump is delusional and thinks that he is the magic solution to all of america s problems.for many years our country has been divided , angry and untrusting .
many say it will never change , the hatred is too deep .
it will change ! ! ! !
