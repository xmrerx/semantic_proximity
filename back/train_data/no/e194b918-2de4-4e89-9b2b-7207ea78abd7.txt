oslo ( reuters ) - a norwegian court sentenced a 17-year-old russian citizen to nine months in jail on monday for making a small explosive device and bringing it to the center of oslo in april .
prosecutors had sought a two-year sentence for the teenager , saying he had frequented islamist websites , become radicalised and possessed images of islamic state members killing prisonners .
the teenager , who denied any wrongdoing , said he had been planning to detonate the device in a forest near his home .
the device was placed in central oslo on a busy saturday night in april , one day after a truck attack in stockholm in neighboring sweden killed five people .
the oslo police bomb squad said the device was about 30 cm ( 1 ft ) across and appeared capable of causing only a small amount of damage .
[ l8n1hh0lt ] soon after the discovery of the device , norwegian police raised the country s security threat level .
the teenager has lived in norway since 2010 and has previously applied for asylum .
the status of that application was not immediately clear .
in 2011 , far-right mass murderer anders behring breivik set off a car bomb in oslo that killed eight people and destroyed norway s government headquarters , before going on a shooting rampage , killing 69 people at nearby utoeya island .
