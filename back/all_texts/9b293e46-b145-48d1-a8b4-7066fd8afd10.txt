GENEVA (Reuters) - The head of the U.N. fact-finding mission probing violence in Myanmar s Rakhine state said on Tuesday he is still waiting for permission to enter the country.
We have not been able to proceed further in planning the presence of a fact-finding team on the ground until there is a clear signal from the government of Myanmar that the fact-finding mission is in fact enabled to access into the country, Marzuki Darusman told the U.N. Human Rights Council.
We continue to hold hopes, high hopes in fact, that this may be resolved.
