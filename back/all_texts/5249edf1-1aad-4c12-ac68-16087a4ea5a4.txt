I wish I could say I was shocked, but the sad truth is pro-abortion voters are the major reason America has been crippled by Obama for 8 years, and potentially looking at a continuation of his radical policies with a Hillary presidency.
To hell with our nation, the abortion industry must be kept alive, no matter the cost Maybe you ve seen those awards given to local businesses for having a certain number of accident free days or hitting certain regional or area sales quotas.
here s an award that will take your breath away for a terribly and horrific reason.Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains gave its Aurua abortion clinic an award for increasing the number of babies killed in abortions.
The award coincides with the abortion quotes the Planned Parenthood abortion business is implementing on all o its affiliates:From a blog post by Abby Johnson on the award:Ever since I left Planned Parenthood, I have been talking about the abortion quotas that are established inside abortion facilities.
Many abortion supporters refused to believe it, citing that surely Planned Parenthood wants abortion to be safe, legal and RARE.
If they want something to be RARE, they certainly wouldn t have quotas, right?We recently had a clinic worker leave the affiliate, Planned Parenthood of the Rocky Mountains.
This affiliate runs the 2nd largest Planned Parenthood facility in the U.S. At this clinic in Denver, they give out various awards to their satellite clinics and post these awards on a bulletin board for everyone to see.When our former worker saw this award on public display, it really started to change her thinking about Planned Parenthood s motivation.
This award was given to their Aurora clinic for exceeding abortion visits first half of fiscal year 2012 compared to first half of fiscal year 2013.
This means that the Aurora Planned Parenthood exceeded the abortion quota that was imposed on them.
And THAT is award worthy according to Planned Parenthood.Via: LifeNews
