Hillary Clinton isn t letting the latest childish nickname from Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump get under her skin.
Appearing on ABC s This Week, the Democratic candidate was asked about Trump calling her Crooked Hillary.

Clinton went on to emphasize why she isn t afraid of Trump s schoolyard insults, but is more than willing to take him on head-first.
I can take care of myself, Clinton said on This Week when asked to respond to Trump s jab.
What I m concerned about is how he goes after everybody else.
He goes after women.
He goes after Muslims.
He goes after immigrants.
He goes after people with disabilities.
He is hurting our unity at home.
He is undermining the values that we stand for in New York and across America.
And he s hurting us around the world.
Trump is trying to make noise in the media about Clinton at the exact same time he s stuck in a delegate fight with Senator Ted Cruz.
Trump has been repeatedly out-hustled and out-campaigned at state delegate events where Cruz has organized to secure delegates ahead of the Republican Convention in Cleveland.
Trump faces the prospect of the nomination being snatched away from him, even though he has a very big lead over Cruz, because Trump may have problems hitting the 1,237 delegates needed to win the Republican nomination.Even if he succeeds there, polling indicates Trump is in for a nightmare election if he goes head to head with Clinton.
Polling shows that Trump s unfavorable are so sky-high he would lose to Clinton by double digits in a national election.
Trump also shows considerable weakness in state polling, where he pulls up even at best with Clinton in strong Republican states like Mississippi and Utah.Featured image via YouTube
