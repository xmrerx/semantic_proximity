In spite of Senator John McCain s promise to his constituents only 9 months ago when he was running for reelection, that he would fight to repeal and replace Obamacare, McCain voted late last night with two other liberal Republican senators, and every Democrat senator to keep Obamacare intact.But that s not what Senator McCain promised Arizona voters he would do only 9 months ago On October 10, 2016, John McCain faced off against his Democrat opponent Congresswoman Kirkpatrick in a televised debate.
At the center of the debate was the disastrous Obamacare and what could be done to fix it.
McCain responded: For the first time in history, a major entitlement reform was rammed through the Congress of the United States without a single vote from the other side.
I fought for weeks, and weeks, and weeks against Obamacare and they would not allow us an amendment.
There was not a single amendment allowed.
No input from the minority party.
We were the minority party.
Now Congresswoman Kirkpatrick wants us to sit down and work together.
Here s how we work together, we repeal and we replace it.
McCain went on to argue that the majority of the American people have resoundingly rejected Obamacare.
One of the debate moderators asked McCain if it was possible for Congress to try to improve Obamacare rather than to try to repeal it.
McCain rejected the idea that it could be fixed and that the only solution is to repeal Obamacare: We have to scrap it entirely and start over.
McCain went on to explain why Congress MUST repeal Obamacare, It s a scam and the problem is, that the cost is becoming prohibitive and we ve got to change it and fix it.
Watch Senator John McCain as he arrogantly throws his thumb down in defiance of his own party and joins two of the most liberal Republicans in the Senate to thumb their noses at President Trump, as they jump across the aisle to join their friends who shut them out of the first Obamacare vote.
