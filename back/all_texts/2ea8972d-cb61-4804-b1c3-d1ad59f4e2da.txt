If you ever needed evidence of Donald Trump s bromance with Vladimir Putin, it s in the amount of time they spent together.
Though their private meeting at the G-20 summit was supposed to last a half hour, Trump ended up spending two hours and sixteen minutes with the man who helped him get elected through a fierce and well-funded propaganda campaign as well as an extensive hacking effort.
Several times I had to remind the president, people were sticking their heads in the door, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told the Washington Examiner.
They even sent in the first lady at one point to see if she could get us out of there, and that didn t work either.
We went another hour after she came in to see us, so clearly, she failed.
There was so much to talk about, said Tillerson.
Neither one of them wanted to stop.
Tillerson says that Trump and Putin got along like they had been best friends all their lives.
The two leaders connected very quickly, he says.
There was a very clear positive chemistry.
Don t worry, though.
Trump is on top of this Russia scandal thing.
He asked Vlad if Russia interfered with our election and accepted at face value that Putin absolutely did not help him win.
Nothing to see here:Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, who attended the meeting along with Tillerson, said Trump accepted Putin s assurances that Russia didn t meddle in the U.S. election.
But Tillerson said the Russians had asked for proof and evidence of its involvement.
A day earlier, Trump had said Russia probably meddled but that other countries likely did, too.Tillerson said the two leaders had agreed to continue the discussion, with an eye toward securing a commitment that Russia won t interfere in U.S. affairs in the future.See?
Case closed.
Nothing to worry about.
