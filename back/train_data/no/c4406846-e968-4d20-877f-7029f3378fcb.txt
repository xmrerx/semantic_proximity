beware of morning talk show hosts turned news personalities .
the katie couric s and matt lauer s of the world are some of the most radical and dangerous propagandists in the media today .
we are unknowingly being fed gun control with a cherry on top , while most americans don t even realize the leftist drivel they re being fed during a may 13 appearance on nbc s today , katie couric previewed her upcoming gun control documentary by claiming a silent majority of gun owners want more gun control.couric said these things during an interview conducted by matt lauer , who began the interview by countering fbi statistics and claiming mass shootings are on the rise .
in september 2014 , the fbi released a highly politicized study claiming a rise in mass shootings , only to have the authors of the study recant months later and admit they created data to make the study outcome fit a preconceived conclusion.yet lauer claimed mass shootings are on the rise , and couric played along without hesitation .
in fact , she built on lauer s mass shootings comment to suggest more gun control is needed , and a silent majority of gun owners support it.couric said : ninety percent of the public really favors universal background checks .
and after sandy hook , everyone thought this was a watershed moment , something would be done .
and then when manchin/toomey died in the senate , i couldn t understand the disconnect between public opinion and our elected officials.so couric undertook a gun control documentary , under the gun , and says that in interviewing people for the film , she came to the conclusion that the nra really does not speak for the majority of gun owners .
she said , the nra only represents five percent of gun owners , so there s this huge silent majority , and they represent common ground .
