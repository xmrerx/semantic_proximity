baghdad ( reuters ) - iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi on saturday pressed the case for the central government in baghdad to receive the income from kurdistan s oilfields , saying the money would be used to pay kurdish civil servants .
seeking to control the oil income from the autonomous kurdish region is central to abadi s strategy after the kurdish referendum on independence held on monday .
the kurdistan regional government said it plans to use the vote , which delivered an overwhelming yes for independence , as a mandate to seek the peaceful secession of the kurdish region through talks with abadi s government .
abadi , who rejects any talks with the kurds on independence , wrote in a tweet : federal government control of oil revenues is in order to pay kr ( kurdistan region ) employee salaries in full .
no other statement was forthcoming from the government .
it was not clear whether baghdad had had any success in taking control of oil income from the kurdish region in the north of iraq , which for years has kept oil revenue and paid kurdish civil servants .
abadi on thursday said turkey had told iraq it would deal only with the iraqi government on crude oil exports .
iraqi kurdish crude oil is exported to world markets through a pipeline to turkey s mediterranean coast .
baghdad imposed a ban on direct international flights to the kurdish region on friday .
