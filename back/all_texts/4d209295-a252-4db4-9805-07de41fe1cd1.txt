The GOP is known for its misogyny.
This is especially true of those currently running for president on that side of the aisle.
So, it is only fitting that misogynist insults often used by men are turned on these guys, and Full Frontal host Samantha Bee did just that on Monday s edition of her show.Women are often accused of being too emotional to be in certain positions, but the mudslinging and childish insults that have peppered the GOP debates and campaign trails show that men can be just as emotional in their cases inappropriately so.
Bee started her first segment with a eulogy for the death of the Republican Party in the wake of the absolute national embarrassment that is their presidential primary, then turned on the candidates themselves.
She began: I don t mean to sound sexist, but I think men are just too emotional to be president.
Bee then pointed out what everyone knows, saying that the GOP establishment knows that the Donald Trump candidacy is doing to their brand what his a*shole son does to real elephants.
This narrative within the establishment has made old-time GOPers like former presidential nominee Mitt Romney and Arizona Senator John McCain try to urge people within the party not to support Trump.Bee says that this won t do any good, though, if past efforts by Romney are any indication, because when [Romney] tried to stand between a charismatic guy and the White House, you got beat like a Muslim girl at a Trump rally.
Samantha Been is absolutely correct here.
Trump will likely be the GOP s nominee, and that is absolute nightmare for them.
He s an openly racist, misogynist, xenophobic asshole who bears some startling and disturbing resemblances to Adolf Hitler, and we all know how THAT ended.You re done, GOP and you did it to yourselves.
Good riddance.Watch Samantha Bee s brilliant takedown below:Featured image via screen capture
