americans who are sick and tired of leftist ceo s using their public positions to attack president trump and his efforts waged a huge boycott against starbucks and the starbucks brand : kudos to this shareholder for standing up and confronting schultz over his selfish decision to publicly shame president trump in his efforts to keep terrorists from entering our country with starbuck s stock underperforming , its about time someone questioned starbucks s liberal agenda .
just don t expect the media to care.a conservative think tank , the national center for public policy research , confronted outgoing controversial starbucks ceo howard schultz .
as an owner of starbucks stock , the group sent its general counsel justin danhof to starbucks s annual shareholders meeting on march 22 .
there , he questioned schultz for his public liberal opinions that may have hurt the company s stock price.in reference to schultz s jan. 29 decision that starbucks would hire 10,000 refugees , danhof asked schultz how much will starbucks investors have to spend so that the company can properly vet refugees that the federal government admits it can t afford to vet ?
he also asked schultz why he condemned president donald trump s immigration order but lacked the courage to speak out against the obama-clinton travel ban ?
