( reuters ) - somalia s islamist al shabaab insurgency shot four men accused of spying on monday in a public execution which underscored the insurgents control of swathes of the country s southern region even as the government girds up for an offensive against them .
the four men were captured weeks ago .
they were publicly executed today after the court ruling and after admitting espionage , mohamed abu abdalla , al shabaab s governor for the jubba regions said by phone .
two of them were spying for the ethiopian government and the other two were spying for somali government intelligence .
the men were shot in buale , the capital of middle jubba , he said , a region mostly controlled by al shabaab that lies south of the capital of mogadishu .
the government did not return calls seeking comment .
al shabaab s grip on the horn of african nation has been weakening since it was pushed out of the capital in 2011 by african union peacekeepers .
but it still controls large parts of the countryside .
it is trying to overthrow the weak , u.n.-backed government and impose a strict form of islamic law .
somalia has been riven by civil war since 1991 , when clan warlords overthrew a dictator then turned on each other .
