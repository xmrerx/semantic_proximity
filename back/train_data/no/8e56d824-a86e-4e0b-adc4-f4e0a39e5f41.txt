appearing on fox news , former new york city mayor rudy giuliani decided to make the bold claim that the world is more dangerous than ever after citing shootings like orlando .
he even went so far as to say : do you ever remember the world as dangerous as this ?
i don t. it s like , c mon man , you were the mayor of nyc during 9/11/01 , but i get it , that happened under a republican president , and you don t want to dare insinuate your own party is weak on terror .
got it.now , to be completely honest , it s not so much that giuliani forgot he was mayor of nyc during the worst terrorist attack on american soil , but he seems to be playing completely ignorant to that fact , and is just trying to throw president obama and hillary clinton under a bus.to his credit ( of which he should get none ) he did mention 9/11 in passing , but as if only to glaze over the fact that it was a terrorist attack on our nation , but he seems to think that what s happening now is worse than the day nearly 3,000 americans lost their lives.his political pandering clearly knows absolutely no bounds , and should enrage us all.watch giuliani go on fox news to feign complete ignorance here.giuliani : `` do you ever remember the world as dangerous as this ?
i do n't . ''
