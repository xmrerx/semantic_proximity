docs leaked by guccifer 2.0 show a memo from nancy pelosi giving directions to her minions about how to handle black lives matter terror group.in the memo , pelosi is careful to tell the dccc staff to talk to blm members , but make sure you don t allow them to meet with you in large numbers .
in other words , feed the animals , but keep them at an arms length .
this is exactly the kind of rhetoric you would expect from 5-star nancy ( who s net worth is listed at $ 74.11 million ) .
keep them engaged so you don t lose the black voting block , but don t let them get too close most notable is advising democrats not to say all lives matter or to talk about black-on-black crime as this is the worst thing to say to black lives matter activists.it describes blm as radical , which is pretty accurate and notes that it extends beyond questions of police brutality to criminal justice reform .
what they leave out is they don t want reform , they want eliminate prisons and police.notice also it advises : don t offer support for concrete policy positions .
in other words , listen and pretend you care , while offering nothing.via : weasel zippers
