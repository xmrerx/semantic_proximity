lusaka ( reuters ) - zambian president edgar lungu on friday called for unity among political groups ahead of talks between the government and the opposition aimed at reconciliation after a political crisis earlier this year .
the leader of the opposition united party for national development ( upnd ) , hakainde hichilema , was arrested with five others in april and charged with plotting to overthrow the government after his convoy failed to make way for lungu s motorcade .
the case stoked political tensions in zambia , a major copper producer and seen as one of africa s more stable and functional democracies , following a bruising election last year .
hichilema was freed from prison in august after the state dropped the charges , to pave the way for dialogue between the two sides following mediation by commonwealth secretary-general patricia scotland .
scotland s special envoy ibrahim gambari is in zambia and has separately held talks with lungu , hichilema and other opposition leaders .
in an address at the opening of the national assembly , lungu said zambians could disagree and quarrel but would always remain one .
the factors that unite us are much greater than those that seek to divide us , he said .
opposition upnd members of parliament , who boycotted lungu s last address , attended friday s session , saying their attendance would give confidence to the process of dialogue .
the upnd mps took this decision in the interest of the country in view of the forthcoming political dialogue , their spokesman jack mwiimbu said in a statement .
