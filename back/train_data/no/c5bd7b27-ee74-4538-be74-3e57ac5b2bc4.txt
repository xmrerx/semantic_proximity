paris ( reuters ) - the french socialist party plans to put its headquarters in paris up for sale , the party said on tuesday , as it tries to reinvent itself after a poor performance in elections earlier this year .
the disappointing performance in the presidential and parliamentary elections split the party , and it will struggle financially .
the sale of the paris mansion , acquired in 1980 , will be used in part to cover the shortfall .
this new era that is ahead of us can also open up at a new place , jean-francois debat , the treasurer of the party told journalists .
the number of socialist seats in the 577-seat assembly plummeted from 280 in 2012 to just 29 , the lowest in the post-war fifth republic .
parliament s lower house is now dominated by president emmanuel macron s centrist republic on the move party , which blew apart the traditional two-party system .
the crisis facing the socialists has its roots in a mid-term shift of former president francois hollande from being the self-proclaimed enemy of bankers and defender of workers to advocate of business-friendly reform .
the move split the party , exposing a deep-seated rift between moderates and hard-left lawmakers .
