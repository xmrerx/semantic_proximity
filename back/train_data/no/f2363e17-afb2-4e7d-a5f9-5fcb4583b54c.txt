dublin ( reuters ) - an irish general election appeared likely after opposition party fianna fail submitted a motion of no confidence on friday in the deputy prime minister , which the ruling party considers a breach of a three-year agreement to support prime minister leo varadkar s government .
fianna fail leader micheal martin told state broadcaster rte that his party had submitted the motion .
a senior member of varadkar s fine gael party earlier said that the submission of a no confidence motion by fianna fail would kill the deal to support the government .
