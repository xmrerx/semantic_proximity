There s a lot going on in the Hillary Clinton/Donald Trump/Russia investigation that all the highfalutin newspapers that cover politics are still trying to ignore.Well, investors had better know this stuff before it bites them in the assets.
So here goes.Numerous reports coming out of the Senate Judiciary Committee last week said that former FBI Director James Comey made the decision not to refer Clinton for prosecution long before he even interviewed key witnesses, including Hillary.Remember, the Republicans now control this committee.
So bad news isn t going to be stifled anymore.Clinton, you probably remember, lost her private emails, which she d been storing on a personal computer server.
Comey chastised her harshly in a televised speech but then said there was a unanimous decision not to recommend prosecution.Clinton s emails, which were stolen by the Russians, have never been found.
But as I ve mentioned numerous times, the messages are still in the possession of the National Security Agency (NSA), which offered to give them to the FBI.Comey turned down that offer, according to a source who has been very reliable.I ve also mentioned that Comey fibbed when he said his agents unanimously agreed that prosecution was unnecessary.
In fact, my source says that FBI agents were irate about the decision not to go after Clinton.
