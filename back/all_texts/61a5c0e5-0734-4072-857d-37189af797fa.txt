Navy SEAL Carl Higbie had three words for Katy Perry: Go to hell.
Carl Higbie in a Thursday interview on Fox News criticized Perry for her remarks following the deadly Manchester terror attack that left 22 people dead and 59 injured, including children.Perry said: The greatest thing we can do is just unite and love on each other.
No barriers, no borders, we all just need to coexist In response to her call for no barriers, no borders, Higbie said that Perry should hold one of her concerts in Syria and see how they respond to our culture:You might remember Higbie from the time he was screeched at by a CNN anchor when he demanded the truth before accusing Trump s administration of anything: A Navy SEAL Carl Higbie was blasted and screeched at by a CNN anchor who was shocked that Higbie asked for more evidence and truth in the Trump controversy.
Yikes!
She s got snowflake written all over her.
It s just how the left rolls you have to march in lock-step with what they believe to be true even if it s not true.
Just go with it, right?
We say NOT RIGHT!Shouldn t we ask that sources be exposed?
Anyone can say they know the truth but when they hide behind anonymity, they ruin their credibility.
The left just expects everyone to believe the many lies they ve been telling about President Trump.
We re with Carl!
We re not accepting any stories against Trump until we have proof and know the source.Way to go Carl!
