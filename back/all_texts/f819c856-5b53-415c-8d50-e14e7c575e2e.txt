Marlee Matlin may have had no comment on Thursday when it was revealed that Donald Trump called her retarded because she is deaf, but she destroyed him on Friday for it.
Recent media reports have circulated that Donald Trump allegedly referred to me as retarded, the AcademyAward-winning actress wrote on Twitter.
The term is abhorrent and should never be used.
The fact that we are talking about this during a very important moment in U.S. history has upset me deeply.
Trump used the term during Matlin s stint on Celebrity Apprentice back in 2011.
During filming on the boardroom set, the Republican nominee wrote down a question on a piece of paper asking if Matlin is retarded.
He also often mocked her voice and insulted her face to face and behind her back.Matlin continued her condemnation of Trump by pointing out that there are millions of Americans who are hearing impaired and said she plans to use her voice to vote against him in November.
I am Deaf.
There are millions of Deaf and hard of hearing people like me, in the United States and around the world who face discrimination and misunderstanding like this on a daily basis.
It is unacceptable.
So what s my response?
It s not about insults or taking each other down.
As a person who is Deaf, as a woman, as a mom, as a wife, as an actor, I have a voice.
And I m using that voice to make myself heard and vote.
My response to recent media reports Marlee.

There is no excuse for Trump s behavior.
He is simply a despicable human being who should not be allowed anywhere near the White House.
He owes Marlee Matlin and the rest of America a sincere public apology.Featured Image: Wikimedia
