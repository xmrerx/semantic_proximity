Georgia Congressman John Lewis is one of America s most cherished civil rights icons.
Most people, no matter how much they disagree with him, have the good sense not to attack him but not Donald Trump.On Friday, parts of an interview that Rep. Lewis did for Meet the Press with NBC s Chuck Todd were released, and in that interview, Lewis questioned the legitimacy of Trump s presidency.
Of course, being the wannabe strongman that he is, Trump cannot STAND the idea of anyone much less anyone in a position of power daring to question him or his right to enter the Oval Office.
To that end, Trump sunk even further than he has in times past, and attack Rep. Lewis via Twitter:Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results.
All talk, talk, talk no action or results.
Sad!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017Donald Trump, you need a history lesson.
John Lewis almost died taking action with regards to civil rights in America.
He has done more for this nation than you could ever dream of doing.
If you want your approval ratings to go even lower, keep going.
Rep. Lewis is not afraid of the likes of you.
He has more courage, class, and action in his little finger than you do in your whole pathetic body.
If he wants to declare you illegitimate, it is his right to do so.
That man has earned the right to say whatever he likes, about whomever he likes.Go ahead, keep it up with the attacks.
I dare your sycophants to defend this one.Featured image via Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images
