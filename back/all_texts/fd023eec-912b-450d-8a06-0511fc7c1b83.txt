WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday the United States would maintain sanctions on Cuba and Venezuela until they restore political and religious freedom.
We re confronting rogue regimes from Iran to North Korea and we are challenging the communist dictatorship of Cuba and the socialist oppression of Venezuela, Trump told a conservative political conference.
And we will not lift the sanctions on these repressive regimes until they restore political and religious freedom for their people.
