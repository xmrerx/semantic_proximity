if you were watching fox news this morning , you probably saw terror expert james mitchell being interviewed regarding the latest muslim attack in london .
he was cut off mid-interview as soon as he started to name and shame who was responsible for the terror attack in london today.james mitchell on london # pearsonsgreen terror attack gets cut off # fridayfeeling another attack on western civilization pic.twitter.com/tnzxve0rvp somewhereusa ( @ karey_usa ) september 15 , 2017the ironic thing is that the only thing fox news put out about the interview was that we re being too pc lol ! .

why won t they say who commits most terror attacks ? ?
? london terror attack gosh , i wonder who did it ? officials are looking for terrorists who detonated a bucket bomb on a crowded london subway train .
twenty-two people were injured but it could have been much worse .
the homemade bomb did not fully detonate .
the ied was made with different items like fairy lights and was probably on a timer set to detonate.we continue to see terrorism by muslims why are we quiet about who does this ?
