In true Trump style he was able to laugh at himself and make fun of the protest against him.
He turned this into ratings gold for SNL and made us all laugh out loud The faux outrage and twisting of Trump s words on immigration continued outside the Saturday Night Live studio last night: The presidential candidate hosted Saturday Night Live this week, turning his controversial appearance into both a punchline and a reality.Much like on the campaign trail, the Republican frontrunner didn t hold back during his monologue, diving right into jokes about Rosie O Donnell, protesters angry about his hosting the show and even fielding an interruption from Larry David:Larry David couldn't miss this opportunity.
