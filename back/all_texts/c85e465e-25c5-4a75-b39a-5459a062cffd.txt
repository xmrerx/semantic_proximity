Kara Young, the biracial model who dated Donald Trump has broken her silence amid the deadly attack in Charlottesville.
Trump s former girlfriend says she never heard him say anything racist not once.She told the paper that she s never heard him make any sort of racist comments, but was left horrified by what he said about the deadly attack in Charlottesville.
GPSo just to clarify The comments President Trump made after the Charlottesville violence, where he blamed the actions of the KKK, as well as the violent Antifa agitators and Black Lives Matter protesters, (who in many cases should have been charged with domestic terrorism if we had a law-abiding attorney general when Barack Obama was president) actually horrifies a woman who dated Trump for 2 years, and insisted that he was NOT a racist ?
What exactly, about his statement horrified Young?
