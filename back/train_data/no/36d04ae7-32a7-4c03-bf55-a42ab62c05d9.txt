manchester , england ( reuters ) - britain s junior brexit minister said on monday he was hopeful that eu negotiators would agree to move on to discuss future relationships in october , even after the head of the european commission said it would take miracles for that to happen .
i am very hopeful that everyone will see the mutual advantage of moving on to a discussion of the future relationship in october , steve baker told an event at the conservative party s annual conference .
britain has been seeking to push the talks beyond the terms of the divorce and on to future ties , including trade , at a european meeting later in october .
but jean-claude juncker appeared to dash those hopes when he said last week that the first stage of talks had not made enough progress .
