United States Army veteran, A.D. Bell, tore into President Obama in a video posted to his YouTube channel this Sunday.
He expresses his frustration with Obama and the fact that nothing in the country is any better in the minority communities as Democrats claim.
When President Barack Obama said he d find it a personal insult if the people, black people in particular, don t vote for Hillary Clinton.
I find it a personal insult that you ve only made one attempt to reach out to these people.
People have been calling on him to come back to Chicago for a long time.
