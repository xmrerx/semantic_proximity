according to the results from a recent survey by public policy polling , only 45 percent of donald trump voters polled wholeheartedly believe that donald trump jr. met with russian lawyer natalia veselnitskaya , despite the fact that the u.s. president s eldest son has openly admitted doing so.president trump s alleged collusion with russia has been one of the main stories doing the rounds since before his inauguration , but more fuel was added to the fire when the new york times broke the news at the beginning of the month of donald trump jr. s meeting with veselnitskaya , a russian lawyer with ties to russian leader vladimir putin , and six others in an effort to obtain damaging information about his father s campaign rival , hillary clinton , back in june 2016.donald trump jr. has since admitted that the meeting took place and has even given details of the attendees , including former trump campaign chairman paul manafort and trump s son-in-law and now-senior adviser , jared kushner , however , many trump voters aren t so sure.despite these admissions from the man himself , 32 percent of the trump voters surveyed believe that the meetings didn t happen at all and a further 24 percent weren t entirely sure .
to make matters even worse , 72 percent believed the whole story about russia meddling in last years presidential election to be fake news , while only 14 percent disagreed entirely with that notion.some other points of interest that came from the results of the trump voters surveyed : but it isn t all bad news .
the very same survey showed that only 41 percent of his surveyed voters approve of the job he s doing , whereas 55 percent don t. to make matters worse , just 37 percent of his voters consider trump to be honest , but 57 percent say he isn t , and 52 percent call him an outright liar , while only 40 percent disagree with that label being used to describe the president .
so there is hope.featured image via jeff vinnick/getty images
