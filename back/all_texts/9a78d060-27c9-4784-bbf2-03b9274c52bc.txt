These are statistics are shocking and very telling.
Please be sure to share this piece with Hillary voters who support a candidate that welcomes un-vetted refugees to America with open arms in the name of diversity.
Obama and his regime have been shaming Americans into believing that there is something wrong with us for being suspicious of radicalized Muslims in America.
Barack Hussein Obama has gone out of his way to criticize Christianity, going as far back as the Crusades to make a point about Christians committing acts of violence against Muslims.
He has also gone out of his way to embrace Islam.
Is it any small wonder he is endorsed and adored by one of the most radical Muslims in America, leader of the Nation of Islam, Louis Farrakhan?
On the back of the Brussels terror attack it is worthwhile remembering that while a majority of Muslims in the West appear to have no truck with terrorism or extremism, there are a significant number who sympathise with terrorism and repeatedly attempt to justify attacks on the West.TERRORISMAn ICM poll from 2006 revealed that 20 per cent of British Muslims sympathised with the 7/7 bombers who brought terror to the streets of the British capital, killing 52 and injuring hundreds.
This number rose to one in four British Muslims, according to NOP Research for Channel 4.
With a British Muslim population of over 3 million today, that translates to roughly three quarters of a million terror-sympathising people in the UK.The number rises for younger British Muslims a sure sign that radicalisation through schools, mosques, and prisons (often via Saudi-funded groups) is creating a long-term problem in Europe.
Thirty-one per cent of younger British Muslims endorsed or excused the 7/7 bombings of 2005, with just 14 per cent of those over 45 doing so.Here are a few examples of tweets we found last night on Twitter following the Brussels terror attack:A 2013 study found that 16 per cent of young Muslims in Belgium believed that state terrorism is acceptable, while 12 per cent of young Muslims in Britain said that suicide attacks against civilians in Britain can be justified.Pew Research from 2007 found that 26 per cent of young Muslims in America believed suicide bombings are justified, with 35 per cent in Britain, 42 per cent in France, 22 per cent in Germany, and 29 per cent in Spain feeling the same way.And Muslims who are more devout or dedicated to Islam are three times more likely to believe that suicide bombings are justified a harrowing statistic when you consider that 86 per cent of Muslims in Britain feel that religion is the most important thing in their life.
While just 5 per cent of UK Muslims said they would not report a terror attack being planned, the number leaps to 18 per cent amongst young, British Muslims.The anti-police narrative fueled by groups like Black Lives Matter are no doubt contributing to this idea that people should not work with the police, with the British Muslim Youth group recently urging a boycott of police.More recently, in 2015, it was revealed that 45 per cent of British Muslims think that hate preachers that advocate violence against the West represent mainstream Islam.
Forty per cent of British Muslims say they want Sharia law in the West, while 41 per cent oppose it.Despite the fact that Islamophobia did not rise after the Paris Attacks, there remains a grievance industry across the Western world which targets young Muslims especially, urging them to feel victimised by Western governments for taking a stance against Islamism and scarcely a tough stance at that.CRIMINALITYDo these stats explain Obama s rush for a mass release of prisoners before he leaves office?Earlier this year it was reported that one in five prisoners in the United Kingdom s top security jails is now Muslim, a rise of 23 per cent from just five years ago.
In total, a 20 per cent increase in the jail population in Britain has been outstripped by the rise in Muslim inmates up 122 per cent over 13 years.The same disproportionate figures are borne out across the United States, where Pew data from 2011 revealed that Muslims made up 9 per cent of state and federal prisoners though at the time Muslims made up just 0.8 per cent of the U.S. population.In 2008, the Washington Post reported About 60 to 70 percent of all inmates in [France s] prison system are Muslim, according to Muslim leaders, sociologists and researchers, though Muslims make up only about 12 percent of the country s population.
INTEGRATION Despite hundreds of millions of pounds, dollars, and euros spent on integration projects, it appears to be a Sisyphean task calling into question the rate at which immigration is occurring throughout the Western world and the tolerance with which our societies have operate thus far.The BBC found that 36 per cent of 16 to 24-year-old Muslims believe that if a Muslim converts to another religion they should be punished by death.
Thirty five per cent of Muslims say they would prefer to send their children to an Islamic school, and 37 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds say they want government-funded Islamic schools to send their kids to.The report again highlights the radicalization of the Muslim youth in the West, with 74 per cent of 16 to 24-year-olds preferring Muslim women to wear the veil, compared with only 28 per cent for those over the age of 55.
