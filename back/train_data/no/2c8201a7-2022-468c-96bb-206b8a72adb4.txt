manila ( reuters ) - philippine maoist rebels declared a traditional christmas truce on friday after the government announced the same , calling off hostilities for six days .
in a statement posted on its website , jorge madlos , alias ka oris , spokesman for the communist new people army ( npa ) , said the truce would last from saturday to tuesday , when the group celebrates its 49th anniversary .
all units of the npa and the people s militias shall remain on active defensive mode in order to defend the people and revolutionary forces , madlos said , adding the guerrillas will maintain a high degree of alertness and preparation against any hostile actions or movements by enemy armed forces .
on thursday , the defense department announced a truce over the same period to allow filipinos to celebrate a stress-free christmas season .
both the government and the npa have declared christmas truces since the late 1980s when the two sides first agreed to peace talks , brokered by norway .
the tradition has continued even after negotiations stalled and now have been scrapped by president rodrigo duterte .
the npa rebels , estimated to number around 3,000 , have been fighting for nearly 50 years in a conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people and stifled growth in resource-rich areas of the country .
the country also faces various islamist insurgencies in the south .
