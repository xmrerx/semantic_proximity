hilarious conservative media analyst and youtube sensation mark dice took to the streets of los angeles in 2013 while president obama was still occupying our white house .
he asked random people walking down the street if they would sign a petition to support violent criminals to be released from our prisons and onto our streets .
it s interesting to see how many people accept that illegal aliens in our prisons are not being treated unfairly without any evidence .
this false narrative was successfully promoted by barack obama , our media and the democrats , who decided that illegal aliens should be not just be given equal treatment to american citizens , but instead , they should be given special treatment above and beyond those afforded to american citizens.watch the video and check out the new statistics below that were just released by zogby , showing that hispanics in america now support president trump more than any other demographic .
apparently supporting illegal aliens who commit crimes in america is no longer cool under a trump administration : most of the people who are seen signing this petition , are hispanic .
but that s when we had a president who shamed americans into believing that giving special privileges to illegal aliens was expected .
today however , is a different story in its latest survey , zogby analytics said that hispanic support has hit 45 percent , two points higher than the president s generic approval.that is 55 percent higher than the total latino vote for trump in the election .
he won just 29 percent .
the biggest surprise in this new poll is trump s approval among hispanic voters , which is at 45 percent approval/51 percent disapproval .
in february the numbers were less among hispanics at 39 percent approval/53 percent disapproval , said zogby.via : washington examiner
