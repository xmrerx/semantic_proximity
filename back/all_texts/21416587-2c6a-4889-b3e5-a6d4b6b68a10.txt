OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada has no plans to change its travel advice for Cuba or to remove any Canadian staff from its embassy there, though some staff have experienced some unusual symptoms, a spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Chrystia Freeland said on Friday.
Some of our diplomatic staff and their family members started to experience unusual symptoms in March 2017, including earaches, dizziness and headaches, said Adam Austen.
All of the personnel who experienced symptoms underwent testing in Canada and the U.S. and the cause of the symptoms remains unknown.
We have been working closely with Cuban authorities to ascertain the cause.
We continue to monitor the situation closely and we have no plans to travel advice or remove any staff, Austen added.
The United States on Friday cut its diplomatic presence in Cuba by more than half and warned U.S. citizens not to visit because of mysterious attacks that have caused hearing loss, dizziness and fatigue in U.S. embassy personnel.
