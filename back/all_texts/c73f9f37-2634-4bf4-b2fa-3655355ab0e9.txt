Megyn Kelly has been around for a while as a reporter.
Like the majority of people in her field, her work has been praised by some and not liked by others.
Yet, ever since her spat with Donald Trump, she has been catapulted to a level of unprecedented notoriety.
In some ways, her new found fame has had positive ramifications, but in other ways it has been frightening, especially when you factor in Donald Trump.
He seems to have inspired many people, some of them with racist and violent tendencies.Kelly knows first hand what it is like to get on the bad side of Trump supporters because she has been receiving death threats.
Kelly said, It s not so much what he writes or says, it s how he gins up anger among so many, so it manifests in my life in several ways.
Kelly has cause to worry that someone s gonna hurt me in the presence of my children.
As disturbing as this revelation is, one has to keep in mind that there has been a consistent thread of violence or calls to violence when it comes to Donald Trump and his campaign: People have been attacked and/or kicked out of his rallies for opposing his views and Trump has repeatedly called for violence against those who oppose him at his cult-like rallies.The hope is that the simmering nightmare that is Trump will go away and he will not have an opportunity to have actual tangible power in the form of the presidency.Watch video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KjWEoD9aj0I]Featured image via video screenshot
