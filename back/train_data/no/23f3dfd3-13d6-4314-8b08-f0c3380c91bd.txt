prague ( reuters ) - czech president milos zeman plans to appoint andrej babis as prime minister in early december and the full cabinet around the middle of the month , zeman s spokesman said on thursday .
babis s ano party came first by a wide margin in a parliamentary election last month but fell short of a majority and has not found any coalition partners nor votes to support a minority cabinet that babis is now trying to form .
czech public television reported on thursday that zeman wanted to appoint babis on dec. 6 and his full cabinet on dec. 15 .
the president s spokesman said those were provisional dates .
zeman spoke on thursday with journalists traveling with him during a state visit in russia .
the eight other parties in parliament have so far been unwilling to join a coalition with ano , mainly due to an investigation into allegations that babis hid ownership of an farm and convention center almost a decade ago to get european union subsidies .
babis denies any wrongdoing and says the case is politically motivated .
the new government will take power from the date of the appointment .
if it loses a mandatory confidence vote , it will stay in office until another administration is formed , which can take months .
babis appointment will be possible only after the current government of prime minister bohuslav sobotka resigns , which is expected to happen next week at the earliest .
so far , only the communists have said they may help ano s minority government in the confidence vote , but their votes alone would not be enough .
