tripoli ( reuters ) - a libyan force that acts as an anti-crime unit in tripoli said it had arrested the organisers of a comic festival for acts of indecency and against public morals .
the arrests were carried out by the special deterrence force ( rada ) , a salafist-led armed group that has expanded its power under libya s u.n.-backed government of national accord .
salafists are ultra-conservatives whose influence has grown across libya in recent years .
the arrests cut short the second three-day annual comic con festival of arts , comics , anime and gaming to be held in the capital .
the arrests were made on friday , the second day of the event .
some libyans had attacked comic con organisers on social media for holding the event , saying it was un-islamic and resembled a halloween party .
the organisers said on their facebook page that the festival had nothing to do with halloween .
they posted no immediate comment on the arrests .
rada said in its statement that festivals like comic con were derived from abroad and exploit weakness of religious faith and fascination with foreign cultures .
the organisers and supervisors of the event were arrested and will be presented for public prosecution for acts of indecency and against public morals , it said in a statement .
it is necessary to address these destructive phenomena and fight them , which drive the dissemination of pornography and feed the minds of teenagers and motivate them to kill and mutilate through well-known cartoons .
