london ( reuters ) - britain launched a fund on friday to support new technology to screen hand-luggage in airports in a bid to detect concealed explosives without passengers having to remove electrical items from their bags .
the department for transport said 3 million pounds ( $ 3.9 million ) would be made available to support innovation in the detection of hidden explosives , as well as new methods to recognize when electrical items had been tampered with .
we need to embrace and encourage the talent from industry that will allow us to stay several steps ahead of those who wish us harm , security minister ben wallace said in a statement .
britain joined the united states in imposing a so-called laptop ban on certain flights from the middle east earlier this year , restricting passengers from carrying electronic items in their hand luggage .
the restrictions have been lifted on some flights from turkey and tunisia following the introduction of new security measures , but remain in place elsewhere .
the transport department said it would consider funding proposals that focused on screening at airport security areas , as well as portable technology which could be used at other points in a passenger s journey .
