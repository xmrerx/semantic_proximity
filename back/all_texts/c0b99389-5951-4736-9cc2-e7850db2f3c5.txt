WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday they had taken a “positive step” toward unifying the Republican Party with the goal of winning the White House in November.
“With that focus, we had a great conversation this morning.
While we were honest about our few differences, we recognize that there are also many important areas of common ground,” the two said in a joint statement.
“This was our first meeting, but it was a very positive step toward unification,” the statement said.
