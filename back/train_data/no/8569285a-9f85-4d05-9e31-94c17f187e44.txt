brussels ( reuters ) - the chairman of european union leaders , donald tusk , said the bloc is ready to start negotiating a transition period with britain after it leaves the eu , and it wanted more clarity from london on how it sees their new relationship after leaving .
tusk said britain will have to respect all eu laws during the transition , as well as respect its budgetary commitments and the bloc s judicial oversight .
but it would no longer take part in decision-making that will be done by the 27 remaining states .
we are ready to start preparing a close uk-eu partnership in trade but also fight against terrorism and international crime , as well as security , defense and foreign policy , tusk told reporters after british pm theresa may arrived in brussels with a brexit deal .
tusk said , however , too much time was spent on negotiating the outlines of britain s exit , which he said was the relatively easier part .
we all know that breaking up is hard but breaking up and building a new relation is much harder , he said .
so much time has been devoted to the easier task and now ... we have de facto less than a year , left of talks before britain is due to leave in march , 2019 .
