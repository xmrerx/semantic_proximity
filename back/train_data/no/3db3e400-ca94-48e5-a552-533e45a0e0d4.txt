our goal is to raise awareness of the heartless and even illegal activities of planned parenthood by going to where the killing and harvesting of body parts from aborted children takes place .
the four main sponsors are : created equal , the pro-life action league , 40 days for life , and citizens for a pro-life society.creating a presence at neighborhood planned parenthood facilities is essential to inform the public about what is going on behind closed doors .
local sidewalk counselors and activists are a key component to shutting down planned parenthood in the long term.the national day of protest will strengthen local efforts by raising their profile with the local press , the community and other pro-life activists .
together , the protests held on august 22 will put pressure on the media , both local and national , to report the truth about planned parenthood , and on government officials to stop funding this discredited organization.click here for map to find protest locations.what : protest pp s harvesting and selling of aborted baby parts where : over 300 planned parenthood facilities across america click here to find a location near you .
