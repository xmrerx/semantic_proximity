ROME (Reuters) - The Italian government on Wednesday won all five confidence votes it had called on a new electoral law in the upper house of parliament.
Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni had called the motions to get the package approved quickly, in the face of furious opposition from the anti-system 5-Star Movement and small leftist groups.
A final vote on the law is scheduled for Thursday morning.
