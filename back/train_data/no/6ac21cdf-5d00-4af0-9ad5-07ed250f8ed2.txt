berlin ( reuters ) - qatar is ready to sit at the negotiating table to try to end a dispute with its gulf arab neighbors , emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani said on friday in berlin .
saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , egypt and bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with qatar on june 5 , accusing the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas of financing terrorism and cozying up to their arch-rival iran .
doha denies the charges .
saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman spoke by phone with sheikh tamim a week ago in what looked like a breakthrough .
but riyadh promptly suspended any dialogue with doha , accusing it of distorting facts in its news agency s report of the interaction .
as you know we have had a siege of more than 100 days against qatar , sheikh tamim told a joint news conference with german chancellor angela merkel in berlin .
we spoke about qatar s readiness to sit at the table to solve this issue .
for her part , merkel said she was concerned that there was still no solution to the crisis , adding she supported efforts by kuwait and the united states to mediate an end to the dispute .
sheikh tamim also said he retained confidence in german firms and will hold on to stakes in deutsche bank and volkswagen .
separately , qatar s foreign ministry warned its citizens against traveling to egypt , because it said the authorities there had imposed security measures on qataris entering the country .
it did not provide details in a statement .
