A school district in Mount Vernon, Washington, was advised by legal representation Wednesday to allow the Satanic Temple of Seattle to start an after-school program at one of their elementary schools because it would be costly and futile if officials chose otherwise.Duncan Fobes, a lawyer with the Seattle-based law firm Patterson, Buchanan, Fobes and Leitch, advised the Mount Vernon School Board during a Wednesday meeting that any effort to block the proposed After School Satan Club by the Satanic Temple of Seattle for Centennial Elementary School would ultimately be unsuccessful, according to the Skagit Valley Herald.
I think that if the school district denied that application, you would face costly litigation that would be distracting from your mission, said Fobes who was hired by the district s risk-pool insurance group to assess if the district had legal standing to deny the temple s application.
We believe that it s clear that, because the district has a policy and procedure that encourages the use of community groups to use your facilities, because you do that, you must open it to this group, Fobes added.
You don t have to sponsor the group, you don t have to help the group.
