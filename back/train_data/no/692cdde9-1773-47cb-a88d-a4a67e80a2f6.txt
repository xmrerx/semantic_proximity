united nations ( reuters ) - u.n. secretary-general antonio guterres on sunday urged warring parties in yemen to stop all ground and air assaults and called for a resumption of all commercial imports into the country because millions of children , women and men risk mass hunger , disease and death .
a saudi-led coalition launched air strikes on yemen s capital , sanaa , local media said , lending support to former yemeni president ali abdullah saleh after he signaled he was abandoning his support of the iran-aligned houthis - a shift that could pave the way to end three years of war .
