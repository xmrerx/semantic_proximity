washington ( reuters ) - the sole republican member of the u.s. securities and exchange commission , michael piwowar , expressed deep skepticism about a retirement advice rule that the labor department released on wednesday , a sign of potential conflict over the long-awaited regulation .
“ i am disappointed that the rule announced today seems to ignore the chorus of voices that questioned whether it will restrict middle-class families ’ and minority communities ’ access to professional financial advice by making retirement advice unaffordable , ” piwowar , an sec commissioner , said in a statement .
“ i am fearful that those concerns , which were widely and bipartisanly held , will prove to be true once the rule becomes effective. ” the sec , the country ’ s chief securities regulator has been crafting its own rule on retirement advice for years .
some lawmakers and industry members had said that the labor department , which oversees retirement laws , should hold off until that rule was finalized .
under the labor rule that takes full effect jan. 1 , 2018 , brokers would have to follow a fiduciary standard , acting in clients ’ best interests when advising about retirement accounts .
it aims to end potential conflicts of interest by brokers who advise on individual retirement accounts , and to protect consumers from buying unnecessary investment products .
but after a draft was released last year , members of both political parties , along with financial services firms , expressed concern that the rule would drive up costs and put professional advice out of reach for middle and lower-income people .
