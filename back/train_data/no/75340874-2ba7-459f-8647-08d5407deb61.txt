berlin ( reuters ) - german lawmakers have protested after wolfgang schaeuble , the new president of the bundestag , announced a ban on sending tweets from inside the parliament chamber .
in a letter published in german media on thursday , the former finance minister told lawmakers that using devices to photograph , tweet or send messages from the plenary chamber is inappropriate to the proceedings of the bundestag .
german politicians are far behind other countries in addressing voters via twitter s short messaging service , and none comes close to u.s. president donald trump - but the measure has not gone unprotested .
this is not going to be the last word on the matter , tweeted conservative lawmaker dorothee b r , who with more than 64,000 followers is among the biggest twitter stars of german politics , proving her adeptness with a winking smiley and a string of hashtags .
you can watch parliamentary sessions live , but we can t tweet from it , tweeted her liberal colleague frank sitta .
would a handwritten letter from inside be ok ?
it makes no sense !
it was not clear if either of those tweets had been sent from the parliament chamber .
the backlash comes after an election which heard promises to address germany s relative slowness in adopting the latest digital technologies .
politicians fear the industrial and export titan s strength risks being undermined by more nimble digital upstarts from silicon valley .
during his decade at the finance ministry , schaeuble earned a reputation for ruthlessly policing indebted euro zone states budgets .
lawmakers chose him for his new job in the hope he would ably discipline a parliament that since september s national election is more fragmented than ever before .
