moscow has said 155 representatives of the autonomous region will participate , sipan hemo , the commander of the ypg , was quoted as saying by official syrian kurdish social media channels on wednesday .
kurdish groups have not taken part in any round of syrian peace talks so far despite their control of more than a quarter of syria .
turkey opposes their involvement in talks .
moscow backs syrian president bashar al-assad in syria s six-year-old civil war while turkey opposes him .
but ankara views the ypg as a terrorist group affiliated to the kurdish pkk , which has waged an insurgency in turkey for decades .
russia , iran and turkey announced the jan. 29-30 dates for the talks in the black sea resort of sochi date after a round of peace talks in kazakhstan last week , but did not say who would participate .
turkish president tayyip erdogan on wednesday called assad a terrorist and said it was impossible for syrian peace efforts to continue with him .
syria responded that erdogan himself supported terrorist groups fighting in syria .
about 40 syrian rebel groups , including factions that have taken part in other rounds of peace talks , said on monday they would refuse to attend the sochi congress .
russia is the most powerful supporter of assad .
its jets have helped him bring the rebellion against his rule near to an end , and rebels say moscow has put no pressure on him to find a political solution .
u.n. syria envoy staffan de mistura has said that the success of the congress should be assessed by its ability to contribute to and support the u.n.-led geneva talks on ending the war .
