americans need to know that gun control is not just an issue leftist legislators are pushing .
educators and school administrators are making it clear that even the suggestion or thought of a gun by students , regardless of age , is evil and will be punished .
when this story first came out in the news , we thought it had to be fake .
once we realized it was a real story and that a 2nd grader had actually been suspended for chewing a pop-tart into the shape of a gun , we applauded his father for taking the matter to court .
we assumed any reasonable judge would rule against the irresponsible parties involved in their reckless decision to suspend this 7 year old boy , and that the boy s suspension would be reversed .
were we ever wrong the suspension of second grader who chewed his breakfast pastry into the shape of a gun was upheld by a circuit court judge last week.joshua welch was suspended from anne arundel county s park elementary in march 2013 after chewing his pastry into the shape of a gun and [ pretending ] to fire it .
the student s father , b.j .
welch , took the matter to court in hopes of having the suspension reversed and expunged from his son s record.but wjz 13 reports that an anne arundel county circuit judge upheld the suspension , ruling that joshua s actions were disruptive .
anne arundel county schools reacted to the ruling by releasing a statement which said , we have believed from the outset that the actions of the school staff were not only appropriate and consistent , but in the best interests of all students .
welch family attorney robin ficker lamented the ruling and pointed out there was no violence , no real weapon , no ammunition .
but the suspension will now be on [ joshua s ] record in school every time he goes into a new grade .
