Try not to laugh too hard at this one.Apparently, conservative hero our brave President can face down Muslim terrorists, Mexican rapists, reality, and all other imagined enemies concocted by the American Right but he completely crumbles into a blubbering mess when confronted with his greatest enemies: slight inclines and staircases.According to British publication The Sun, Trump was seen holding hands with U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May for a very interesting reason: he suffers from a disorder called bathmophobia, a severe fear of stairs and slopes so pervasive that he can be triggered just by looking at them.While the handholding that was observed has been presented as a sign of how deeply they have bonded, The Sun published a report on Saturday that shoots down that idea completely:Government sources in Washington DC said they had been told the New York property billionaire is uncomfortable with using either [stairs or slopes].The 70-year-old president is thought to have grabbed Theresa May s hand to steady himself as the pair walked down a ramp in a colonnade, before then rubbing it in thanks.Trump s phobia also means he refuses to visit one close aide s office in the White House because it s up a flight of stairs from the Oval Office.Downing Street last night would not discuss the president s alleged phobia, instead dubbing the hand holding a chivalrous gesture .Trump also recently confessed to being a germaphobe (to the point that he says he is going to do everything in my power not to shake hands with teachers because they have 17,000 germs per square inch on their desk ) as he attempted to shut down reports that he had paid a couple nice Russian ladies to pee on a bed in a hotel room because President Obama had once slept there.Does this new information matter at a time that the world is fighting his recent attempt to ban Muslims from entering the country?
Absolutely not.
But this weekend, we all needed a laugh.Featured image via Getty Images (Christopher Furlong)
