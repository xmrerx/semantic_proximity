New York City begs to differ Of course, this is just another way of Obama saying, Screw Trump and screw America, we re building Muslim communities in your hometowns and communities with or without your permission.
In an official statement on the eve of Ramadan, an Islamic holy month, Barack Obama said the United States would continue to welcome Muslim refugees despite voices that seek to divide us.
I stand firmly with Muslim American communities in rejection of the voices that seek to divide us or limit our religious freedoms or civil rights, he said in the statement.
I stand committed to safeguarding the civil rights of all Americans no matter their religion or appearance.
Obama s speech regarding Ramadan, the monthlong holiday observed by Muslims through fasting during daylight hours, did not mention Donald Trump by name, but clearly seemed to be directed towards the Republican nominee.
Here in the United States, we are blessed with Muslim communities as diverse as our nation itself.
There are those whose heritage can be traced back to the very beginning of our nation, as well as those who have only just arrived, he said.
