WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate Intelligence Committee is still negotiating with President Donald Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, to obtain documents for its investigation into Russia and the U.S. presidential election, congressional aides said on Thursday.
Earlier on Thursday, the committee’s Republican chairman, Senator Richard Burr, told reporters that Flynn’s lawyers said he would not honor a subpoena for the documents.
A lawyer for Flynn did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
