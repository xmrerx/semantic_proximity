He watched bullets ricochet off a dirt path beyond the right field fence.
He heard a cry go up from the players left on the field, directed toward the security guards who were swinging into action.More than 25 bullets can be heard ripping through the air in the footage, which was captured by a witness close to the field at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park.At one point, a man can be seen lying in the middle of the field.
Do we know where he s at?
the man recording the video can be heard saying.
I assume people have been calling 911 already.
The shooting continues for several minutes, with some pauses in between the gunfire.
Toward the end of the video, several gunshots are fired in quick succession, as people shout in the background.The footage then shows several people crowd around the player on the field.The shooter has died and it s being reported he was homeless living out of a gym bag.
