barcelona ( reuters ) - protesters clashed with police trying to reclaim disputed religious artefacts from a museum in catalonia on monday , in the latest display of tension between catalan separatists and spain s central government ahead of a dec. 21 election .
a monastery in neighboring aragon region says over 44 of its artefacts were sold illegally to catalonia in the 1980s and the issue has become a symbol of broader disagreement between opponents and supporters of catalan independence .
culture minister inigo mendez de vigo angered catalan nationalists in november by using special temporary powers to accept a petition by a judge from aragon calling for the artefacts to be returned to their previous home , the monastery of sijena .
the previous month , madrid took control of catalonia to quell the crisis over secession and called a snap regional election .
hundreds of demonstrators on monday massed at the museum of lleida in western catalonia where the artefacts were kept and pro-independence groups called supporters to stop the police from removing them .
there were minor scuffles , though no injuries were reported and the artefacts were eventually taken away at around noon .
former catalan leader carles puigdemont , currently in self-imposed exile in brussels , criticised the move on twitter and blamed the three principal unionist parties running in upcoming elections , the ruling people s party ( pp ) , the socialist party and ciudadanos .
carried out at night and using a militarised police force , as always , and taking advantage of a coup d etat to plunder catalonia with complete impunity : this is the model that ciudadanos , psc and pp defend , puigdemont said .
prime minister mariano rajoy said his government could not oppose court rulings because it would mean stepping outside the rule of law .
