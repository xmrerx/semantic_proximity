This has been one nasty election year.
First, a North Carolina GOP office was firebombed.
Luckily, no one was hurt.
Now, another swing state, Ohio, has seen vandalism but this time the other side of the aisle was the target.
A truckload of manure was dumped right out front at the Warren County Democratic Party headquarters.
Here is the tweet showing the damage:When they dump manure, we go high!
One of our best performing offices, generating strong D early vote.

It is ILLEGAL!
That it is.
Yes, this has been an exceptionally nasty election cycle.
Most people are wishing it was over.
In the meantime, it seems that some people are taking their frustrations with everything out on each other.
That isn t the way, though, folks.
Whether you re a Republican or a Democrat, violence and vandalism is not the answer.
