Two nights ago, we elected the worst person imaginable to the highest office in the land.
His Majesty, King Hater, doesn t take officially take office until January 20, 2017, but the effects of his election are already spreading in a rash of hateful and bigoted incidents against everyone who isn t a straight, white, Christian male.Insanul Ahmed has collected a series of social media posts and videos detailing exactly what s happened.Because that s apparently not bad enough, there s even more:What s truly terrifying here is that this is just the beginning.
Trump s election just legitimized every brand of hate there is.
It s now okay to intimidate, harass and threaten anyone who isn t straight and white.
It s now okay to sexually assault women.
It s now okay to be anti-Semitic, and openly hurl epithets at anyone who isn t straight and white.
There are people who keep saying, It will all be okay, and joking around about Trump s win without understanding why so many of us are so angry and scared.We re angry and scared because things we ve already been through, like what s above and more, were validated with Trump s election.
The haters, the bigots, the anti-Semites, the racists, the men s rights activists/misogynists, the white supremacists, the Islamophobes, the nativists, and the religious right, were all vindicated, while we were invalidated and violently kicked to the side.Welcome to Trump s America.
Price of admission: Rights, freedoms, equality, humanity.
We ll waive your fees if you re a straight, white male.Here s Ahmed s full list, posted on Twitter:Day 1 In Trump s America Featured image by Win McNamee via Getty Images, and via Twitter
