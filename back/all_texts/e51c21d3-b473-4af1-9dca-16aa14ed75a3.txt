WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Friday he was preparing to call British Prime Minister Theresa May after a home-made bomb on a London train injured 22 people.
Trump, who spoke briefly with reporters before going into the Oval Office, said he had been briefed on the attack, which police called a terror incident, calling it a terrible thing.
Asked about a Friday morning tweet in which Trump said the U.S. ban on travelers from certain countries should be more specific, Trump said: We have to be tougher and we have to be smarter.
