cnn political hack alison camarota wants to nail president trump but former independent counsel ken starr says he sees no obstruction .
starr goes on to say that it s a very hard case to make .
camarota comes back and tries to make the hope comment by trump to be an admission of guilt starr isn t buying it : she really , really wants this but starr says she s going to intent .
it s very hard to prove and to know someone s intent bingo !
starr hit the nail on the head with the last comment ! starr also goes through the same thing with george stephanopolous : notice how stephanopoulos tries desperately to get ken starr to claim trump is guilty it s a full-on deep state press with the constant media bashing of president trump .
it s become a surreal experience to just attempt to listen to the blathering liberals on cnn , abc , nbc , cbs , msnbc and other local liberal hack stations .
all credibility is lost
