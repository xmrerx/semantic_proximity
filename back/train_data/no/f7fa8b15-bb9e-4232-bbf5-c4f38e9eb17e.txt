caracas ( reuters ) - venezuela s opposition said on tuesday that this week s planned political dialogue in the dominican republic with president nicolas maduro s government was being postponed because regional guarantors were not going .
the international negotiation process can not go ahead until the foreign ministers are invited , opposition negotiator luis florido said , referring to the potential presence of latin american foreign ministers at the talks .
negotiations to ease a bitter and long-running political crisis in the opec nation had been scheduled for wednesday .
previous dialogue efforts have ended in recriminations between the two sides with no concrete progress .
the opposition coalition had previously accused the maduro government of blocking the presence of foreign ministers at this week s talks , but on tuesday said it appeared to be more a scheduling problem .
there was no immediate response from officials .
the opposition s principal demand is for free and fair conditions for the 2018 presidential election .
it also wants freedom for jailed activists , autonomy for the opposition-led congress , and a foreign humanitarian aid corridor to help alleviate venezuela s unprecedented economic crisis .
maduro accuses his opponents of conspiring with the united states and a right-wing international campaign to oust his socialist government via a coup .
the government is seeking guarantees against violence and recognition of the pro-maduro constituent assembly that has overridden congress .
at least 125 people died in four months of often violent protests against maduro earlier this year .
foes say he is a dictator who has wrecked a once-prosperous economy .
maduro and his allies have accused the opposition of preferring violence to dialogue .
debt refinancing talks with international investors had begun successfully in caracas on monday , the government said , though creditors said the discussions were fruitless .
