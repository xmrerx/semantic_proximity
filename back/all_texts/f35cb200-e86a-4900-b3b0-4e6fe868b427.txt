Twitter moments reported that Alaska mom Jolene Jackinsky was waiting at an airport when she noticed the former president, who was immediately drawn to her baby.Barack Obama can be seen posing and smiling with a baby he randomly saw in the airport.
Not surprisingly, ABC News reported on the supposedly spontaneous photo and included a dramatic quote from the mother of the baby as their headline, that made it seem as though Jesus himself appeared at the airport in front of the baby s mother: Oh my God, it is Obama : Alaska mom, baby meet ex-president"Oh my God, it is Obama": Alaska mom, baby meet ex-president https://t.co/hig00Hf1uQ pic.twitter.com/zKhxy7oWnw ABC News (@ABC) July 8, 2017Liberals on Twitter were beside themselves with excitement over America s worst President, Barack Obama.I would cry so many tears if Obama held my child https://t.co/AtP8Afxph5 Jasmin Roederer (@JazzyFlagrant) July 8, 2017The ex I will never get over https://t.co/YQBFpGMLwN Chaffer with no S (@jchaf15) July 8, 2017Not everyone was so impressed with the former president s pose with the baby at the airport.

So why is the ring missing now?
