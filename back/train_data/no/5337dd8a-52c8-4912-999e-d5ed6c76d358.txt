dublin ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump s assertion that he had heard ireland was going to cut its already low corporate tax rate is fake news , irish prime minister leo varadkar said on wednesday .
trump raised a few eyebrows in ireland on monday when he told reporters at the white house : i hear that ireland is going to be reducing their corporate rates down to 8 percent from 12 .
i can confirm that president trump s claim that we are proposing to reduce our corporation profit tax to 8 percent is indeed fake news .
there is no such plan to do so , varadkar told parliament in answer to a question on trump s comments .
ireland s 12.5 percent corporate tax rate has long made it a hub for investment from major u.s. multinationals like google ( googl.o ) and facebook ( fb.o ) and a target for criticism from u.s. politicians .
irish policymakers have responded by consistently stressing that the corporate tax rate will neither go up or down and the rate was reaffirmed just last week in the government s budget for 2018 .
our corporate profit tax is 12.5 percent , has been for a very long time through changes of government , through recessions and through periods of growth , and it as much that certainty that is as important to business as anything else , varadkar said .
trump has said he would like to see the u.s. corporate income tax rate reduced to 20 percent from 35 percent , in part to better compete with lower tax jurisdictions like ireland .
