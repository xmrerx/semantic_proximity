If Ivanka Trump really cares about the LGBTQ community she would not have supported her dad in the 2016 Election.But she did, and that means any show of support she makes is meaningless.Tone deaf as usual, Ivanka still posted a couple tweets on Thursday night in a weak effort to honor LGBTQ Americans.Logging back on after Shavuot, wishing everyone a joyful #Pride2017.
This month we celebrate and honor the #LGBTQ community.
Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) June 2, 2017And in order to prove her support, she claimed that she has LGBTQ friends.I am proud to support my LGBTQ friends and the LGBTQ Americans who have made immense contributions to our society and economy.
Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) June 2, 2017It s kinda like when a racist Republican claims they are not racist because they claim to have black friends.Again, Ivanka supported her dad for president despite the fact that he picked anti-gay conservative Mike Pence as his vice-president.
And let s not forget that Trump s Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is also virulently anti-gay as are many other Trump officials.The fact is that Trump s administration represents the single greatest threat to the lives and freedom of LGBTQ Americans.
And that s exactly why Twitter users handed Ivanka her ass for daring to claim she supports them.Then why d you support anti-gay Mike Pence?

Or is @IvankaTrump vying for the most tone-deaf out-of-touch individual who ever lived award?
(((Denise A Rubin))) (@DeniseARubin) June 2, 2017You openly supported and campaigned for the most anti-LGBTQ+ presidential ticket in recent times.
Your words mean nothing to us.

Tom Coates (@tomcoates) June 2, 2017You send out two tweets about #Pride2017 and your father didn t send out a single one!!!
He doesn t care about LGBT people!
FUCK HIM!
Perez (@ThePerezHilton) June 2, 2017Not only did he not tweet about #Pride2017, he also removed White House Pride celebrations this month.

She is complicit as usual.Featured Image: Sean Gallup/Getty Images
