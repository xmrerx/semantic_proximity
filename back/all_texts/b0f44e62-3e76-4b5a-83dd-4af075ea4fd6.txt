Hillary Clinton will be back in the spotlight this fall for an unprecedented, big-ticket book tour for her new tome What Happened, with tickets priced as high as $1,200.On Monday, the ex-Democratic nominee announced Hillary Clinton Live, a 15-city tour, which includes stops in a handful of states she lost in the election last year.The astronomically priced tickets for Hillary s loser tour, certainly begs the question: If no one came to see Hillary at her rallies (for free) when she was running for president, why would they pay $1,200 to hear the even more irrelevant Hillary Clinton whine about why she lost to Trump?
Promotional materials for her first stop, at the Warner Theatre in Washington, D.C., promises Clinton plans to let loose and tell her audience a personal, raw, detailed and surprisingly funny story of her election loss and recovery.The website promoting the tour, HillaryClintonBookTour.com, features a quote from Clinton too.
In the past, for reasons I try to explain, I ve often felt I had to be careful in public, like I was up on a wire without a net, she said.
Now I m letting my guard down, she pledged.
The tour kicks off on September 18 in D.C. and continues on all through fall.Clinton is making stops in the trio of states that are largely blamed for her election loss: Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan.Clinton is hitting up a trio of Canadian cities too, making appearances in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver.Top-tier ticket packages in those cities cost $3,000 Canadian dollars for two seats, or, in American dollars, about $1,200 a pop.
