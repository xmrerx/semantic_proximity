MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - British foreign minister Boris Johnson said on Tuesday negotiations to leave the European Union were going well but there was too much gloom attached to Brexit.
At the Conservative Party s annual conference, Johnson said that, while trade deals with other countries might take time to negotiate, there would be loads of them done before the next British election, due in 2022.
Johnson also told a meeting on the sidelines of the conference that Britain would want to do things differently to the EU in certain areas, such as data and bio-science.
