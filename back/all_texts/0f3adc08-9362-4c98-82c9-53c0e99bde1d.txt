As Donald Trump s support has crumbled in the past month, donations to Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign have been surging.
In the most recent reports filed with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC), Clinton has just reported her best month yet of fundraising.The campaign ended July with $58.5 million on hand, up from $44.4 million on June 30, according to its report released by the Federal Election Commission on Saturday.
Its $52.3 million raised and $38.2 million spent were both the highest of any month this cycle.Even more positive for Clinton, most of those donors were first time small-dollar donors, of the sort that have been so important to other candidates like Senator Bernie Sanders and President Obama.
58% of the money Clinton raised in July was under $200.
Before, those donors represented 31% of her base.Clinton has spent most of the money on campaign ads in swing states, while Trump only announced plans for a meager advertising buy in the last week.
He did not advertise during the Olympics, which most experts believe is a crucial time to reach prospective voters who aren t news junkies.
Clinton bought time for an ad which highlighted Trump s habit of outsourcing the manufacturing of his clothing lines to other countries.According to the RealClearPolitics current average of polling, Clinton has a 5.7% lead against Trump nationally.
He hasn t had the lead in a single national poll since the week of July 22, when the Republican National Convention was underway.Since then Trump has been involved in a series of controversies, including his repeated attack on the family of a fallen U.S. soldier.
Allegations of underhanded dealings and connections to the Russian government eventually led to the ouster of his top campaign official, Paul Manafort.
