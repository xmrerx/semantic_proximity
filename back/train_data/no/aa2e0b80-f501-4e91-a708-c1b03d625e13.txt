buenos aires ( reuters ) - argentina blocked two european activists from entering the country on the eve of the world trade organization s ministerial meeting in buenos aires , the two told a local radio program on saturday .
sally burch , a british activist and journalist for the latin american information agency , said argentina had already revoked credentials given to her by the wto to attend the meeting but thought she would be able to enter the country as a tourist .
they found my name on a list and started asking questions ... supposedly i was a false tourist , burch said on radio 10 .
it s not very democratic of argentina s government .
petter titland , the spokesman for the norweigan ngo attac norge , said authorities denied him entry without explaining why .
late last month , argentina rescinded the credentials of some 60 activists who had been accredited by the wto to attend the meeting because it determined they would be more disruptive than constructive .
wto meetings often attract protests by anti-globalization groups , but they have remained largely peaceful since riots broke out at the 1999 meeting in seattle .
wto s spokesman , keith rockwell , reiterated on saturday that it disagreed with argentina s decision to revoke activists credentials .
we didn t have the same perspective but we re now moving on , rockwell told journalists .
argentina s president mauricio macri has promoted business-friendly policies since taking office in december 2015 , and argentina will host global events as chair of the g20 group of major economies next year .
