You have to believe this junior Democratic Congressman is a bit unhinged and immature when you read what he did during a moment of silence for the Texas victims.
He walked out of the moment of silence Monday night for victims of this weekend s mass shooting at a Texas church.
The Democrats have politicized the shooting in Texas from day one This showboating politician thought of politics before honoring the victims of the shooting in Texas (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.10'; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));Posted by Ted Lieu on Monday, November 6, 2017FOX NEWS REPORTED:California s Ted Lieu said that he would not join his colleagues who were observing the moment of silence in the chambers of the House of Representatives: I can t do this again I ve been to too many moments of silences.
In just my short period in Congress, three of the worst mass shootings in us history have occurred.
I will not be silent.
I urge us to pass reasonable gun safety legislation, including a universal background check law supported by 80 percent of Americans, a ban on assault rifles and a ban on bump stocks.
WHAT LIEU FAILED TO REVEAL:The shooter should not have been able to purchase guns!
The Air Force made an error and did not report the shooter so he would be flagged.
The laws are in place Mr. Lieu!
SCREW THE NRA My thoughts and prayers are with the victims and families affected by the mass shooting in Sutherland Springs, he posted on Twitter Sunday.But just two hours later, after some of his followers objected to the measured nature of the tweet, Lieu unloaded on the NRA:I agree my prior tweet could be better.
So here: I pray for the victims in TX.
Also, screw the @NRA & can you help Dems take back the House.
