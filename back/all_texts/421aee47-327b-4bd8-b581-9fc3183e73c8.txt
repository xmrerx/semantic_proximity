Reports are saying that President Obama, as always, is a complete class act he s telling everyone at the White House to show Trump s team the same respect he was shown, and basically showing us all how to take the high road even when things look bad (if the country elected the guy that had been questioning my birth for five years, I probably wouldn t do the same.
Would you?
).But things DO look bad, and nothing says it more clearly than this GIF of Vice President Joe Biden at President Obama s press conference:Sorry, Joe.
Direct democracy isn t good enough for the United States, and turnout wasn t high enough to overcome Republican election-rigging.
The look on his face says it all he s let down, appalled, and terrified for the future of our country.Everything in the power of the people and Democrats in congress must be done to protect the will of the people who voted for Hillary Clinton by a slim margin and stop Donald Trump from accomplishing his horrific agenda.Featured image via screencapture
