her testimony about being targeted is riveting ! the internal revenue service has located 6,924 documents potentially related to the targeting of tea party conservatives , two years after the group judicial watch filed a freedom of information act lawsuit for them.the watchdog group intended to find records regarding how the irs selected individuals and organizations for audits that were requesting nonprofit tax status.the agency will not say when it will make the documents available to the public tom fitton , president of judicial watch , is calling on president trump to clean house at the agency .
