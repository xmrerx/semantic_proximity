WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Russia’s attempts to interfere in foreign elections are one of the top worldwide security threats, the senior Democrat on the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said on Thursday.
“Russia’s direct interference in democratic processes around the globe is a direct assault that we must work together to repel,” Senator Mark Warner said as the panel began its annual hearing on worldwide threats, featuring testimony by leaders of U.S. intelligence agencies.
Russia denies such allegations.
