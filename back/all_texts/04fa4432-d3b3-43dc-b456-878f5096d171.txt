Donald Trump continues to lead all others for the Republican nomination for the presidency.
He has destroyed his opponents and if his momentum continues, he will most likely be the Republican nominee despite his racist, xenophobic, and often violent rhetoric.
Yet, he has not been met without resistance from the rest of non-Republican America.
In Chicago, his rally was shut down and these days it seems that wherever he goes, he s met with a barrage of protestors.This was the case in Utah as pro-Trump and anti-Trump sides clashed.
Anti-Trump protestors hung a model of Trump by its neck on the steps of city hall and invited people to smash it like a pi ata.
I hate Trump, shouted one man as he beheaded the figure in one quick motion.
The man then took the head and kicked it to the approval and applause of the audience.The #DumpTrump pi atas are out outside City Hall in #SLC @KSL5TV pic.twitter.com/TLXuItY23h Nicole Vowell (@NicoleVowellKSL) March 19, 2016Another recording of the event shows a second man taking another swing at the figure of the Republican contender.
He shouted to the crowd, how can Trump run a country when he can t even do his hair right?
He then struck the Trump effigy to a cheering crowd.Here s the video:As the possibility of a Trump nomination is becoming more of a reality, people are coming out by the thousands to reject him all over the country.
The best America can do is go to the polls in November to make sure that Trump or the other possible clowns for the Republican nomination do not win the presidency.
