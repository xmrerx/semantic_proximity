Just when we thought that Sarah Palin was out of our lives, she seems to have found a way to creep back in.
The self-described conservative and the vice presidential running mate of Republican senator John McCain in 2008 was asked whether she would be presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump s running mate.
Palin said that she would be ready to serve but she worried about being a burden to the presumptive nominee.
Palin said: I think I m pretty much as vetted as anybody in the country could be vetted.
I think there are so many other great people out there in American that could serve in this position.I think if somebody wanted to choose me, they already know who I am, what I stand for.
They wouldn t be in for any surprises.Palin did acknowledge that she came with lots of baggage.
She said: I want to help and not hurt, and I am such a realist that I realize there are a whole lot of people out there who say, Anybody but Palin.
I wouldn t want to be a burden on the ticket and I recognize that in many, many eyes, I would be that burden.
So, you know, I just want the guy to win.
I want America to win.
Burden is an understatement.
A Trump/Palin ticket already sounds like a clown show but the thought of a Trump/Palin presidency is a terrifying prospect for America.
As President Obama has warned, the presidency is not reality television or entertainment.
It s the most powerful position in the world where important decisions must be made.
Trump and Palin do not qualify to hold these positions.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9BjYkd98_tc]Featured image via video screenshot.
