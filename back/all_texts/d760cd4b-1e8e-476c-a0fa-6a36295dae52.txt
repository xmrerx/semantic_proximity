In an effort to slash $10.5 trillion in government spending over the next 10 years, Donald Trump has decided that the first target will be the Department of Justice s 25 grants and programs aimed at implementing the federal Violence Against Women Act.
This means that every grant authorized by the law over the last 25 years will be eliminated in their entirety.To put it in perspective, Trump s cuts are double that of the cuts sought by House Speaker Paul Ryan and the Republican House caucus.The Violence Against Women Act, a bipartisan law passed in the early 1990s, has been reauthorized twice and is tasked with protecting, aiding, counseling and saving women from abuse, harassment, intimidation and stalking.Some of the 25 grants offered from the DOJ include:All of those grants will be gone, rendering the programs (and the act overall) moot.The man who loves women is about to defund all the services that protect them from abuse and battery.Let that sink in.The Republican war on women has taken a dramatic and ugly turn, and it s all thanks to Donald Trump.Democrats tried to warn America.
It would make sense that a man who routinely calls women bimbos, bitches, and dogs, and brags about sexually groping them, would target the programs that help them when they re most vulnerable.There is no skating around this the incoming administration is vehemently sexist and misogynistic.
Republicans in the past, including the Bush Administration, have not leveled the kind of assault on women that the Trump Administration is preparing to do.
Again, it should be noted that this is an extreme position to take, one that diverges from even typical GOP standards.Instead of cutting the bloated Defense budget and rolling back fat-cat kickbacks for corporations, they re going to target abused women and children even as domestic violence becomes one of the largest public health crises in America.Hopefully House and Senate Republicans, including the female members, will stand up to these outrageous cuts.More importantly, where s Ivanka Trump?
Isn t she supposed to be the new unsung hero of modern day feminism?Women of all stripes and ideologies Republican and Democrat should be outraged.
Abuse doesn t pick a political party.
Vulnerability doesn t pick a political party.
And a political party (or administration) should not be making life harder for those in need.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images
