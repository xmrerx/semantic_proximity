milwaukee ( reuters ) - president barack obama said on thursday that some 20 million americans had become insured as a result of the affordable care act , his signature healthcare law also known as “ obamacare. ” during a trip to wisconsin to tout the program , obama said he hoped republicans would work with him during his final months in office to improve the law , which they have tried unsuccessfully to repeal .
“ today i can announce that thanks to the law , 20 million more americans now know the security of health insurance , ” obama told a crowd in milwaukee after being introduced by a local man who said the law saved his life .
the man , brent brown , said he was a republican who had not voted for the democratic president .
the law was passed in 2010 and republicans have sought to repeal it ever since .
the u.s. department of health and human services said the estimates obama referenced included coverage from the expansion of the medicaid program , health insurance marketplaces , and provisions that allowed young people to stay on their parents ’ private insurance plans longer .
the 20 million figure was an update to a september 2015 government estimate that 17.6 million americans had been insured as a result of the affordable care act .
