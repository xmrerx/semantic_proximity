Former Rep. Gabby Giffords was not about to let Donald Trump get away with exploiting the recent terror attacks in London to push his pro-gun agenda.
The Arizona Democrat dropped the mic on Trump with just one tweet.
Every day is a gun debate, she informed him.
Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now?
That s because they used knives and a truck!
Trump tweeted in regards to the attacks that took place in London over the weekend.
Although seven people lost their lives and 50 more were wounded, Trump was more concerned with using the tragedy to push his pro-gun agenda.Do you notice we are not having a gun debate right now?

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 4, 2017Giffords, who was herself a victim of gun violence, was not in the mood for Trump s bullsh*t. Mr. President, every day we are having a gun debate because every day 90 people in our country die from gun violence.
Many of them are kids, Giffords tweeted back to Trump.Mr.

Six others were fatally shot that day.
She and her husband, astronaut Mark Kelly, founded Americans for Responsible Solutions, a nonprofit that seeks to prevent gun violence.Trump is not only a Republican, but he is also easily bought.
He bows to the highest bidder and when it comes to guns, that would be the National Rifle Association.
So it isn t surprising that he is pro-gun.
But to exploit a terror attack just one day afterward, while the grief is still raw and the city of London is still reeling, is low even for Trump and the NRA.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images
