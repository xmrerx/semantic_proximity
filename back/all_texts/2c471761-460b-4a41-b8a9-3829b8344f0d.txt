After House Speaker Paul Ryan stood in front of the American people and urged them not to rush to judgement on Trump s numerous Russia-related scandals We need the facts, said the guy from a party that spent years badgering our last President about his birth certificate, Benghazi, Benghazi, and Benghazi a reporter asked him a question that should have been easy for him to answer.
But it wasn t easy, was it, Mr. Ryan?CBS correspondent Nancy Cordes asked Speaker Ryan if he still has full confidence in Donald Trump.
This is an easy question for the meth-addled morons who still hang on every word spoken by their favorite fascist, but Ryan (like many Republicans who want to be re-elected) seemed to have difficulty with the question.
He simply looked down, a get me the f*ck out of here expression overtaking his rodent-like face.In recent days, we learned that Donald Trump handed state secrets directly to Russia in the Oval Office, and that James Comey s firing occurred after he refused to pledge his loyalty to Trump and requested additional resources for his investigation into The Donald s collusion with Russia.
At this point, if anyone has anything approaching faith in Donald Trump, they are unfit to serve in any elected office.Ryan could have provided a one-word answer to that question if he truly believed in The Donald.
Instead, brave Sir Ryan ran away.Watch it happen below:Featured image via screengrab
