Donald Trump has crossed another line that should disqualify him from running for president.During a speech to a crowd in Ottumwa, Iowa on Saturday, Trump expressed praise for North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un for solidifying his power by spilling the blood of his family members and political opponents.
You ve got to give him credit, Trump gushed.
How many young guys he was like 26 or 25 when his father died take over these tough generals and all of a sudden, you know, it s pretty amazing when you think of it.
How does he do that?
Even though it is a culture, and it s a culture thing, he goes in, he takes over, he s the boss.
It s incredible.
He wiped out the uncle, he wiped out this one, that one.
I mean this guy doesn t play games.
Here s the video via YouTube.
The relevant remarks begin at the 41 minute marker.Yeah, you heard that.
A Republican presidential candidate who desires to be the leader of the free world admires a ruthless dictator for the way he executes people who might be a challenge to his power.
Doesn t that sound like a dangerous threat to democracy?And it s not like Trump hasn t been leaning toward being a dictator throughout his campaign.
After all, we re talking about a guy who has no problem with throwing people out into the freezing cold or letting his supporters beat up protesters.Donald Trump has displayed a frightening level of hostility toward his opponents and people who don t support him or his policies.
He has taken political discourse to an all new low over the last year by attacking Republican and Democratic presidential candidates below the belt.
He has also made it clear that he has no respect for women and would treat anyone who isn t a conservative white guy with utter contempt.
If anyone has the capacity to become America s first tyrant, it s Donald Trump.And that s why it is scary to hear him praise Kim Jong-Un and his deadly power tactics.Featured Image: flickr
