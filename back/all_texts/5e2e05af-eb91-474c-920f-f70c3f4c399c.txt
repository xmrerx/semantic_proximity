An Ohio judge ruled that Ronald Ritchie, the man whose 911 call led to the officer-involved shooting of a Black man in an Ohio Walmart store in 2014, can be charged with making a false alarm.In August 2014, 22-year-old John Crawford was shot at least ten times by police, as he shopped for an air gun inside a Beavercreek, Ohio Walmart.Police arrived at the store in response to calls placed by Ronald Ritchie and his wife.During his 911 call, Ritchie claimed that John Crawford had a gun and that he was using it to threaten people.Video evidence showed that John Crawford had picked up the air gun in another part of the store, likely to purchase it.While Ritchie told the 911 operator that John Crawford was pointing the gun at customers, and at one point stated he was aiming it at children, after reviewing the video the judge determined Ritchie s statements were not true.As the AP reports here, the judge specifically noted in her statement: at the time that Ronald Ritchie is relaying to dispatch that Mr. Crawford is pointing the gun at two children, the video does not depict this event.

Watch the video from WHIO.Less than 30 days after he told the 911 operator that John Crawford was threatening people inside the store with a gun, he retracted those statements, telling reporters at no point did he shoulder the rifle and point it at somebody.
Contrary to Ritchie s statements, video footage shows that Crawford was using the air gun to prop himself up, leaning on it as he did his shopping.
He was talking with his girlfriend on the phone when a group of white officers shouted at him to drop the gun, then immediately opened fire, shooting him multiple times in the back.His last words were It s not real.
