On Thursday, Donald Trump visited his home state for the first time since he was kinda-sorta elected President by a minority of the population and a system of rules that is in inexplicably still in place to protect slavery (seriously).
Let s just say the welcome wasn t the warmest.
I m just here to protest everything Trump, protester and real estate broker Nina Horowitz told the Straits Times.
It just gets worse and worse and he s just not president material by any stretch of the imagination.
He s an anti-intellectual who s not qualified for the job and I believe he contradicts what America is supposed to be about, said a protest organizer.The crowd collectively had a message for Trump: New York hates you.

Australia has universal healthcare, a system often derided by Republicans who would rather see the poor suffer than pay a single goddamn penny more in taxes.Donald Trump is a complete embarrassment to our country and the people of his home state know it.This is the response with which Trump should be met everywhere he makes an appearance.
Keep resisting, America.Featured image via screengrab
