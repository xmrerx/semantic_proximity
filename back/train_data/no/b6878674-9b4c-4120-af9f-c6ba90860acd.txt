we do this not because it s legally required , because it s not , patton said at a hearing on the agreement .
we do this because we believe it s the right thing to do , both for the victims and their families and for the city .
this is historic , said mr. coverson .
the only city in america that has given reparations and passed a reparations ordinance , and given an official apology for the violence that the police have done to citizens .
the city of chicago on tuesday sought to put to rest one of its most persistent scandals , proposing a $ 5.5 million reparations fund for dozens of torture victims connected to former chicago police cmdr .
jon burge and his so-called midnight crew of rogue detectives.the proposal , negotiated with a key plaintiff s attorney and supported by mayor rahm emanuel , would offer free city college tuition for victims and their families , free counseling for psychological issues and substance abuse as well as other assistance to more than 50 potential victims .
the city would also issue a formal apology , create a permanent memorial recognizing the victims and ensure that eighth- and 10th-grade students attending chicago public schools would be taught about the burge case and its brutal legacy , cementing the scandal s role in city history.but as much as the proposal seeks to end a painful , controversial era emanuel said it would close this book , the burge book on the city s history it is unlikely to stanch the flow of torture claims from victims .
a loyola university chicago law school dean appointed by a cook county judge has identified some 20 additional cases in which inmates may have been burge victims .
other inmates who have made torture claims continue to fight to overturn convictions and win their freedom .
and one lawsuit over the torture is pending.already , this stubborn scandal has cost taxpayers about $ 100 million in lawsuit settlements , judgments and other legal costs , according to lawyers .
it brings it much closer to closure , especially from the city s point of view , said flint taylor , an attorney who has been pursuing the torture issue for decades and was one of the lawyers who negotiated the reparations package .
but it s not done and over .

he was released in october but confined to his home until february .
