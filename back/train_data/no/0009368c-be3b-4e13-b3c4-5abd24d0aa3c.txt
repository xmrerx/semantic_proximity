wikileaks released more e-mails and guess what hillary detests everyday americans .
is anyone except the left surprised by that ?
after all , it has been proven with these e-mails that she s very much an elitist who admittedly can t relate to regular folks .why in the heck would we ever want a president who detests everyday americans ?
hillary built her entire campaign on being the champion of everyday people
