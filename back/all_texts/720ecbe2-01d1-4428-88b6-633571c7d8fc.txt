Trump fans may have won the election, but they aren t taking a break from expressing their racist hatred of Michelle Obama.
The Donald s Deplorables were out in force after the First Lady posed for the cover of Vogue.
I could have spent eight years doing anything, and at some level, it would have been fine, Obama told the magazine.
I could have focused on flowers.
I could have focused on decor.
I could have focused on entertainment.
Because any first lady, rightfully, gets to define her role.
There s no legislative authority; you re not elected.
And that s a wonderful gift of freedom.
In exercising her freedom, Michelle Obama has done quite a bit to push education, healthy eating, and support for our veterans and in exercising their freedom, the Right has responded with nothing but hate.
The reaction to the First Lady appearing in elegant clothing was typical.
Readers of Yahoo News showered Obama with racist remarks, calling her an ape and a monkey and even wishing death upon her for the horrific crime of wearing pretty clothes.
If you thought this behavior would stop after the election, you were wrong.
Trump fans are not done by a long shot and now they have been emboldened by America electing its first official KKK candidate.It will get worse before it gets better.Featured image via Vogue/screengrabs
