cairo ( reuters ) - egyptian military jets destroyed 10 vehicles carrying weapons , ammunition and smuggled goods near the country s western desert border with libya , the army said on saturday .
egypt s porous border with libya has long been a headache for security forces as weapons flow across the frontier , but an attack on police last month claimed by a new militant group has highlighted the security challenges in the western desert .
the air force dealt with them and destroyed them completely and killed all the elements inside , the army statement said , without giving a date of the operation .
egypt s security forces are battling a stubborn islamic state insurgency in the northern sinai region , where militants have killed hundreds of police and troops since 2014 when attacks there started to increase .
