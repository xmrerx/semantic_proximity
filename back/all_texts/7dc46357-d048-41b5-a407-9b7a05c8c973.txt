The Tonight Show s Jimmy Fallon debuted his impersonation of Senator Bernie Sanders, and it was hilarious and spot-on.
After Sander s resounding victory in New Hampshire on Tuesday, Fallon-as-Sanders gave his victory speech.
Repeatedly telling the crowd to be stop clapping, Fallon-as-Sanders said: I m speaking tonight to claim victory in the New Hampshire primary over She Who Must Not Be Named.
New Hampshirites showed the world that you are good, decent people, even though you live in towns that sound like 18th-century porn stars.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ua3aNP19ah8]Fallon-as-Sanders told the crowd that they wanted a candidate who looks like a Scooby-Doo villain before his mask is removed and that they got one in Sanders.
He said that he feels like a million bucks, which of course means I will now evenly distribute myself among the middle class.
Fallon already has a Trump impersonation he often does on the show but his debut of Sanders is an indication of the senator s rising star and his popularity among voters, especially younger generations, who regularly watch Fallon s show.If the resounding victory in New Hampshire is an indication of things to come, Fallon will be doing plenty of impersonations of Sanders victory speeches both in the primaries and in the general election in November.
