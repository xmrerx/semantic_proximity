21st century wire says while you were watching the presidential reality show , the pentagon was busy putting boots back on the ground in iraq and threatening to invade syria.watch a video of this report here : cnn reports that the unit has been setting up safe houses , establishing informant networks and coordinating operations with iraqi and peshmerga units in the past few weeks.defence secretary ash carter said : the only thing i ll say is the expeditionary targeting force ( delta ) is in position , it is having an effect and operating , and i expect it to be a very effective part of our acceleration campaign , carter explained that the deployment of special forces was to make isis fear that anywhere , anytime , it may be struck .
delta force is 200-men strong in iraq , and will be carrying out raids on targets , recovering hostages , eliminating terrorist commanders and gathering intelligence from enemy locations.carter also said : this force will also be in a position to conduct unilateral operations in syria .
what carter is really saying is that delta force may be used illegally in syria , as they have no mandate from the sovereign syrian government , or the un for that matter , to conduct any operations at all on syrian territory.some might even say this is an american threat to invade syria.russian actions , on the other hand , are absolutely legal under international law , as they are fully sanctioned by the syrian government.earlier this week we learned that the russian special forces unit spetznaz was infiltrating isis with undercover operatives , which enabled airstrikes to hit within just three meters of their targets.do you think delta force will have a real effect on the fight against isis ? get the full story on the syrian crisis : 21st century wire syria files
