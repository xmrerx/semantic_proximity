dubai ( reuters ) - eight women and two children from the same yemeni family were killed when an air strike by forces of the saudi-led coalition involved in the country s three-year-old war hit a wedding party , residents said on monday .
the 10 people were returning on sunday evening from a wedding in marib province , an area east of the capital sanaa held by the iran-allied houthi group , when their vehicle was struck , the sources said .
a spokesman for the coalition , which denies targeting civilians and says that every report of an attack is investigated , did not respond to an email requesting comment .
the residents said the victims , all female , were part of the same family , but gave no further details on their ages or if anyone else was traveling with them .
the coalition has been conducting regular air strikes in houthi-held areas as part of a campaign to restore president abd-rabbu mansour hadi to power .
the united nations says that more than 60,000 people have been killed or wounded in the conflict , which also displaced more than two million and triggered a cholera epidemic that has infected about one million people .
