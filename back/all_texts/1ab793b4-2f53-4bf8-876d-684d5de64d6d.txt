House Speaker Paul Ryan (R., Wis.) on Tuesday pushed back against a report from last week that speculated he would not seek reelection in 2018.Ryan spoke at the weekly House Republican leadership press conference and took questions on an array of issues ranging from the House tax bill to speculation that he will not seek reelection in 2018.The speaker was asked about a Politico report that speculated he wouldn t run for reelection, prompting Ryan to push back in a visibly irritated manner.
Oh, look.
I m not going anywhere anytime soon and let s leave that thing at that, Ryan said.
I actually think that piece was very irresponsible.
It was a speculative piece and it was faulty speculation, and I want to put it to rest.
Watch:Last week, Politico reported they interviewed approximately three dozen people, including fellow lawmakers, congressional and administration aides, conservative intellectuals and Republican lobbyists, about Ryan s future in Congress and whether he would seek reelection.
None of the people said they believed Ryan would stay in Congress past 2018, according to the report.The House Republican Conference held a closed-door meeting prior to the press conference where Ryan reportedly first clarified he wasn t going anywhere.Politico reporter Rachael Bade, who co-wrote the initial report, tweeted that Ryan told conference he s not going anywhere and got a standing ovation.
