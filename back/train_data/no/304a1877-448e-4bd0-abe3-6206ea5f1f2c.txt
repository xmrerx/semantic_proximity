barcelona ( reuters ) - pro-independence parties may fail to retain an absolute majority of seats in the catalan parliament in regional elections next month , a poll published on sunday showed , with pro-unity parties poised to increase their vote share .
failure to win a majority in the regional parliament would be a blow for catalan separatists who have billed the dec. 21 election as a de-facto plebiscite on madrid s decision to impose direct rule on the wealthy region last month .
following spain s worst political crisis in decades , the sacking of the secessionist catalan government in october has a eased tensions for the moment , although victory for the pro-independence camp in december would plunge the northeast region back into uncertainty .
catalan separatist parties are predicted to win 46 percent of the vote , down slightly from 47.7 percent in a previous election in 2015 .
unionist parties combined would account for another 46 percent of votes , up from less than 40 percent last time , according to the poll by metroscopia .
the poll shows pro-independence parties winning 67 seats , one short of the absolute majority they would need to retain control of the regional parliament .
unionists forces would also fall short a majority in this scenario , although the poll suggests a high number of voters , around 23 percent , remain undecided .
the staunchly unionist center-right party citizens looks set to cement its position as the largest opposition force with 25.3 percent of votes , gaining from the catalan wing of prime minister rajoy s conservative popular party which drops to 5.8 percent and loses five of its 11 seats .
turnout for the election , which former catalan leader carles puigdemont said on saturday would be the most important in the region s history , is predicted to reach a record 80 percent .
