chris matthews tried his best to create sympathy for the loser who shot random republicans .
can you believe it ?
msnbc host chris matthews got political in his defense of alexandria shooter james t. hodgkinson : we don t know what sadness was in this guy s life , , , ,blah , blah , blah inequality ! matthews had the unbelievable gaul to bring up sympathy for this guy making an excuse for his heinous act by using class warfare inequality is exactly the twisted thinking that caused this loser to shoot people : hodgkinson was a hater of republicans and president trump .
he volunteered for sen. bernie sanders during the 2016 election .
his deranged view of conservatives lead to the shooting.check out the word salad ramble of matthews trying to somehow justify what would make someone shoot republicans : howard , you and i know each other .
you know what goes into somebody s we can say wacky behavior because they re dead .
we don t know what sadness was in this guy s life what his prospects were .
something that made him mad at the world so he focused on republicans .
he did understand inequality as an issue .
bernie sanders wrote about that in the paper the other day .
there s nothing wrong with the issue .
it s a great issue to fight for if you re a progressive .
but he got it into his head that he was going to get better equality of incomes in this country by killing people .
that s not going to happen .
