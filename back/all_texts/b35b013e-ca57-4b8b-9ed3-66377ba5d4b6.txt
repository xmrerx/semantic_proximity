While speaking at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) commencement ceremony, Matt Damon took a moment to take a quick jab at Donald Trump.
He suggested that maybe we re living in an alternate environment.
One that is simulated and controlled by others, because how else could one explain Trump being the Republican presidential nominee.During his impassioned speech, Damon also told the audience of new graduates: There is more at stake today than in every story that has ever been told.
He told the graduates that it is up to them and those like them to get out there and start tackling the world s many problems.
However, he especially spoke of one problem, and that is what bankers did to millions of Americans during the housing crisis that took place nearly a decade ago.Damon said: Let me say this to the bankers specifically the ones that brought you the biggest heist in history.
Adding: It was theft, and you knew it.
It was fraud, and you knew it.
And you know what else?
We know that you knew it.
Also driving the point home that if we were to pass these bankers on the street, they need to know that we have absolutely no respect for them.Damon also added one very important point: I don t know if justice is coming for you in this life or the next.
But if it does come in this life, her name will be Elizabeth Warren.
Hell yeah it will be, and Warren, of course, being the U.S.
Senator from the great state of Massachusetts where MIT resides.Damon, like many of us, is fed up with how there are rules for bankers, and then somehow different rules for the rest of us.
And he also knows that there are those who are fighting for us, those like Senator Warren, who will try to make sure another financial crisis like the one a decade ago never happens again.Watch a clip from Damon s speech here: Featured image via video screen capture
