Rarely in life do you see people go so perfectly together.
However, Donald Trump and Sarah Palin are made for one another.
They are the peanut butter and jelly of political duos.
Unfortunately for America, though, most of us are allergic to nuts.After Trump decided to throw his hissy fit and not attend the Fox News GOP debate being moderated by Megyn Kelly, because apparently he is allergic to her cooties, Palin decided to take to Facebook (as she does) and lay down her defense of the hotel magnate.She starts the post with, Media: Here, Let Me Define For You a Genuine Game Changer .
You tell em, Sarah!
I m sure they can t wait to read what you have to say.
After all, your opinion is so relevant and paramount to all of politics, or for that matter, THE WORLD.Palin doesn t want Trump to get bullied by the ballyhooed media debate game.
She goes on and on and on, rambling in an indecipherable word salad.
She says things like: Enough is enough; Trump s victory on this issue proves we have a choice.
The courageous GOP frontrunner is speaking for us with his screw it, biased media the people deserve better red line.
Finally.
Trump will now lead others with this empowerment to go around media filters and egos and everything else that s stood between people with a heart to serve and the voters.
As well as: We can go elsewhere to seek truthful information that includes a candidate s voting record, their responsibility in spending other people s money and balancing budgets, their record of negotiating to win, their private sector acumen and personal accomplishments, who they re beholden to, if they ve incentivized more illegal aliens to flood our borders with gifts and freebies making America much less secure oh, and so much more!
Yes, that s all one sentence.
Oh, and what s better than starting a sentence with Like ?
Like, if politics is their profession in perpetuity, which is the antithesis of our Founders vision.
She then goes on to say that she s studied journalism.
Which, I guess, technically she has.
However, she apparently didn t learn much along the way.Palin finishes her post with P.S.
that is just pure gold as she throws shade at Fox News and Megyn Kelly for not kowtowing to Trump s demands: (P.S.
Is it just me, or if a debate host has made himself or herself the principal in a story they re expected to objectively cover for the edification of the public, and they even acknowledge they re the reason the frontrunner chooses not to participate, then isn t it common sense (and courtesy to the voting public) to simply, humbly allow someone else to moderate the debate?
With all due respect, what a strange game at play.
It s at the expense of straight-shooting candidates gunning in competition for the nation s top administrative position, and more importantly, at the expense of Americans who deserve to hear them instead of the cries from a pity-partying press with noses out of joint because someone finally took a stand for common sense and an even playing field.
Sarah Palin really shouldn t be the one to talk about common sense considering she has no sense at all.
This is probably one of her more bizarre posts where she apparently used the talk to text feature on her mobile device.
If there s anyone out there willing to decipher or translate this, have at it.Without further ado, here s the word salad in all its glory: // < !
