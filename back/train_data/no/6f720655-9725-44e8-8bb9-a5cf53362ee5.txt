a spokeswoman declined to give details.mr trump has flitted between being a democrat , republican and independent in recent years and his positions on gun control have shifted also.in 2000 , he wrote that he backed bill clinton s ban on assault weapons and supported a slightly longer waiting period for buying a gun .
he appears to have recanted and no longer supports any new gun controls .

i don t want to do anything to violate the second amendment .
