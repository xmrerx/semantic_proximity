cairo ( reuters ) - the egyptian public prosecutor ordered that a suspected libyan militant and 14 others be held for 15 days pending an investigation of their role in a deadly attack in egypt s western desert last month , state news mena reported on friday .
the interior ministry said on thursday that abdelrahim mohamed al-mesmari , from the libyan city of derna , was captured by egyptian forces following an air raid in response to the attack .
security sources initially said at least 52 policemen were killed when militants attacked a patrol , firing rockets and detonating explosives in a remote part of the desert .
the interior ministry refuted those figures and said 16 were killed .
charges against mesmari will include premeditated murder of police officers , possession of firearms and joining a terrorist organization , mena reported .
a new and little-known group called ansar al-islam claimed responsibility for the october attack , posing a new threat to egyptian security forces , which have been battling an islamic state insurgency in the sinai peninsula since 2013 .
the military last month killed 15 militants in an air raid directed at the group it blamed for the desert attack , according to the interior ministry , which said that all of those killed had been trained in derna .
mesmari escaped the air raid but was later arrested along with 29 egyptians who had been recruited to join the group , according to the interior ministry .
( this version of the story corrects final paragraph to clarify that 29 suspects were arrested later , after the air strike in which 15 were killed )
