abidjan ( reuters ) - ivory coast will cut its armed forces by about 1,000 troops by the end of the year , the government spokesman said on wednesday , in a bid to rationalize a costly and sometimes unruly military .
government spokesman bruno kone told reporters after a cabinet meeting that the 997 soldiers had accepted voluntary retirement this year as part of an initiative to conform to accepted standards , partly by reducing the ratio of non-commissioned officers to lower ranks .
ivory coast does not give details on the size of its military , but security sources estimate there are more than 25,000 troops in a country with a population of about 24 million .
francophone west africa s biggest economy suffered two army mutinies this year that damaged its reputation among investors and forced the government to agree to costly pay rises .
the distribution of ivory coast s army is out of step with the standards accepted in modern armies , kone said .
the former french colony , once known as one of the most stable states in west africa , is still recovering from a brief civil war fought after president alassane ouattara won a disputed election in 2010 but incumbent laurent gbagbo refused to step down .
ouattara has struggled to assert his authority over the army , which was cobbled together in an uneasy merger of the northern new forces rebels who supported him and the professional troops who had fought against him .
the soldiers being taken out of action included three senior officers , 634 non-commissioned officers and 354 regular foot soldiers , kone said .
