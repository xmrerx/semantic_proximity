WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.
Senator Elizabeth Warren said on Tuesday she has “no doubt” the legal fight over who is the proper leader of the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will continue to a U.S. appeals court after a district court judge renders a verdict.
“It’s too important to everyone to let it rest at the district court.
The parties are entitled to take an appeal to the Court of Appeals, and I have no doubt they will,” Warren, who helped establish the CFPB, said in a brief interview with Reuters.
Leandra English, the agency’s deputy director, is suing the Trump administration over who is the proper acting director.
She is seeking a temporary restraining order barring the Trump administration from filling that job, and the case is pending before a U.S. district court in Washington.
