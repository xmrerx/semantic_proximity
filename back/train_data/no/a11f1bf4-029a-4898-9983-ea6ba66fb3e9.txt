did you watch the opening ceremony of the 2016 olympics in rio last night ?
if you did , you probably picked up on some politics slipped into the ceremony .
a snoozer on global warming with tons of propaganda was a buzz kill for even those who ve bought into the scam .
also , a bit of colonialism thrown in overall , with a very small budget , the opening ceremony was great but please , please keep the focus on the athletes !
politicizing the olympics ruins the spirit of the games ! the beginning presented us with huge spiders and then super model giselle walked and walked and walked and then this giant dance number with dancers that look like teletubbies ? then the ceremony went from this wild brazilian dance party to a sad trombone .and global warming propaganda !
ugh ! one of the biggest hits of the night on social media was this guy from tonga john kerry couldn t quite figure out how to take a photo he s pulling a bill clinton with that open mouth look of cluelessness each team was introduced by oops !
the saudis might not like a woman driving finally !
the best part of the night team usa ! michael phelps proudly brought in our flag !
