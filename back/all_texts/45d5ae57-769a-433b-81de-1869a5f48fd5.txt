Neil DeGrasse Tyson has always put science before politics, sometimes frustratingly so.
Right after Trump was elected, Tyson appeared on Stephen Colbert s show, and rather than opine, he chose to try to comfort the host by saying that when you look at earth from outer space, our problems dissolve.
He also said: The politician is representing an electorate.
So, really, if you re against a politician, you re against their voter base, fellow citizens of this country, he said.
So I as an educator, when I want to educate people, I don t say, Don t vote for this person or Vote for that person.
I just simply educate you, so that when the time comes, you can make as informed a decision as you can.
Now, though, Tyson is changing his tone.
The Trump administration is clearly anti-science and it s anti-education.
For Dr. Tyson, it s time to speak out right before protesters across the nation are prepared to march for science.
He posted this video to Facebook on Friday: Science is a fundamental part of the country that we are, Tyson said.
When you have people who don t know much about science standing in denial of it and rising to power, that is a recipe for the complete dismantling of our informed democracy.
While Tyson was clearly talking about Donald Trump, anti-GMO anti-vaxxer (often) liberals were taken to task as well.Tyson didn t deny that science has a place in politics.
Once we agree, for example, that humans are causing climate change, we can debate how to fix the problem, but until we agree that there is a problem, we re screwed.Donald Trump s name wasn t mentioned at all during the four-minute video, and it didn t need to be.
It was clear that Tyson was frustrated (dare I say angry?)
that his career has been so politicized while he tries to stay on the sidelines.
