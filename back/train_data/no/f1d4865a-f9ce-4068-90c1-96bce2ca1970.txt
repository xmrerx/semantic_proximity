any company who puts the safety of myself and my daughters second to political correctness can find a new customer to spend thousands of dollars in their store .
one person demonstrated just how far target department stores will take it s new gender-neutral bathroom policy.andy park , identifying himself as a man , walked into a st. petersburg , florida target store dressed in men s clothing and asked to use the ladies restroom .
sometimes i get uncomfortable in the men s room , was his only excuse.after he was given the go-ahead , park asked what would happen if a woman complained .
he was told they d take care of it .
in other words , his rights were more important than a woman seeking privacy .
