Seth Meyers destroyed Republican presidential wannabe Ted Cruz on Tuesday night for running a campaign of dirty tricks and lies.The Late Night host brutally examined Tricky Ted during the Closer Look segment for the way he has used unethical maneuvers to smear his opponents and fool voters into casting their votes for him.It all started in Iowa when Cruz s campaign put the word out that Ben Carson was dropping out of the race, which may have caused some Carson supporters to switch their allegiance to the Texas Senator.The stolen votes likely helped Cruz capture victory in Iowa but it hurt him in the media, forcing him to request a meeting with Carson in an effort to make amends.
The only problem is that instead of a meeting in a normal setting, the two chose a storage closet instead, which as Meyers pointed out, is pretty ironic considering both men are anti-gay.
That s right, Cruz and Carson met inside of a storage closet.
A moment I m sure both of them, as anti-gay rights advocates immediately regretted when they realized that eventually they would have to come out of the closet, together, Meyers quipped.But Cruz hasn t only played dirty tricks against Ben Carson.
His new target has been Marco Rubio with ploys such as making it appear like Rubio and President Obama are alike or making up stories about how Rubio trashed the Bible in front of Cruz staffers.Meyers also noted that even Republicans have called out Cruz for saying and doing anything to get elected, regaling the audience about how Cruz took a pro-fireworks stance on a local issue because staffers found 60 people who would vote for him if he took up their cause.Here s the video via YouTube.Ever since he won Iowa, Ted Cruz has not fared very well.
New Hampshire chose Donald Trump, and even South Carolina couldn t stomach Ted Cruz as the nominee as evangelical voters abandoned him for the billionaire loudmouth.
It even looks like he could lose in his home state of Texas as newspapers in Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio are endorsing anybody but Cruz as the GOP nominee.
And now Cruz is looking more and more like a desperate man whose dream of world domination is slipping further and further away.
