Really?MARRAKESH, Morocco Bill and Chelsea Clinton are convening foreign leaders here at a lush golf resort set in a palm grove this week to showcase their foundation s charitable work.
But the conference also highlights new controversies engulfing the Clinton family s vast philanthropic enterprises as Hillary Rodham Clinton begins her presidential campaign.A liberal human rights organization and several Republican lawmakers, for instance, are criticizing the Bill, Hillary and Chelsea Clinton Foundation for accepting donations from a Moroccan government-owned mining company, whose seven-figure sponsorship of this week s gathering came amid growing scrutiny of foreign-government donations.Meanwhile, some blue-chip companies that have long provided large donations to the Clinton Foundation are pulling back or reassessing their support.An Exxon Mobil spokesman said this week that the company has decided not to be involved in the Clinton Global Initiative this year.
The oil company said its decision was unrelated to recent scrutiny of the foundation, but this is the first year it has not been a sponsor since 2009.
Other sponsors, including Monsanto, are reevaluating their partnerships.Via: WaPo
