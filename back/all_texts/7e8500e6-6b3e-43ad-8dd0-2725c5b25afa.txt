Civil political discourse took a beating in West Virginia this weekend when a Democratic senator profanely proclaimed that he was going to vote the way he wanted and didn t give a s t if it cost him his seat.
I don t give a s t, you understand?
I just don t give a s t, Sen. Joe Manchin told the Charleston Gazette-Mail on Sunday, saying he wasn t going to toe his party s line on every issue.
Don t care if I get elected, don t care if I get defeated, how about that.
If they think because I m up for election, that I can be wrangled into voting for s t that I don t like and can t explain, they re all crazy, he continued.
I m not scared of an election, let s put it that way.
Elections do not bother me or scare me, he said.
I m going to continue to do the same thing I ve always done, extremely independent.
