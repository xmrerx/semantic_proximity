Esteemed Democratic Attorney Alan Dershowitz UNLOADED on left-wing sensation Maxine Waters on FOX and Friends Sunday.
Dershowitz responded to Waters calling him a racist on MSNBC:Alan Dershowitz: Well, she doesn t know what she s talking about.
First of all, I wasn t talking about the grand jury I was talking about the petit jury.
Grand jury doesn t matter.
Grand jury will indict a ham sandwich.
But if there were to be an indictment it would matter greatly where the trial was.
Maxine Waters should know better and does know better If I d have said race didn t matter she would have called me a racist.
She throws around the term so loosely and so inappropriately and it weakens her credibility by calling everybody a racist.
When she calls real racists racists, nobody is going to believe her Race matters.
Maxine Waters ought to know that and Maxine Waters ought to be ashamed of herself.
