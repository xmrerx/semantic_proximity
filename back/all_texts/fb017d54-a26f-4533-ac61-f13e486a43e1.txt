Many of us have been ready to impeach Donald Trump since election night.
However, the downside to this scenario was the prospect of Vice President Mike Pence taking his place.
Well, thanks to the testimony of former FBI Director James Comey, we may not have to worry about ending up with President Pence when we finally manage to get rid of Trump.On Thursday, Comey testified about how Trump had pressured him to drop his investigation into Mike Flynn s shady Russian ties and tried to back him into a loyalty pledge.
Buried in his testimony, which contained one bombshell after another, was this little tidbit: Pence, who was the head of Trump s transition team, knew damn well that Flynn was compromised by not one but two foreign governments and he allowed him to be named National Security Adviser anyway.
In a moment that went largely unnoticed, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) asked Comey if Pence was aware of Flynn s connections to Russia.
The former head of the FBI said that yes, Pence knew.
He apparently just didn t care.
My understanding is that he was, Comey replied, adding that he got this information from then acting Attorney General Sally Yates, who also ended up fired after angering Trump.This statement may become very important in coming months as we move closer and closer towards impeaching Trump.
If Pence was in on all of this then he is just as dirty as Trump and the rest of his crooked cronies.
If there was anybody who still thought that maybe Pence is just too oblivious to what s going on around him to notice all the shady sh*t, Comey just cleared that up with his testimony.
Pence knew.
He knew and still allowed Flynn to have access to our country s most sensitive information.
And now, the American people know too.Watch Comey shoot down Pence s hopes of ever becoming president here: Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
