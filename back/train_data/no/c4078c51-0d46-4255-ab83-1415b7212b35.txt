hillary clinton has turned down repeated requests by barack obama to join him in a nationwide political movement that he plans to lead against the presidency of donald trump .
hillary s received two phone calls from obama and several from valerie [ jarrett ] , said a source familiar with hillary s conversations with the outgoing president and his chief political adviser .
they ve been urging hillary to get on board their anti-trump campaign .
they invited her to a post-inaugural day gathering at the mansion the obamas have rented in d.c. , where they re going to lay the groundwork for the offensive against trump , the source added .
among those on the invitation list : donna brazile , nancy pelosi , and james carville .
but hillary told obama and valerie that she couldn t work it into her schedule .
according to the source , hillary doesn t have much faith in obama s leadership of an anti-trump crusade .
obama s proved time and again that he thinks only of himself , not of his fellow democrats , said the source .
he s been a lousy leader of the democratic party and , after eight years in the white house , he s left the party in shambles .
there s yet another reason hillary doesn t want to be associated with an obama-led movement against trump , the source added .
trump has indicated he s willing to let bygones be bygones as far as hillary s email scandal and her pay-to-play involvement with the clinton foundation .
she doesn t see any upside to pissing off donald as he moves into the white house .
