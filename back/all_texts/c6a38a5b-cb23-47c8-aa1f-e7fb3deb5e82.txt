21st Century Wire says It s been almost two years since the cloud storage provider Dropbox appointed former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to its board.
A move Edward Snowden, at the time, called hostile for data privacy.
Snowden s comments on the matter first appeared in a video interview conducted by the Guardian, and were published in a July 17, 2014 article: Dropbox is a targeted you know wannabe PRISM partner, he told the Guardian.
They just put Condoleezza Rice on their board who is probably the most anti-privacy official you can imagine.
She s one of the ones who oversaw Stellar Wind and thought it was a great idea.
So they re very hostile to privacy.
PRISM: The NSA s data collection surveillance program that every citizen should know about.
PRISM and Stellar Wind were both approved and implemented during President George W. Bush s administration.

In layman s terms, this means that cloud storage providers NOT hostile to data privacy don t just encrypt your data, but actually host your data without their ability to access it ever.
They have zero knowledge of the contents of your data.
It s a big distinction, but one easily missed by a public inundated with confusing doublespeak on data privacy.Snowden adds that s the only way they can prove to the customers that they can be trusted with their information, and makes specific reference to one cloud company, SpiderOak, as a provider of zero knowledge systems.
