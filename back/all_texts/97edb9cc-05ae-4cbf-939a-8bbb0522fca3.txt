Conservatives love to tell us that Donald Trump speaks his mind and always tells the truth despite a mountain of evidence against the latter point, so when he told us he recorded his conversations with former FBI Director James Comey it s perfectly reasonable for us to take him at his word.Shortly after he fired Comey for requesting additional resources for the investigation into the Trump administration s collusion with Russia, Trump threatened to release the recordings in an effort to intimidate a witness recordings whose existence would be just the latest in a long history of Trump secretly recording conversations.James Comey better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017Apparently, The Donald has done some reading on Richard Nixon, because he seems to have destroyed the tapes he made.
After Comey said Lordy, I hope there are tapes (the one time in history Lordy has sounded so badass), Trump realized that his plan wasn t quite working out so well so he now claims that they never existed.
With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea whether there are tapes or recordings of my conversations with James Comey, but I did not make, and do not have, any such recordings, Trump tweeted on Thursday.With all of the recently reported electronic surveillance, intercepts, unmasking and illegal leaking of information, I have no idea Donald J.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2017Either Trump is lying about making the recordings or he is lying about them not existing .or he destroyed them.
That final option, given Trump s history, is the one that likely occurred.Naturally, the American people once again proved that they are not as stupid as Trump thinks they are:WHAT THE FUCK, TRUMP?

#TrumpFearsPressY MJ (@TheMagsterBarks) June 22, 2017Notice he didn t say he that he didn t know about them or listen to them Bens The Best (@bens_the_best) June 22, 2017Translation I reviewed tapes with my lawyer and they don t support my point so all tapes and equipment have been destroyed.
Brief Truth (@TheBriefTruth) June 22, 2017HE made/had no tapes.
This, once again is was advised by his lawyers to shield him if and when they ever do surface proving Comey right TheUnsilentMAJORITY (@The_UnSilent_) June 22, 2017Does this mean that there really aren t tapes, or that there ARE tapes and you don t want to release them because the confirm Comey s story?
Dave Branson (@popsiclemud) June 22, 2017Here s a disturbing, but likely scenario: There were tapes.
And their existence just created problems Trump can t handle.Featured image via screengrab/Getty Images
