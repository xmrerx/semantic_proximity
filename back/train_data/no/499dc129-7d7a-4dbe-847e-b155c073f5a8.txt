taipei ( reuters ) - taiwan has suspended refined oil and lng exports to north korea , as well as clothing and textile imports , to comply with united nations resolutions , a largely symbolic move by the island to show it is a responsible member of the international community .
self-ruled taiwan is not a member of the united nations , due to beijing s position that it is simply a chinese province and so not able to have its own official diplomatic ties with anyone .
but proudly democratic taiwan likes to show that it follows international norms , despite its lack of u.n. membership .
on sept. 11 , the united nations security council unanimously stepped up sanctions against north korea over its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on sept. 3 , imposing a ban on the isolated nation s textile exports and capping imports of crude oil .
to complement the un measures , taiwan said it would suspend liquefied natural gas , crude oil , and refined oil product exports to north korea with effect from tuesday , the economics ministry said in a statement .
taiwan will suspend clothing and related textile good imports from north korea , it added , adding that written pacts made before sept. 11 would prevail for imports until dec. 10 , so long as a special permit is obtained from the trade office .
taiwan s measure is aimed at denouncing north korea s recent successive nuclear tests and actions that jeopardize regional security , the economics ministry said in a statement .
taiwan and north korea have only a minuscule trading relationship .
taiwan says its exports to north korea in the first six months of this year were worth just $ 36,575 , an annual decrease of more than 90 percent .
last week , north korea fired a missile that flew over japan s northern hokkaido region far out into the pacific ocean , shortly after its biggest nuclear test this month .
