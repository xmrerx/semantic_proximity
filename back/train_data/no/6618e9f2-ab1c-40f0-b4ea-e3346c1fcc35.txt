so much for trying to come together like the left always says they think we should do it was a brave gesture but not a smart one for caleb slater to try and attend a black lives matter vigil for the young woman who was killed at the riot on saturday in charlottesville .the president of a college republicans chapter said he was attacked and choked by hard-left activists as he attended a vigil for the woman killed saturday at the charlottesville unite the right demonstration.ithaca college student caleb slater wrote in a statement that masked members of antifa assaulted him at a syracuse event held on sunday in memory of heather heyer , who died when a driver plowed into counter-protesters in virginia.slater wrote that he wore a young america s foundation ( yaf ) hat to the vigil as a symbol of peace , and he hoped showing up to the left-wing black lives matter program as an identifiable conservative would demonstrate that conservatives condemn the actions of the alt-right just as much as anyone else in our culture .
