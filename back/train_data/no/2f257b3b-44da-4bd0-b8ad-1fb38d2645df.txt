mexico city ( reuters ) - mexican senate committees on wednesday approved a controversial security bill that human rights groups say risks granting excessive power to the armed forces in their already checkered role in combating organized crime in the country .
the bill , which enjoys some cross-party support between conservatives and centrists , will now pass to the floor of the upper house of congress for discussion and possible approval late on wednesday or on thursday morning .
the law of internal security aims to regulate the armed forces role in combating drug cartels , a conflict which has claimed well over 100,000 lives in the last decade .
senate committees approved the bill on wednesday , a senate spokesman said .
lawmakers who support the bill say it will set out clear rules that limit the use of soldiers to fight crime .
rights groups have strongly attacked the bill , saying it prioritizes the military s role in fighting the gangs over improving the police , and could open the door to greater abuses and impunity by the armed forces .
the military has already been embroiled in multiple human rights scandals including extrajudicial killings of gang members and the disappearance of 43 students near one of its bases in 2014 .
the united nations , amnesty international and mexican human rights organizations have all criticized the bill .
this law should not be approved quickly , it puts liberties at risk by giving more power to the armed forces without designing controls and counterweights , said santiago aguirre from the miguel agustin pro center for human rights .
last week , president enrique pena nieto asked lawmakers to include civil society s views in their discussion of the bill , which sparked attempts by protesters to bar access to the upper house of congress when it reached the senate .
