A voice of reason speaks out!
Mike Huckabee told Fox News host Judge Jeanine Pirro that he has a special repulsion for white supremacists and that Trump did the right thing in his statements about Charlottesville.
It s part because I m white, he elaborated.
It s part because I have seen this evil and hateful attitude that elevates some people above others.
And as a believing Christian, I m especially offended because anybody who believes The Bible, especially the gospels, will have to accept that there is no way that God is a respecter of persons- as scripture makes clear, He doesn t love some people more than others because of their color, because of their affiliation, even with Him.
He mentioned that because he believe in the gospels that every person has equal worth, that makes him pro-life.Pirro asked Huckabee if the outrage over the president s remarks are just Trump haters who will look for any reason to dump on him.
Well it seems like a lot of them are, I don t know what they expect the president to do, Huckabee responded.
At the time that he made the comment, the driver of the car had not even been identified.
That s exactly right!
Pirro exclaimed.
And so what is he supposed to say?
Huckabee continued.
Is he supposed to do what Barack Obama used to do and jump to conclusion and make a decision like he did in Ferguson.
Missouri, which turned out to be totally untrue?
The president has to be careful in taking steps.
I thought what he condemned was what we all could immediately condemn and that was the violence, the car some coward in a car drove into innocent people to try and kill them.
And he condemned that!
What else is he supposed to do at that point?
Amen!Via: Mediate
