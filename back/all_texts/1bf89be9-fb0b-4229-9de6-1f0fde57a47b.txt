It s starting to look like robots have taken over the White House all ready, Chong tweeted Friday.

Currently, the list of Trump associates stands at, well, this graphic from the Washington Post helps some:Over the weekend, Trump associate Roget Stone bragged about having a back channel to Wikileaks Julian Assange.
Though Stone quickly deleted the tweet, this raises some serious questions about the links between the Trump campaign and Russian propaganda outlet Wikileaks, who released hacked documents all through the campaign that were intended to help The Donald defeat Hillary Clinton.
Wikileaks, of course, recently released information meant to discredit the CIA a group Trump has been attacking.
This was heralded by Russian state media a half-hour before Wikileaks dropped the documents:RT tweeted 30 minutes before the documents were leaked.RT at 8:09 amWikileaks at 8:38am @MaxineWaters @maddow #TrumpRussia ????
