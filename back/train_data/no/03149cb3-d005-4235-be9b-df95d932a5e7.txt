paul ryan nervously giggled during the republican announcement of the budget and obamacare replacement this morning .
it s interesting to watch all of the republicans in the video below skip over the elephant in the room by redirecting everyone to other items they consider to be positive .
ryan emphasized the funding for border patrol but skipped right over the border wall funding.why does the left bother with resistance theatrics when the republican congress funds their entire wish list anyway ? is funding the nih ( national institutes for health ) with 2 billion dollars a good thing ?
that bloated and very wasteful item needs to be looked at more closely .
remember shrimp on a treadmill ?
drunk monkeys ?
yes , this is the organization that gives out your tax dollars to people to do crazy experiments that are honestly wasteful.the other things like funding sanctuary cities ?
is anyone else puzzled by this ? why are the republicans constantly trying to appease the democrats ? please skip to the 5:15 mark in the video : this is a loser spending bill for the american people !
