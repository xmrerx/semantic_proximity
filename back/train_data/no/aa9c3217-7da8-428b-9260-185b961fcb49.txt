lille , france ( reuters ) - five migrants were wounded on saturday when shots were fired during a brawl in the northern french port of calais , the local prefect s office said .
gunshots were exchanged between groups of afghans in the late afternoon , it said .
a police source said the incident occurred during what was probably a dispute between migrant smugglers .
the shots were fired near the local secours catholique charity on the outskirts of calais .
three migrants were being treated in a calais hospital and a fourth , who was more seriously wounded , had been transferred to a hospital in lille .
a fifth was treated at the scene .
calais is a magnet for migrants aiming to reach britain , a short distance across the channel .
last year , authorities cleared the makeshift jungle camp in calais , but people hoping to get into britain by crossing the channel in trains or ferries are steadily returning .
authorities estimate at 500 and associations at 700 the number of migrants from ethiopia , eritrea and afghanistan still in calais .
