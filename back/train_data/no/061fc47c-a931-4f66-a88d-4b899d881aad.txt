gosh , i wonder why the clinton foundation has come under fire in the past for foreign donations : a previous donor , the kingdom of saudi arabia , has given between $ 10 million and $ 25 million since the foundation was created in 1999.this is all a question of ethics both for the donations to possibly curry favor with clinton and the omission of lots and lots of money .the clinton foundation failed to report $ 20 million in donations from governments to the internal revenue service , newly refiled tax returns show.reuters reported that the foundation disclosed the $ 20 million it received from governments , most of them foreign , between 2010 and 2013 when it and a spin-off organization refiled tax returns from six years to fix errors.the bill , hillary , & chelsea clinton foundation did not previously separate out its donations from governments on old tax returns as is mandated by the irs.the foundation refiled tax returns from 2010 , 2011 , 2012 , and 2013 and a charity spun off from the foundation , the clinton health access initiative , refiled its own returns from 2012 and 2013 after both were found to have made errors reporting funds from foreign governments .
the revelations about inaccuracies came just as hillary clinton , a democratic candidate for president , endured scrutiny for the millions of dollars that her family foundation has received from foreign governments.via : wfb
