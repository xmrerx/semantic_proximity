berlin ( reuters ) - german police presented on tuesday diaries , pairs of glasses and other items belonging to late beatle john lennon that were stolen from his widow yoko ono in 2006 and eventually ended up in berlin .
police arrested a man in berlin on monday suspected of receiving the 86 stolen items , which include lennon s last diary that ended on the day he was shot and killed in new york on dec. 8 , 1980 .
this day contains the entry that on that morning john lennon and yoko ono had an appointment with annie leibovitz to take a photo which i think is world famous , berlin prosecutor michael von hagen told a news conference .
the leibovitz portrait of a naked lennon curled up around ono on their bed ran on the january 1981 cover of rolling stone magazine .
hagen rejected suggestions that ono might have lent or given away the objects : the diaries especially ... were also treated by yoko ono as something sacred .
and the idea that she would have given away three original diaries , especially the one that ends on the very day lennon died , can be completely ruled out .
carsten pfohl , head of property crime for berlin police , said investigators had found one of the pairs of glasses and a receipt in lennon s name hidden in the trunk of the car of the accused on monday .
police suspect that the items were stolen by ono s former driver and then taken to turkey and were only brought to berlin in 2013 or 2014 .
another suspect lives in turkey , they said .
the berlin police was alerted after they were found by the administrator for a bankrupt auction house , which had previously valued the objects at 3.1 million euros ( $ 3.64 million ) .
( $ 1 = 0.8519 euros )
