( reuters ) - atlantic city mayor don guardian on thursday called an emergency city council meeting next week to discuss whether the distressed new jersey gambling hub should file for municipal bankruptcy .
governor chris christie ’ s veto on tuesday of legislation that aimed to stabilize the city ’ s tax base and boost its cash flow left the city with “ no other option but to explore bankruptcy , ” guardian said in a statement .
state lawmakers have been pushing for a full takeover of city operations , saying local officials have not done enough to cut costs .
only city officials can file for bankruptcy , but the state , which already oversees the city ’ s finances , must ultimately approve it .
