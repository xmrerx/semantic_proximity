If it weren t for the whiney phrase, political correctness, which is really just another phrase for being polite, Donald Trump would likely have never invaded the White House.
It seems that over the last 50 or so years, black people have gotten much too uppity, so when Netflix announced the release of a series called Dear White People, which isn t supposed to be exactly flattering to white people and especially racist white people, they threw a fit and are canceling their Netflix memberships.Because they can be as cruel as they want toward People of Color, but if the People of Color call them on it, well, that s out of bounds.
So, White Supremacists, taking a cue from their Supreme Orange Leader, came up with a protest Twitter hashtag, #NoNetflix.Netflix announced a new anti-white show (Dear White People) that promotes white genocide.I cancelled my account, do the same.

This trailer that talks about people dressing up in black face, which I thought we agreed a long time ago was beyond offensive.Take a stroll through those comments and you ll be hating white people too.The series is based on a movie of the same name and if white people watched it with open minds, they would know that no one came across as anything more than flawed human, although deservedly, white people were portrayed as much less aware.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images
