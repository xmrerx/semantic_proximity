berlin ( reuters ) - brexit campaigner nigel farage received a standing ovation at a pre-election rally of the anti-immigration alternative for germany ( afd ) in berlin on friday , where he was presented as a model of what a right-wing eurosceptic politician can achieve .
far-right parties have suffered setbacks this year at elections in france and the netherlands , but the afd is set to enter germany s national parliament for the first time in the sept. 24 parliamentary vote .
farage , a leading voice in the victorious movement last year for britain to leave the european union , bemoaned the lack of discussion of brexit in the german campaign .
( i m trying ) to get a proper debate going in the biggest , richest and most important , powerful country in europe about not just the shape of brexit but perhaps even the shape of the european project to come , farage told reporters .
he said chancellor angela merkel and her social democrat ( spd ) challenger martin schulz had refused to discuss brexit as it was a huge embarrassment for the european dream that both of them have had .
polls put the afd , which wants to put an end to euro zone bailouts and call a referendum on germany s eu membership , on up to 11 percent support .
that could make it the largest opposition party if merkel wins , as expected , and renews her grand coalition with the spd .
beatrix von storch , the afd s 46-year-old deputy chairwoman , said her party took hope from farage , who was a founding member of the eurosceptic uk independence party in 1993 .
nigel farage showed the impossible is possible if you just believe in it and fight this fight - he did that for more than two decades and that makes him a role model for us , she said .
farage said he thought merkel would probably be better for brexit as she was more likely to agree to a free trade deal between britain and the eu , while schulz , previously president of the european parliament , was a pro-eu fanatic .
