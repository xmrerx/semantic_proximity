ami horowitz went to a new york conference on white privilege and asked the attendees to explain their whiteness .
somebody told him , we re all racist .
but he then went to a black neighborhood in harlem to ask people there if they were consumed with the same concern over white privilege .
they all felt that to be so consumed would be to admit that they couldn t accomplish their own dreams and goals , and they definitely don t think that is the case.so why are the white people so obsessed with white privilege ?
