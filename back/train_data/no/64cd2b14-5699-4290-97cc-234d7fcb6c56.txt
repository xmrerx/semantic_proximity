washington ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump has developed a friendly relationship with philippine president rodrigo duterte , a senior administration official said on tuesday , despite duterte s often profanity-laden tirades against the united states .
i think there s a warm rapport there and he s very much looking forward to his first in-person meeting with president duterte , the u.s. official told reporters during a background briefing on trump s nov. 3-14 trip to asia .
the two leaders have become friendly during telephone conversations and exchanges of letters , the official said .
trump will travel to asia amid rising tensions over north korea s nuclear and missile programs .
he will be in manila on the last leg of his trip , which includes visits to japan , south korea , china , and vietnam , to attend the asean leaders summit .
duterte has attacked the united states verbally , chiding washington for treating the philippines like a dog , despite the two nations longstanding relationship .
the philippines leader announced his separation from the united states during a visit to beijing a year ago , declaring he had realigned with china as the two agreed to resolve a south china sea dispute through talks .
duterte is accused by international human rights groups of supporting a campaign of extrajudicial killings of drug suspects in the philippines , which his government denies .
the philippine leader was infuriated by expressions of concern by members of former president barack obama s administration about extrajudicial killings in the philippines .
but trump , in a phone call to duterte in may , praised the philippine leader for doing an unbelievable job on the drug problem despite human rights groups condemnation of duterte s drug crackdown , in which thousands of people have been killed .
