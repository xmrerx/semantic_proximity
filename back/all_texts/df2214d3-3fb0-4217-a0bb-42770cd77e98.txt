Uh oh, folks: that evil FAKE NEWS is after Donald Trump again, this time distorting his perfectly awesome visit with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
Sure, Trump ignored Merkel when she asked him if he wanted to shake hands a clear example of his lack of respect for women and of course he accused a German reporter of FAKE NEWS when he was asked about his ridiculous lie that President Obama tapped his wires at Trump Tower but Trump says the visit went great no matter what the FAKE NEWS says.
Despite what you have heard from the FAKE NEWS, I had a GREAT meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Trump tweeted Saturday morning.
Nevertheless, Germany owes vast sums of money to NATO & the United States must be paid more for the powerful, and very expensive, defense it provides to Germany!

Austin Braun (@AustinOnSocial) March 18, 2017@realDonaldTrump When you act like an ass on TV, the news media has nothing to do with Americans' perception of your embarrassing meeting.

You refused to shake her hand.
We SAW IT.
ON VIDEO.
You acted like a petulant child instead of a statesman.
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) March 18, 2017If there was any doubt before this meeting with Merkel, there isn t anymore: Our President* is nothing but a petulant child one who cares nothing about facts, our reputation, or American citizens in general.Featued image via Twitter
