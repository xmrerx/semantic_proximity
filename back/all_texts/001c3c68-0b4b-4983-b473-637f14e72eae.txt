Earlier on Tuesday, Donald Trump decided to accept a Purple Heart from a supporter who had earned it for his service.
It was a thoughtful gift, but one Trump should have refused to accept considering it is a medal earned by being greatly injured or dying in the line of duty serving the nation, and given in the name of the president.To top it all off, Trump said he always wanted one, and this way is much easier.
No one wants a Purple Heart.
No one.
It s something those in the military actually try to avoid earning, but when it is earned, it is greatly earned and comes with the respect of a grateful nation for the sacrifice given.One person who actually did serve their nation, and actually earned a Purple Heart, is none other than Rep. Tammy Duckworth (D-IL).
She lost both of her legs and damaged her right arm while serving.
A sacrifice Trump will never know anything about considering he got five deferments from serving in our military during a time of war.After hearing Trump s remarks surrounding the Purple Heart, Duckworth tweeted out: Donald Trump, this is how one usually looks when you are awarded the Purple Heart.
Nothing easy about it.
