More than three weeks later, that release has yet to take place.Clinton s more fervent opponents have hoped for weeks that the promised document dump would be an October surprise damaging and revelatory emails or the like and inflict a mortal wound on her campaign.
There s no evidence however that such damaging information even exists.It was only this summer that Assange s group leaked thousands of embarrassing emails from the Democratic National Committee which showed their disdain for Bernie Sanders insurgent campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination.
The uproar over the disclosures forced DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman-Schultz to resign in disgrace on the eve of the Democratic National Convention.DEATH THREATS?Assange and his supporters have long claimed that his personal safety is at risk due to the danger he (supposedly) represents to Clinton s presidential ambitions.
In August, liberal commentator Bob Beckel suggested in a TV appearance that Assange be murdered, proclaiming that someone should shoot the son of a bitch!
Assange himself has also recently hinted publicly that low-level DNC staffer Seth Rich, who was murdered this summer in Washington DC, had been the source for Wikileaks document dump on the DNC.
And that Rich s alleged role in the leaks was linked to his death.Via: Heat Street
