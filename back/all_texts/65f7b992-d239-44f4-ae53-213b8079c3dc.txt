WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Computer security records turned over to the FBI from an email server Hillary Clinton used while she was U.S. secretary of state show no evidence of foreign hacking, the New York Times reported on Thursday, citing unnamed people close to a federal investigation into her emails.
The security logs handed over by a former aide to Clinton, the Democratic front-runner in the Nov. 8 presidential election, back up her stance that her use of a personal email account did not risk exposing U.S. secrets to hackers or foreign governments, the Times said.
