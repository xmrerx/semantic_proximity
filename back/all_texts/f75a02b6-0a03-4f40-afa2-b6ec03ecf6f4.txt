It s no secret that conservatives believe with all of their hearts that serious, life-threatening issues that plague women every day of their lives aren t very important.
So when Fox Business host John Stossel made a mockery of policies that have been put in place prevent rapes on college campuses over the weekend, he was shocked to find out that many people don t agree with his misogynistic jokes.The weekend segment was called Campus Rape Hysteria, and Stossel repeatedly argued throughout the program that there wasn t an epidemic and that any evidence related to sexual assault on campuses was debatable.
Stossel also laughed at campus initiatives that require men to have consent from a woman before and throughout a sexual experience.
Stossel said: Colleges passed rules and some states passed laws that are supposed to protect women by defining the consent that s needed before a couple can have sex.
California s law says consent must be ongoing throughout a sexual activity.
That means, I guess, a woman must repeatedly say, Yes, please proceed.
I doubt many college students do that but it is the law!
To get his point across and show just how crazy this could get, Stossel and his friends at Fox created a check-list-type form that mocked the consent process except it wasn t received as well as he thought it would be.Fox News screenshotWhen Stossel showed his form to college students, most of them actually took the subject seriously leaving the Fox host visibly disappointed that America s youth actually had morals and respect for women.
He said: The kids must laugh at it.
I can t believe anybody having sex gets repeated consent.
Yet many students voiced the exact opposite.
One male student said on the show, Something needs to be done.
I m not sure this is the right way, but I think women need more protection.
