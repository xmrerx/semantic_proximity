washington ( reuters ) - u.s. attorney general loretta lynch asked not to be considered as a nominee to fill the supreme court vacancy created by the death of justice antonin scalia last month , the justice department said on tuesday .
lynch , 56 , was rumored to be under consideration by democratic president barack obama .
she is held in high regard within the administration , received bipartisan support for her nomination as attorney general and would be the first black woman to serve on the supreme court .
“ given the urgent issues before the department of justice , she asked not to be considered for the position , ” the department said in a statement .
in recent weeks , other names have emerged on obama ’ s short list , including sri srinivasan , jane kelly and paul watford , all of whom serve as federal appeals court judges .
in an interview with fox news last week , lynch responded to speculation she was being vetted for the job .
“ i haven ’ t had those conversations .
i ’ m very happy with my job , ” lynch said .
justice department spokeswoman melanie newman said that while lynch was deeply grateful for the support of those who suggested her as a high court nominee , “ she is honored to serve as attorney general , and she is fully committed to carrying out the work of the department of justice for the remainder of her term. ” the process of filling the spot that was held by scalia , one of the court ’ s most conservative justices , has ignited a partisan battle in washington .
republicans who control the u.s. senate do not want to see the court shift ideologically to the left and have said they will not hold a vote on obama ’ s nominee .
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said the next supreme court justice should be chosen by the winner of the nov. 8 presidential election .
