With the rise of Donald Trump, America s racists are coming out of the woodwork in droves.
They are also becoming increasingly violent.
Yet another incident of racist violence comes to us from Iowa City, Iowa, where a man wearing a surgical mask attacked a black man.
Authorities were called to the scene due to a fight, only to find out it was a racist attack.The attacker, Andy Benavidez, 47, told police that the attack was racially motivated.
Benavidez hurled racist epithets at his victim, all the while physically assaulting him.
The most bizarre part of all was, of course, the surgical mask, and the suspect informed police that the reason for his wearing it was so that he wouldn t be contaminated by black people germs.Benavidez is facing assault charges for his crime, and thanks to the fact that he has admitted that he did it because he is a flaming racist, a hate crime charge will be attached as well.This sort of thing will only get worse as people are given cause to spew their hatred and lash out in violence.
It will only be a matter of time before this is a regular and even expected occurrence.Watch a local news report on the attack below:Featured image via video screen capture from CBS 2 Iowa
