ankara ( reuters ) - the mayor of ankara said on monday he will step down this week , the fifth mayor from the ruling party to quit in recent weeks in the face of demands for a purge of local politics by president tayyip erdogan .
melih gokcek , a staunch erdogan loyalist who has been mayor of ankara for 23 years and won five consecutive elections , said on twitter on monday that he would leave office on saturday , after meeting with erdogan at the presidential palace .
four other mayors from the ruling party have already stepped down in recent weeks , including istanbul s mayor kadir topbas , following demands that they resign from erdogan , who says he is seeking a renewal of his ruling ak party .
three mayors from our party have handed in their resignations so far , and there are three more .
i believe they will hand theirs in as soon as possible , erdogan told a news conference in ankara last week before gokcek and one other mayor resigned .
erdogan decision to target the mayors follows his narrow victory in a referendum to grant himself sweeping powers last year , which was more popular with rural than urban voters .
seventeen of the country s 30 largest cities voted against it .
since then , erdogan has spoken of the need for renewal in local government and the ruling ak party , citing signs of metal fatigue within administrations .
gokcek , generally regarded as a staunch erdogan loyalist , is well known in turkey for tweets in which he has engaged in spats with journalists and with other senior members of the akp .
in february he suggested the u.s.-based cleric blamed by erdogan for a failed coup last year might be plotting an earthquake , with the help of foreign powers .
