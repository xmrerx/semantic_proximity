Well, it s official: both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have chosen their vice presidential picks, and it s time to move forward towards November.
Trump picked a guy who might even fall asleep to his own voice and is a known woman-hating homophobe, better known as Mike Pence, and Hillary picked a liberal guy with a tremendous progressive record who is fluent in Spanish Tim Kaine.Noticing the glaring contrast between the Clinton and Trump campaigns was none other than political analyst Ana Navarro.
She pointed out the obvious differences in reaching out the Latino community from either campaign.Navarro said on Twitter: Hispanic Outreach: Hillary Clinton has Spanish-speaking do-gooder who was a missionary in Honduras; Trump has Joe Arpaio and a taco bowl.

Funny, and yet, kind of sad.Joe Arpaio, who of course is notoriously known for being the racist Sheriff from Arizona, and the infamous taco bowl is in reference to Trump s attempt to reach out to the Hispanic community on Cinco de Mayo.Whoever is going to win this election is going to need the Hispanic vote, and as far as it looks right now, Hillary Clinton is going to wipe the floor with Trump.
After all, Trump refers to Mexicans as rapists and murderers, and that didn t really go over too well.
Guess we ll just have to wait and see.Featured image via video screen capture
