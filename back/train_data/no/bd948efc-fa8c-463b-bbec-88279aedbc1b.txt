london ( reuters ) - british police on monday said they had arrested a man who tried to climb a wall at queen elizabeth s buckingham palace home in central london , but said that the incident was not terrorism-related .
the 24-year-old man was arrested on suspicion of trespass on sunday evening , three minutes after he stepped over a low outer perimeter fence near the palace , the metropolitan police said .
the man was not found in possession of any offensive weapons and the incident is not being treated as terrorist related , police said in a statement .
he has been released on conditional bail and has undergone a mental health assessment .
british police are on high alert after five attacks blamed on terrorism this year .
in august , a man wielding a sword outside the palace was charged under terrorism laws .
three police officers suffered minor injuries detaining him .
a number of people have tried to get into the palace grounds in recent years .
a woman was arrested in october for attempting to scale the gates of the palace .
in may 2016 , a man with a conviction for murder climbed over the wall and walked for about 10 minutes around the grounds of the palace before being arrested .
he was jailed for four months .
four years ago , a man armed with a knife tried to enter through a gate and was later jailed for 16 months .
a month earlier , two men were arrested following a break-in at the palace .
one of the biggest security breaches at buckingham palace happened in 1982 when an intruder , michael fagan , climbed a wall and wandered into a room where the queen was in bed .
