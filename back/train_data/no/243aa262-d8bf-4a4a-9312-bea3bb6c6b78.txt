nairobi ( reuters ) - legislators from kenya s ruling party and opposition exchanged blows on thursday , after polls closed in a controversial repeat presidential election .
live national television showed mps tumbling into a hedge at nairobi s panafric hotel when the two sides clashed after attempting to hold near-simultaneous news conferences at the same venue .
one lawmaker shouted profanities on camera , prompting nervous giggles from anchors .
the fistfight reflected larger tensions within the country , that saw polling stations in some counties unable to open after opposition leader raila odinga called for a boycott of the oct. 26 poll , saying it would not be free and fair .
odinga s withdrawal left president uhuru kenyatta as the only serious contender for the presidency , although six other candidates were also on the ballot .
kenyatta won a presidential poll on aug. 8 that was later nullified by the supreme court on procedural grounds .
