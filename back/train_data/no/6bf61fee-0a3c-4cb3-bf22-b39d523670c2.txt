matt lauer , of the failing today show had an exclusive interview with the president .
george w. bush refused to criticize barack obama s presidency , but the media is hoping that after his brother jeb took a brutal beating in the primary s that his position on not trashing a sitting president may have changed .
true to form , the pathetic matt lauer attempts to blame the division in our nation , that will surely be barack obama s legacy , on president donald trump .
lauer starts the interview out in a whiny voice , as he attempts to get the former president bush to take the media s side against trump : but there s enormous division in the country right now , and although the president says he hopes to unify the country , have you in the first month seen him do or say anything that in your opinion , would be an attempt to heal the wounds of the election ?
things took an unexpected turn when instead of agreeing with lauer , george w. bush reminds him of the role the press has played in helping obama to divide our nation , and more specifically , how irrelevant matt lauer has become .
