mexico city ( reuters ) - fourteen people were shot dead on tuesday night at a drug rehabilitation center in northern mexico as part of a territory fight between two criminal gangs , a spokesman for the state attorney general s office said .
the shooting took place in the rosario neighborhood of the city of chihuahua , the capital of the border state chihuahua , and left 14 people dead and 8 injured , spokesman carlos huerta said on wednesday .
we have an ongoing preliminary investigation wherein we believe it was an attack carried out by a criminal gang fighting for drug territory in the area , huerta said .
the so-called aztecas street gang attacked the rehab center where some members of rival group los mexicles , associated with the powerful sinaloa cartel , were located , huerta said .
the two groups are wings of cartels fighting over drug distribution routes , particularly for crystal meth .
last year , some 23,000 people were killed in violent incidents in mexico , the deadliest year since president enrique pena nieto took office in late 2012 .
since then , violence has grown as the country s powerful drug cartels have splintered and consolidated while fighting ruthlessly for control of lucrative smuggling routes in the united states .
some 1,444 people have been killed so far this year in chihuahua state alone , huerta said .
