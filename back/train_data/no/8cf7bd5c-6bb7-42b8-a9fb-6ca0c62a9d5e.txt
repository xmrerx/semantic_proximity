yangon ( reuters ) - chinese president xi jinping met with myanmar s top military general in beijing on friday and discussed china s support amid international criticism over its treatment of the rohingya minority , according a statement from the general .
china has offered diplomatic backing to its southern neighbor throughout the crisis , despite growing pressure from western countries for the myanmar military to be accountable for alleged atrocities .
more than 600,000 members of the rohingya muslim group have fled from buddhist-majority myanmar s rakhine state to bangladesh in three months since insurgent attacks on security posts sparked a brutal counter-insurgency campaign .
china helped to block a resolution on the crisis at the u.n. security council , while the united states this week called the response by the military and local vigilantes ethnic cleansing , echoing earlier statements by senior united nations officials .
according to a statement on the facebook page of senior general min aung hlaing , he and the chinese leader on friday discussed the promotion of cooperation between the armed forces of the two countries , the situation of china standing on myanmar s side at the forefront of the international community regarding the rakhine issue , and other issues .
min aung hlaing arrived in china on tuesday and has largely met chinese military officers during his visit .
the statement also said they discussed ongoing talks between myanmar s government and myriad ethnic insurgent groups , some of whom are based along myanmar s shared border with china .
according to chinese state news agency xinhua , xi said china was closely watching the peace process and was willing to play a constructive role ... for security and stability in their border areas .
the xinhua account did not mention rakhine , but cited xi saying that china always respects myanmar s sovereignty and territorial integrity .
