vienna ( reuters ) - the far right freedom party ( fpo ) , set to become kingmaker after elections on oct. 15 , wants austria to join the visegrad group of central and east european states opposed to immigration .
eurosceptic leaders in poland , hungary , the czech republic and slovakia have refused migrant quotas approved by a western-dominated majority of european union member states .
they also reject proposed european union reforms that would transfer more power from national governments to brussels institutions .
the fpo , likely to be a part of austria s next ruling coalition , also wants a more decentralized eu .
we will ... strengthen contact with the visegrad states and it would be nice and good if we could maybe even become a member of the visegrad group , fpo chief heinz-christian strache said in an election debate with social democrat chancellor christian kern focusing on curbing migrant flows and brussels powers .
the freedom party and center-left social democrats are fighting for second place in sunday s election with both commanding about 25 percent of the vote in the latest polls .
the freedom party appears ticketed for a place in the next coalition given that the conservative people s party s rating of around 33 percent is unlikely to improve enough for an absolute majority , and bitter disputes between the two centrist parties .
conservative leader sebastian kurz has , like strache , praised far-right hungarian prime minister viktor orban for building a border fence to keep migrants out of eu territory .
to avoid losing votes , austria s mainstream conservatives have drifted recently towards the fpo s anti-immigration positions and joined calls to shrink and refocus the eu s powers .
jean-claude juncker , the head of the european commission , the eu executive , has invited visegrad group leaders to a meeting on oct. 18 to try to ease tensions between them and wealthier western europe .
