WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A powerful sea surge will accompany Hurricane Irma as the storm moves through Florida, and that blast of ocean water could badly damage coastal areas, Florida Governor Rick Scott said.
I am very concerned about the west coast, Scott said of Florida s western shoreline that faces the Gulf of Mexico and is being hit hard by Irma.
Scott was talking on Fox News Sunday.
Later, on ABC News, Scott said: This storm surge is just deadly.
