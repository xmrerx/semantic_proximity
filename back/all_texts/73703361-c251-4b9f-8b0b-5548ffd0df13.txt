Looters in Texas are boldly walking into businesses affected by the flooding and literally stealing everything off the shelves.
It s hard to fathom that the first thoughts of so many people who have lost everything are to steal as much as they can from others who have also lost everything.
Last week, we published a story with a video about one lone, and very brave man who claimed to be a former S.W.A.T.
Deputy, standing in the middle of a parking lot defending local store owners from would be looters.
Apparently, he s not the only badass in Texas who s sick and tired of watching these thugs steal from local business owners.Meet Sheriff Troy Nehls of Fort Bend County who s putting looters in his county on notice.
He s got a message for looters, and he s not mincing words We ve heard of looting around the greater Houston area, specifically Harris County.
As far as Fort Bend County, we haven t. I made a comment the other day that we support the Second Amendment here in Fort Bend County, and there are many of us that are armed.
I would caution those that want to come and prey on our people here in Fort Bend County that are suffering so much right now.
You may want to stay out of Fort Bend County because you could leave this county in a bag.
We support the 2nd Amendment I would caution those that want to come & prey on our people here in Fort Bend County.
