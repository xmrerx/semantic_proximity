harare ( reuters ) - lawmakers from president robert mugabe s ruling party will meet at the party headquarters on monday to discuss impeaching the 93-year-old leader after a noon deadline passed without him resigning , zanu-pf s chief whip lovemore matuke said .
the ruling party removed mugabe as zanu-pf president and first secretary on sunday , capping a dramatic week after the military seized power on wednesday saying it wanted to remove criminal elements around the president .
