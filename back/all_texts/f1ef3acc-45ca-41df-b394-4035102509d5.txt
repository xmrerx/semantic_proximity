The USDA is spreading the wealth like crazy with the green energy giveaways of thousands to farmers.
We know from past experience that these farmers are given grants and loans for supposed green energy projects only to see the scam of pocketing money.
The USDA had previously spend BILLIONS of taxpayer dollars on a project called Pigford that was proven to be nothing but an effort to redistribute money to thousands of minorities.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is spending millions on green energy projects for farms, including putting solar panels on the tops of chicken coops.The federal agency announced Friday that its Rural Energy for America Program (REAP) will spend $63 million on solar panels and wind turbines for the farming industry.One project, totaling $16,094, was awarded to Blue Sky Poultry, Inc., of Bainbridge, Ga., to install a solar array on the roof of poultry houses.
Other projects announced by the USDA included $18,000 for solar panels for a fruit farm in Ohio, and $19,750 for a wind turbine for a farm in Minnesota.The majority of funding is going toward similar small projects.
The agency is also financing larger solar projects through loan guarantees in the amounts of $3 to $4 million, and funding a $5 million project to turn wood into gas.Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack said the $63 million in funding would create jobs, reduce greenhouse gas pollution, and helps usher in a more secure energy future for the nation.
The USDA pointed out that the Obama administration has spent more than $291 million in grants and $327 million in loan guarantees on green energy projects for farmers through the program since the president took office.Via: WFB
