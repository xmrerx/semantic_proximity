this story is a perfect example of how muslim migrants do not assimilate in their host countries .
instead of assimilating , they are demanding austrian students change their culture and even their religion , to satisfy the desires of the refugees who are essentially guests in their villages and towns the following news report about the radicalization of students in a viennese high school begins with turkish president recep tayyip erdogan s recent comments about women , who he thinks should concentrate mainly on being mothers .
mr. erdogan s words are taken seriously in germany and austria , since he has a strong influence on turks there , even those of the second or third generation.notice that the chechens relatively recent arrivals are said to pose the most serious problem .
the same story is told all over europe : the chechens are the biggest troublemakers , second only to the somalis in areas that host somali communities .
you might call them the somalis of the caucasus.via : gates of vienna
