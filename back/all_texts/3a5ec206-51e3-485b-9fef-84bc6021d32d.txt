MOSCOW (Reuters) - New sanctions on Russia which U.S. President Donald Trump has signed into law are tantamount to a “full-scale trade war”, Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Wednesday.
Medvedev also said in a Facebook post that the sanctions showed the Trump administration was utterly powerless.
“The hope that our relations with the new American administration would improve is finished,” he wrote.
