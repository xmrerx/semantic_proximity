WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday he hopes to have several of President-elect Donald Trump’s Cabinet nominees confirmed on his first day in office on Jan. 20.
“In the past, we’ve been able to confirm a number of an incoming president’s Cabinet appointments on day one, and we hope on January 20,” McConnell said.
“Even though there’s a lot going on that day, we hope to be able to vote on and confirm a number of the president’s selections for the Cabinet so he can get started,” the Kentucky Republican said.
