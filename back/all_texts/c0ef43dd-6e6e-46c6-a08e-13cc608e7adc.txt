Donald Trump showed up to vote in New York City with his wife Melania and hilarity ensued.When the Trump s walked through the doors they were greeted by a round of boos and jeers.
Clearly, New York voters are not Trump fans.But Trump s day got even worse when he tried to sneak a peek at Melania s ballot, apparently just making sure she votes for him.Well, a photo of the moment was captured and now the Internet is having a field day mocking the Republican nominee.This picture is everything.

Talk about being a paranoid control freak.
And it would be completely understandable if she didn t vote for her husband, especially considering he has treated women like shit his whole life.Featured image via screenshot
