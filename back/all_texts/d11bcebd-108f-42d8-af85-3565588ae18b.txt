According to the Associated Press on Friday, President Trump had plans to mobilize the National Guard to round up illegal aliens.
Now, it appears, the memo was a ploy to find the White House information leak.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer denied these rumors and called them absolutely false.Via Gateway Pundit: There is no effort to do what is potentially suggested, he said.
Spicer called the AP report 100 percent not true, adding that there was no effort at all to utilize the National Guard to round up unauthorized immigrants.
Sources are now saying that multiple memos were released, all with slight differences in order to smoke out the leak.Multiple sources within the WH have told me that the "memo" on the 100K National Guard soldiers was fake news designed to smoke out leaker.

@realDonaldTrump is FURIOUS.
#BringBackFlynn https://t.co/JYsbs49R55 Mike Cernovich (@Cernovich) February 17, 2017Give 10 different people 10 different copies of the "same" memo.
Include 1 different words or typos in each.
Oldest trick in the book.
