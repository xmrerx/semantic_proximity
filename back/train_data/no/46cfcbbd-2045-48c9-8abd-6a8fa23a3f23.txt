a menacing donald trump is gazing down on phoenix s grand avenue.the president is flanked by mushroom clouds and swastikas configured like dollar signs .
i think a lot of people are feeling this way and i m just trying to express what i think is on a lot of people s minds these days , the billboard s artist , karen fiorito , said friday in an interview from her california home .
something that really concerned us was this idea of a dictatorship where things were going in a certain direction .
the billboard art was commissioned by the billboard owner , beatrice moore , a longtime patron of the arts on grand avenue .
some of these issues are so important you can t not speak out , moore said in an interview.the trump billboard went up friday at 11th avenue and grand , to coincide with the start of the annual three-day art detour event in downtown phoenix .
moore said it would remain up as long as trump is president.were moore s remarks about hitler what inspired this hateful billboard ? this isn t the first time fiorito and moore put up controversial billboard art.in 2004 , fiorito created a billboard of president george w. bush and top government officials for her master of fine arts thesis on political propaganda at arizona state university .
dear america , the billboard said , we lied to you for your own good .
now trust us .
moore and fiorito did expect blowback from trump supporters .
fiorito said she has received death threats over the trump billboard .
a lot of hate .
things have gotten a lot more escalated now , she said .
i just hope that everyone involved in helping bring this message out is safe and that we all get through this unharmed , fiorita said .
