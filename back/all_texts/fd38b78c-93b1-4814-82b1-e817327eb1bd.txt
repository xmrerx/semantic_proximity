WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A senior White House official said former Republican congressman Mike Rogers is being considered as a candidate to replace FBI Director James Comey, who was fired late on Tuesday by President Donald Trump.
Rogers briefly served on the Trump transition team and was a national security adviser to the Trump campaign.
He is a former chairman of the House of Representatives intelligence committee and was an FBI agent in Chicago for five years before retiring in 1994 to begin a career in Michigan politics.
A spokeswoman for Rogers did not immediately comment on the report.
In 2013, the FBI Agents Association urged then-President Barack Obama to nominate Rogers, but Obama chose Comey instead.
