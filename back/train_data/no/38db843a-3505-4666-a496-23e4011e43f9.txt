rome ( reuters ) - members of italy s anti-establishment 5-star movement , which leads most opinion polls before a national election early next year , began voting on thursday to elect their leader and candidate for prime minister .
barring a colossal surprise the winner will be luigi di maio , the 31-year-old lower house deputy who has been groomed as leader over the last few years by beppe grillo , the comedian who founded 5-star as a protest movement in 2009 .
the party s supporters are voting online on a dedicated platform linked to grillo s blog , reflecting 5-star s credo of internet-based direct democracy .
voting will end at 7 p.m. ( 1700 gmt ) on thursday , but the result will not be known until saturday , when it is announced at 5-star s annual three-day gathering in the adriatic coastal town of rimini .
there are eight candidates , but di maio s victory is considered a formality .
he is one of italy s most prominent and popular politicians and his seven rivals , mostly local councillors , are virtually unknown even to 5-star supporters .
the only people seen as having any chance against him decided not to run , opening the party up to accusations of failing to run a proper contest .
roberto saviano , author of the best-selling novel gomorra , said on facebook that he wanted to run for the post to help 5-star out of a pathetic situation .
saviano is not a party member and so is not eligible .
probably the only risk for di maio would be if voting were distorted by another hacking attack against 5-star s internet platform .
in august an anonymous hacker revealed he had broken into the system to obtain secret data on 5-star s members and donors .
