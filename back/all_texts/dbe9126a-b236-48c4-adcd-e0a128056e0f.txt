What a bizarre exchange between a reporter and Democrat leader Nancy Pelosi!
She is asked during a press conference what her relationship is with President Trump and she laughed.
What s even stranger is she mocked the way Trump says DACA .It s as if she detests the president so much that she can t bring herself to speak his name.
Notice how she talks in disjointed sentences and stops suddenly to think.
She cannot even form a complete thought!
