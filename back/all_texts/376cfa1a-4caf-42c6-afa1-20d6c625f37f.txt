(Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in will ask China and Russia for their support for new sanctions against North Korea, Kyodo News said on Thursday, citing a Japanese official.
Abe and Moon, in talks on the sidelines of the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia, agreed to step up pressure on North Korea, Kyodo said, as the reclusive state pushes ahead with its nuclear and missile programs.
