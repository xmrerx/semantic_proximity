LONDON (Reuters) - Britain is less likely to leave the European Union without an agreed exit deal after last week s decision by the European Commission to recommend that talks move on to the next phase, Brexit minister David Davis said on Thursday.
I think no deal has become massively less probable after the decisions of last Friday - and that s a good thing because the best deal is a tariff free, non-tariff barrier-free arrangement, Davis told parliament.
He also said the government would have to think about how to respond to a decision by parliament to hand lawmakers more say over a final exit deal with the EU.
