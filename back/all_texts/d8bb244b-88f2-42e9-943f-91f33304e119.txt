Steve Bannon has called himself a street fighter, but George Clooney has another way to describe the controversial former advisor to President Donald Trump: a failed f ing screenwriter.
Speaking to journalists at the Toronto International Film Festival on Friday to promote his new film, the racially-charged Suburbicon, Clooney unloaded on Bannon, who will appear on Sunday s 60 Minutes for his first televised interview since leaving the White House last month.
I like picking fights.
I like that Breitbart News wants to have my head.
I d be ashamed 10 years from now if those weaselly little putzes, whose voices are getting a lot higher every week as this presidency starts to look worse and worse weren t still [after me], Clooney said.
Steve Bannon is a failed f ing screenwriter, and if you ve ever read [his] screenplay, it s unbelievable.
Now, if he d somehow managed miraculously to get that thing produced, he d still be in Hollywood, still making movies and licking my ass to get me to do one of his stupid-ass screenplays.
Before he became a prominent right-wing media baron and member of Trump s inner circle, Bannon worked in Hollywood as a producer and financier (he famously made some money off the Seinfeld syndication deal).
He also dabbled in screenwriting, having co-written a hip-hop musical based on Shakespeare s Coriolanus that takes place during the 1992 L.A. riots.
(Clooney has mocked Bannon for his Hollywood background in the past as well.
)Paul Joseph Watson had one of the best videos ever in response to Clooney s remarks about Trump (above).
