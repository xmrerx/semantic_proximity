madrid ( reuters ) - the leader of catalonia s regional government , carles puigdemont , said on thursday his administration would push on with a banned oct. 1 referendum on a split from spain , in defiance of a court order banning the vote .
we will do it because we have contingency plans in place to ensure it happens , but above all because it has the support of the immense majority of the population who are sick of the arrogance and abuse of the people s party ( pp ) government , he said in a televised statement .
the ruling pp government of prime minister mariano rajoy and major opposition parties in madrid have declared an independence referendum illegal and against spain s constitution .
