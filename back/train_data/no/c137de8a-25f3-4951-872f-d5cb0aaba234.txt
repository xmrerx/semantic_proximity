bangkok ( reuters ) - the thai government said on thursday it plans to take legal action against a radical buddhist monk detained by police for posting anti-islamic views on social media , and posing a threat to national security .
phra maha aphichat punnajanto is based at a temple in bangkok , but police detained him on tuesday in southern thailand , a region where muslim separatist insurgents have been fighting for decades .
a spokesman for thailand s military-led government told reuters that aphichat had been warned in the past that his social media activities could spark religious conflict .
his actions demean another religion and are considered inappropriate , lieutenant general sansern kaewkamnerd said .
the government now has to take legal action against him .
the 31-year-old firebrand rose to prominence in 2015 when he urged buddhists across the country to burn down a mosque as retribution for every monk killed in the insurgency .
the outspoken monk has also been active in campaigning to make buddhism a state religion of thailand .
aphichat has voiced admiration for ashin wirathu , a monk in myanmar well known for his anti-muslim views , and sees his actions as a model for safeguarding buddhism in thailand .
police told reuters that aphichat was being detained at the crime suppression division unit in bangkok .
images appeared on social media on wednesday evening showing aphichat being disrobed in his temple .
thai deputy prime minister prawit wongsuwan said on thursday aphichat had left his religious order voluntarily .
reuters was unable to reach aphichat for comment .
the buddhist association of thailand issued a statement protesting the aphichat s detention saying that it was disrespectful and breached personal rights .
a monk from the same temple , who declined to be named , told reuters that aphichat had not breach any laws governing their order and he could not be defrocked .
