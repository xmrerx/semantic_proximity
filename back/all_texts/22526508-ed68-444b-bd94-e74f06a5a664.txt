There have been a lot of strange this that have happened this presidential election season, but some things are definitely stranger than others.
One of those things being the fact that Rep. Steve King (R-IA) seems to know Sen. Ted Cruz s speeches by heart.Now, one could assume that it s because he s heard them so many times and Cruz doesn t change things up, so like a fan of a band he s mouthing the words.
Another assumption could be made that perhaps he helped write the speech, so he s proudly mouthing the words along side his partner in conservative crime.
However, probably the most accurate assumption would be that Ted Cruz is actually King s ventriloquist dummy and he s not doing a good job of hiding the movements of his mouth.Need proof?
Watch this Vine: Now, this is still just a working theory, but it s one that makes the most sense, really.
How else can one explain that they seem to be the same person in two different bodies.
Albeit, one is Canadian and the other from Iowa.Need further proof?flickr/amazonI can t be the only one who sees this?
How uncanny is that?
I mean, c mon.However, I digress, maybe, just maybe, King should either practice his ventriloquism better, or learn to keep his mouth just so he doesn t appear to be a creeper in the background.
Either choice would work.Video/Featured image from Vine
