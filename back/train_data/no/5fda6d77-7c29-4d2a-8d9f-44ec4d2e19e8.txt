have a listen and i know you ll be shaking your head like i was : transportation secretary anthony foxx told a crowd in north carolina tuesday that only 49 % of low-income neighborhoods have sidewalks while more affluent areas have near 90 % .
in order to have a society where everyone has a shot at the american dream , than it s imperative that we acknowledge these challenges .
foxx made the comments to the charlotte rotary club where he discussed the ways that infrastructure should connect people to opportunity.during his speech , foxx referenced a map of atlanta that showed areas of pedestrian and bicycle accidents .
the grey areas represent communities of concentrated poverty .
this is representative of what s occurring nationally , which is not surprising , because only 49 % of low-income neighborhoods have sidewalks .
in high-income areas the number is closer to 90 % .
so , if we want a society in which everyone has a shot at the american dream , than it is imperative that we acknowledge these challenges , foxx said .
