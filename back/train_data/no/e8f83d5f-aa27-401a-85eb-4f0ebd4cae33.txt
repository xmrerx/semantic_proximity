beirut ( reuters ) - lebanon is too weak to bear the consequences of saad al-hariri s resignation as prime minister and can not afford to side against iran , lebanese druze leader walid jumblatt said on saturday after hariri stepped down .
hariri , an ally of saudi arabia , said there was an assassination plot against him and attacked iran and its lebanese ally hezbollah during his resignation speech on saturday .
hariri s resignation thrusts lebanon back onto the front line of saudi-iranian regional rivalry and seems likely to exacerbate sectarian tensions between lebanese sunni and shi ite muslims .
i am concerned about the economy , of course , and i am concerned about politics .
we can not afford to fight the iranians from lebanon , jumblatt told reuters .
he advocated compromise with hezbollah in lebanon while waiting for regional circumstances to allow saudi-iranian dialogue .
lebanon has enough problems .
it is too weak for such a resignation , because it will have a tremendous negative impact , said jumblatt , one of lebanon s most influential politicians .
he described hariri s resignation as incomprehensible .
the druze are an important minority in lebanon s sectarian system of government .
jumblatt has frequently played kingmaker in lebanese politics .
