Really Hillary?
Why don t you tell us about men who are offensive to women Donald Trump s remarks about Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly are offensive, but the rest of the Republican field is equally offensive, Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Rodham Clinton said Monday.
What Donald Trump said about Megyn Kelly is outrageous, but what the rest of the Republicans are saying about all women is also outrageous, Clinton said.
They brag about slashing health-care funding, they say they would force women who have been raped to carry their rapist s child, and fail to put forward proposals that would help women earn equal pay.
I think the guy went way overboard.
Offensive, outrageous, pick your adjective, Clinton told reporters following a campaign event here focused on making college more affordable.

No war on women here
