ankara ( reuters ) - turkish and russian officials will meet to finalize turkey s s-400 surface-to-air missile systems deal in the coming week , turkish president tayyip erdogan said on monday .
turkey has been negotiating with russia to buy the system for more than a year .
washington and some of its nato allies see the decision as a snub because the weapons can not be integrated into the alliance s defenses .
turkey expects to receive its first such system in 2019 , defense minister nurettin canikli said in november adding that the deal includes two s-400 systems while one was optional .
our officials will come together in the coming week to finalize the s-400 issue , erdogan said during a joint news conference with his russian counterpart vladimir putin .
turkey has been working to develop its own defense systems and equipment and has lined up several projects for the coming years including combat helicopters , tanks , drones and more .
erdogan also said ankara and moscow were on the same page regarding the u.s. move on jerusalem and added that two leaders would keep in contact on the issue .
