geneva ( reuters ) - a break-in at the u.n. human rights office in burundi s capital may have been an attempt to smear the government , a presidential aide told reporters on friday in geneva .
u.n. staff in burundi filed a complaint with police after a group of armed men broke into the office in bujumbura at around 2.30 a.m. on wednesday , a u.n. spokeswoman said .
nobody was hurt and there was no damage in the attack , which came a week after a u.n. human rights inquiry said burundian officials at the highest level should be held accountable for crimes against humanity .
willy nyamitwe , senior communications officer in the office of the president , said the two guards at the office had been arrested and it was probably not a simple burglary .
what the police have already said is apparently there was no attack coming from the outside , which certainly means the guards would seem to be complicit .
but ... we should wait for the final conclusions of this investigation .
nyamitwe is expected to respond to the allegations at the u.n. human rights council next week .
burundi has rejected the findings of the u.n. inquiry , which nyamitwe said was a puppet of the european union .
u.n. human rights spokeswoman elizabeth throssell called for an investigation of the break-in that complied with international legal procedures .
