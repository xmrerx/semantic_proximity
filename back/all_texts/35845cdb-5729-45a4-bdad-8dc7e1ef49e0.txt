(Reuters) - U.S.
Senator Dick Durbin, the No.
2 Democrat in the Senate, said on Wednesday that fellow Democrat Al Franken should resign in light of sexual misconduct allegations against him.
“Senator Franken’s behavior was wrong.
He has admitted to what he did.
He should resign from the Senate,” Durbin said on Twitter.
Durbin marked the 15th Democratic senator, including third-ranking Democrat Patty Murray, to call on Wednesday for Franken to step down.
