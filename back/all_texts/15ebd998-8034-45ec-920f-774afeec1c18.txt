WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he fired FBI Director James Comey because he was not doing a good job.
“He wasn’t doing a good job, very simply.
He wasn’t doing a good job,” Trump told reporters at the Oval Office during a brief photo op as he met with Henry Kissinger, a former secretary of state.
Trump declined to answer further questions about the firing, which was announced on Tuesday and stunned Washington.
