White House press secretary Sean Spicer is a trainwreck.
After all, this is the guy who said Hitler really wasn t that bad.
Everybody tunes in daily to see what ridiculous assertion will come out of his mouth this time, and apparently, that is all the job security he needs in Donald Trump s administration.According to the Washington Post, Trump has no intention of firing Spicer because he gets great ratings, and in Trump s White House, ratings matter far more than facts.
The WaPo article explores Trump s obsession with cable news and revealed that Spicer s job is safe as long as he can keep people turning in to watch him crash and burn.
I m not firing Sean Spicer, Trump said, according to sources.
That guy gets great ratings.
Everyone tunes in.
The Washington Post reports that most of the televisions in the West Wing display four channels at all times CNN, Fox, Fox Business and MSNBC.
The article also noted that during an intimate lunch recently with a key outside ally in a small West Wing dining room, for instance, Trump repeatedly paused the conversation to make the group watch a particularly combative Spicer briefing.
Spicer has become a laughing stock.
Saturday Night Live has had a blast lampooning him in recent months, with Melissa McCarthy playing the role of the press secretary.
The fact that Spicer was portrayed on SNL by a woman seemed to be more upsetting to Trump than any of Spicer s numerous gaffes.The press secretary kicked off his very first press conference by claiming that Trump s inauguration really didn t have a pathetic turnout, despite pictures proving he was full of it.
And things have only gone downhill from there.
But as long as America keeps tuning in for Spicer s daily dumpster fires press briefings, he can rest assured that Trump is going to keep him around.
