As Trump began preparations to interview for cabinet positions, he decided it was a good idea to ask his rich friends to sit in on the interviews so he could get their opinions.
In audio released by Politico Saturday, The Donald can be heard telling a crowd at his Bedminster, New Jersey golf club: We re doing a lot of interviews tomorrow generals, dictators, we have everything.
You may wanna come around.
It ll be fun.
We re really working tomorrow.
We have meetings every 15, 20 minutes with different people that will form our government, Trump added.
We re going to be interviewing everybody Treasury, we re going to be interviewing Secretary of State.
We have everybody coming in if you want to come around, it s going to be unbelievable .so you might want to come along.
If it sounds to you like Trump was giving his paying club members special access to the different people that will form our government, you are correct in that assessment.
This is particularly troubling for President Asterisk, who recently was photographed reviewing secure North Korea documents during dinner at his Florida home as white supremacists on his staff held cell phone flashlights so he could see all while surrounded by his rich friends.
So, this is my real group, Trump tells his crowd of elite pals.
These are the people that came here in the beginning, when nobody knew what this monster was gonna turn out to be, right?
