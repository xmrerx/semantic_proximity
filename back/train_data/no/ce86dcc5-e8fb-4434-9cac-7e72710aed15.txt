these darn progressive cnn reporters just can t help themselves .
they re so conditioned to gop candidates who roll over and allow the left to control the narrative , it s almost like they ve forgotten who they re dealing with at a fundraiser tonight in norton , massachusetts , cnn decided that instead of asking an intelligent question that might actually help americans to learn more about what trump thinks about serious issues facing america like say the iran deal , they instead chose to ask trump about a few protesters outside of a building packed with enthusiastic supporters .
well , i don t see a lot of protesters .
i see thousands of people .
and there are a few protesters .
and , i figured you d ask that question because you know , that s the way it is .
cnn is terrible .
cnn .
are you with cnn .
are you with cnn .
you people do not cover us accurately .
so they have a few protesters outside .
and thousands of people .
and the first question from cnn is about protesters .
