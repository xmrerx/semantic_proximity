WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The acting secretary of Homeland Security has notified President Donald Trump of countries that do not meet new U.S. vetting standards and has recommended “tailored” and “tough” restrictions on their citizens’ entry into the United States, U.S. officials said on Friday.
Trump has not yet approved the restrictions, the officials said.
It is unclear if he will do so before a temporary travel ban on citizens of six majority-Muslim countries expires on Sunday.
The officials declined to say how many or which countries were included in DHS acting Secretary Elaine Duke’s report to Trump.
