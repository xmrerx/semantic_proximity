don t let hillary s cheerleaders in the mainstream media convince you that she can beat trump .
trump has proven himself to be a formidable opponent and don t forget that hillary was beaten by an amateur jr .
senator in 2008 .
i ve consistently said throughout the analysis of this race that i would not want to run against donald trump because i think he s the most dangerous candidate .
give me ted cruz , give me john kasich , give me any of the vanquished they re traditional politicians , easy to beat .
and , ted cruz , in particular , way outside the mainstream , she said .
donald trump , when you look from what he said the other day about the gender bill and using the bathrooms , it proves that point because he knows how to appeal to not only libertarians but to independents who support that , too .
so he will be a very , very tough candidate to face in a general election .
i think it will be one of the closest elections we see since 2000. https : //youtu.be/zqtkc1apia4
