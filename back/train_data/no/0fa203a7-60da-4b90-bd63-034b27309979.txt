chicago ( reuters ) - cash-strapped illinois needs $ 43 billion over 10 years to repair and improve its transportation network and boost the state economy , according to a report released on monday by the metropolitan planning council .
“ the $ 43 billion needed to rebuild and improve our transportation infrastructure is less than what we ’ re wasting today on vehicle repairs due to poor road conditions , time lost to traffic congestion , and population and jobs going to neighboring states , ” jim reilly , a senior fellow at the nonprofit , nonpartisan chicago region planning group , said in a statement .
the fifth-largest u.s. state is in its 10th month without a full fiscal 2016 budget due to an impasse between its republican governor and democrats who control the legislature .
illinois is struggling with a $ 6.7 billion bill backlog as pensions and debt payments gobble up a big chunk of available revenue .
the report called for raising $ 2.7 billion a year by increasing the current 19 cents-a-gallon state gasoline tax by 30 cents and hiking vehicle registration fees , which cost $ 101 a year for most cars , by 50 percent .
half of the new money would be tapped for pay-as-you-go projects , with the other half backing $ 25 billion of 25-year bonds .
the money would be spent on state and local roads , mass transit and railroads .
the council recommended an amendment to the illinois constitution creating a transportation trust fund to ensure the new revenue is not diverted for other purposes .
