washington ( reuters ) - former white house national security adviser tom donilon and former ibm chief executive sam palmisano will lead a new commission to strengthen u.s. cyber defenses over the next decade , the white house said on wednesday .
president barack obama set up the commission on enhancing national cybersecurity this month and sought $ 19 billion for cyber security across government in his annual budget proposal , a boost of $ 5 billion over the previous year .
federal agencies have worked to upgrade their security since the office of personnel management announced last year that roughly 22 million personnel files had been stolen in a massive hack .
