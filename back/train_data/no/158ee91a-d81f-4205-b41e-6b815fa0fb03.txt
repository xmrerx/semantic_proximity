beirut ( reuters ) - lebanese security forces arrested a former mayor of the town of arsal near the syrian border on saturday in connection with the capture of lebanese soldiers , security sources said .
ali al-hujeiri also stands accused of collusion with the nusra front islamist group , al qaeda s former syria branch , the sources said .
militants from the nusra front and islamic state briefly overran arsal in 2014 and captured a number of soldiers before they withdrew during clashes with the army .
nusra front released 16 soldiers in 2015 in exchange for the release of jailed islamists .
islamic state killed all nine soldiers it had captured .
both groups were driven from their last foothold at the syria-lebanon border in recent separate offensives by the army and lebanese shi ite group hezbollah .
it was not immediately clear which group of captured soldiers hujeiri was being accused over .
lebanese president michel aoun said this week the army was investigating the circumstances that led to the capture of the soldiers killed by islamic state .
