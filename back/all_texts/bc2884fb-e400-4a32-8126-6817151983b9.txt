A class-action lawsuit against the first daughter s company has been filed by San Francisco-based retailer Modern Appealing Clothing.
Although Ivanka Trump has distanced herself from her namesake brand, the business can t seem to catch a break.
The first daughter s company has been sued by a San Francisco-based retailer over unfair competition.
Modern Appealing Clothing (MAC) has filed a class-action lawsuit against Ivanka Trump Marks LLC, claiming that the defendant has gained unfair advantage from Donald J. Trump being the President of the United States and from Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared, working for the President of the Unites States, according to court documents published by the International Business Times.The suit was filed in the San Francisco Superior Court on Thursday.The lawsuit says President Donald Trump and counselor Kellyanne Conway provided publicity for Ivanka s lines and therefore helped boost its sales.
Donald defended his daughter on Twitter, saying that Nordstrom was treating her unfairly when the retailer announced it would be dropping her line due to declining sales.
Conway appeared on Fox & Friends in February and told viewers to go buy Ivanka s stuff.
The suit also asked for a restraining order that prevents the Ivanka Trump label from being sold in California.
The doc read, As a result of their unlawful acts, defendants have reaped and continue to reap unfair benefits and illegal profits at the expense of plaintiff MAC and the Class it seeks to represent.
