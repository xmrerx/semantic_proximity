It s no secret to anyone not living under a rock that there is no love lost between Donald Trump and Rosie O Donnell.
It s also no secret that Alec Baldwin s brutal and spot-on mockery of Trump on Saturday Night Live is really getting under Trump s skin, and has been for some time now.
However, the ultimate blow came this past Saturday night, when SNL featured a surprise appearance by actress Melissa McCarthy as Trump s bumbling, lying, combative press secretary Sean Spicer.
The portrayal stole the show and went viral.While Trump has yet to tweet about it, the word on the street is that what bothered him the most about SNL s treatment of Spicer wasn t the mockery itself, but rather that Spicer was portrayed by a woman.
To Trump, that equals making his press secretary look weak.Given this perfect storm of facts sure to be causing the notoriously thin-skinned president wannabe to seethe, Trump s own favorite social media platform, Twitter, has come up with a BRILLIANT way to have SNL finally make Trump REALLY blow his stack: Have Rosie O Donnell portray either Trump himself or even better top Trump political strategist Steve Bannon.Bannon is the former head of the white supremacist website Breitbart News, and is clearly the one who is in Trump s ear and pulling the strings behind the scenes.
To have him portrayed by the woman Trump hates most in the world would be EPIC.
Here are just a few tweets on this subject:I'm begging you @SNL please get Rosie O'Donnell to play "President Bannon" over #BLOTUS.
He'll melt like the Wicked Witch!

Cast Rosie O'Donnell as Bannon, the world needs this.
We will never ask for another thing again.

If SNL would replace Alec Baldwin with Rosie O'Donnell in all of their Trump sketches Evan Peterson (@evan_up) February 7, 2017America, I promise you: nothing will get Steve Bannon out of the White House faster than Rosie O'Donnell playing https://t.co/YpehUKqDgG ((( Glenn Hauman ))) (@GlennHauman) February 7, 2017@DaveKingThing @JuddApatow SNL should have Trump in gimp suit with Rosie O'Donnell as Steve Bannon holding leash.
Hit him where it hurts.
Matthew Lee Myers (@themattylee) February 7, 2017Nothing against Alec Baldwin, he's been doing a great job.
But imagine the steam shooting out of Trump's ears if Rosie O'Donnell plays him.
Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) February 7, 2017Rosie O'Donnell as Steve Bannon on @nbcsnl would be INCREDIBLE.
B (@BrianCHarnick) February 7, 2017Apparently, O Donnell herself is game as well:Rosie O'Donnell has already said yes.
Now the ball's in SNL's court.
@SNL https://t.co/zbiv0oGDFW emigre80 (@emigre80) February 7, 2017EW: Rosie O'Donnell nominated herself to play Donald Trump s controversial chief strategist on #SNL.

Keep it up, Twitter.
