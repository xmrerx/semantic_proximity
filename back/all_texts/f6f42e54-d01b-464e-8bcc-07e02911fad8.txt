Trump s inauguration crowd size was pathetic.
How pathetic?
you ask.
When The Donald officially took over the @POTUS Twitter account, he didn t use a picture of his own inauguration as the banner image.
He used President Obama s:.
@realDonaldTrump's official @POTUS banner image of his #Inauguration is actually @GettyImages photo of Obama's.
So sad pic.twitter.com/KtezPZGyWj noahharlan (@noahharlan) January 20, 2017Naturally, the internet quickly caught on to the fact that no one wants to show up to celebrate Trump becoming the Grand Wizard of our once great nation.For those saying "Trump can't be that hated, look at the size of the crowd" #Inauguration pic.twitter.com/Sczp6Feta5 Stefan Kay (@5tefanK) January 20, 2017President Trump has officially been sworn in.
There is a lot of white in that crowd.

Many challenges for Donald Trump.

As if rain would've kept the #ObamaCoalition away in 2009!

(@mmpadellan) January 20, 2017@HaroldItz @Glenn__Kenny To be fair, it was one of the biggest crowds there to attend a 3 Doors Down concert.
Chuck Tryon (@chutry) January 20, 2017As Obama and Trump looked at over the crowd, Obama whispered: "Mine's bigger."

Not one.

This is not normal.
Nothing about Trump s campaign, election, or presidency is normal.
It is time for the American people to steel their resolve to fight against this wildly hated man, to do all they can to keep him from implementing his horrifying and dangerous agenda.The next four years will be hard, perhaps harder than any four-year period in our lifetimes, but one thing Americans have always had is the strength to stand together in times of adversity and how much more adverse could things be than staring down a President who is sitting in the Oval Office thanks to a massive propaganda and fake news campaign, and hacking of his political opponents spearheaded by a hostile foreign dictator?Featured image via screen capture
