with news circulating that robert mueller will be handing down his first indictment in the russia investigation soon , donald trump is allowing us to watch him squirm in twitterland.as usual , trump demanded that everyone stop looking at him and instead focus on his eternal scapegoat , hillary clinton and the phone right-wing uranium conspiracy .
after all , collusion with a foreign enemy isn t a crime , he says : never seen such republican anger & unity as i have concerning the lack of investigation on clinton made fake dossier ( now $ 12,000,000 ?
) , .
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) october 29 , 2017 the uranium to russia deal , the 33,000 plus deleted emails , the comey fix and so much more .
instead they look at phony trump/russia , .
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) october 29 , 2017 `` collusion , '' which does n't exist .
the dems are using this terrible ( and bad for our country ) witch hunt for evil politics , but the r 's donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) october 29 , 2017up to this point , trump s rant was pretty standard .
what makes this magical is his incredibly panicky do something : are now fighting back like never before .
there is so much guilt by democrats/clinton , and now the facts are pouring out .
do something !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) october 29 , 2017naturally , americans joined together to mock him : who exactly are you asking to `` do something '' ?

1 2 muellers coming for you .
adan garciahernandez ( @ adangarciahern2 ) october 29 , 2017according to trump , all of this is an attempt to distract from his historic tax cuts & reform , which we have apparently known about since the investigation began long before he was kinda-sorta elected by a minority of the population and an archaic system that was set up to preserve the power of slave states.all of this `` russia '' talk right when the republicans are making their big push for historic tax cuts & reform .
is this coincidental ?
not !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) october 29 , 2017trump is extremely worried about something .
perhaps he knows it s only a matter of time before his world comes crashing down upon him.featured image via getty images ( drew angerer ) /screenshot
