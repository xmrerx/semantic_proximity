beirut ( reuters ) - rating agency moody s warned on tuesday that reopening lebanon s political vacuum after the resignation on saturday of prime minister saad al-hariri would damage the tiny country s credit rating .
a drawn-out political stalemate less than a month after the government passed its first budget in 12 years would undermine recent institutional improvements and expose the banking system to a loss in confidence , it said in an emailed note .
any loss of confidence in the banking system or in the stability of lebanon s institutions leading to a significant slowdown in private sector deposit inflows or outright outflows would be credit negative , it added .
lebanon s central bank governor , finance minister and banking association head have all issued statements assuring that lebanon s monetary and financial situation is stable .
the country s fragile economy has one of the world s highest debt-to-gdp ratios and is underpinned by its banking system .
hariri resigned in a televised broadcast from saudi arabia on saturday , taking lebanon s political elite by surprise , and plunging beirut into a political crisis .
president michel aoun has said he will not accept hariri s resignation until he returns to lebanon to explain his reasons , putting off the difficult political consultations among lebanese factions to form a new government .
as the most influential politician in the sunni community , which in lebanon s sectarian system must fill the position of prime minister , hariri has no obvious successor .
