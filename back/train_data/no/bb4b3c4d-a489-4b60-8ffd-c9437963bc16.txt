patrick henningsen 21st century wirethis week another toxic revelation dripped from the chilcot report.according to top british sas officers , us commander stanley mcchrystal s counter-insurgency black-ops featured a program of relentless violence designed to speed up the process of political cleansing and the so-called reconstruction of iraq.what is so interesting here , is the chilcot s choice of language , including the term latin american-style death squads , which by default implies the united states government was party to war crimes in central america during the 1980 s a claim which has always been strenuously denied in public , even though the general public and academia recognizes this to be a self-evident fact of america s long-running ugly history of intervention in that region.the independent report reveals the level of sheer depravity by us command : the mission was an extraordinary set-up : inside the command centre the machine was the death star , on the walls of which were banks of television screens , kill tv , running live pictures of action taking place and surveillance footage in real time from which suspects could be picked out for future arrest or elimination .
the independent also detailed how reckless and violent practices by the us military caused noticeable divisions and splits between joint us-uk command structures and operations , including political tension between british military command.through the newly created office of special plans , neoconservatives paul wolfowitz and douglas feith rolled out their own sub-layer to the us controlled shadow government in iraq , including the establishment of the iraqi de baathification council which , under the supervision of then us viceroy paul bremer , began dismantling the iraqi military , security and intelligence agency infrastructures of president saddam hussein .
and so began the process of the pentagon s de-baathification process in iraq , immediately followed by a hive of violent gangs and counter-gangs created by the us and uk covert military and intelligence apparatuses .
front and center in this effort were us operatives john negroponte and his understudy at the time , robert ford , who was later dispatched as us ambassador to syria in the run-up to the syrian conflict which began in 2011.the legacy of this destructive policy still lingers in iraq and now in syria .
this unquestionably spawned isis and many other terrorist factions in both iraq and syria .
only last week , iraq saw its most deadly car bomb ever , a questionable sectarian attack ( a narrative not challenged by the western and international press ) which killed 200 innocent civilians , and injured many more .
gladio redux : a map of every car bomb in baghdad since the us-uk invasion in 2003 ( source : twitter ) prof michel chossudovsky explains this same highly disturbing pattern that generally follows every us intervention overseas , be it overt or covert : the recruitment of death squads is part of a well established us military-intelligence agenda .
there is a long and gruesome us history of covert funding and support of terror brigades and targeted assassinations going back to the vietnam war .
as government forces continue to confront the self-proclaimed free syrian army ( fsa ) , the historical roots of the west s covert war on syria which has resulted in countless atrocities must be fully revealed .
once again , we can see the revelation of the us-uk method of not simply instigating wars , but facilitating dirty wars not only overseas , but also at home , as in the case of operation gladio and numerous other false flag events admittedly staged in north america.as 21wire will demonstrate in subsequent reports , this latest chilcot revelation is only the tip of a much larger , covert iceberg rthowever , kill or capture operations in and around baghdad , launched from the balad base 50 miles ( 80km ) north of the city , were a key if little known chapter in britain s shadow war , the independent reports.despite killing or taking as prisoner up to 3,500 insurgents , the mission against the sunni insurgency caused deep rifts to the point where a senior commander , himself ex-sas , demanded to know why the uk special forces were helping to run latin american-style death squads ?
the mission , under now-famed us general stanley mcchrystal , involved a shift from searching for apparently non-existent weapons of mass destruction ( wmd ) to man-hunting.antagonism over the tactics led to uk troops being banned from some operations and a uk sas commander lodging a complaint with us authorities for talking about british involvement in operations .
another sas colonel was also ostracized from his regiment after serving under mccrystal.chilcot does sketch out some of the details of the growing rift , though his report appears to leave out direct references to special forces operations .
us and uk strategies had , in effect , been on different courses since the uk decision to focus its attention on mnd ( se ) [ multi-national division south east , the british run zone ] in 2003.as result of this decision , the uk had acquired distinctly different priorities from the us , the 2.6-million-word report argues.it says the uk was then only marginally involved in the central tasks of stabilizing the iraqi government in baghdad and managing sectarian divisions , while it had come to see its main task in basra as one of keeping the situation calm while building the case for withdrawal .
from that point on , it appears , the us became increasingly concerned that a wavering uk was chiefly focused on getting out of the unpopular war in the best order it could and as soon as possible.in 2006 , a former sas soldier blew the whistle on some of the tactics used in and around baghdad .
ben griffin was later gagged by the uk courts for talking about his experiences , but before he was silenced told the telegraph , the americans had this catch-all approach to lifting suspects .
the tactics were draconian and completely ineffective .
the americans were doing things like chucking farmers into abu ghraib [ the notorious prison in baghdad where us troops abused and tortured iraqi detainees ] or handing them over to the iraqi authorities , knowing full well they were going to be tortured , he said at the time.it may be of note that the sas commander s reference to latin american-style deaths squads appears to ignore the fact that at time of the iraq war , in july 2003 , the uk was itself stepping up training of colombian paramilitary forces.commenting on the revelations at the time , human rights ngo amnesty international warned the colombian government has not implemented the un human rights recommendations and military assistance only gives a green light to the army to carry on as before .
