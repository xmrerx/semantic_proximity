moscow ( reuters ) - russia s defence ministry on sunday rejected allegations it had bombed u.s.-backed militias in syria , saying its planes only targeted islamic state militants and that it had warned the united states well in advance of its operational plans .
u.s.-backed militias said they came under attack on saturday from russian jets and syrian government forces in deir al-zor province , a flashpoint in an increasingly complex battlefield .
the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) , an alliance of kurdish and arab militias fighting with the u.s.-led coalition , said six of its fighters had been wounded in the strike .
but major-general igor konashenkov , a spokesman for the russian defence ministry , dismissed the allegations in a statement on sunday .
konashenkov said russian planes had only carried out carefully targeted strikes in the area based upon information that had been confirmed from multiple sources .
the strikes had only hit targets in areas under the control of islamic state , he said .
to avoid unnecessary escalation , the commanders of russian forces in syria used an existing communications channel to inform our american partners in good time about the borders of our military operation in deir al-zor , konashenkov said .
in the last few days , russian surveillance and reconnaissance did not detect a single clash between islamic state and armed representatives of any third force on the eastern bank of the euphrates , he added .
separately , franz klintsevich , a member of the upper house of parliament s security committee , said there was no proof to underpin the accusations against moscow .
