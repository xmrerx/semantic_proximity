( reuters ) - former democratic senator and indiana governor evan bayh announced on wednesday that he will come out of retirement to run for the u.s. senate , a move that could determine whether democrats can take control of the upper chamber in november .
“ with the challenges facing indiana and our country , i can no longer sit on the sidelines and watch as partisan bickering grinds washington to a halt , ” bayh said in a statement announcing his candidacy .
bayh served two terms in the senate before announcing his retirement in 2010 .
he has maintained a campaign account with more than $ 9.2 million cash on hand .
the republican candidate , todd young , has a campaign account with more than $ 1 million .
fellow democrat baron hill cleared the way for bayh to run on monday when he announced that he was leaving the senate race .
the democratic party needs a net gain of four senate seats to take control of the 100-member chamber in the nov. 8 election .
