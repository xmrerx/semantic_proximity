the economic stagnancy of the obama years is to blame for plummeting life expectancy rates among white , working-class americans , according to former president bill clinton , who privately told democratic donors that lower-income whites don t have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning .
clinton made the remarks while speaking to at a november 2015 closed-door fundraiser for hillary clinton in canton , ohio.echoing a theme of republican nominee donald trump s campaign , the former president expressed his concern that white , working-class americans have been left behind over the last eight years.clinton expressed his frustration with the most recent ( at that time ) democratic debate , which he said lacked a single mention of the fact that 84 percent of the american people , after inflation , had not had a raise of 1 cent since the financial crash .
we have incredible debates all over america that shouldn t exist between people in different racial groups because they don t trust law enforcement anymore , he continued .
and in the middle of all this we learned , breathtakingly , that middle-aged , non-college-educated white americans life expectancy is going down and is now lower than hispanics , even though they make less money .

clinton continued .
why ?
because they don t have anything to look forward to when they get up in the morning .
because their lives are sort of stuck in neutral .
