Actually, the quotes aren t that old.When Trump appeared on The View in March 2006 with Ivanka, the alleged billionaire was asked how he would react if Playboy magazine were to ever feature his daughter s picture on its cover.
I don t think Ivanka would do that inside the magazine, Trump said.
Although she does have a very nice figure.
I ve said that if Ivanka weren t my daughter, perhaps I would be dating her.
An conservative anti-Trump launched a radio ad earlier this year featuring Trump s bizarre remarks about his daughter.
He told Rolling Stone that if he weren t happily married and his daughter s father, the narrator says, adding, he d well, he didn t finish the thought, but you can guess what he meant.
