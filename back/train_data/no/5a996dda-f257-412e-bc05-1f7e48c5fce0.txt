xiamen , china ( reuters ) - the nations of the brics grouping strongly deplore north korea s nuclear test but the problem over its nuclear program should only be settled through peaceful means and dialogue , they said in a draft communique seen by reuters on monday .
in its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on sunday , north korea detonated what it said was an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long-range missile , prompting a vow of massive military response from the united states if it or its allies were threatened .
we express deep concern over the ongoing tension and prolonged nuclear issue on the korean peninsula , the draft communique said .
a formal communique , known as the xiamen declaration , is expected to be issued at a meeting attended by heads of state from the five major emerging economies in the grouping - brazil , russia , india , china and south africa - in the chinese coastal city of xiamen .
brics countries will continue to firmly oppose protectionism as they are committed to an open and inclusive multilateral trading system , the draft communique said .
it emphasized the need to be vigilant in guarding against inward-looking policies that could hurt global market confidence , calling for brics countries to strengthen macroeconomic and structural policy coordination .
it also called upon all countries to fully implement the paris climate agreement , while pledging to enhance brics cooperation on climate change and energy and to expand green financing .
the five emerging economies agreed to jointly establish a brics local currency bond fund , the draft communique added .
