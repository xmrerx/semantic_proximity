WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Environmental Protection Agency confirmed on Wednesday it would reopen a review of whether the Obama administration’s 2022-2025 vehicle emission rules are feasible, a win for automakers which have urged the Trump administration to reverse a January decision to uphold the standards.
The EPA said it would make a determination by April 2018 after the Obama administration sought in January to lock in the rules.
Environmentalists say the rules save fuel and reduce greenhouse gases.
“These standards are costly for automakers and the American people,” said EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt in a statement.
