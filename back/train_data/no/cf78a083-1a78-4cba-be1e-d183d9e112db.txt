juba ( reuters ) - the death toll from inter-clan fighting in south sudan s great lakes region last week - a new source of violence in a country devastated by a four-year civil war - has reached at least 170 , officials said on tuesday .
the clashes in the province s malek county broke out after a group of young men from the ruop ethnic group attacked rival youth from the pakam group on wednesday and thursday .
revenge attacks have since taken place .
dharuai mabor teny , a member of parliament from the region , updated an earlier death toll of 45 .
right now , from both sides , we have 170 plus people who lost their lives .
342 houses have been burnt and almost 1,800 people displaced , teny told reuters .
the violence prompted the government to declare a three-month state of emergency in the region and surrounding areas on monday .
the military has also been ordered to deploy troops to quell the unrest .
shadrack bol maachok , the regional government s spokesman , said the widespread availability of arms complicated efforts to control the conflict .
those arms in the hands of the civilians are going to be taken away and heavy forces are going to be brought here , he told reuters .
the un mission in south sudan unmiss said its troops were helping remove roadblocks mounted by the clashing groups in a bid to open up routes for movement and trade .
south sudan was plunged into war in 2013 after a political disagreement between president salva kiir and his former vice president riek machar escalated into a military confrontation .
the fighting has killed tens of thousands , uprooted about a quarter of the population of 12 million people and left its small , oil-dependent economy moribund .
violence between rival communities is common in parts of south sudan , often triggered by quarrels over scarce grazing land and cultural and political grievance
