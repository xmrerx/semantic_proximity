tegucigalpa ( reuters ) - over two dozen people were injured in clashes on friday between honduran security forces and protesters demanding a vote recount for last month s contentious and still unresolved presidential election , according to the red cross .
supporters of the center-left opposition alliance against the dictatorship , led by tv star salvador nasralla , set fire to tires across the country , blocking major thoroughfares in the capital , tegucigalpa , and the second city of san pedro sula .
police and soldiers responded with tear gas to rock-throwing protesters who set fire to a vehicle for carrying soldiers in tegucigalpa .
near san pedro sula , protesters blocked a road leading to the key puerto cortes port , before being moved on by security forces .
the honduran branch of the international committee of the red cross said that 27 people had been injured in the clashes .
at least five of those injured in the northern city of villanueva , near san pedro sula , had been shot , it said .
honduras has been roiled by political instability in the wake of the nov. 26 vote , which remains unresolved .
nasralla trails conservative president juan orlando hernandez by 1.6 percentage points according to the official count , which has been questioned by the two main opposition parties and a wide swathe of the diplomatic corps .
honduras electoral tribunal said on sunday that a partial recount of votes showed broadly the same result as previously , maintaining hernandez s lead .
it has until dec. 26 to declare a winner .
last week , honduras two main opposition parties presented formal requests to annul the results of the election .
