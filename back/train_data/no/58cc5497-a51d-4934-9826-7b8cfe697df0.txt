dar es salaam ( reuters ) - tanzania offered a reward of 10 million shillings ( $ 4,500 ) on tuesday for the arrest of a former chief accountant of its anti-graft watchdog , part of a new drive to root out corruption .
president john magufuli , in office since november 2015 , has launched a crackdown on high-level corruption that has already seen thousands of public officials losing their jobs .
john mbungo , deputy director general of the state-run prevention and combating of corruption bureau ( pccb ) , told reporters that the agency s former chief accountant , godfrey gugai , is on the run after his assets were frozen in may as part of a graft investigation .
the frozen assets include six vehicles and 40 apartments , houses and prime plots in the commercial capital dar es salaam and other urban centers .
public officials convicted of possession of unexplained wealth face a sentence of up to seven years in jail , a fine or both .
foreign investors have long complained that corruption is a big obstacle to doing business in the country .
