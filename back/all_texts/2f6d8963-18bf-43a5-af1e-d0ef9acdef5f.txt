Well first of all, politicians, especially those elected President of the United States, are very adept at creating straw men; taking something that they feel rhetorically works to their advantage and using it.
That s exactly what the President did.
My question did not suggest he was content with the captivity of those four Americans.
My question was about the contentment or the satisfaction or the realization that it was necessary within the context of this deal to leave them unaccounted for.
That was the essence of the question.
Clearly it struck a nerve.
That was my intention.
