A tweet by actress Salma Hayek clearly demonstrates how ridiculous the Republican Party is for supporting Donald Trump.During a rally in Buffalo on Monday, the Republican front-runner didn t even notice a major slip of his tongue when he confused to the terrorist attacks on 9/11 to the convenience store known as 7-Eleven.
I wrote this out, and it s very close to my heart, Trump claimed.
Because I was down there and I watched our police and our firemen down at 7/11, down at the World Trade Center right after it came down.
And I saw the greatest people I ve ever seen in action.
Yeah, it s so close to his heart that he couldn t even be bothered to get the date of the attacks right.
And he was in New York when he made the unforced error.Trump would end up being crucified on social media for the screw-up, but Salma Hayek won the Internet with her own hilarious reaction.
I am a dyslexic Mexican and English is my second language, however even I do not confuse 7/11 with 9/11, she wrote.Here s the post via Twitter.I am a dyslexic Mexican and English is my second language, however even I do not confuse 7/11 with 9/11.
#DonaldTrump Salma Hayek (@salmahayek) April 19, 2016Hayek has only been on Twitter for just a year now but it looks like she has mastered the art of the Twitter burn.This has to be a totally embarrassing moment for Trump.
In fact, it s probably the most embarrassing gaffe he has made throughout his hateful campaign.
The man lives and works in New York for his entire life and yet he can t correctly state the date of the worst terrorist attack on American soil which happened in his own backyard and claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people.Donald Trump is a disgrace and Salma Hayek just put him in his place with a single tweet.Featured Image: Gage Skidmore
