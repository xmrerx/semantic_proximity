Maybe it s time for Muslim citizens and immigrants to start assimilating.
What a concept Texas has just made a move that is sure to have many people cheering, and a select few angry.
As the march to Sharia Law presses on, it appears Texas is fighting back.Over the past few years, Texas has been quick to take a stand against President Obama and implement the laws necessary to protect its citizens.
Now, the Texas legislature has just passed a law designed to permanent bar Muslims from instituting Sharia Law in the Lone Star State.While State Sen. Donna Campbell doesn t specific measure Islamic law in the bill, her measure guarantees that no laws from foreign courts will be admissible by Texas civil court judges.
It s just to provide some belt and suspenders to make sure that, with judicial discretion, we don t trump Texas law, American law, with a foreign law regarding family law, Campbell told reporters.Muslim groups have already criticized the bill, calling it a solution looking for a problem.
They also argue that the bill will only perpetuate Islamophobia.
What do you think?
Do you support the measure?
