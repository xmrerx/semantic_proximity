moscow ( reuters ) - russia does not rule out ordering the united states to cut its diplomatic staff in russia to 300 people or fewer , ria news agency quoted senior foreign ministry official georgy borisenko as saying on wednesday .
in july , moscow told the united states to slash the number of its diplomatic and technical staff working in russia by around 60 percent , to 455 , in a further sign of souring relations .
the figure of 455 was meant to mirror the total number of russian diplomats working in the united states , but also included russian nationals working at the united nations in new york , borisenko , head of the foreign ministry s north america department , told ria .
the fact that in the summer we took into account the people working for russia s mission at the u.n. , this was good will , borisenko said .
if they haven t appreciated this , we have the full right to reduce ... the number of u.s. diplomats , he said , adding that moscow could stop taking russian u.n. staff into account when calculating what parity between the two countries meant .
in this case , the number of american personnel in russia should decline to a level of 300 or below .
a spokeswoman for the u.s. embassy in moscow said washington hoped that complying with the russian requirements would mean both countries could stop trading retaliatory measures , ria later reported .
the deterioration of relations does not serve the interests of either side .
we hope that the downward trend in relations has come to an end , ria quoted embassy spokeswoman maria olson as saying .
