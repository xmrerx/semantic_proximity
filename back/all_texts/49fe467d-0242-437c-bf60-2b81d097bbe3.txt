BRASILIA (Reuters) - A majority of the judges on Brazil s Supreme Court voted on Wednesday to send new graft charges against President Michel Temer to the lower house of Congress, which must authorize any trial of a sitting president.
Last month, Temer s allies in Congress blocked the first corruption charge against the president, saving him from facing a possible Supreme Court trial that could have ousted him from office.
