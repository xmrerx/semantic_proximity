On Friday, Donald Trump decided to distract from revelations that intelligence agencies had identified the individual Russians who delivered hacked documents to Wikileaks on behalf of The Donald s best friend Vladimir Putin by proving to the world that what he lacks in his desire to attend intelligence briefings he makes up for in his adherence to the principle that ratings aree everything.
Wow, the ratings are in and Arnold Schwarzenegger got swamped (or destroyed) by comparison to the ratings machine, DJT.
So much for .
Trump tweeted.
Nine minutes later, he added, being a movie star-and that was season 1 compared to season 14.
Now compare him to my season 1.
But who cares, he supported Kasich & Hillary.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017While it is true that Celebrity Apprentice debuted with low numbers 44 percent down from the last year Trump hosted, this probably has more to do with the fact that the President-elect is still listed as executive producer for the show than any other factor.
After all, more than half the country wants nothing to do with him as President, or as part of a television show that has been steadily dropping in ratings for years.

Trump" pic.twitter.com/4MNvPlmi7J Steve Kopack (@SteveKopack) January 3, 2017Naturally, as The Donald has spent more time b*tching about Celebrity Apprentice than attending intelligence briefings like Fridays, where he gets to learn the identity of the Russians who delivered the information Trump says they didn t get from a hack ordered by Vladimir Putin to rapist-in-hiding Julian Assange s shady website.
Twitter, naturally, descended on The Donald, brutally mocking him for, well, just being him..@realDonaldTrump Sir: how can you find time to tweet on Apprentice ratings but not receive an intelligence briefing?
West Wing Reports (@WestWingReport) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump Kind of like getting beat by almost 3 million votes when running for president?
Aaron Gouveia (@DaddyFiles) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump It must be exhausting to be this petty.
Mark Pytlik (@markpytlik) January 6, 2017His show ratings tanked bigly after the first season.

@realDonaldTrump Another great presidential tweet.

For the love of God, get off Twitter.
Now.

Ashvin Lad (@ashvinlad) January 6, 2017 Ratings are bad bc Americans are boycotting the show & your brand, you slow bully!
@realDonaldTrump @lovealaska1105 https://t.co/ZPQIwQNKad Sonia Mota (@SoniaKatiMota) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump Read an intelligence briefing, not a Nielsen briefing Jason Solomon (@solomonster) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump if you just added "nanny nanny boo boo.
I'm rubber, you're glue!"
that tweet would be complete.
#unpresidented #maga Kristine Schachinger (@schachin) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump Ratings machine?
History Revisionist.
First season was OK at 7 spot.
Down hill from there.
So sad pic.twitter.com/GvTCs9fL7w Subvert Trump (@_Robespierre__) January 6, 2017Trump may be tweeting about ratings, but he surely has a lot on his mind with the intelligence briefing.
After all, he has maintained for months that he had secret information that proves Vladimir Putin s gang didn t hack his political enemies for him.
He has repeatedly attacked our intelligence agencies for bringing it to light.
As ABC reports, the proof that Trump was lying to the American people is quite strong:Overnight just hours after President Barack Obama received the report new details emerged of just what is contained in the secret document.A senior official briefed on the intelligence sources, methods and assessments in the report that Trump will receive this morning told ABC News that the findings are clear: the evidence points directly to the Kremlin and to Russian President Vladimir Putin in what one official described as multiple streams and types of intelligence collection, not just forensic examinations of the hacked systems.
Those various streams of information gathered by U.S. spy agencies include signals intelligence such as intercepts of communications between Russian officials in which they implicated the Kremlin s own espionage, as ABC News reported last month.The Washington Post reported late on Thursday that the eavesdropping caught senior Russian officials actually cheering Trump s surprise victory in November as a success of the Kremlin s intelligence program.And Vice President Joe Biden who was privy to the classified briefing that Trump will receive today told the PBS NewsHour that, there s overwhelming consensus in the community and overwhelming evidence supplied by the community that Russia did engage in an effort to impact on the elections.
There is clear evidence that they in fact were engaged in activities designed to try and impact in the outcome of the election, Biden said, while noting there was no evidence that they actually tampered with voting booths or tampered with voting rolls.
Referring to parts of the report which will be made public next week, Biden said: It will state clearly that the Russians did as a matter of policy attempt to discredit the US electoral process and attempt to hurt Mrs. Clinton.
Contrary to Trump s public bloviations Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, says that the attacks were approved at the highest level of government in Russia and by that, he means that the highest is President Putin.
Recently, Barack Obama expelled more than 30 suspected Russian intelligence operatives from the country.
Vladimir Putin responded by saying he would wait to respond until his puppet sorry, Trump was officially President.Featured image via Getty Images (Andrew Renneisen)/screengrab
