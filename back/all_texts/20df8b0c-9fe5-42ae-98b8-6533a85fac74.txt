WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday he hoped to see compromise immigration reform that combines border security measures with protections for immigrants who were brought illegally to the United States as children.
President Donald Trump on Tuesday ended a program for so-called Dreamers and gave Congress six months to find a legislative fix.
In a New York Times interview on Thursday, Ryan was asked if he would put the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program to a vote.
“I’m going to put a consensus plan on the floor, because I want members of Congress in both parties to talk to each other and find consensus on this issue.” Ryan said the DACA issue was a symptom of failure of security at U.S. borders.
“It is only reasonable that while fixing this serious real problem, we also try to address the root cause of that problem.
And that is border security,” he said.
“That is where I think the consensus lies.”
