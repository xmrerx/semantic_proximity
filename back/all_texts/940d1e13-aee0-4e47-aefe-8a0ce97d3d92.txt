Donald Trump is a reality television star and we ve heard from numerous people, including President Obama himself, that this is not a reality show like he thinks.
Jeb Bush repeatedly hammered Trump for not being a serious candidate.
Enter his top strategist, Paul Manafort, who spoke to Chris Matthews on MSBNC Tuesday night, where he directly reinforced the serious joke that is Donald Trump and his campaign.Manafort and Matthews were discussing just how exciting the GOP convention will be.
Manafort insisted that, since Trump is already a TV star, he understands the media, and he can make the convention and everything else very entertaining.
It s just absolutely, fantastically frightening that we have a candidate with a strategist who thinks this is all just entertainment.The kicker in this interview came when Matthews and Manafort got into this exchange:MATTHEWS: You re going to have to break some eggs, though, right?
MANAFORT: I don t think we have to break any eggs.
MATTHEWS: Reince Priebus is going to give us an exciting convention?
Come on!
MANFORT: Donald Trump is going to give you an exciting convention.
MATTHEWS: Okay, how?
Do you have some movies or- MANAFORT: We re going to have a program put together, it s not put together yet- MATTHEWS: A reality show of some kind?
MANAFORT: Well, this is the ultimate reality show, the presidency of the United States.
This made us facepalm our eyeballs into the backs of our heads.
Watch the whole bizarre exchange below:So there it is.
Manafort himself admitted that the Presidency of the United States is, in his view and probably Trump s view, a reality show.
That is the most incredible, and unbelievable, position a candidate can take.
A Trump presidency will literally make us the world s biggest punchline, whatever Trump himself thinks.Featured image via screen capture from MSNBC video
