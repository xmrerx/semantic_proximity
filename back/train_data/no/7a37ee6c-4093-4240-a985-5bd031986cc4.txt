i think we are in a real moment like nixon ? ? ?
he [ trump ] did all of the dogwhistles .
this is not bernie sanders populism , this is george wallace populism that he s doing .
but he can not say he did not run a campaign that has created a lot of racial fears and a lot of divisiveness and he played to the crowd and he knew what he was playing to .
[ is he talking about obama ?
] i know him here in new york .
he knew exactly what he was doing .
he was playing to the worst elements .
the question is now what are you going to do ?
