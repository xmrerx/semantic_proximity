jodie foster gives a dose of common sense to set the record straight on the phony war on women being pushed by the left : i don t think there is a big plot to keep women down jodie foster said she s tired of people oversimplifying the issue of gender equality in hollywood , declaring that there isn t some major plot in the industry to keep women down .
the 53-year-old money monster director made the comments wednesday during a panel at the tribeca film festival with fellow director julie taymor , variety reported.ms .
foster said , i feel like the issue is way more complicated than saying , why aren t women making big mainstream franchises ?
there are so many reasons , she continued .
some of them are about our psychology , some of them are about the financial world , some of them are about the global economy .
there are so many answers to that go back hundreds of years .
it would be nice to be able to have a more complex conversation and to be able to look at it more than just a quota or numbers .
i don t think there is a big plot to keep women down , she added .
it is neglect really , and a lot of people that weren t thinking about it , and a lot of female executives who have risen to the top , who have not really made a dent of bringing many women into the mainstream world .
money monster , ms. foster s fourth feature film which premieres next month at the cannes film festival , tells the story of a failed investor who holds a television commentator hostage on live tv , variety reported .
though it comes at a time when wall street is at the center of debate in the democratic presidential race , ms. foster insisted the film isn t meant to be political .
for me really it is a character film , she told the magazine .
the backdrop of technology is really interesting to me .
technology is making us closer and we have this virtual intimacy that sometimes feels closer than real intimacy .
