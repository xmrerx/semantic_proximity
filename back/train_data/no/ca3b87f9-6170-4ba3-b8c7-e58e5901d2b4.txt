london ( reuters ) - heathrow airport announced a public consultation on the proposed development of a third runway at europe s biggest airport , saying it aimed to mitigate the environmental impact of expansion .
prime minister theresa may backed a $ 22 billion expansion of the london hub in october 2016 , after decades of government indecision .
but the plan has been controversial , with critics highlighting the possible impact on air quality in london and noise levels in the local community .
heathrow said it would seek the views of locals on the environmental impact of expansion and how the airspace around heathrow is managed .
over the past year , we ve been working hard to evolve our expansion plans and have come up with several new options to deliver it more responsibly and affordably , said the airport s executive director for expansion emma gilthorpe .
the new discussions are separate from a previously announced government consultation on a national policy statement on airports , and is focused on the airport s plans for infrastructure and the impact on the local community .
transport secretary chris grayling has said that the government aims to give the go-ahead to the new runway in the first half of 2018 .
the latest consultation will launch on jan. 17 and run for 10 weeks .
