No time to waste we've got to fight with everything we've got to #DefendDACA.
Thanks, @jorgeramosnews, for sharing these powerful stories.
https://t.co/rNtZZ4ONBy Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 4, 2017Mediaite But what about the interview Hillary did with CNN s Christiane Amanpour to promote her previous book, Hard Choices ?
A video has emerged showing the interview where Hillary told Amanpour that she believed the DACA kids should be sent back.During the exchange, Clinton had some tough words for the children of illegal immigrants, including waves of unaccompanied minors coming in 2014 telling Amanpour that the United States was a nation of laws and that they probably had to go.Watch at the 2:20 mark: The exchange went like this:AMANPOUR: So, you re saying they should be sent back now?
CLINTON: Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back.
But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families.
And just as Vice President Biden is arguing today in Central America, we ve got to do more.
I started this when I was secretary to deal with the violence in this region to deal with border security.But we have so to send a clear message, just because your child gets across the border, that doesn t mean the child gets to stay.
So, we don t want to send a message that is contrary to our laws or will encourage more children to make that dangerous journey.
Of course, Hillary is never one to keep her promises.
As soon as she began campaigning, she began to change her tune on DACA: Well, they should be sent back as soon as it can be determined who responsible adults in their families are, because there are concerns whether all of them should be sent back, said Clinton.
But I think all of them who can be should be reunited with their families.
