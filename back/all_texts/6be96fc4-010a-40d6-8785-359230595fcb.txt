At one time, Ann Coulter thought Donald Trump was the greatest thing to ever happen to America.
But apparently, she doesn t feel that way anymore because she just freaked out all over Twitter screaming about Trump s daily melodrama and failure to follow through on any of his campaign promises.Yesterday, the Trump administration kept in place Obama s unconstitutional executive amnesty.
Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) June 16, 2017This daily Trump melodrama is worth it ONLY if he s really going to build the wall, cut off Muslim refugees and deport illegals.
Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) June 16, 2017Today s BORDER WALL CONSTRUCTION UPDATE: Miles completed yesterday Zero; Miles completed since Inauguration Zero.
NEXT UPDATE TOMORROW.
Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) June 16, 2017Anyone in a Southwestern state who strolls to the border & drops a brick will have done more to build the wall than @realDonaldTrump.
Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) June 16, 2017If @VP Pence were smart, starting making noises about how he d LOVE to build a wall.
He d be sworn in as president about 2 weeks.
Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) June 16, 2017I thought w/ Trump we d finally have a president helping OUR country.
So far: Syria, Saudi Arabia, Israel, Italy, China, N Kor.
Today: Cuba!
Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) June 16, 2017At least Cuba s in our hemisphere.
How long can it be before Trump gets to America?

Mediaite reached out to Coulter for a comment and her response made it crystal clear where she stands with Trump at this particular moment.
It was a whole series today!
This jackass is really ticking me off.
And today Cuba?
F*cking Cuba?
If he d run a campaign promising to do everything he s done in the last 6 months, he d never have been elected.
Even Trump s most loyal supporters are fed up with his bullsh*t. His approval ratings are dwindling by the day and no one with any sense at all wants to be associated with him or his administration.
And now, even Ann Coulter has had it with him.
Things sure don t look good for Trump right now.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
