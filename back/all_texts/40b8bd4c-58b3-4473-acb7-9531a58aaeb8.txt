TOKYO (Reuters) - The leaders of Japan and Britain pledged on Thursday to cooperate in countering the threat posed by North Korea, two days after it fired a missile over northern Japan.
North Korea s reckless action is a threat to Japan, Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told his National Security Council.
Japan and Britain will cooperate to counter this.
British Prime Minister Theresa May, attending the meeting during a visit to Japan, said: Through our deepened security partnership, we must work together to enhance our collective response to the threats to international order and global peace and stability.
And that must include confronting the threat that North Korea poses and ensuring that this regime in North Korea stops its aggressive acts.
