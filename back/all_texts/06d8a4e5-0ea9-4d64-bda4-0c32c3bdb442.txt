Newsweek s Kurt Eichenwald, who also serves as a senior editor at Vanity Fair and goes hard at conservatives in his reporting, is an avid Twitter user.
He also has epilepsy, and some deplorable fuckwits have taken advantage of that and his Twitter presence to literally harm him they ve sent him tweets with strobe effects specifically intended to induce an epileptic seizure.What kind of a black-hearted animal does someone have to be to do something like this?
It s not bad enough that these deplorables were threatening Eichenwald s kids following his on-air brouhaha with Fox News Tucker Carlson?
They have to go after him and literally harm him?Epileptic seizures are not a joke.
They can be very serious.
And make no mistake, intentionally inducing a seizure in someone, especially as harassment, ought to be considered assault under the law if it isn t already.
In fact, Eichenwald s wife took to Twitter on his account to call this jackass out on that:@jew_goldstein This is his wife, you caused a seizure.
I have your information and have called the police to report the assault.
Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) December 16, 2016@jew_goldstein s account was suspended at the time of this writing, but that s a mere slap on the wrist for what they did.Another horribly sick thing here is all the responses to Ms. Eichenwald s tweet.
Right-wing nutjobs clearly don t give a damn about what happened.
Take a look at a sampling, if you can (this writer s heart is breaking):@kurteichenwald @jew_goldstein Yes, Police, I d like to report an assault by JEW GOLDSTEIN' AltRight_GOP (@WeDaGOPNow) December 16, 2016@WeDaGOPNow @Trump_a_right @jew_goldstein @kurteichenwald His tweets loud like a bomb I was traumatized TheRightStuff (@ThaRightStuff) December 16, 2016@ThaRightStuff @WeDaGOPNow @Trump_a_right @jew_goldstein @kurteichenwald finally someone is actually literally shaking Sally Baker (@SallyBakerCake) December 16, 2016@kurteichenwald @jew_goldstein BWAHAHAHAH THIS IS THE FUNNIEST AAAARRGH cough aaaaackkk ..DAMMIT NOW IM HAVING A SEIZURE!

Alpha Mike Foxtrot (@AlphaMikeFox2) December 16, 2016@TrumpetyTrumpet @kurteichenwald @TuckerCarlson Can you lead with this tomorrow?
Also, an explicit mention of the maestro, @jew_goldstein tx Bill Smith #7933 (@Trump_a_right) December 16, 2016The Dallas Morning News reported earlier that Eichenwald is taking a short break from Twitter, which is confirmed in his own tweetstorm over this incident.
Eichenwald says that this specific tweet read, You deserve a seizure, in addition to containing the strobe video.
His break from Twitter is for self-protection.
His tweetstorm over this is below and contains a warning to anyone else who might consider doing this to him.
Here s hoping there are actually consequences and he doesn t ever have to worry about this again.For self-protection, I am taking a short twitter break.
I will be spending that time with my lawyers & law enforcement going after 1 of u Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) December 16, 2016Last night, for the second time, a deplorable aware I have epilepsy tweeted a strobe at me with the message you deserve a seizure on it Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) December 16, 2016 it worked.
This is not going to happen again.
My wife is terrified.
I am disgusted.
All I will be tweeting for the next few days are Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) December 16, 2016 copies of documents from the litigation, police reports etc.
Once we have the lawsuit filed, we will be subpoenaing Twitter for the Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) December 16, 2016 identity of the individual who engaged in this cross-state assault.
At this point, the police are attempting to determine if this is Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) December 16, 2016 a federal crime because it appears to be cross state.
This kind of assault will never happen again without huge consequences.
This Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) December 16, 2016 individual will be going to court, and he will be paying a price.
And if any of you others ever try this again, I will make sure it Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) December 16, 2016 happens to you.
Online anonymity does not protect criminals.
Thats why subpoenas exist.
You are facing a criminal investigation and a Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) December 16, 2016 lawsuit.
So if any of you others think about trying this cute prank, consider the consequences.
They will be severe.
Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) December 16, 2016Again, I will not be seeing your comments or tweeting for awhile except to upload copies of litigation and police documents.
Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) December 16, 2016Otherwise, I ll be back once it is clear from the paperwork i will be tweeting that this is not a joke.
See you soon.
