paris ( reuters ) - the independence speech made by catalonia s leader was a trick , spanish foreign minister alfonso dastis said on wednesday , although he said there was room for negotiations within the frame of spain s constitution .
carles puigdemont s speech to the catalan parliament on tuesday was a trick to say one thing and do the opposite , dastis told french radio station europe 1 .
puigdemont leader balked at making a formal declaration of independence from spain on tuesday , calling for talks with madrid over the region s future in a gesture that eased fears of immediate unrest in the heart of the euro zone .
asked about the possibility of organize another referendum in catalonia , dastis said that spain s constitution does not allow it .
we can not accept that a portion of the catalans decide for the whole of spain , he said .
