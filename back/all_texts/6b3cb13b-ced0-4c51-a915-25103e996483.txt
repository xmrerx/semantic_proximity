Mary J. Blige has a beautiful voice but this sit down with Hillary is just awkward.
It s really odd that Hillary acts so phony and stiff during this singing interview.
We re not buyin it!
We re betting HRC is thinking she d rather be in her jammie onesie with a zippy cup of chardonnay by her side.
Inauthentic doesn t even come close to what this is gag worthy but funny at the same time.Like you ve never seen them before.
@MaryJBlige sits down with @HillaryClinton.#The411 Coming September 30th.https://t.co/hbaWqfjJcp pic.twitter.com/P2qpm3h3Pm Apple Music (@AppleMusic) September 27, 2016 Moonbattery had this to say about the song American Skin : The song, American Skin (41 Shots), is Bruce Springsteen s irritating exploitation of African immigrant Amadou Diallo getting shot by police who thought he was shooting at them in the Bronx in 1999.
The outrageously unfair and irresponsible song, which implies that Diallo was killed on purpose for being black, inspired a boycott of Springsteen s shows by the NYC Patrolmen s Benevolent Association.Shrillary appears to be going whole hog with the Black Lives Matter pandering.
