bogota ( reuters ) - colombia s government is urgently working with congress on a law that would lay out terms of surrender for crime gangs such as the gulf clan , president juan manuel santos said on thursday , after the gang declared a unilateral ceasefire .
the gulf clan , also known as the usuga clan and the autodefensas gaitanistas , has been accused of operating drug trafficking routes in partnership with mexican cartels and taking part in illegal gold mining .
it announced a ceasefire on wednesday and has said its members were willing to turn themselves in .
santos , speaking at a event about the eradication of coca crops in antioquia province , hailed the ceasefire and said a surrender of the group would be welcome , but added that security forces will not halt actions against the group .
if this organization wants to surrender to justice it s very welcome and we re working with the justice minister to put together some decrees and there s a law in congress to facilitate the collective surrender of the gulf clan that we are classing as urgent , santos said .
the president has said the government will not negotiate with the group because members are criminals and not politically motivated rebels like the now-demobilized revolutionary armed forces of colombia ( farc ) or national liberation army ( eln ) .
defense minister luis carlos villegas , speaking at the same event , said operations against the clan will continue .
the fact that they won t shoot is good news but if they continue to commit crimes they will be targeted , he said .
we are not going to suspend operations or lower our guard .
