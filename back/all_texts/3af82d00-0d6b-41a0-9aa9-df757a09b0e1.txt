President Obama could not hold back the tears while discussing the excessive amount of lives lost over the years at the hands of guns during his press conference on Tuesday.
In what is perhaps one of his most emotional speeches in recent memory, President Obama asked the nation to start having a sense of urgency to finally get rid of gun violence, once and for all.Now, every time the president speaks, the nation notices.
This time, however, the president practically cried on live TV.
It wasn t the type of crying a baby would do, but rather the sort of emotional embrace you would expect a strong leader to show talking about an issue as critical as this one.With that said, actions speak louder than words and even tears.
That is why the president not only gave a great speech but announced what his new executive actions on gun control would entail.
The gun lobby might be holding Congress hostage right now but they cannot be holding America hostage.
Anybody in the business of selling firearms must get a license and conduct background checks After Connecticut passed a law requiring background checks and gun safety courses, gun deaths decreased by 40%.
A violent felon can buy the exact same weapon over the internet with no background check, no questions asked.
1 in 30 people looking to buy guns from one website had a criminal record.
This is not a plot to take away everybody s guns We can find ways to reduce gun violence consistent with the Second Amendment.
People are dying.
And the constant excuses for inaction no longer do.
No longer suffice.
That s why we re here today.
