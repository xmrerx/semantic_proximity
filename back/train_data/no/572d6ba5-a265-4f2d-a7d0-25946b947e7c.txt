munich , germany ( reuters ) - german chancellor angela merkel s conservative alliance should avoid making big policy commitments before they start coalition negotiations , potential junior government partners said on thursday .
germany is set for months of uncertainty after merkel s cdu/csu alliance won a fourth term in sunday s election but bled support to the far-right alternative for germany ( afd ) .
the christian social union ( csu ) , merkel s party s bavarian ally , has signaled it wants a rightward shift , to focus on security and setting a limit on immigration numbers to dampen the appeal of the afd , a policy firmly opposed by the greens .
this could complicate merkel s hopes of building a three-way coalition between the conservatives , the pro-business free democrats ( fdp ) and the pro-immigration , environmentalist greens .
nobody should set out maximal demands that could already be seen as ruling it ( such a coalition ) out , greens leader cem ozdemir told the funke newspaper group .
merkel s christian democratic union ( cdu ) and will meet with the csu on oct. 8 to seek a common position ahead of negotiations with the other parties .
the fdp also warned against making commitments that would undermine coalition prospects .
even if there s no guarantee of success , it would be wrong to pull down the shutters this early , party general secretary nicola beer told the rnd newspaper alliance .
little movement on a coalition is expected before an oct. 15 vote in the western state of lower saxony , currently ruled by the social democrats ( spd ) - who have said they will go into opposition at the national level - and the greens .
leading economic institutes said on thursday that the next government can count on record budget surpluses over the next two years due to a solid upswing , potentially facilitating merkel s task of building a coalition .
