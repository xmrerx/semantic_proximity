riyadh ( reuters ) - saudi arabia said on thursday it had dismantled an islamic state cell in the capital riyadh , in connection with a plot to launch a suicide attack on the defense ministry .
two militants were killed and five others arrested in raids on three locations on wednesday , an official source in the newly-created presidency of state security said in a statement on state-run television .
deadly bombing and shooting attacks have been mounted by islamic state militants against security forces and shi ite muslims in saudi arabia .
islamic state has for years criticized the leadership of the western-allied kingdom , the world s top oil exporter , accusing it of deviating from their strict interpretation of islam and advancing the interests of their u.s. enemies .
thursday s statement said a suicide bomber in the eastern riyadh district of al-rimal detonated his vest after security forces surrounded a house used to manufacture suicide vests and explosives .
another militant was killed by security forces after he holed up with firearms in an apartment in the western district of al-namar , it said .
the third raid was at a horse stable in the southern riyadh suburb of al-ghanamia which the statement said had been used as a headquarters .
security forces seized firearms and bomb-making materials , shown on state television along with a burned out car and a damaged building where the first militant had blown himself up .
the suspects were not identified .
security forces closed off several areas in riyadh on wednesday , and videos shared online showed a plume of smoke rising at one location .
the plot to attack the defense ministry , uncovered last month , allegedly involved two yemeni nationals and two saudi citizens .
a saudi security source said at the time that one of the detainees was a member of the armed houthi movement , which is locked in a 2-1/2-year-old war with a saudi-led coalition in yemen .
