sharia is creeping into our american way of life every day .
the town of hamtramck , michigan is a perfect example of islam quietly taking over towns across america .
it s really a silent invasion and americans are just rolling over and letting it happen.a recent article we reported on regarding sharia in america : minneapolis muslim tries to enforce sharia in neighborhood : people who don t know me would say i m a terrorist and another : tough texas mayor who fought back against implementation of sharia law in her city will join trump team [ video ] and another : texas muslims praying in methodist church claim : sharia is just like the constitution [ video ] see our point ?
this is creeping into our towns and has already taken over in hamtramck : in case you haven t heard , this michigan town just recently became the first town in america to have an all muslim city council .
this town went from being a diverse blend of many cultures to being majority muslim .
michigan is heading in the direction of being majority muslim with the next democrat candidate for governor being muslim this is why what s happening at this high school is so disturbing we bend over backwards to accommodate muslims for fear of being called islamophobic .
all the while , sharia is becoming more and more accepted .
