london ( reuters ) - britain will pursue a balanced policy on immigration once it has left the european union by seeking to attract high-skilled workers while driving the overall numbers down , defence secretary michael fallon said on wednesday .
the guardian newspaper published a leaked government document late on tuesday detailing plans to drive down the number of lower-skilled eu workers coming to britain once it has left the eu in 2019 .
we ll set out firm proposals later in the year , fallon told sky news .
there is a balance to be struck , we want to attract to this country , not shut the door , on highly skilled people who want to come here and make a contribution to our society .
equally we have to make sure that british companies are also prepared to train and train up british workers .
the public are very clear , they want to see immigration not stopped but brought properly under control .
they also want to be clear that we implement what they voted for in the brexit referendum .
