Here on the eve of this historic election, we face what is perhaps the most important election of our lives.
We ve watched not just the story of two campaigns during this general election season.
We ve also watched the story of two Americas.
With GOP nominee Donald Trump, we see a dark, divisive vision of America, a country that deports vulnerable, hard-working immigrants without cause, a country that shuns LGBTQ people, controls women s bodies, and threatens political opponents with prison.On the other hand, with Hillary Clinton, we see a beautiful, diverse, bright future that we can be proud of.
We see inclusion, an end to crushing debt for college students, equality across the board, a nation that accepts all no matter race, ethnicity, religion, creed, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, or any other defining characteristic.
We see an America where everyone is welcome, where we can be proud to call ourselves a great nation that loves ALL of its people.Well, popular pop artist Katy Perry has put those ideas together in a brilliant new campaign ad for Hillary Clinton.
Set to her hit song Roar, the video shows everyday Americans with hopes and dreams like we all have.
Flashing across the screen, words tell the story of why they are voting for Hillary Clinton.This election decides who our country is for generations to come, my fellow Americans.
I already proudly voted for Hillary, and did everything I could to campaign, donate, phone bank, and get out the vote.
I know what kind of America I want us to be.
Do you?Without further ado, I leave you with this video, entitled ROAR, to inspire you in this historic time.
