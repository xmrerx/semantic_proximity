washington ( reuters ) - the pentagon will need to buy up to 18 more russian-built rd-180 engines to power rockets carrying u.s. military satellites into space over the next six years or so , deputy defense secretary robert work said in an interview on friday .
congress banned use of the russian rd-180 rocket engines for military use after 2019 , following russia ’ s annexation of the crimea region of ukraine in 2014 .
but u.s. lawmakers eased the ban late last year , worried that it could drive united launch alliance , a joint venture of lockheed martin corp and boeing co , out of business and leave only privately held spacex to lift satellites into space .
work said the united states needed to ensure there were at least “ two affordable and reliable means into space. ” he added the rd-180 would be needed only during what he described as a transition period of new domestic rocket engine development .
“ we just don ’ t see any way you can get a new engine in anything less than six years , ” work said .
“ and so , therefore , in the transition period , we believe strongly that we need rd-180 space engines .
no more than 18 but , you know , that ’ s our position. ” senator john mccain , chairman of the senate armed services committee , is pushing to end u.s. dependence on russian engines used by united launch alliance to power its atlas 5 rockets .
mccain said last month that two russians placed on the u.s. sanctions list because of events in ukraine were leaders of russian space agency roscosmos , which he said was the parent of the company that makes the rd-180 rocket .
ula has said it was moving forward with two companies developing their own u.s. engines , blue origin and aerojet rocketdyne holdings , but such development programs were difficult and took years to complete .
