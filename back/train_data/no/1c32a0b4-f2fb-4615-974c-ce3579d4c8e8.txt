new delhi ( reuters ) - an indian court on thursday acquitted a former telecoms minister , politicians and business executives of graft and money laundering charges in the grant of telecoms licenses due to lack of evidence in one of the country s biggest corruption scandals .
the case relates to alleged below-market-price sale of lucrative telecoms permits bundled with airwaves in 2008 , which a federal auditor said may have cost the government as much as $ 28 billion in lost revenue .
a special court convened by the federal investigator was called to give its verdict on the accused , including former telecoms minister a. raja .
the prosecution has miserably failed to prove its charge , defense lawyer vijay aggarwal told reporters , citing the judge s ruling .
shares of companies affected by the case rose after the verdict , with reliance communications ltd gaining as much as 13.3 percent , db realty jumping nearly 20 percent and sun tv networks ltd rising as much as 6.8 percent .
the scandal dented the fortunes of then prime minister manmohan singh and his government , which oversaw the sale of the licenses at below-market prices , and triggered street protests .
it was one of the several scandals that emerged during singh s second term , hobbling policymaking and diverting the government s attention away from pushing forward crucial economic reforms .
the uncertainty hurt business sentiment in asia s third-biggest economy , and led to questions about the government s efforts to crack down on corruption .
in 2012 , the supreme court ordered 122 licenses held by eight operators to be revoked , declaring the licenses illegal and the process wholly arbitrary , capricious and contrary to public interest .
