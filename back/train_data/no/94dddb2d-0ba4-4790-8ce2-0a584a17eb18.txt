milan ( reuters ) - italy s ruling democratic party ( pd ) has lost further ground over its rivals after political infighting and fallout from a banking scandal , an opinion poll showed on sunday .
the poll comes just weeks before parliament is expected to be dissolved before elections early next year .
the pd share of the vote fell 1 percent , from eight days ago , to 23.4 percent , its lowest level in five years , according to the ipsos poll in the newspaper corriere della sera .
support for the pd , headed by former prime minister matteo renzi , has fallen steadily in recent months , with the group damaged by deep schisms and personality clashes .
the party has also come under fire over allegations cabinet undersecretary maria elena boschi took steps to try to save banca etruria , a local bank based in her home town of arezzo .
boschi has repeatedly denied exerting any political pressure in deciding the future of banca etruria .
the ipsos poll said growing support from smaller allies had raised the center-left bloc s share of the vote to 26.2 percent , as of dec. 14 , from 24.8 percent .
that was well short of the 36 percent polled by the center-right bloc led by former prime minister silvio berlusconi .
it was also behind the 28.2 percent share of the 5-star anti-establishment party .
the 5-star movement is predicted to emerge as the largest single party in the next parliament , but it has repeatedly ruled out joining any coalition .
italy has just introduced a new electoral system that is expected to handicap 5-star , favoring instead mainstream political blocs .
italy s parliament is likely to be dissolved between christmas and the new year , opening the way for national elections in early march that look unlikely to produce a clear winner .
