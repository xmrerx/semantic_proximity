as a catholic , i m not sure what offends me more , my fellow catholics who would vote for an anti-life , lying criminal who has put our entire nation s security in jeopardy , or a catholic who would vote for a woman whose campaign team mocks my faith wikileaks has released another 1,000+ hacked emails from clinton campaign chairman john podesta .
the anti-secrecy organization announced part three of their leak on tuesday afternoon : release : the podesta emails part 3 ( 1190 new emails ) # hillaryclinton # podestaemails # podestaemails3 https : //t.co/wzxeh70oum pic.twitter.com/75jvhpvtx8 wikileaks ( @ wikileaks ) october 11 , 2016amongst the newly released documents , one email exchange in particular should draw the ire of conservatives and american catholics specifically.the 2011 email , entitled conservative catholicism , comes from john halpin , a senior fellow at the left-wing center for american progress ( cap ) , and is addressed to jennifer palmieri , formerly of the cap and current director of communications for the 2016 hillary clinton presidential campaign , and john podesta .
the email , in which traditional catholic beliefs are derided as backwards , drips with contempt for catholic americans .
many of the most powerful elements of the conservative movement are all catholic ( many converts ) from the sc and think tanks to the media and social groups , halpin writes to podesta .
they must be attracted to the systematic thought and severely backwards gender relations and must be totally unaware of christian democracy .
palmieri piles onto the catholic bashing in her response .
i imagine they think it is the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion , palmieri writes .
their rich friends wouldn t understand if they became evangelicals .
imagine the same had been written about muslims .
