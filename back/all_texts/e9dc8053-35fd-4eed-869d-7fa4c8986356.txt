Several high school seniors in Texas won t be having such a high old time for graduation this year, and it s all their own damn fault.
17-year-old Ryan Westbrook, 18-year-old Ethan Sigmund, 18-year-old Christian Joeckel, 17-year-old Hayden Honoloka and 18-year-old Cameron Bodenstab will now be spending their remaining high school days facing charges for a racist crime.
The teens allegedly spray painted whites only near a water fountain on their rival s campus, Martin High School.
They claim it was a senior prank.

We hope that @ArlingtonISD investigates & enforces policies soon.

The charges include their spreading hatred based upon race and sexual orientation.
Arlington police Lt. Christopher Cook says of the situation: They re pretty remorseful.
I don t think that they gave a lot of thought into the ramifications.
Unfortunately you re held accountable and there s consequences when you engage in this behavior.
Local station WFAA also says that there were other things that were spray painted on trash cans and banners at Martin High School by these geniuses that is unfit to be printed by any news outlet.Well, boys, this is much more than just a prank.
You re clearly racists, and you deserve whatever you have coming to you.
