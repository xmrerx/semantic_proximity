This is cute and hilarious.During his show on Thursday night, Jimmy Kimmel pointed out to his audience that it was Sarah Palin s birthday.
The half-wit former governor of Alaska is now 52-years-old and continues to defend her status as America s Village Idiot.Kimmel didn t break out into a rendition of Happy Birthday, even though the copyright claim on the song has been vanquished by a federal judge.
Instead he let a little girl on stage to deliver a birthday message to Palin dressed as a birthday card.Third-grader Lindsey then stepped through the curtain dressed as Palin with an American flag as the background and gave the audience the most adorable mocking of Sarah Palin ever witnessed.
Hi everybody, I m Sarah Palin!
she began.
Is today my birthday?
You betcha!
I m 29-years-old, but the lame-stream media says I m 52.
I support Donald Trump, because we need a straight shooter in the White House.
I know straight shooters because I once shooted a whole zoo from my helicopter.
Well, I gotta go make my husband Todd a moose pie.
Obama s the Anti-Christ!
Bye-bye!
Here s the video via YouTube:As you may all nightmarishly recall, Palin jumped to reappear in the spotlight in order to endorse Donald Trump last month in a bizarre rant that made everyone think of the Yosemite Sam character in the Looney Tunes cartoons.
How bout the rest of us?
Right wingin , bitter clingin , proud clingers of our guns, our god, and our religions, and our Constitution, Palin said during her endorsement speech.
Tell us that we re not red enough?
Yeah, coming from the establishment.
Right.
