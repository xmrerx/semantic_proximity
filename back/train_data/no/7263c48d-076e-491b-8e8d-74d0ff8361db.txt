islamabad ( reuters ) - militants have crossed into pakistan from afghanistan and killed a pakistani army officer and a soldier , the pakistani military said on monday .
the uneasy neighbors , both of which are important u.s. allies , accuse each other of harboring militants on either side of the border , and their two armies have exchanged fire across it during periods of tension over recent years .
four pakistani soldiers were wounded in the attack on a military post in the northwestern region of bajaur , the army said .
it did not say when the raid took place but said up to 10 of the attackers were believed to have been killed in pakistani retaliatory fire .
independent verification was not possible as the area is largely closed off to reporters .
pakistan and afghanistan share a rugged , porous border of 2,500 km ( 1,500 miles ) .
afghanistan , which does not recognize the border , has lately been angry over a pakistani plan to build a fence along most of it .
the pakistani army said the absence of afghan central government s writ on its side of the border facilitated such militant attacks .
there was no immediate response from the afghan government .
the attack came a week after unidentified gunmen shot and killed a pakistani diplomat near his residence in the eastern afghan city of jalalabad .
