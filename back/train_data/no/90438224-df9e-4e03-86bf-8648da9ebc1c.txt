waterbury a federal agent , with help from an informant , went undercover for nearly two years to document food stamp fraud occurring at an inner-city market whose employees were busted in recent weeks.though w.b .
trade fair supermarket , a small corner market on willow street , had dusty cans and only one regularly used register , federal authorities estimated they have redeemed almost $ 5.7 million in food stamps since 2011.but those benefits weren t used to provide nutritional food to city residents , rather they were swapped for cash , glass smoking pipes and even power tools , federal authorities allege.a recently unsealed federal search warrant for the store shows an undercover agent with the office of the inspector general suspected the store of trafficking , or exchanging large amounts of benefits for cash.tallat mahmood , 63 , raul carlos monarca , 40 , and tahir shahzad , 32 , of harrison , n.y. were charged with federal food stamp fraud and illegally trafficking in food stamp benefits.the food stamp program is aimed at giving low-income residents the ability to purchase nutritious foods using a type of debit card called an ebt .
but people enrolled in the program are barred from buying booze , cigarettes , paper goods and soap , among other items .
the market is well stocked with everything from rice and sugar , to doorknobs and scented candles.but authorities say the trio allowed customers to illegally swap their federal food stamps , known as supplemental nutrition and assistance program or snap benefits , for cigarettes , bongs , hookahs and glass smoking pipes , which are in display cases at the front of the store.when the ebt card is run through a special terminal , the total amount of items is inputted by the store , which is then deducted from the person s snap account .
when that occurs , that inputted amount is then transferred to the store s bank account.federal authorities allege the men exploited those transfers , giving customers a meager portion of their snap benefits in cash , while the rest went into the store s bank account .
store employees are supposed to ensure the items being purchased are eligible for the benefits when they run the person s ebt card.the store opened in early 2011 and by march of that year the owners applied to accept snap benefits , federal authorities allege .
the store redeemed $ 6,532 in snap benefits in april 2011 , but by march of this year , that one-month tally had grown to more than $ 179,000 , according to federal documents.the agent , along with an informant , visited the store 19 times starting in 2014 and paid about $ 7,381 in snap benefits in exchange for about $ 2,905 in cash and a number of eligible and ineligible items such as soda , chips , glass pipes , bongs , hookahs , and hardware .
for instance , in april , the agent was given $ 200 cash , two glass smoking pipes , an electric circular saw and cigarettes in exchange for $ 583 in snap benefits.only weeks later , a federal snap employee visited the store under the guise of inspecting it to talk about snap rules and regulations.shahzad indicated he knew that exchanging cash for snap benefits was prohibited , while mahmood stated the benefits were to buy food , that s it and no lottery .
only weeks later during another visit by the undercover agent , an employee at the store gave him $ 200 cash for $ 540 in benefits.though authorities suspect the store redeemed more than $ 5 million in federal benefits , the store employees were charged with fraud based on a roughly 18-month span starting in 2014 where the store took in $ 3.2 million in benefits .
this practice results in illegal profits to traffickers , misuse of government funds intended to provide food for needy families , and the creation of a market for stolen or fraudulently obtained snap benefits , the agent wrote of alleged traffickers , according to a federal search warrant for the store.the store now only accepts cash for payment , according to a sign on its door.mahmood and shahzad are free after they posted bond , but they were ordered to surrender their passports .
monarca has not been released from jail .
if convicted , they face a maximum of five years in prison.the principal member of the store is listed as aijaz ahmed , according to state business records , but he has not been charged with any crime.via : rep-am
