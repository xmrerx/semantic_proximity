jakarta ( reuters ) - hardline muslim groups in indonesia burned photos of u.s. president donald trump , as well as u.s. and israeli flags , on monday during a protest outside the u.s. embassy against trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel .
indonesia , home to the world s largest muslim population , has joined a global chorus of condemnation of trump s controversial move on israel , which they say threatens security and stability in the middle east and the world .
the status of jerusalem , a city holy to jews , muslims and christians , is one of the thorniest barriers to a lasting israeli-palestinian peace .
jerusalem s eastern sector was captured by israel in a 1967 war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally .
palestinians claim east jerusalem for the capital of an independent state that they seek , while israel maintains that all of jerusalem is its capital .
hundreds attended the protest outside the u.s. embassy in jakarta , which was barricaded by barbed wire and dozens of police officers .
let us witness the destruction of israel s hegemony , one protest leader shouted into a megaphone as protesters burned an israeli flag .
we will support palestine with our blood .
many protesters waved palestinian flags and carried banners supporting intifada , or an uprising against israel , and rally leaders also shouted anti-semitic slogans .
the protest was led by the islamic defenders front , an aggressive vigilante group that calls for sharia , or islamic religious law , to be imposed in indonesia , a secular country .
the demonstration followed a much larger protest at the weekend , where thousands called for diplomatic relations with the united states to be severed and for the u.s. ambassador to be expelled .
indonesia supports a two-state solution in the israel-palestine conflict .
