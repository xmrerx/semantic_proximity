John Oliver isn t known for mincing words when it comes to his description of Republicans.
Last night was no exception as he left no hold barred when he discussed the insanity of the Republican candidates during the debates.His primary focus was on the man that has an uncanny tendency for outdoing himself for his insane behavior: Donald Trump.
This time, however, he had a partner in Marco Rubio.
After showing a clip of Rubio s size-of-hands-equals-penis joke and Trump s response, Oliver said: That s right, Donald Trump just talked about his dick during a presidential debate.
A dick which I presume looks like a Cheeto with the cheese dust rubbed off!
Building on the momentum, Oliver included clips of many Republicans disavowing their support for Republican front runner Donald Trump, including commentator Doug Heye who called a possible Trump nomination, an abortion on our own party and the end of the Republican Party as we know it.
Oliver said: Holy shit!
You know they re getting desperate when they re just throwing in their favorite buzzwords.
He won t just be an abortion, he ll be a sharia law wrapped in a Benghazi-themed gay wedding.
Oliver then went on to give a reading of from former wife Ivana Trump s creepy thinly-veiled autobiographical soft-core novel For Love Alone, as read by actress Morgan Fairchild: In a moment, they were on the floor, on top of the mink coat, Katrinka s legs gripping his waist, as he moved deeper and deeper into her.
As Adam pulled away from her, his c*ck fell for a moment into the valley between her legs, leaving a smear of semen on the dark silk.
He smiled with satisfaction.
Now you have to keep the coat.
