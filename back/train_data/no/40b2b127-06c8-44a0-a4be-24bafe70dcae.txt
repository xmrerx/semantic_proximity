baltimore ( reuters ) - the u.s.-led battle against islamic state militants controlling parts of iraq and syria is gaining steam and will show more progress by year ’ s end , vice president joe biden said on thursday .
biden touted the recent success of u.s. efforts backing iraqi troops against the islamic state in iraq as part of a broad defense of obama administration foreign policy .
“ i promise you , after ramadi , watch what happens now in raqqa in syria and what happens in mosul ( iraq ) , by end of this year , ” he told u.s. house of representatives democrats , in baltimore for a three-day retreat .
iraqi forces , boosted by u.s. training , have evicted insurgents from large parts of ramadi , leading to speculation that they could have success elsewhere against the islamic state .
“ we ’ ve taken back collectively 40 percent of the territory they occupy , ” biden said .
white house spokesman josh earnest , asked about biden ’ s remarks , said he had not yet heard them .
but he added , “ obviously , we ’ re going to need to get isil leaders out of mosul and out of raqqa and that ’ s a significant task .
we know that they ’ ve been dug into those cities for a while now , and that means it ’ s going to be hard to dig them out. ” isil is one of the acronyms referring to islamic state .
the democratic vice president attributed recent successes to more engagement by european countries and turkey .
“ the president has finally got the attention of europeans to pony up because they haven ’ t been doing much of anything , ” biden said , adding , “ i spend too much time probably with president erdogan , but erdogan has seen the lord .
things are changing because of self-interest. ” biden and turkish president tayyip erdogan discussed ways to deepen cooperation in the fight against islamic state in a meeting in istanbul on saturday , according to a white house statement on sunday .
