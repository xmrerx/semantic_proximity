One of the biggest mysteries in Constitutional Law is what the Framers meant when they said natural born citizen.
Section 1 of Article Two of the United States Constitution states the eligibility requirements for serving as president of the United States, and under clause 5 one would find the natural born requirement:No Person except a natural born Citizen, or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty-five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.The Supreme Court will have the option to take up the case, if it so chooses, now that the lawsuit challenging Ted Cruz s eligibility to be President has been filed.Retired Utah lawyer Walter Wagner has led the birther movement against Ted Cruz, filing multiple lawsuits in federal court to block the Texas Republican from seeking the nomination.
Wagner lost his case in Utah District Court, with Judge Jill Parrish writing:Nowhere does Mr. Wagner allege how he will be injured in a personal and individual way.All cases must show that the individual bringing the lawsuit has suffered, is suffering, or will suffer an injury personal to them, and that their rights have been violated.
Wagner contends that he does have a vested interest, saying it s his job at insuring that all candidates for the position of president are legally qualified.
Basically, he s a taxpayer and an American citizen, so he has a particular interest in who the president is.After being smacked down in Utah, Wagner appealed to the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver and subsequently the U.S. Supreme Court.Hopefully the Justices see fit to end this ridiculous talking point, seeing as though Trump will most likely emerge as the nominee.
Also, establishing sound Constitutional decision to this long mysterious issue.
