Americans are getting sick of Donald Trump and his campaign slogan.Trump remained silent on the first day of the new year but returned to Twitter on Monday to once again declare that he will Make America Great Again in all caps.Well, the New Year begins.
We will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017Unlike his ridiculously offensive first attempt to wish Americans a Happy New Year in which he referred to millions of people as his enemies, Trump tried to strike a different tone this time by using words like we and together.
But Twitter users weren t buying the bullshit Trump was trying to sell..@realDonaldTrump Sweetie, for the new year, maybe it s time to drop the campaign slogan WHILE you re Presidenting.
Most people do!

@realDonaldTrump Otherwise it seems like you haven t really thought it out beyond a hashtag, dear.
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump America has always been great for a small number of parasites (like you) who unjustly possess vital assets and resources.
The Socialist Party (@OfficialSPGB) January 2, 2017@melissa4697 Unjustly because, like other capitalists, he is a parasite living off the rest of society.

Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Even your American enemies?
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Together, huh?
It feels like just last year you called more than half the country your enemies.
Nick Jack Pappas (@Pappiness) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump It was a strange New Year, though.
At midnight, we went from the year 2016 to the year 1933.
Nick Jack Pappas (@Pappiness) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Did you send this tweet in Russian as well?
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Well, the New Year begins.
How about finally releasing your taxes & offering a real plan to reduce conflicts of interests?

Anthony Domanico (@ajdomanico) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump this is certainly progress.
Nothing misspelled.
Matthew C. Pabreza (@Putitindabasket) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump You are a national embarrassment.

For that, he should publicly apologize and refrain from posting such divisive tweets for the next fours years.
Or better yet, just stop user Twitter entirely.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images
