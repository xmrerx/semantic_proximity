BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s parliamentary speaker said on Monday it was too early to talk about the country s government having resigned or the formation of a new government after Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri said at the weekend he would stand down.
President Michel Aoun said on Sunday he will not decide whether to accept or reject the prime minister s resignation until Hariri returns to Lebanon from Saudi Arabia, from where he made the announcement.
Speaker Nabih Berri said in a televised statement he agreed with Aoun s statement.
