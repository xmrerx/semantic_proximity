Election night on November 8, took everyone by surprise.
The polls showed Hillary Clinton up pretty much everywhere she needed to be, yet Donald Trump still somehow squeezed out a victory.We saw the shock first hand, the same shock that likely overtook everyone, live on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah s coverage of the election.
They really didn t seem to believe how close the race had become.After Noah asks senior Hillary correspondent Desi Lydic about how the Clinton campaign is holding up on election night, she responded with: We will just have to wait a little longer than expected to find out if America prefers a competent sane woman or a misogynist troll doll.
Unfortunately, we all now how that turned out, and even The Daily Show s senior political correspondent Jordan Klepper, who was supposedly at the Trump rally really couldn t believe what was going on, and joked about how everyone there assumed they were going to lose and was ready to blame it on being rigged.
Needless to say, the entire night took everyone by surprise except for maybe Donald Trump himself, who always assumes himself a winner, and this time, to the horror of us all, he was right.Watch it all happen here:Featured image via video screen capture
