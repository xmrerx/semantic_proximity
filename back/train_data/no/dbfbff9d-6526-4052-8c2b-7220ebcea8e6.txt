even though this # blacklivesmatter terrorist clearly calls for the killing of whites and cops in her youtube videos , latausha nedd denies it .
no word yet from her mother yet on how she wouldn t harm anyone and doesn t have a racist bone in her body https : //youtu.be/d3ywqlvqiooa blacklivesmatter activist in clayton county , ga , was ( finally ) arrested after making threats against police officers on her youtube channel.latausha nedd who calls herself eye empress sekhmet was arrested for making threats against police officers and taken into custody .
in the video of her arrest , she claims since her threats were on a youtube channel , they were somehow innocuous .
but nedd has built up a pretty good resume of violent , racist and criminal calls to bloodshed.here s the video where nedd declares open season on the motherf * cking crackers , points a gun at the camera and shows images of white police officers.https : //youtu.be/vmhramzpjjkwsb-tv is reporting nedd denied advocating killing cops , even though that s precisely what she did .
this is about a youtube video ?
i ve seen worse on youtube , nedd said from the back of a police cruiser .
all i said was defend yourself against people who want to kill us .
that s all .
i never said anything more than that .
nedd claims she s harmless .
but according to police , her words are as dangerous as any weapon.here she is protesting stone mountain with more racist , anti-american # blacklivesmatter idiots : it s also the reaction she solicits or anyone solicits from people who may be listening , register said.nedd remains in the clayton county jail , charged with making terroristic threats and transmitting those threats through social media.nedd has been involved with the blacklivesmatter movement for some time .
