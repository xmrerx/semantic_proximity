kigali ( reuters ) - a critic of rwandan president paul kagame will appear in court on friday charged with inciting insurrection and forgery , the prosecutor s office said on thursday .
diane shima rwigara , a 35-year-old accountant , is the latest political opponent of kagame to face criminal charges .
she was barred from contesting the presidency in an august election he won with 98.8 percent of the vote .
she has repeatedly accused him of stifling dissent and criticized his rwandan patriotic front s tight grip on the country since it fought its way to power to end a genocide that killed more than 800,000 people in 1994 .
the court will examine the serious grounds justifying provisional detention of the suspects , the prosecutor s office said on twitter .
the office noted that the other two suspects to appear in court are rwigara s mother adeline and sister anne .
the three women have been in detention for around two weeks .
they were first taken from their home in the rwandan capital on aug. 30 on tax evasion allegations related to the family s tobacco company .
that charge was not listed in those filed on tuesday .
kagame has been widely praised for restoring stability in rwanda and presiding over a rapid economic recovery after the genocide in the east african nation .
but human rights groups say he has muzzled independent media and suppressed potential democratic opponents .
some critics of the government have been imprisoned or killed .
rwanda last month charged another opposition official and eight others with forming an armed group and seeking to overthrow the government .
with each arrest in rwanda , fewer and fewer people will dare to speak out against state policy or abuse , read a human rights watch in a report released last month .
