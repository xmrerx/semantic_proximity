Barbra Streisand was an Obama sycophant and one of the corrupt Clinton s most loyal fans.
She is also part of the Hollywood liberal resistance movement.
Much like Rosie O Donnell, Kathy Griffin, and literally hundreds of overpaid celebrities, Barbara Streisand is obsessed with tweeting about how much she hates President Trump.
It s Streisand s latest tweet that has conservatives calling her out for her complete and utter stupidity .Streisand tweeted: Collusion or no collusion, @realDonaldTrump should be impeached for sheer stupidity.
Collusion or no collusion, @realDonaldTrump should be impeached for sheer stupidity.

You can't impeach a President, because of your feelings, Barbra.
