christmas the perfect time to pander to muslims there is a reason his mother never let him be king .
during a recent radio broadcast , charles , britain s prince of wales , told his listeners that christians should give thoughts to the prophet mohammed during this christmas season.clip via the telegraph normally at christmas , we think of the birth of our lord jesus christ , he said on radio 4 s thoughts for the day .
i wonder though if this year we might remember how the story of the nativity unfolds , with the fleeing of the holy family to escape violent persecution .
the crown prince then likened that event to mohammed traveling to medina in search of converts .
and we might also remember that when the prophet muhammad migrated from mecca to medina he was seeking the freedom for himself and his followers to worship .
prince charles then claimed that all religious groups want the same thing the ability to live and worship in peace and to allow others to do the same .
whichever religious path we follow , the destination is the same to value and respect the other person , accepting their right to live out their peaceful response to the love of god , he said.the prince of wales then appeared to go after both president-elect donald trump s populist message as well as great britain s departure from the european union based , in part , on the influx of immigrants from middle eastern countries .
we are now seeing the rise of many populist groups across the world that are increasingly aggressive towards those who adhere to a minority faith .
all of this has deeply disturbing echoes of the dark days of the 1930s , he said .
