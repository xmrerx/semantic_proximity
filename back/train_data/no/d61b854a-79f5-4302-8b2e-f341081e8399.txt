new york ( reuters ) - u.s. democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton ’ s probability of winning the white house gained in online betting markets following the first debate of the campaign on monday night between her and republican donald trump .
a clinton contract on the popular predictit betting market gained 6 cents from the previous day ’ s level to 69 cents , while a contract favoring donald trump ’ s prospects for victory tumbled 7 cents to 31 cents .
contracts are priced from 0 cents to 100 cents , with the contract price equating to a probability of whether that candidate will win the nov. 8 election .
the price swings for both candidates were the largest since early august , and placed clinton ’ s lead in that market at the widest in about two weeks .
clinton ’ s prospects also improved on the irish betting site paddy power .
about halfway through monday ’ s debate , she was shown as a 1-to-2 favorite , and those odds shortened to 4-to-9 in the moments after the debate ended .
trump ’ s odds lengthened to 23-to-10 from 9-to-4 .
the swing following the debate put the brakes on a big trump price rally on predictit that coincided with a tightening in most public opinion polls .
the implied probability of him winning had risen to 38 cents on sunday from just 28 cents at the end of august .
bets on trump fell as low as 5 cents on february but went up as high as 44 cents in may .
bets on clinton , the persistent favorite in most wagering markets , went as low as 37 cents in january and as high as 79 cents in august .
the debate on monday was the first of three scheduled face-offs between the two candidates before the nov. 8 election .
