By now, you ve probably heard that at a recent Ted Cruz rally, Carly Fiorina fell off the stage right after announcing the candidate and his family.
She s fine, don t worry.Yet, leave it to Donald Trump to use this moment to his advantage in front of his band of merry morons.Trump told his crowd in Carmel, Indiana: Carly s perfectly nice.
By the way, she fell off the stage the other day.
Did anybody see that?
And Cruz didn t do anything.
Even I would have helped her, OK?
Basically saying, even I, the biggest jerk on earth, would have given her a hand.
Then he just kept going with it, because you know, Trump: They just showed it to me coming in.
I said, No, I didn t see it.
They just showed it to me and I said, wow, that s really cruel.
She fell off she just went down.
She went a long way down, right?
She went down right in front of him and he was talking.
He kept talking.
He didn t even look like that was a weird deal.
Man.
And then they were both talking.
She was talking from the back and he was talking from there.
They re both talking.
No, it was weird.
Writing out a Trump transcript is very unique, because he will literally repeat himself over and over and over as though you didn t get it the first time.Of course, Trump is making a mountain out of a molehill.
Cruz likely didn t even see her fall, and she was back to the stage within seconds.
All that aside, it is still wildly bizarre that Carly Fiorina is a running mate of a person who likely won t come near enough delegates to secure the Republican nomination.Watch part of Trump s diatribe here:Trump: Even I would have helped Fiorina up: https://t.co/zsb3c5vlqO https://t.co/RLxk64Ae3o POLITICO (@politico) May 2, 2016Featured Photo via Win McNamee/Getty Images
