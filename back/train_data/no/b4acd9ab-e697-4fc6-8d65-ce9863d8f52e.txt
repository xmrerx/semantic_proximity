prague ( reuters ) - the czech president s spokesman likened the european union to the third reich of adolf hitler on thursday while criticizing the bloc s executive over a regulation on food safety .
jiri ovcacek made the comment while citing the case of an ingredient in a czech potato-based alcohol locally known as rum that can not be labeled that way due to an eu ban which says the term must be reserved for cane-based spirits .
the eu s food watchdog , the european food safety authority ( efsa ) , has ruled that the ingredient , called rum-ether , should be discontinued and replaced gradually from april 2018 on the grounds that it contains a material that can damage body cells .
ovcacek shared an article from a czech news website on his facebook page on the issue , adding the comment : the empire has decided that there will be no tuzemak ( czech rum ) to drink in the protectorate .
empire in the czech context is often understood to refer to hitler s third reich , while the protectorate is what the country was called by the nazi regime during world war two .
when asked about the comment , ovcacek said his words were warranted because such actions by some in the eu damaged its reputation .
it points to the absolute insensibility of the european commission , ovcacek said .
ovcacek s comments have led to controversy before , such as his outbursts against prime minister bohuslav sobotka and some of his ministers , and even against the czech media .
czech president milos zeman has portrayed himself as a europhile and fan of a federal eu .
but he has also expressed pro-russian and anti-immigration views and built up relations with china , in contrast to the pro-western and human rights-based style of czech foreign policy established by the late president vaclav havel .
