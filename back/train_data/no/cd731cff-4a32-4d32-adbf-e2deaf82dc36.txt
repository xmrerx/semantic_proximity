at this point , it s fair to ask , what is donald trump s deal ?
from allegedly paying russian prostitutes to drain the swamp all over a bed because obama once slept in it to stealing a photo from our last legitimate president s inauguration and attempting to pass it off as one of his own , to erasing as much of obama s agenda as he could from the white house website , to immediately going for obamacare s throat , it almost feels like the donald s only purpose is to erase the president s legacy and douse it in russian lady pee .
now , it seems , he even stole a cake design from obama.duff goldman , aka the ace of cakes made a very nice cake for the inaugural celebration .
according to eater , it weighed between 40 and 50 pounds , stood about four feet tall , and featured red velvet , lemon poppy seed , pumpkin chocolate chip and pineapple coconut flavors .
goldman designed the cake to honor all five branches of the military by displaying each of their seals prominently on the side of the cake basically , it s patriotic as f * ck .
here is a photo of trump , pence , and one of the few immigrants they like admiring the cake : washington , dc january 20 : president donald trump , his wife first lady melania trump , vice president mike pence and karen pence clap before cutting the cake during a salute to our armed services inaugural ball at the national building museum on january 20 , 2017 in washington , dc .
president donald trump was sworn in as the 45th president of the united states today .
( photo by alex wong/getty images ) here s the thing , though : goldman didn t make that cake for trump he made it for obama in 2013 .
trump just stole the design .
the cake on the left is the one i made for president obama s inauguration 4 years ago , goldman wrote on twitter friday .
the one on the right is trumps .
i didn t make it .

yes , that s right trump plagiarizes a cake .
naturally , even the folks on twitter were kind of surprised that trump would steal a cake design and much mockery ensued : @ sunchbunny @ duff_goldman or urine .

first plagiarized speeches , now plagiarized cakes .
lexistential ( @ lexistential ) january 21 , 2017 @ duff_goldman they stole your design after melania failed to come through .
fortunately someone took a photo of her cake before it was binned pic.twitter.com/ffjyzuchcl tan joll ( @ cukeyishere ) january 21 , 2017at this point , trump s seeming desire to both be and destroy obama is looking , well , pretty fucking crazy .
but , hey if this trend continues , maybe we ll see donaldcare ( an exact replica of the affordable care act with an idiot s name attached ) appear as trump s replacement .
it s not like he has a plan of his own.featured image via screengrab
