As you re probably aware already, Donald Trump released an Instagram video this past week in which he attacks Bill Clinton s embattled sex life while tarring Hillary Clinton as being a women s rights hypocrite for remaining married to Bill.Insane.It only gets more insane when the video shows Hillary and Bill flanked by another Bill Bill Cosby.On Thursday night s edition of The O Reilly Factor, yet another Bill Bill O Reilly along with former White House Press Secretary Dana Perino, reviewed the video.
At the tail end of the segment, O Reilly said something that ought to shock everyone.O Reilly said to Perino, [B]y making Hillary Clinton the focus, and this ad that we re going to show you features Cosby, Monica Lewinsky.
O Reilly continued, You know, I don t know if Hitler made it, but you know, he might have.
It s crazy.
So, yes, Bill O Reilly just compared Donald Trump to Hitler.
Frankly, I don t quite know how to feel about this.
On one had, O Reilly violated Godwin s Law by invoking Hitler during a political discussion.On the other hand, O Reilly isn t totally wrong.
Obviously, there s only one Hitler, and I ve resisted the urge to go there, but the ad is classic propaganda, the likes of which the Nazi regime perfected during its terrible reign.
Maybe the compromise is Joseph Goebbels, Hitler s minister of propaganda.
But we re still in Godwin s territory.Then again, if a prominent conservative wants to give the Democrats a big chunk of excellent video for a future commercial, I m all for it.
If the Democrats haven t archived this clip for a series of ads, and perhaps sent a letter to O Reilly, thanking him for the easy win, they re insane.
This ought to play in pro-Hillary or pro-Bernie ads from now until November.
Thanks, O Reilly.Via Media Matters: Featured image via Twitter
