london ( reuters ) - it does not make sense for britain to retain the european union s charter of fundamental rights after it leaves the bloc , britain s brexit minister david davis said .
parliament began debating legislation on thursday to sever political , financial and legal ties with the eu , but the opposition labour party has said it can not support the bill without it being amended to better protect workers rights .
we also do not believe it would make sense to retain the charter of fundamental rights , davis told parliament .
the charter only applies to member states when acting within the scope of eu law .
we will not be a member state nor will we be acting within the scope of eu law once we leave .
he added : the charter catalogues the rights found under eu law which will be brought into uk law by the bill .
it is not , and never was , the source of those rights .
