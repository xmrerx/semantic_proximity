Stephen Colbert had his own solution to Trump skipping the debate on Thursday: Since 25 million viewers were denied the opportunity to see Trump debate, Colbert decided to moderate his own hilarious debate where Trump debates Trump and where Colbert would would pick up those 25 million viewers for his own ratings.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WpKiP_gmDS8]The Late Show host said that the GOP front-runner was the star of this year s top reality show, and renamed it celebrity the president, so it was only fitting that he have his chance to shine on the stage.Colbert used footage of two Trumps being asked the same question, but with contradictory responses on different occasions.
For example, on Jan. 17, Trump had said that no one likes Ted Cruz once they get to know him, yet on Dec. 11, Trump said that he liked the Texas senator a lot.
Trump had also said as recently as this month that he loved the people of Iowa but during a speech in November, he wondered how stupid are the people of Iowa?
In July, Trump said that Hillary Clinton was the worst Secretary of State in the history of the United States.
However, in March 2012, he said Hillary was a terrific woman, saying, I think she does a good job and I like her.
And of course, there was Megyn Kelly.
This week, Trump said he had zero respect for Kelly, adding that she s highly overrated and doesn t do a good job.
However, a previous clip shows that in 2011 Trump told Kelly during an interview that she has done a great job, by the way, and I mean it, he said, with a creepy smile.In his segment, Colbert is able to show the contradictions and hypocrisy that Trump exemplifies in a way that is hilarious but shocking in terms of how Trump, despite being Trump, continues to lead in the polls.Featured image via YouTube screenshot.
