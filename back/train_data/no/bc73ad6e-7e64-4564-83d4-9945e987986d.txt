this is so good !
rand paul knows his climate truth .
jake tapper is totally embarrassed by the argument from paul who tells tapper and all liberals to knock off the hysteria on climate : my goodness , the sky is falling because the world is billions of years old and the most severe climate change events happened millions of years before the industrial revolution .
the hysteria is embarrassing but expected : you need to make sure that your viewers know that most of climate scientists models have been wrong .
they adjust it every year because they haven t been good at predicting things .
but obviously scientists have been predicting for years that the temperatures would go up , that glaciers would shrink , that sea ice would disappear , that oceans would rise , that the sea level would rise and there would be longer and more intense heat waves and all of that has happened , senator ,
