MSNBC host Rachel Maddow found the perfect way to simultaneously report and mock the conservative movement s collective freak out that they saddled themselves with Donald Trump as a presidential nominee.
She looks their actual words, turned them into spoken word poetry and performed them live on-air.Maddox introduced the segment by claiming she was taking a moment to honor the concerns of Republicans across the country who, after several years of swinging to the right, landed there with Trump.
The Sarah Palins, Rick Perrys and Chris Christies of the party might well be happy to pump Trump, but far greater numbers have simply refused.It speaks volumes about how far the GOP has fallen, that George W. Bush, considered at home and abroad one of the worst and extremist Presidents in US history is now looking like the moderate wing of the party.
Both George W. Bush and his father and former President George Bush Sr have announced their refusal to back Trump in his campaign to be the next President of the United States.Not only does Dubya appear moderate next to Trump, he appears articulate too.
Explaining his reasons for rejecting the Trump campaign, he said: I understand that Americans are angry and frustrated.
But we do not need someone in the Oval Office who mirrors and inflames our anger and frustration.
The former presidents have since been joined by Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney, and Benn Sasse with other big names in the GOP yet to make their position known.It was all too much for Maddow, who decided to turn this unholy mess into art and make a seriously hilarious skit out of it all.
She takes verbatim quotes from Republicans freaking out about Trump and performs them with all the sincerity of a performance poet.
