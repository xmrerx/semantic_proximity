(Reuters) - A U.S. district judge in Detroit has issued an order temporarily restraining the Trump administration from carrying out immigration restrictions in a presidential executive order, according to a court document.
Judge Victoria Roberts issued the order on Thursday in response to a motion filed with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan seeking a permanent injunction “that prohibits the denial of entry into the United States of legal permanent residents and those with valid immigrant visas” under President Donald Trump’s Jan. 27 order.
