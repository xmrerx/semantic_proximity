Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) said Sunday Democrats would absolutely raise the corporate tax rate if they take back control of Congress.
If the Democrats take control of the Senate, and you caucus with the Democrats, what s the promise to America about what will be done to reverse the state of affairs that you re so unhappy with?
CBS host John Dickerson asked on Face The Nation.
Sanders jumped into income inequality before changing the subject to child health care and the Dreamers before being interrupted by Dickerson to re-ask the original question.
If Democrats take control, are corporate taxes going up?
Dickerson asked.
I think we re going to take a very hard look at this entire tax bill and make it a tax bill that works for the middle class, and working families, not for the top one percent and large multinational corporations, Sanders said.Dickerson continued to press Sanders for an answer to Democrats raising corporate tax if they were to take control after the 2018 elections.
The Republican tax bill that could pass this week lowers the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent.Sanders is clueless when it comes to business and taxes probably because he has been on the government dole for life.
Sanders is in love with Socialism need we say more.
