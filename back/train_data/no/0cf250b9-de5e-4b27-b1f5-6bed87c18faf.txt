well , that didn t take long .
look for the first beastiality marriage license request in 5 4 3 2 1 nathan collier said he was inspired by the recent supreme court decision that made marriage equal .
he said he was particularly struck by the words of dissenting chief justice john roberts who claimed giving gay couples the right to marry , might inspire polygamy.and so this week , mr collier and his two wives , victoria and christine , entered a courthouse in billings , montana , and sought an application to legalise the trio s polygamous union , right now we re waiting for an answer , mr collier told the independent .
i have two wives because i love two women and i want my second wife to have the same legal rights and protection as my first .
he added : most people are not us .
i am not trying to define what marriage means for anybody else i am trying to define what marriage means for us .
the practice of bigamy holding multiple marriage licences is outlawed in all 50 of the us states , montana among them .
but mr collier said he planned to sue if his application was denied.mr collier said he was former mormon who had been excommunicated for polygamy and now owned a refrigeration business in billings.he married his first wife , victoria , 40 , in 2000 .
the 46-year-old , who appeared in the reality tv show sister wives , held a religious ceremony to marry second wife , christine , in 2007 but did not sign a marriage license to avoid bigamy charges.his first wife , victoria , said that she and her husband s second wife got along like sisters .via : independent uk
