oh , mr. spicey .
our favorite press secretary because we love to hate him .
his gymnastics around donald trump s antics and gaffes ( along with his own ) are already the stuff of legend , and not in a good way .
it makes his relationship with the press acrimonious , and he may well have just about had it with that .
today , he turned chickenshit , tucked his tail between his legs , and ran away from his own press briefing , leaving the white house press corps absolutely stunned.cries of , sean !
hey sean !
seeeeeean !
ah come on , sean !
he walked away !
are among just a few of the loud and disappointed protests coming from a press corps that undoubtedly had a squillion uncomfortable questions for him.watch below : .

pic.twitter.com/2xhzdkhtkm ( @ slickvandal ) may 2 , 2017some of the media are unhappy with this development , too , and really not afraid to say so .
mother jones called it the soundtrack for a presidency .
the hill said that spicer stunned reporters .
market watch noted that the press was left volleying questions toward an empty podium : sean ?
sean ?
hey , sean , come on !
what about the putin call , sean ?
the caption under their photo reads , it just like concluded .
the root had its own take : perhaps spicer needed some time to compose the alternative facts he knew he d have to present after salmon-skin stalin said tuesday that the new budget has enough money for a down payment on the wall , and sen. patrick leahy ( d-vt. ) , the senate appropriations committee s ranking democratic member , responded on twitter with , to be clear , there is no funding in this bill for any kind of down payment on construction of a new border wall .
or , maybe spicer was nervous about responding to trump s tweets from earlier tuesday insisting that the government needed a good shutdown . '
while some blindly loyal trump supporters are saying that he just owned the press , unfortunately for their narrative and for spicey here , answering questions he doesn t necessarily like or want to answer is part and parcel of his job .
he doesn t get to run away when he doesn t want to talk , or without explaining that his time is getting cut short for something else .
really , spicer just got owned here.featured image via screen capture from embedded video
