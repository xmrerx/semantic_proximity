wow !
apparently paul ryan forgot that trump won the nomination because the majority of americans chose him as their candidate .
it s not about who the republican elites choose paul .
should we just do away with elections altogether and let the establishment republicans choose our candidate for us ?
the people of the party he belongs to have chosen a nominee thursday on fox news channel s hannity , former house speaker newt gingrich criticized current house speaker paul ryan ( r-wi ) for his lack of endorsement of likely presumptive republican presidential nominee donald trump earlier in the day in an interview with cnn.gingrich told host sean hannity it was a big mistake and that it sets the wrong tone for the rest of the republican party .
[ i ] n the case of paul ryan he made a big mistake today and he needs to understand this , gingrich said .
he is the speaker of the house .
he has an obligation to unify the party .
he has an obligation to reach out .
obviously he and donald trump are going to have disagreements .
some of them will work out and some of them they won t. that s fine .
our constitution provides that speakers and presidents can fight , but i think he sends the wrong signal and a signal which i think endangers the house republicans and endangers the senate republicans .
i much prefer what mitch mcconnell did , what john mccain did they both said , ok game s over , we have a nominee .
i m for him , he continued .
and i think paul ryan has some obligation institutionally to be responsive to the fact that the people of the party he belongs to have chosen a nominee .
and frankly in the long history of american politics , donald trump is not outrageously outside the norm .
this kind of vitriol you get does not reflect accurately people who have been nominated for president over the last 200 years .
