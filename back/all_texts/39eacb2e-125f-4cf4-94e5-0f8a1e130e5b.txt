Donald Trump s refusal to release his tax returns has been an issue that has dogged him for his entire campaign.
While it is not legally required for presidential candidates to release those documents, it has been tradition for them to do so in the interest of transparency for the electorate.
However, Trump refuses.
He uses being audited as an excuse, but that makes no sense since all of the returns from previous years are not being audited, and, even if they were, that would not prevent him from releasing them.
Trump isn t releasing his taxes because there is something in there that he doesn t want us all to see.
It s as simple as that.Well, GOP Rep. Steve King made an appearance on MSNBC s Morning Joe on Monday morning, and of course, Trump s tax returns became a topic of conversation.
Rep. King says of the matter: I just think the window for that has passed.
When he said that he wouldn t release his returns till the audit was over, and he d been being audited for 13 years, I d say that for him to release them is just a forgone conclusion.
Donald Trump will not release his tax returns.
King added: If he drops it now, into this presidential intense sprint around to the final turn part of the race, I think that would be the only discussion we would hear all the way until November.
Well, Rep. King, they ll be talking about it anyway.
Trump should release his returns so that people can see that he has nothing to hide.
You re right in saying that it is way past time for him to release these tax documents, and you re likely right that he won t do it, because there s probably some very damning things in there that would hurt his candidacy even more than the heat he is taking for refusing to release.Watch Rep. King s remarks below:.
