new york ( reuters ) - u.s. president-elect donald trump on wednesday endorsed a niece of former critic mitt romney to be the next chair of the republican national committee as he moved to put his stamp on the party leadership .
the rnc named michigan republican party chair ronna romney mcdaniel as its deputy chair , and trump said he looked forward to her taking over the party leadership .
trump ’ s incoming white house chief of staff , reince priebus , will leave the rnc chairmanship when trump takes office on jan. 20 .
“ i ’ m excited to have a highly effective leader in ronna mcdaniel as rnc deputy chair and i look forward to her serving as the party ’ s chairman in 2017 , ” trump said in a statement .
“ ronna has been extremely loyal to our movement and her efforts were critical to our tremendous victory in michigan , and i know she will bring the same passion to the republican national committee , ” he added .
the rnc ’ s 168 elected members will convene in january to elect their next chairman and trump ’ s endorsement of mcdaniel will likely carry enough weight to get her elected .
mcdaniel ’ s profile rose in trump ’ s view when she helped him win michigan in the nov. 8 election .
the state had not voted republican in a presidential election since 1988 and was critical to trump ’ s victory over democrat hillary clinton .
her selection came two days after trump passed over mitt romney to be his secretary of state , instead choosing exxon mobil corp chief executive rex tillerson .
trump and romney have gotten past their frictions during the republican presidential nominating battle when the 2012 republican nominee was critical of trump ’ s candidacy .
bob paduchik , a veteran republican operative in ohio who was trump ’ s campaign manager in that state , was named deputy co-chair of the rnc .
trump ’ s victory in ohio was also crucial to his victory .
