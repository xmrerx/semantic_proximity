Geraldo Rivera said his trip to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria confirmed how badly biased the press is against President Trump.
Having seen how he was treated in Puerto Rico and then seeing the press about how he was treated in Puerto Rico it was almost an absolute 100 percent disconnect, the Fox News contributor told Fox & Friends on Saturday.Rivera visited Puerto Rico and interviewed the president and first lady as they surveyed storm relief efforts in the devastated country.He remembered crowds who were ebullient about the president s visit.The federal government s response to Hurricane Maria has been far better than it is given credit for, he continued.
This president has the worst relationship not only with the press but with those on the other side of the aisle that I have seen since Richard Nixon, Rivera said.This wasn t the first time Geraldo Rivera exposed the lies and mischaracterizations of Trump and his actions.
Watch Geraldo tell Fox and Friends about Trump s actual handling of the Puerto Rican crisis versus the media s false narrative: He does not get the benefit of the doubt for anything.
Anything he does is construed in the most wicked, negative way possible.
