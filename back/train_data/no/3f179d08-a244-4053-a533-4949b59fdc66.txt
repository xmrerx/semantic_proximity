zagreb ( reuters ) - croatia s opposition parties on thursday demanded a no-confidence vote in the government over its handling of a crisis at the country s largest company , agrokor , but analysts said the ruling coalition would likely survive .
the government intervened in april because agrokor [ agrok.ul ] , the largest employer in the balkans , faced a debt and liquidity crisis .
given its importance , the crisis could have destabilized the economy .
the opposition led by social democrats says a liquidity loan agreed this summer with creditors including foreign investment funds to finance agrokor s operations through a 15-month period of restructuring lacked transparency and favored some creditors .
the sdp has a responsibility to expose corrupt activities , the sdp leader davor bernardic told reporters .
the government and agrokor s crisis manager ante ramljak rejected the opposition charge and said it achieved the best possible loan terms in the circumstances .
a debate and vote must take place by early december and the conservative-led coalition has a small but firm parliamentary majority .
i don t think this is a particularly wise move for the top opposition party ( social democrats ) as they are likely to achieve little .
i see it rather as an effort to divert attention from political weaknesses within their own ranks , said political analyst davor gjenero .
