WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney is under “active consideration” to serve as U.S. Secretary of State along with other candidates, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said on “Fox News Sunday.” Romney, who met President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday, was a critic of Trump during the campaign.
Pence said that Romney was willing to be considered for the position.
Trump was “very grateful that Governor Mitt Romney came in.
They had a good meeting.
It was a warm and a substantive exchange and I know he is under active consideration to be Secretary of State... along with some other distinguished Americans.” But Democrats were skeptical that Romney is an actual contender.
Representative Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said on CNN Sunday that he would love Romney to get the position and he would be a “consummate diplomat.” “But I think it’s a total head fake.
I think this is Donald Trump still being the entertainer, still running a show where he wants to build suspense and he alone knows who the contestant will be the winner.
It’s more of a nod to the appearance of bringing people together.”
