The incredibly talented voice actor, Billy West, who is probably best known for his work on the hit television show Futurama has resurrected one of the show s most notorious characters.
West posted audio of himself reciting quotes from Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump as the character Zapp Brannigan.
West posted the audio clips of his readings to Twitter, where they have been retweeted thousands of times.
The clips inspired people to create the hashtag #MakeTrumpBrannigan, a play on Trump s campaign slogan.Brannigan is the character everyone loves to hate.
Brannigan is an astonishingly inept military captain whose primary directive seems to be to spread misogyny across the universe.
You don t have to be a fan of the show to enjoy West s recitations of some of Trump s most infamous quotes.
Such as this one from 2012, where he tweeted that, the concept of global warming was invented by the Chinese.

This clip of the character is reading a quote from an interview in Forbes in 2014, where Trump said, It s not a wig, it s my hair.
