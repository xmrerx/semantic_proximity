dubai ( reuters ) - a bahraini civil society group has defended sending a delegation to israel as a gesture of tolerance and coexistence , state news agency bna has reported , after news of the visit sparked wide anger on social media .
the visit came amid high emotions in the arab world over u.s. president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel and move the u.s. embassy there from tel aviv , a move that was widely condemned across the arab world .
the visit by 24 delegates from the group called this is bahrain has prompted a hashtag # bahrain_resists_normalisation , in which twitter users declaring their opposition to what some called an act of treason against palestinians and bahrainis .
in a statement carried by state news agency bna late on sunday , the group said the visit was a private initiative to israel and occupied jerusalem comprising bahrainis and expatriates of various faiths .
the initiative by this is bahrain is based on the principle of tolerance and coexistence , an approach embraced by the kingdom of bahrain and a feature of its society , and aims to visit islamic , christian , jewish and other holy sites across the world , the group said .
