kuwait ( reuters ) - a kuwaiti court handed several lawmakers jail terms on monday for forcing their way into the parliament building in 2011 - a move that could cause political turbulence in the gulf arab region s most liberal state .
protesters burst into parliament in 2011 after lawmakers had been denied the right to question then prime minister sheikh nasser al-mohammad al-sabah about corruption allegations .
kuwait s al-qabas newspaper said the court sentenced current mps jamaan al-harbash and waleed al-tabtabai to five years and mp mohammed al-mutair to one year .
an outspoken former parliament deputy , musallam al-barrak , who earlier this year finished serving a two-year prison sentence for insulting the country s ruler , was sentenced to seven years .
the mps have a considerable political following , especially among kuwait s traditional tribes which have influence in areas outside the main cities .
kuwait avoided mass arab spring-style unrest though citizens held large street protests in 2012 after the emir sheikh sabah al-ahmad al-jaber al-sabah changed the electoral law .
while kuwait allows more freedom of speech than some other gulf arab states , the emir has the last say in state affairs .
there have been a series of political trials and authorities have revoked citizenship of some kuwaitis in the past several years that have drawn rebuke abroad and anger at home .
