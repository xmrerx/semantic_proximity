berlin ( reuters ) - brexit campaigner nigel farage said on friday that british prime minister theresa may might be out of a job by christmas unless she manages to get her party behind her and take charge of brexit negotiations .
speaking at an election campaign event for the right-wing alternative for germany ( afd ) in berlin , farage said may needed to rapidly assert her authority over her conservatives and also over the brexit negotiations .
if she doesn t do those two things - doesn t get some sense of order back into her own party and direction back into where the negotiations are going then i think the whispering campaign will go from something that is being done in private to being done in public and she might not last til christmas , he said .
at a citadel on the outskirts of germany s capital , farage said leading british ministers have been contradicting each other on a weekly basis so the government looked rudderless .
she has to stamp her authority on the party and do so pretty damn quickly , said farage , who while leader of the anti-eu ukip party played an important role in pressuring then-prime minister david cameron to hold the brexit referendum .
