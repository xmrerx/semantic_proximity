OSLO (Reuters) - Norwegian Defence Minister Ine Eriksen Soereide was named minister of foreign affairs on Friday, making her the first woman to hold the post in the Nordic country.
She replaces Boerge Brende, who last month was appointed president of the World Economic Forum.
The appointment leaves the top three government jobs, that of prime minister, foreign minister and finance minister, in the hands of women.
Prime Minister Erna Solberg said European Affairs Minister Frank Bakke-Jensen will move to the defense post, while Marit Berger Roesland will join the cabinet to take up the European affairs portfolio.
