washington ( reuters ) - the united states carried out its first air strikes against islamic state militants in somalia and killed several terrorists , the u.s. military said on friday .
the pentagon s africa command said the first strike was carried out at midnight local time ( 2100 gmt , thursday ) and another one at 11 a.m. on nov. 3 .
several terrorists were killed , the military said in a statement , adding that the strikes were conducted in coordination with somalia s government .
u.s. forces will continue to use all authorized and appropriate measures to protect americans and to disable terrorist threats , the statement said .
islamic state has been gathering recruits in the region , although experts say the scale of its force is unclear and it remains a small player compared to the al shabaab group .
last month , a group loyal to islamic state seized a small port town in somalia s semi-autonomous puntland region , the first town it has taken since emerging a year ago .
the group , which refers to itself simply as islamic state , is a rival to the larger al shabaab force , which is linked to islamic state s rival al qaeda and once controlled much of somalia .
the united states has occasionally carried out strikes against al shabaab militants in somalia , which retains a strong presence in parts of the south and center and carries out gun and bomb attacks .
the al shabaab group aims to drive out the peacekeepers , topple somalia s western-backed government and impose its strict version of islam on the horn of africa state .
more than 350 people were killed in twin bombings in the somali capital mogadishu last month , the deadliest attack in the country s history .
earlier this year , the white house granted the u.s. military broader authority to carry out strikes in somalia against al shabaab .
