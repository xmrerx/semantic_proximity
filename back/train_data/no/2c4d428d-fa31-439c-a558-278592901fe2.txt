ankara ( reuters ) - iranian president hassan rouhani said on tuesday the u.s. demand for u.n. nuclear inspectors to visit iran s military facilities were unlikely to be accepted by the nuclear watchdog .
the international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) is very unlikely to accept america s demand to inspect our military sites , rouhani said in a televised interview .
the u.s. ambassador to the united nations , nikki haley , last week pressed the iaea to seek access to iranian military bases to ensure that they were not concealing activities banned by a 2015 nuclear deal reached between iran and six major powers .
he gave no indication why he believed the iaea would decline the request .
