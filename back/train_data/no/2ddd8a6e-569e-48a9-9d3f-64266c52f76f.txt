tallinn ( reuters ) - estonia has detained a man suspected of being a russian agent operating against the estonian state , the prosecutor s office said on tuesday .
the man was stopped at the weekend as he prepared to leave estonia for russia from the north-east border town of narva .
he was formally charged on monday in a tallinn court .
a person , who is a russian citizen , is suspected of acting as an fsb agent in the preparation of a computer crime against the republic of estonia , the prosecutors office said .
the target of his action against estonia was the estonian state authorities .
no further details were given .
russia s federal security service , or fsb , is a successor to the kgb , the soviet union s security service .
neither the fsb nor the russian foreign ministry immediately replied to requests for comment .
estonia , occupied by the soviet union until 1991 but now a member of nato and the european union , has a strained relationship with its powerful neighbor .
in may this year , estonia expelled two russian diplomats posted at moscow s consulate in narva for contacts with local officials that were considered inappropriate for diplomats .
earlier in the same month , an estonian court handed out a five-year prison sentence to a russian national for spying for the foreign intelligence unit of the russian armed forces .
