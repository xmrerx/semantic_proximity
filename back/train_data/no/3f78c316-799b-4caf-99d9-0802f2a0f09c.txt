washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. state department has approved an export license for ukraine to buy certain light weapons and small arms from u.s. manufacturers , spokeswoman heather nauert said on wednesday .
department records show ukraine has bought small amounts of those types of weapons for several years , both before and after the 2014 russian annexation of ukraine s crimean peninsula .
the department notified congress of the decision on dec. 13 , nauert said , adding that the u.s. government was not selling the weapons directly to the kiev government but was allowing ukraine to buy from u.s. manufacturers .
under the previous two administrations , the u.s. government has approved export licenses to ukraine , so this is nothing new , nauert said .
the license covers weapons in categories such as semi-automatic and automatic firearms up to , and including , .50 caliber weapons .
it also includes combat shotguns , silencers , military scopes , and flash suppressors , as well as parts .
nauert said the u.s. government had not directly provided lethal defensive equipment to ukraine , nor had it ruled out doing so .
u.s. exporters can apply for direct commercial sales licenses at any time and those are reviewed by the state department on a case-by-case basis , she said .
