it s been more than 18 years , but anyone who was alive at the time will remember when they first heard the news that eric david harris , 18 , and dylan bennet klebold , 17 , two students from columbine high school in littleton , colorado , had shot and killed 12 of their fellow students , plus one teacher and wounded 21 additional people , before turning their guns on themselves in the school s library on that fateful morning of april 20 , 1999 .
the pair were also packing almost 100 explosives in what usa today described as a suicidal attack [ that was ] planned as a grand if badly implemented terrorist bombing .
at the time it was almost impossible to conceive a greater tragedy , two lonely teenage outcasts feeling the need to take so many innocent young lives on just a regular day at school .
sure , there had been other mass-shootings of a greater scale , but columbine is still the worst us high school shooting on record , was the second-worst mass-shooting on any school campus at the time behind the 1966 university of texas massacre , and the fifth-worst mass-shooting on us soil.fast-forward less than two decades later and the murder spree at columbine high school no longer even cracks the top-10 when it comes to the worst single-day mass-shootings in modern us history .
what makes the statistics even more terrifying is that the five worst mass-shootings in the united states and six of the top-10 , have all occurred in the last 10 years .
to make matters worse , three of the top-5 were in the past 18 months.here are the 10 worst single-day mass-shootings in modern us history , counting victims only .
in each instance , the shooter s death has been omitted.which brings us to eric harris , dylan klebold , and the columbine high school massacre .
to many , that is one of the worst tragedies the human mind can conjure up just a couple of misunderstood teenagers who sought the justice of who they saw as their transgressors by running riot on their school and shooting at anyone in their path , resulting in 13 deaths , before killing themselves .
this incident is no longer one of the 10 worst mass-shootings in modern us history , but something needs to be done before it drops any lower.featured image via screenshot
