21st century wire says the mainstream media continues to deflect from its own collapse in credibility in the wake of hillary clinton s epic electoral meltdown by inventing a synthetic fake news crisis and scapegoating clinton s loss on bloggers and cheap eastern european hoax websites .
in addition to mainstream media constantly pushing out actual fake news , corporate media giants have also created their own fake alternative media as well .
here are a number of media operatives appearing on tv pretending to be alternative media but in reality are really funded by the major broadcast media empires .
one of these is a political news website called vox.com .
it s designed to look like an edgy alternative news source , but in reality , vox is just another establishment consensus reality-building tool .
silicon valley investors have pumped tens of millions of dollars into this media outlet , with the lead investor being none other than nbc universal who are one of the biggest peddlers of actual fake news globally ( just ask their phony news anchor brian williams ) .
watch as fox host tucker carlson takes apart hypocritical vox staffer timothy lee over the issue of fake news circulating on the internet , revealing how vox is also a producer of fake news too .
as carlson rightly points out this issue really boils down to freedom of speech.caveat : certainly , fox news is not immune to pushing their own brand of fake news , especially when it comes to promoting us wars overseas , but it does have a number of capable pundits who have exposed a number of key revelations during the course of this historic 2016 election .
