Donald Trump claims he is writing his own Inaugural Address and posted an image to Twitter as proof.
The Internet laughed out loud.Trump looks like he is not enjoying anything that requires thinking and the image is clearly staged to once again dupe his gullible supporters into believing that he is actually writing it himself.
Trump also dubbed his Mar-a-Lago resort the winter White House, which also pissed people off.Writing my inaugural address at the Winter White House, Mar-a-Lago, three weeks ago.
Looking forward to Friday.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2017In reality, it s hard to believe Trump is capable of writing anything longer than 140 characters, so it s obvious that a speechwriter is doing all the work just like Trump hired a ghostwriter to pen his books.The image is so bad, in fact, that Twitter users couldn t help but mercilessly mock Trump.
@realDonaldTrump I hope you ve been working on that vocabulary of yours.

@realDonaldTrump Oh, honey, this looks terribly staged.
Is that a magic marker?

@realDonaldTrump And, dear, I know you need a familiar bed, but the winter White House is the White House.

You need to put the paper flat on the desk, and open the notepad.

Because he sure as hell isn t going to think of something original.Featured image via Twitter
