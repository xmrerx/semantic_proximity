Earlier today an unidentified male entered the U.S. Capitol s Visitor Center with a gun.
The man was apprehended, resulting in a lock down of the Capitol building and other buildings in the area.
A female bystander, and the suspect were injured, but not seriously.It wasn t long before Republicans used the incident to racially profile Muslims, even though no Muslims are known to have been involved in the incident.
I don t talk about going into Muslim neighborhoods and putting an omnipresence there like Stormtroopers, Fox News Contributor Bo Dietl said in an interview on Fox Business Channel.
What I talk about is having a lot more Muslim police officers uniform and plainclothes which can talk to people: What s going on?
You see something suspicious, I drive by, you call over [and] let me know.
You have to have that communication back and forth.
That s the most important thing, is intelligence.
We have to realize one thing: we re facing this threat, complacency can t be setting in here.
We have to be on guard all the time.
The Capitol certainly is a target, same as New York City is, said Dietl.
And part of my thing about the political correctness is, look, we ve got very, very fine Muslim-American people that live in neighborhoods, that have great families, and their most important thing in life is to take care of their families.
Dietl tried to affirm he wasn t being Islamophobic and racist towards Muslims while simultaneously linking an unrelated incident to Republicans warped belief surveillance on Muslims needs to be increased.
Selective enforcement and surveillance based on race and religion has become incredibly popular these days in the Republican Party, as its front-runners for the Republican presidential nomination, Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, constantly one-up each other on who is more racist towards Muslims.Featured Image Courtesy of Flickr
