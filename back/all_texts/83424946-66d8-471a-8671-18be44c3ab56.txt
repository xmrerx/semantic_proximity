WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday condemned white supremacists, in remarks responding to presidential candidate Donald Trump and his failure to disavow a white supremacist group in an interview.
McConnell told reporters that there had been a lot of talk in the past 24 hours about “one of our presidential candidates and his seeming ambivalence” to the Ku Klux Klan white supremacist group and David Duke, a former Klan leader.
“So let me make it perfectly clear.
Senate Republicans condemn David Duke, the KKK, his racism,” McConnell told reporters, adding the Republicans condemned “everything they stand for.” (Reporting by Susan Cornwell) This article was funded in part by SAP.
