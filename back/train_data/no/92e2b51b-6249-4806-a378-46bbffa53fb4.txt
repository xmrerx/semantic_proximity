cairo ( reuters ) - a cairo court on sunday released 17 people arrested last month during a crackdown by the authorities on homosexuality , judicial sources said .
they had been charged with practicing homosexuality and inciting debauchery and were sentenced to three years in prison should they fail to pay a fine of 5,000 egyptian pounds ( $ 285 ) .
the defendants have been given leave to appeal against the sentence in a higher court .
although homosexuality is not specifically outlawed in egypt it is a conservative society and discrimination is rife .
gay men are frequently arrested and typically charged with debauchery , immorality or blasphemy .
in october egyptian security forces arrested 57 people in a wave of arrests triggered by the raising of a rainbow flag at a music concert .
the overwhelming majority of those arrested were not involved in the flag incident , however , and were arrested over their perceived sexual orientation in the following days .
