the alleged president s swamp now has a russian accent , with some in his administration revealed to have ties to the hostile foreign government .
and that some may include trump himself .
on top of that , trump has been pushing for a travel ban , while initially seeking to stop travelers from seven predominantly muslim countries from entering the u.s. that executive order was so chaotic that travelers were still in mid-flight when he signed it , then detained at airports .
his second attempt to ban muslims failed in court after he watered it down to forbidding travelers from six countries from entering the u.s. and now trump is pushing through a health care plan which gifts the rich with tax breaks and hits the elderly hard with pricier coverage .
trump s first meeting with german chancellor angela merkel was so awkward that it was obvious he can not sit in a room with actual world leaders without embarrassing the rest of us.meanwhile , trump is on another vacay at his mar-a-lago resort while trying to take away healthcare from 24 million americans.photo by tom pennington/getty images
