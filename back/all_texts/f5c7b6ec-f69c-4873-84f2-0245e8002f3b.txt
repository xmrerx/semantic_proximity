Dan Rather just released a Facebook post that s so full of BS that it stinks to high heaven!
Please feel free to go on over to his page and let him have it: Dan RatherOur lefty media hacks are coming out of the woodwork to try and bash Donald Trump.
It s unbelievable and unprecedented: Disgraced former CBS news anchor Dan Rather is out with a haughty statement on Facebook, urging all of his fellow news anchors and mainstream media editors to destroy Donald Trump and his supporters.
This cannot be treated as just another outrageous moment in the campaign, Rather said, referring to the Republican presidential nominee s comments about defending the Second Amendment.Rather appeared horrified by Trump s comment, struggling to explain his shock.
By any objective analysis, this is a new low and unprecedented in the history of American presidential politics, he said.Rather challenged the media to hold Trump accountable for his words, urging them to do more to try to shame his supporters.
We will see whether major newscasts explain how grave and unprecedented this is and whether the headlines in tomorrow s newspapers do it justice, he said.
We will soon know whether anyone who has publicly supported Trump explains how they can continue to do.
