Lindsey Graham, the South Carolina Republican was unable to differentiate himself from other GOP Presidential candidates and in August 2015, national polls said that 13 percent of Republican or leans-Republican voters said they d never vote for him.
Zero percent said they would vote for him.Even someone else polled at 1 percent (cue the joke about how hard it would be to find someone else who isn t already in the race).
The highest Graham polled nationally was at 2 percent, according to Real Clear Politics.Yet this morning, on CBS s Face the Nation, while discussing President Donald Trump s inaugural address calling for his policy to be informed by putting America first, Sen. Lindsey Graham, (R-SC) said, I don t know what America first means.
Graham said, To the president, if America first is a throwback to the 20 sand 30 s isolationism when it was first used as a phrase, the world would deteriorate even quicker, if it is a new way of Ronald Reagan s peace through strength I would like to work with him.
I don t know what America first means.
