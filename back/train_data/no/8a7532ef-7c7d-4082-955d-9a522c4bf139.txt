so much for the most transparent administration in history because the step-daughter of theresa heinz-kerry , a woman who is reportedly worth a cool billion , needs her daddy to steal from us taxpayers to help fund her non-profit ?
it looks like john kerry is using his position as secretary of state to enrich his family , just like his predecessor hillary clinton did.more than $ 9 million of department of state money has been funneled through the peace corps to a nonprofit foundation started and run by secretary of state john kerry s daughter , documents obtained by the daily caller news foundation show.the department of state funded a peace corps program created by dr. vanessa kerry and officials from both agencies , records show .
the peace corps then awarded the money without competition to a nonprofit kerry created for the program.initially , the peace corps awarded kerry s group now called seed global health with a three-year contract worth $ 2 million of state department money on sept. 10 , 2012 , documents show .
her father was then the chairman of the senate committee on foreign relations , which oversees both the department of state and the peace corps.seed secured a four-year extension in september 2015 , again without competition .
this time , the peace corps gave the nonprofit $ 6.4 million provided by the department of state while john kerry was secretary of state.seed also received almost $ 1 million from a modification to the first award , as well as from department of state funds the group secured outside the peace corps.the peace corps program called the global health service partnership ( ghsp ) sends volunteer physicians and nurses to medical and nursing schools in malawi , tanzania , uganda and liberia , according to seed s website .
more than 40 clinical educators worked at 13 sites in the 2014-2015 program.kerry and government officials colluded to launch the program and ensure that seed would get the contract.is there anyone in this administration who s not using their power and influence to enrich themselves ? rich , liberal elitists pretend they re all about helping people while engorging themselves at the troth on the taxpayer s dime.time for them to go .
