This year s election is really shaping up to be one of the most ridiculous ever in the history of the republic.
And adding to this bizarre circus is the fact that Dr. Mehmet Oz, noted TV host and alleged scam artist, will be the one reading Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s health report.
However, not the whole thing.Oz told Fox News Brian Kilmeade about how Trump has instructed the release, and when Kilmeade asked, Oh, it s still going to be his decision?
Oz replied: It s his decision.
You know, I the metaphor for me is it s the doctor s office, the studio.
So I m not going to ask him questions he doesn t want to have answered.
So basically, we re only going to hear what Trump wants us to hear like a scripted reality show (which, btw, all reality shows are).Upon hearing the news of Dr. Oz releasing Trump s medical report, legendary entertainer extraordinaire Cher took to Twitter to let us all know how she feels about it.And because Cher tweets in fluent emoji, her tweet is translated here: Why is Dr. Oz letting Trump pimp him out!?
Oz is bound by ethics!!
Is he so hungry for ratings he ll let Trump use him like guys at a frat party.
WHY IS DR OZ LETTING TRUMP PIMP HIM OUT OZ IS BOUND BY ETHICS?
IS HE SO HUNGRY 4RATINGS,HE'LL LET TRUMP USE HIM,LIKE GUYS AT A FRAT PARTY?
Cher (@cher) September 13, 2016Whoa.
But she s not wrong.
The fact that this is being accepted as legitimate by the American people should be clear evidence that the movie Idiocracy has now become reality, and it s f*cking terrifying.Featured Photo by Ethan Miller/ACMA2010/Getty Images for ACMA/Twitter
