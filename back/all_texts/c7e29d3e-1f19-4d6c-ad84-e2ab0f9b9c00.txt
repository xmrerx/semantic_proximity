WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential hopeful Donald Trump will call for a top income tax rate of 33 percent, rather than the 25 percent he previously had proposed, CNBC reported on Monday, citing remarks by an informal Trump adviser.
In a tweet and posting on its website, CNBC said Larry Kudlow, a contributor at the cable outlet who is helping to shape Trumpâ€™s tax plan, made the remarks.
