( reuters ) - gasoline and diesel prices rose sharply in north korea after its sixth nuclear test and as the u.n. security council imposed new sanctions capping fuel supply , market data analyzed by reuters on monday showed .

the website is run by north korean defectors who collect prices via phone calls with traders in the north .
diesel prices also surged 61.5 percent from $ 1.30 per kg to $ 2.10 per kg during the same period .
lee sang-yong , who speaks regularly to sources inside the north and supervises market data from them , said the price hikes were caused primarily by a cut in supplies as the regime scrambles to hoard fuel , wary of a potential fuel crunch .
north korean authorities are likely to have intentionally reduced supplies in the market after the nuclear test , thinking the u.n. security council sanctions would affect their own repository , lee said .
in addition , astute traders are cutting their supplies on the expectations that the prices would go up further , while there s some psychological effect among ordinary citizens who worry about war .
