the border will remain closed to irregular migrants , but those that are using these points to cross and have already reached our territory will be given humanitarian assistance so they can continue on their way , he said .
panama will not allow anyone who has crossed into our country to die on our territory , he added , in a public speech.around 800 us-bound migrants , most of them from haiti , africa , asia and cuba , are in dense jungle on the panama-colombia border , varela said friday.he described it as another migration crisis .
