sen. rand paul of kentucky announced wednesday he is suspending his presidential campaign .
although , today i will suspend my campaign for president , the fight is far from over , mr. paul said in a statement .
i will continue to carry the torch for liberty in the united states senate and i look forward to earning the privilege to represent the people of kentucky for another term .
leisa and i had the privilege of hearing rand paul speak on mackinac island in sept , 2015 .
we videotaped his speech and hope you ll take a few minutes to hear what he felt were the most important issues america faces today .
he turned a room full of republicans who were talking amongst themselves and barely interested in what he had to say , to a crowd of people who were totally engaged within minutes of his powerful speech .
he won the crowd over that night and went on to win the straw poll which included every gop presidential candidate , many of whom attended the same event .
we wanted to share this with you , as we believe rand paul brings up some very important points .
love him or hate him , paul is a true patriot who clearly loves this country .
he will be missed by many and we believe he was , and will continue to be an important voice in conservative politics.mr .
paul finished fifth in the iowa caucuses earlier this week .
across the country thousands upon thousands of young people flocked to our message of limited government , privacy , criminal justice reform and a reasonable foreign policy , he said .
brushfires of liberty were ignited , and those will carry on , as will i .
