reports from several sources revealed on november 22 that clinton campaign chief john podesta was taking meetings with a group claiming it had discovered irregularities in several counties of some of the states that trump won.apparently a group of prominent computer scientists and election lawyers met with podesta to express their belief that they found persuasive evidence that results in wisconsin , michigan , and pennsylvania may have been manipulated or hacked , according to new york magazine.in order to overturn the election , these challenges would have to succeed in multiple counties and multiple states all at the same time to swing the electoral college to clinton , so it certainly seems like a desperate long shot.it is such a long shot that even the left s favorite numbers guru , nate silver , essentially dismissed the effort.to follow : some * very * quick analysis which suggests the claim here of rigged results in wisconsin is probably bs : https : //t.co/syle76bnmq nate silver ( @ natesilver538 ) november 23 , 2016
