bogota ( reuters ) - colombia s armed forces have been authorized to launch air raids against crime gangs and farc members who have refused to adhere to a peace accord with the former guerilla group and instead chose to continue drug trafficking and other criminal activity , the defense ministry said on tuesday .
as many as 1,000 members of the revolutionary armed forces of colombia ( farc ) have not abided by the terms of last year s peace agreement with the government , preferring instead to remain armed , fight the government and profit from illegal drugs and mining .
the conflict killed more than 220,000 people and displaced millions since it began in 1964 .
the executive order allows troops to conduct bomb attacks against farc dissidents and crime gangs from airplanes and helicopters , and shields the military from criminal prosecution , the defense ministry said in a statement .
raids can only be carried out if civilians are not close by .
air raids were the most effective weapon in the government s fight against the farc , pushing fighters deep into inhospitable jungle and killing high-level rebel commanders .
that strategy also has been used against the national liberation army ( eln ) , now the biggest active guerrilla group in colombia , which is in peace talks with the government .
the two sides began a bilateral ceasefire in october .
more than 11,300 members of the farc , including fighters , urban militia and prisoners are in the process of being incorporated into society after the group handed in its weapons to the united nations and formed a political party .
