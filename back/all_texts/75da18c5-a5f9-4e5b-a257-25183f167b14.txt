No, we didn t make this up.
Just listen to Tucker Carlson s dismay at how ridiculous this is:WEIRDEST CLAIM EVER: PUMPKIN SPICE LATTE = WHITE SUPREMACY: Pumpkin spice just doesn t taste as good when you add a shot of racism, a feminist leader explained as the fall flavor began to pop up in coffee shops around the country.
