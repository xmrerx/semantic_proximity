Tucker Carlson and Greg Gutfeld are great together in their take on Hillary s never-ending book tour and recent Jimmy Fallon appearance.
They discussed Fallon segment where women nauseatingly fawned over Hillary Clinton and Miley Cyrus even cried while reading a thank you note to Clinton.
In what was supposed to be a somewhat serious moment, you couldn t help but ask yourself if this was a skit that had a punchline at some point.
NAUSEATING DISPLAY ON FALLON: Singer Miley Cyrus and female writers on NBC s The Tonight Show read thank-younotes to Hillary Clinton about her loss to Donald Trump and the pain it caused many of her supporters during her appearance on the program Wednesday.
TRANSCENDING FIRST LADYHOOD ??
?Cyrus and the writers said Clinton transcended first ladyhood and referred to all the work you ve done for public health care.
The main focus was on her loss to Trump and the psychological pain they associate with it Cyrus was unable to contain her sobs Thank you, Hillary, for being a constant beacon of strength, hope, and determination for me and millions of other young women, Cyrus said.
You ve been a role model and an inspiration and a voice of reason in uncertain times.
I could go on and on, but I d like to get to the point, she concluded.
Could I give you a hug?
Tucker Carlson and Greg Gutfeld were spot on!
IF YOU CAN MAKE IT THROUGH, HERE S THE SEGMENT THEY RE TALKING ABOUT:The laugh is hard enough to listen to!
