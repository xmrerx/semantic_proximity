london ( reuters ) - president donald trump plans to visit britain in february to open the new u.s. embassy in london but will not meet queen elizabeth , the daily mail newspaper reported on wednesday .
trump s planned visit to britain has proved controversial since prime minister theresa may invited him for a state visit , which typically involves lavish pageantry and events hosted by the queen .
however nearly 2 million people have signed a petition saying trump should not be invited because it would cause embarrassment to the queen , and protests could be expected to greet the u.s. leader .
the daily mail cited a source in westminster as saying trump had told may during a call on tuesday that he planned a working visit to britain to open the new embassy , a billion-dollar building which overlooks the river thames , in late february .
a spokesman for may s downing street office declined to comment on the report .
he said the position on the state visit had not changed .
an offer had been extended but no dates have been arranged .
may originally invited trump to visit by the end of 2017 .
britain regards its close ties with washington as a special relationship and a pillar of its foreign policy as it prepares to leave the european union .
however the ties have been strained in recent months , most recently when trump sparked outrage by rebuking may on twitter after she criticized him for retweeting british far-right anti-islam videos .
