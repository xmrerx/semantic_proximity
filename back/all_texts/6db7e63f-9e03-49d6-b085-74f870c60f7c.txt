(Reuters) - Nearly 400,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since a surge in violence in Myanmar s Rakhine state began on Aug 25.
The exodus of refugees, sparked by a fierce military response to a series of Rohingya militant attacks, is the most pressing crisis Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi has faced since becoming leader last year.
She has been the target of criticism from fellow Nobel laureates and religious leaders across the world, for failing to condemn the human rights abuses against the Rohingya.
Here are a selection of quotes about her reticence: AUNG SAN SUU KYI - 1991 Nobel Peace Prize, Myanmar leader "We have to take care of our citizens.
We have to take care of everybody who is in our country, whether or not they are our citizens."
(Sept 7 - reut.rs/2x1S4Ey) DESMOND TUTU - 1984 Nobel Peace Prize, anti-apartheid leader, addressing Suu Kyi: "My dear sister: If the political price of your ascension to the highest office in Myanmar is your silence, the price is surely too steep."

I am still waiting for my fellow Nobel Laureate Aung San Suu Kyi to do the same.
"The world is waiting and the Rohingya Muslims are waiting."
