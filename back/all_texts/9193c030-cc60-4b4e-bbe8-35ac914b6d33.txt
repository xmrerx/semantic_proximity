It really says something when Republican leaders tell Trump not to tweet during an important event.When Former FBI Director James Comey s hearing was hours away, Republicans were rightfully anxious.Sean Spicer may have told the world that Trump s tweets are official statements, but we all know it s a circus and Spicer s trying to be the ringmaster.
The Republicans are finally beginning to realize that.
Oh, I wish he d do something else.
It s not going to change the testimony, said Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Richard Burr, a Republican from North Carolina, who chaired the Comey hearing.
(Source)It was no secret that Comey would speak unfavorably about Trump thanks to Comey s opening statement released on Wednesday.Naturally, this meant there was a high chance of Trump tweeting and saying how sad and wrong Comey is if Trump s track record is anything to go by.It s clear Trump needs someone to hold his hand through his time in office but whether he ll take the hand is up in the air.
What I would do is go do my job, let them have their hearing and not give the impression that you re trying to influence it, said Sen. Jim Inhofe, R-Oklahoma before the Comey hearing.Republican lawmakers are hoping that, if Trump can continue to lay low, the commotion of Trump s circus will die down a little.
Then they will be able to focus on Trump s agenda again.To everyone s surprise, Trump didn t tweet during the hearing.
Or at least, not the Trump we were all expecting.
Instead, we got Trump Jr. throwing a tantrum on Twitter.I guess next time, Republicans should be specific on which Trump should not tweet during important events since they can t figure it out for themselves.
Honestly it would be in everyone s best interest if Trump and his family didn t tweet at all.Featured image via Andrew Harrer/Bloomberg via Getty Images
