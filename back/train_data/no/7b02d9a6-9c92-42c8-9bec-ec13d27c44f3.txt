but .. b but it isn t fair to ask for voter id says the party that dominates the states that refuse to cooperate with trump s election commission .
the more corruption that s exposed through post-election voting investigations , the more we begin to understand why so many democrat pundits and liberal media outlets were so sure hillary had the election in the bag .. eleven counties in california have more registered voters than voting age adults in the county.judicial watch announced it sent a notice-of-violation letter to the state of california and 11 of its counties threatening to sue in federal court if it does not clean its voter registration lists as mandated by the national voter registration act ( nvra ) .
both the nvra and the federal help america vote act require states to take reasonable steps to maintain accurate voting rolls .
the august 1 letter was sent on behalf of several judicial watch california supporters and the election integrity project california , inc.in the letter , judicial watch noted that public records obtained on the election assistance commission s 2016 election administration voting survey and through verbal accounts from various county agencies show 11 california counties have more registered voters than voting-age citizens : imperial ( 102 % ) , lassen ( 102 % ) , los angeles ( 112 % ) , monterey ( 104 % ) , san diego ( 138 % ) , san francisco ( 114 % ) , san mateo ( 111 % ) , santa cruz ( 109 % ) , solano ( 111 % ) , stanislaus ( 102 % ) , and yolo ( 110 % ) .in the letter , judicial watch noted that los angeles county officials informed us that the total number of registered voters now stands at a number that is a whopping 144 % of the total number of resident citizens of voting age .
remember when the huffington post denied voter fraud was an actual thing in america , while calling hillary clinton , ( the candidate who clearly benefitted from illegal voting practices ) the legitimate president-elect ?
under section 8 of the nvra , states are required to make a reasonable effort to remove the names of ineligible voters from official lists due to the death of the registrant or a change in the residence of the registrant , and requires states to ensure noncitizens are not registered to vote.there is strong circumstantial evidence that california municipalities are not conducting reasonable voter registration list maintenance as mandated under the nvra , judicial watch wrote in the notice letter sent to california secretary of state alex padilla .
