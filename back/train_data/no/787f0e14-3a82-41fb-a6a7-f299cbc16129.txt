hong kong ( reuters ) - an american serving a life sentence in a hong kong jail for the 2003 milkshake murder of her merrill lynch banker husband made a fresh challenge against her sentence on friday .
nancy kissel , who is in her mid 50s , has been in jail since 2005 when she was found guilty of murdering her husband after giving him a drug-laced milkshake and then clubbing him to death with a metal ornament in their luxury home .
she was convicted a second time in a 2011 retrial and failed in a final appeal against her conviction in 2014 .
kissel lodged a judicial review against the long-term prison sentences review board , hong kong court records showed .
she is arguing that the board had deprived her of the right to make an informed submission to challenge the rationality of its decision .
a lawyer for kissel said the board should have recommended to the chinese controlled city s chief executive that a fixed prison term should have replaced an indefinite life sentence , public broadcaster rthk said .
the murder gripped hong kong s business and expatriate communities with its tales of domestic violence , rough sex and adultery that cast a shadow over the high-flying lifestyles of financial professionals in the former british colony .
kissel s latest move comes the same week that british former bank of america merrill lynch employee rurik jutting appealed against a life sentence handed down last year for murdering two indonesian women he tortured and raped .
