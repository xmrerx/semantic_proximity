listening to zeke emanuel , awkward brother of chicago mayor rahm emanuel , is always a study in the absurdities of politics .
this guy is supposedly the architect of obamacare but he s just one big jackwagon.can you believe we ve had people like this determining the healthcare policy for all americans ?
he s now providing cover for the failing obamacare exchanges .

not a success but you wouldn t know it from all the finger pointing going on with this putz.here s zeke trying to blame his failure on politics nice try but we re not buyin it :
