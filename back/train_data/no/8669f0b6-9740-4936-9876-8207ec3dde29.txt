oslo ( reuters ) - norway s christian democratic party withdrew from coalition talks with the government on wednesday , ending conservative prime minister erna solberg s hopes of broadening her minority right-wing cabinet into a center-right majority one .
the move may make it more difficult for solberg to secure backing for her fiscal spending plans and policy proposals , and could even jeopardize her cabinet s long-term survival .
solberg has ruled in a minority government since 2013 with the populist progress party .
she had hoped to bring the two parties other backers in parliament , the christian democrats and the liberals , into her cabinet after the four parties combined won a renewed but smaller majority on sept. 11 .
while solberg had needed the support of just one of the two centrist parties previously to push through her policies , she now needs the backing of both in addition to that of her own conservatives and the progress party .
but the christian democrats , wary of supporting further tax cuts and the government s tough line on immigration , said it would stay out of government even though it preferred solberg as prime minister over labour leader jonas gahr stoere .
solberg had previously rejected a proposal from the liberals and the christian democrats to remove progress from the government in favor of the centrists .
our alternative for a government did not succeed , but we still wish for good , constructive cooperation , party leader knut arild hareide of the christian democrats told reporters after meeting the three other parties on wednesday .
the liberals will continue to negotiate with the government , but their potential inclusion in the cabinet would not be sufficient to ensure a majority .
the government is due to present its 2018 fiscal spending proposal on oct. 12 and must negotiate a compromise in parliament by late november or early december .
