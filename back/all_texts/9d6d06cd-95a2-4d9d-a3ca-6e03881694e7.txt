(Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted on Tuesday to confirm Dr. Scott Gottlieb, a conservative health policy expert and venture capitalist, as commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration.
Gottlieb, a physician and former deputy FDA commissioner during the George W. Bush administration, is seen as competent and knowledgeable.
But critics worry about his ties to the pharmaceutical industry.
Gottlieb has agreed to divest his holdings in about two-dozen healthcare stocks.
