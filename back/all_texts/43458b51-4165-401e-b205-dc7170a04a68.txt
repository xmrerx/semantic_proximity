These images were all taken from a Facebook page dedicated to capturing death threats against Donald Trump.
I thought I had seen everything until I came upon this page.
The lack of value these (mostly) young people place on the sanctity of life is stunning.
How many of these people do you think have been visited by the FBI?
How many of these common thugs have been arrested?
What if there was a Facebook page exposing the death threats made against Hillary?
Do you think it would have been all over the news?
All of these images and the video below can be found on the Operation Mogul Fury Facebook page.
We commend this person for their hard work in uncovering these vile threat spread out across so many social media accounts.
