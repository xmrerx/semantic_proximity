BRUSSELS (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May and the other 27 European Union leaders want to send a more positive signal on Brexit, but London has not offered any new opening on the financial settlement, a senior EU official said on Friday.
The official was speaking after a two-day EU summit in Brussels.
