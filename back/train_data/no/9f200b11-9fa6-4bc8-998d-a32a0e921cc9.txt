judge napolitano spoke out today about the unmasking of people in government by obama .
he began to discuss allegations senator rand paul and another senator were under surveillance by the obama administration but dropped a bomb on the obama administration spying on the us supreme court.judge napolitano : justice scalia told me that he often thought the court was being surveilled .
and he told me that probably four or five years ago if they had to unmask senator paul s name to reveal a conversation he was having with a foreign agent and the foreign agent was hostile to the united states they can do that .
that s not what he s talking about .
they re talking about unmasking him when he s having a conversation with his campaign manager when he s running in the republican primary.during the discussion judge napolitano also said barack obama could be subpoenaed to testify if he viewed the unmasked intelligence .
