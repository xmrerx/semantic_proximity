James Kallstrom is the former Assistant Director of the FBI who is no fan of former FBI Director James Comey.
We ve reported several times on Kallstrom s very blunt take on the politicization of the intelligence community (see below).
Check out his awesome take on how Comey folded Wow!Kallstrom tells it like it is in his latest interview: James Comey, the notion that Barack Obama was going to let Hillary Clinton was going to be indicted that was obvious to anybody who knows anything at the very beginning Unfortunately, it turns out he was a political hack I think he maybe started out in an honorable way.
His opinion of himself is sky high.
Unbelievable guy.
Just an arrogance about him I think he thought he was Superman and found out he wasn t. The dogs are always going to bite you on your heels when you re dealing with the Clintons.
Look how long the American people have been dealing with the crime syndicate known as the Clinton Foundation We got all these major crime things bubbling All of which are 20 times bigger than Watergate!
And nothing seems to be happening The Attorney General is in a coma!
James Kallstrom, former FBI Assistant Director, said he is glad it happened.
Daily CallerKallstrom endorsed Donald Trump for president He said he feels like America is going down the tubes .
We should listen to this man!
He s been in the belly of the FBI beast and knows the truth.
