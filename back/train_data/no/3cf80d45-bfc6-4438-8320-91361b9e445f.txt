hanoi ( reuters ) - a court in vietnam on friday upheld a nine-year jail sentence for a prominent activist convicted of spreading propaganda against the state , her lawyer said .
blogger tran thi nga , 40 , was initially found guilty at a trial in july , six months after she was arrested in a widening crackdown on critics of the communist government .
despite sweeping economic reform and increasing openness towards social change , the ruling party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism .
nga s sentence of nine years in prison and five years probation was upheld by a court in the central city of nha trang , one of her lawyers said .
nga said she was innocent and was not guilty of propaganda against the state , lawyer ha huy son told reuters by telephone .
court officials were not immediately available for comment .
nga s family did not have access to the hearing .
the u.s. embassy said it was deeply troubled by the court s decision and that everyone in vietnam should be able to express their political views without fear .
the united states calls on vietnam to release tran thi nga and all other prisoners of conscience immediately , u.s. embassy spokesman pope thrower said .
in november , a vietnamese court upheld a 10-year jail sentence for another prominent blogger , nguyen ngoc nhu quynh , known as me nam , or mother mushroom , who was jailed for publishing propaganda against the state .
