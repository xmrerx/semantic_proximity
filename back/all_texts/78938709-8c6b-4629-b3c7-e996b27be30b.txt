TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japanese man wielding a sword killed his sister, a Shinto priestess, on the grounds of a Tokyo shrine, then stabbed his wife to death before committing suicide, police and media said.
Police declined to comment on a motive for Thursday s killings or the family feud.
Shigenaga Tomioka, 56, attacked Nagako Tomioka, 58, chief priestess of the Tomioka Hachimangu shrine, as she got out of a car.
Media reports said she was his sister.
His 49-year-old wife, Mariko, stabbed and wounded the driver of the car with a sword, police said, before she too was killed.
Shigenaga sent a threatening letter to his sister in 2006, saying he would send her to hell , the Sankei newspaper said.
Shinto is the traditional religion of Japan and many shrines dot the country.
The Tomioka Hachimangu shrine, established in 1627, has a close link with sumo and the emperor and empress visited in 2012.
