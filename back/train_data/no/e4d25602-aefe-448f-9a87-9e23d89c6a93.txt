brussels ( reuters ) - venezuela s democratic opposition was awarded the european union s human rights award on thursday and the european parliament called for a peaceful transition to democracy in the troubled country .
the prize , named after soviet physicist and dissident andrei sakharov , was awarded to venezuela s opposition-led national assembly legislature , which the government has stripped of powers , and all political prisoners , the eu parliament said .
venezuela is suffering from a harsh economic crisis and president nicolas maduro s government has clamped down on the opposition , jailing or otherwise barring from office many dissenting leaders and activists .
today we are supporting a nation s freedom struggle , european parliament president antonio tajani said .
we also want to launch an appeal for a peaceful transition towards democracy and an opening of a humanitarian corridor to ease the suffering , he added .
julio borges , head of venezuela s national assembly , tweeted that it was an honor to receive the award on behalf of the whole of venezuela , adding : the international community recognizes our people .
the european parliament s left-wing group gue/ngl , which includes parties such as germany s die linke , ireland s sinn fein and greece s ruling syriza , said it would boycott the award ceremony , saying the decision was politically charged .
previous winners of the prize , first awarded in 1988 , include pakistani education activist malala yousafzai and south african president nelson mandela .
