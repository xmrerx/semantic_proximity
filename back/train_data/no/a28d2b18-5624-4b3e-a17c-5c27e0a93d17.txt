washington ( reuters ) - republican presidential candidate senator ted cruz on wednesday said the senate should not vote on president barack obama ’ s supreme court nominee merrick garland .
“ merrick garland is exactly the type of supreme court nominee you get when you make deals in washington d.c. , ” he said in a statement that also criticized rival donald trump , who often boasts of his ability to close deals .
“ a so-called ‘ moderate ’ democrat nominee is precisely the kind of deal that donald trump has told us he would make - someone who would rule along with other liberals on the bench like justices ginsburg and sotomayor . ”
