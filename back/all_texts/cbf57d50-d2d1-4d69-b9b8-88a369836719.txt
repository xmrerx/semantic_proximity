And that is a question that is left open still unanswered.
and secondly, have you ever heard of anyone putting $145 million, at one moment, into the hands of the Clinton foundation?
And the answer is, of course not.
These questions, most basic and fundamental, were armed by the very committee made up of the very agencies, departments, and individuals responsible for national security.
this, this is the biggest Obama scandal.
I think it may well turn out to be the biggest scandal in American political history.
