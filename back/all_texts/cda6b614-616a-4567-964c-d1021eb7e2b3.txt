CAIRO (Reuters) - Jordan said on Friday a U.S. air strike on a Syrian air base was a “necessary and appropriate response” to a chemical weapons attack this week which the United States and its allies blamed on Syria’s government.
The chemical incident was “an inhuman act ... which drew wide-ranging international reactions, the latest of which was the U.S. military strike.
“Jordan considers this a necessary and appropriate response to the continued targeting of civilians”, government spokesman Mohammed al-Momeni said, quoted by state news agency Petra.
Syria’s government denies using chemical weapons.
