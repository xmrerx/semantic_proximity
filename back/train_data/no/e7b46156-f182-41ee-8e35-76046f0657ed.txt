tokyo ( reuters ) - japanese police arrested three crew of a north korean boat on saturday for stealing a generator from a hut on an uninhabited island , public broadcaster nhk said , the latest drama amid increasing arrivals of north korean fishing boats off japan .
the boats , some in distress , some abandoned and some with dead bodies on board , have raised fears about infiltration by spies as tension with north korea surges over its missile and nuclear programs .
north korea has test-fired two missiles over japan , a country it has threatened to destroy .
most experts say the wooden boats are just carrying fishermen including soldiers drafted to fish .
there has been no suggestion the crew are defectors .
a boat , with 10 crew on board , was found moored at the island , off hokkaido , last month and several crew said they picked up electronic goods from the hut , according to nhk .
police arrested three of them for theft and other crew members will be sent to the immigration bureau , nhk said .
hokkaido police were not immediately available to comment .
a spokesman at the japan coast guard declined to comment .
there were 28 cases of boats adrift off japan or grounded on its shores in november , the coast guard has said , compared with just four in november last year .
