Donald Trump is literally inching dangerously close towards arresting members of the free press for doing their jobs.During his insanely embarrassing rant at his solo press conference on Thursday, Trump repeatedly whined about the media and called them fake news.
He demanded that the media always take him at his word because only he knows the truth.Of course, the media does not negotiate with mad dictators and they refused to comply with Trump s demand that they bow down and kiss his ass like Fox News and Breitbart have done.
So Trump lashed out at the media on Friday by calling them the enemy of the American people an accusation that he soon deleted so he could reword it and add more media outlets.Huffington Post contributor Eliot Nelson caught the tweet before Trump could scrub it.By the transitive property I m pretty sure the president of the United States just accused us of treason.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017This is pretty damn pathetic, and puts America on the slippery slope towards actually arresting journalists and reporters because they are not acting like propaganda drones for his corrupt administration.
That would clearly be a violation of the Constitution, but Trump and his Republican cheerleaders no longer give a damn about constitutional rights.Trump s tweet lit the Internet on fire, and Twitter users ripped him a new one for it.
@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN What the fuck are you doing?
Honesty, you re ill and should be in a home.

@realDonaldTrump @nytimes @NBCNews @ABC @CBS @CNN Wow, that s quite a list.
Perhaps it s time to take a long hard look in the mirror.

He is totally unfit to hold the office he occupies.
The presidency is not a dictatorship, but Trump is trying to turn it into one and he s getting closer to succeeding.
Accusing the media of treason for telling the truth is what tyrants do before they start having them arrested.
The media is not the president s personal propaganda machine.
The media exists to inform the American people and serves as a check on the government.
If Trump were not so inept and destructive, the media wouldn t cover him very much at all.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images
