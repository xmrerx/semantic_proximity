PARIS (Reuters) - World powers sent a clear message on Friday that the Lebanese policy of staying out of regional affairs should be adhered to and that foreign governments should not interfere in the country s politics, France s foreign minister said.
Disassociation applies to everyone - inside and outside, Jean-Yves Le Drian said at a news conference with Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri after an international meeting on Lebanon.
These principles were reaffirmed this morning.
Hariri warned that any breach of the policy of mutual non-interference would drag Lebanon back into the danger zone .
