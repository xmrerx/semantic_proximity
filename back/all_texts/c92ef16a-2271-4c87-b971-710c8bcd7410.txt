BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Kurdish forces have not withdrawn from the Khurmala oil field, northwest of Kirkuk, Erbil-based Rudaw TV said on Thursday, citing a Peshmerga commander.
Khurmala is part of the geological structure of the Kirkuk oil basin.
It was developed by the semi-autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government as it lies in its administrative boundaries.
Iraqi forces on Monday seized the Kirkuk province from Kurdish forces who deployed there in 2014.
