It doesn t get much more anti-American than forcing the removal of American flags from an American owned business A Florida car dealership is facing fines for displaying its patriotism.The Kia dealership in West Palm Beach faces penalties of up to $1,000 per day for a code-enforcement violation it received from Palm Beach County for displaying six American flags on its property, WPTV reported.The county said the dealership is violating a that prohibits the display of pennants, balloons, banners and other signs made of lightweight fabric, plastic or similar substances.
We re just trying to show our patriotism, dealership general manager Mike Wangle told WPTV.The notice said the dealership must remove the flags by the Fourth of July or the fine will be imposed.
You would think they they would let us leave it up during the Fourth and then say, take them down after the holiday, Wangle said.He told WPTV he understands the code, but doesn t understand why the flags don t fall under the flags category.// <!

Those are banners, he said.
But when you re displaying the American flag, that s a little different.
That s why we re kind of upset about it.
He added that he will keep the banners flying until July 5 to display patriotism on Independence Day, even if he has to pay the fine himself.Via: Biz Pac Review // ]]>
