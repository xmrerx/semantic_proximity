moscow ( reuters ) - russian authorities evacuated people from dozens of buildings in moscow on wednesday after a flurry of anonymous phone calls asserting the locations had been mined , ria news agency reported .
three of moscow s main train stations were being checked on wednesday , along with the city s famous gum department store near red square , and more than 20 other buildings , the news agency said .
gum said on its website it was temporarily closed for technical reasons .
a reuters tv cameraman said he saw police with sniffer dogs checking the building .
russia has this week experienced a wave of hoax bomb threats .
citing an unnamed source in the emergency services , ria said the hoaxes had so far affected more than 20 russian towns and cities .
all of the calls had so far turned out to be false alarms .
when asked about the matter , a kremlin spokesman referred reporters to the police .
ria cited its source as saying that many of the hoax calls may have been made from ukraine .
relations between moscow and kiev are at a low after russia annexed ukraine s crimea in 2014 and pro-russian separatists in eastern ukraine rebelled against kiev s rule .
