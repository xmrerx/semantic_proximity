This is what Democrats think of people who broke our laws to come to America?
Nancy Pelosi thanked a Dreamer s parents Wednesday for bringing him to the United States illegally.
Pelosi made the remark during a town hall with CNN s Chris Cuomo where she took a question from Dreamer Adrian Reyna.
Our Dreamers, they make America dream again, Pelosi said.
They re so lovely and we, frankly, owe a debt to your parents for bringing you here to be such a brilliant part of our future.
AND she s happy to let the tax payers foot the bill for these illegals:The swelling population of illegal immigrants and their kids is costing American taxpayers $135 billion a year, the highest ever, driven by free medical care, education and a huge law enforcement bill, according to the the most authoritative report on the issue yet.Dreamers are individuals who were brought illegally to the United States as children.
Former president Barack Obama s administration provided cover to Dreamers from possible deportation to their countries of origin with the DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) executive order in 2012.The Trump administration rescinded the order last month and called on Congress to replace it within six months.
Reyna expressed concern about Democrats coming to a deal with President Donald Trump about illegal immigration and Dreamers.Pelosi promised Reyna that a clean Dream Act would be passed before December.Pelosi continued to heap praise on Dreamers and their families and laid out Democrats plan to block the Trump administration and Republicans from taking any kind of potential action against illegal immigration.Read more: WFB
