Donald Trump has never tried to hide the fact that he is a misogynistic a**hole.
Rosie O Donnell, Megyn Kelly, and any other woman who dares challenge Trump s right to grab em by the pussy becomes a target for his hate.
Clearly, this man has a problem with women.
But somehow, we put him in the White House anyway.This week, Trump attacked MSNBC s Mika Brzezinski, tweeting that he refused to let her hang out with him a few months ago because she was bleeding badly from a facelift.
And we all know that Trump finds the idea of a woman bleeding out of her wherever is just too gross for him to handle.Not surprisingly, it turns out that this kind of sexist degradation is a lifelong pattern for Trump.
New York Times columnist Gail Collins remembers Trump attacking her in the most degrading way possible.I have to confess I ve overestimated Donald Trump.Back in the day, he sent me a copy of a column he objected to, with some notes suggesting I was a dog and a liar with the face of a pig.
I ve had many opportunities to make use of that story since Trump became a presidential candidate, so it s all fine for me.
However, I have to admit that it did not occur to me he d keep doing that kind of stuff as president of the United States.This is not normal.
A real man would never treat women the way Trump does, calling them fat pigs and dogs and talking about dating his own daughter.
But this isn t even just any man.
This is the President of the goddamn United States behaving this way.
It is absolutely appalling that this man is supposed to be leading our country, yet this is how he speaks about women.Worse yet, is that this has never been some kind of deep, dark secret.
This is who he his and he has flaunted it for decades.
And he won the election anyway, at least he did in a kind sorta type of way, but I digress.
What the hell have we become?
How are we allowing this?
Why are we acting like any of this is okay in any way at all?Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
