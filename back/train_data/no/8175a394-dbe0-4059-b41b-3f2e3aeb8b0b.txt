benghazi , libya ( reuters ) - libyan forces fighting in benghazi have lost four men and seen 10 wounded so far in december , five months after declaring victory in a campaign to control the eastern city , a medical source said on monday .
three of the dead from the libyan national army ( lna ) were killed by snipers and one by a landmine as it faces resistance from a group of fighters in the benghazi district of khreibish .
there have been daily clashes in the area and occasional air strikes .
lna commander khalifa haftar declared victory in a three-year military campaign against an array of islamist militants and other fighters in benghazi in early july .
the fighting is part of a broader conflict that developed following the 2011 fall of strongman muammar gaddafi .
haftar has opposed a u.n.-backed government based in the capital , tripoli , as he has gradually strengthened his position on the ground .
