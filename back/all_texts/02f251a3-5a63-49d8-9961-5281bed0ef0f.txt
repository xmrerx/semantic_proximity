The program is dead!
Operation Choke Point is no longer a huge nuisance to gun dealers.
Republican leaders like Bob Goodlatte made it clear to the Trump administration s DOJ that they wanted this program to end ASAP.Eric Holder launched the program when he was attorney general.
The program was a thorn in the side of gun dealers because it hurt a gun dealer s ability to receive financial services from banks.One statement from the DOJ stands out: Law abiding businesses should not be targeted simply for operating in an industry that a particular administration might disfavor.

SHOULDN T IT GO WITHOUT SAYING THAT THE DOJ SHOULDN T TARGET CERTAIN BUSINESSES???
