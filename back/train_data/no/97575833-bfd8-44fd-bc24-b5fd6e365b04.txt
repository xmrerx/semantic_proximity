nairobi ( reuters ) - a united states citizen working in south sudan as a freelance journalist was among 19 people killed on saturday during fighting between government troops and rebels in yei river state , the rebels and the military said .
christopher allen , who worked for various news outlets , was killed in heavy fighting in the town of kaya .
south sudan has been convulsed by conflict since late 2013 , pitting president salva kiir s troops against those of rebel leader riek machar .
on the ground , about 16 ( bodies ) have been found around the defensive position of the spla including this white man , santo domic chol , a military spokesman , told reuters .
three government soldiers were also killed , he said .
the rebels identified him as allen , who had been embedded with them for the past week .
we are sad for his family .
he came here to tell our story , said one rebel who knew allen .
he asked not to be named but said allen had been in the middle of the fighting and wearing a jacket marked press .
chol said the rebels had attacked an army base in kaya but they were repulsed after an hour-long fight .
the u.s. government did not respond immediately when reuters sought comment .
the country spiraled into civil war , with fighting along ethnic lines , after kiir sacked machar in late 2013 .
a peace accord was signed in august 2015 and machar returned to the capital in april last year to share power with kiir , before the deal fell apart less than three months later and machar and his supporters fled the capital .
the conflict has forced about 4 million people to flee their homes .
uganda currently hosts more than a million south sudanese refugees , while over 330,000 have fled to neighboring ethiopia .
