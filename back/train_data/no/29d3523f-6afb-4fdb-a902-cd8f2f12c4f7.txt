did you hear about the reporter who was scolded by the russian foreign minister for being rude during a protocol meeting ?
it was all over the news this afternoon but the identity of the rude reporter wasn t known until now you ll love this ! the russian foreign minister sergei lavrov scolded andrea mitchell today when she yelled a question to rex tillerson it really was a priceless moment for all of us who know what a political hack this woman is .
she slobbered all over hillary clinton during the 2016 campaign .
it was very obvious that she really wanted and expected hillary clinton to win the election .
this is truly priceless !
