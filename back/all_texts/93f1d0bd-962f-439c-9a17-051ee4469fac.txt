JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Thursday many countries would follow the United States in recognising Jerusalem as Israel s capital and contacts were underway.
Wednesday s announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump reversed decades of peace-making policy on Jerusalem, which both Israelis and Palestinians claim, and drew censure from many countries, among them key allies of Washington.
I would like to announce that we are already in contact with other countries which will issue a similar recognition, Netanyahu said in a speech at Israel s Foreign Ministry.
He did not name any of these countries.
The United States plans to open an embassy in Jerusalem, a move it says could take three to four years.
The U.S. Embassy is currently in Tel Aviv, Israel s economic hub, as are those of other countries.
I have no doubt that the moment the American Embassy moves to Jerusalem, and even before then, there will be a movement of many embassies to Jerusalem.
The time has come, Netanyahu said.
Palestinian Islamist group Hamas called on Thursday for a new uprising against Israel after Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as the Israeli capital.
