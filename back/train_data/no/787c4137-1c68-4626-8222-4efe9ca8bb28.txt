to all the # nevertrumpers : the ugly ride that you ve been on in support of a candidate who lost the primary election fair and square , is about to come to an end .
multiple sources close to ted cruz say the texas senator is expected indicate his support for donald trump as soon as friday .
it is unclear whether cruz will say only that he is voting for the republican nominee , as other lawmakers have done , or offer a more full-throated endorsement , but the idea of throwing any support to trump is controversial within cruzworld .
politicoted cruz was my choice until he blamed trump for the violence at the chicago rally .
i withdrew my support for cruz that horrible night and since then , he has done nothing to restore my confidence .
maybe the support for his senate seat is eroding , or maybe he s just come to the conclusion that trump genuinely loves his country and needs everyone s support if he s going to defeat hillary in november .
cruz had an opportunity to do the right thing at the rnc convention , but he chose to take a different path .
but unlike sour grapes governor john kasich , who can t seem to find it in his great big , illegal-immigrant-loving-heart to endorse donald j. trump , it appears that cruz is about to do the right thing and for that , we offer him moderate applause
