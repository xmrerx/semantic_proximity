Now that it appears that Donald Trump is the inevitable next president, Alec Baldwin has job security at Saturday Night Live for at least four more years (unless Trump is impeached).
Trump s not happy, at all.This week, Baldwin skewered Trump s Twitter obsession.
The sketch showed the President-Elect as so distracted by his Twitter account that he just had to retweet a high school boy, rather than pay attention during a security briefing.
Kellyanne, referring to campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, played by SNL s Kate McKinnon, I just retweeted the best tweet.
I mean wow, what a great, smart tweet.
When advisors reminded Trump that he was in a security briefing, Baldwin s Trump replied, He s 16, he s in high school, and I really did retweet him.
Seriously, this is real.
Trump s advisors tried to steer him back to the situation in Syria but Trump said, God, Seth seems so cool.
His Twitter bio says he wants to make America great again.
That s when McKinnon s Conway dropped the truth bomb about why Trump really tweets:Trump tweets to much to distract the media from his business conflicts and the scary people in his cabinet, but in Trump s words the real reason is because his brain is bad.
But what s Donald Trump if he can t brag about something he had absolutely nothing to do with:As the adults in the room continued to admonish Trump for his incessant tweeting, he disputed the fact that it was preventing him from focusing on his work.
I was elected 25 days ago and already unemployment is at a nine-year low, millions and millions of people have health care and Osama bin Laden is dead, he said.
Next I m going to do what I promised my whole campaign and I m going to build that swamp.
Here s the full video:Trump was not at all happy with the portrayal.
Within minutes, he posted this:This thin-skinned compulsive tweeter, my fellow Americans, is our next president.Featured image via video screen capture.
