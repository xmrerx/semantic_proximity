BRASILIA (Reuters) - The lower house of Brazil s Congress voted on Wednesday to reject charges filed by prosecutors against President Michel Temer in a case involving bribes allegedly paid by meatpacker JBS SA, sparing him trial by the Supreme Court.
With 136 lawmakers voting to throw out the charges, and given a quorum of 477 of them present, Temer s opponents could no longer reach the 342 votes required to authorize the top court to put him on trial.
