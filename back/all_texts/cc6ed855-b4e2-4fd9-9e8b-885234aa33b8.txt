Hilarious and spot-on conservative, social-media giant, Paul Joseph Watson announced on Twitter that he was done!
.
After waking up to discover that Facebook banned him for a parody video that made fun of feminism that he posted over 18 months ago, Watson had had enough!YouTube has been banning pro-Trump videos.
Watson mentioned the dynamic pro-Trump duo Diamond and Silk and how they re talking about filing a class-action suit against YouTube for demonetizing their videos because all of their advertisers may not agree with their (pro-Trump) views.
Watson claims YouTube has demonetized every single video he s made that criticized Islam.Watson says he needs to seriously think about whether it s worth investing hundreds and hundreds of hours my time every year into something that could completely disappear when I wake up tomorrow morning.
I ll probably ride it until the wheels fall off, but this is it for now.
We defeated Hillary.
We hit a million subscribers.
We had a good run.
