apparently , west virginia democrat not to be confused with real democrats joe manchin effectively told voter he doesn t want his job anymore when he was the only person supposedly on our side who voted to confirm lifetime racist and embarrassment to humanity jeff sessions as attorney general.manchin , who reportedly considered switching to republican just after the 2016 election ( though he denies it ) , has been on the wrong side of history many times in his career .
not only did he vote with republicans to terminate funding for planned parenthood after right-wing activists produced heavily-edited propaganda videos that claimed the women s health organization sells baby parts , but he is so deep in the pockets of the coal industry that the lint is jealous .
on top of that , manchin has been endorsed by the nra and has supported legislation that sought to prevent the epa from regulating greenhouse gas .
while manchin has been criticized for all of that in the past , his decision to support a career racist for attorney general is bringing a sh * tstorm his way that he seems to have failed to anticipate.shortly after the vote , manchin s wikipedia page underwent some renovations most notably the word traitor above his head and a note that he voted with republicans on the horrible jeff sessions : manchin s decision to betray his party , his country and everything decent in the world is not going over well on social media , where pretty much everyone seems to want to set him adrift : @ loganphares @ jalyiv stop calling yourself a democrat , your not .
we do n't support white supremacists .

# riseup roberta greenwood ( @ robertag52 ) february 9 , 2017according to fortune , trump and manchin call each other directly on their cell phones , have met at trump tower and even flirted with the idea of a cabinet post .
his chumminess with our dictator-in-chief alone is enough for democrats to tell him to hit the bricks in 2018 .
everything else is just extra .
