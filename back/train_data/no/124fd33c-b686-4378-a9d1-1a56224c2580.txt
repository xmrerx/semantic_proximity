oh boy !
this is getting good !
bill clinton is now accusing the fbi of serving up a load of bull in the comments about the investigation into hillary s e-mails .
how idiotic is it to publicly slam the fbi ?
i guess slick willy isn t so slick anymore .
all we have to say about this is keep on talkin slick willy ! bill clinton is accusing the fbi director of serving up the biggest load of bull i ve ever heard marking the first significant public comments from the husband of the democratic nominee on the scandal that s plagued his wife s campaign for over a year .
first of all , the fbi director said , when he testified before congress , he had to amend his previous day s statement that she had never received any emails marked classified , clinton told journalists at an asian american journalists association meeting in las vegas on friday , making a strong defense for hillary clinton.he added , they saw two little notes with a c on it this is the biggest load of bull i ve ever heard that were about telephone calls that she needed to make .
the state department typically puts a little c on it to discourage people from discussing it in public in the event the secretary of state , whoever it is , doesn t make a telephone call .
does that sound threatening to the national security to you ?
