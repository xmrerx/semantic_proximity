The adversity that former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords (D-AZ) has had to overcome is nothing short of breathtaking.
After being shot in the head during a meet and greet with her constituents five years ago, she has made a comeback that could put her at hero status.
She s a hero, because not only has she made a startling recovery, but she has dedicated her life to trying to making sure no one has to endure the pain of gun violence.
Through her organization Americans for Responsible Solutions, alongside her husband retired astronaut Mark Kelly, they have made it their life s work.Now, knowing that the epidemic of gun violence is still rampant, Giffords knows we will need a continued strong voice of leadership in the White House to combat the gun lobby and fight to enact gun legislation that will be proactive and lasting.
Later this week, Giffords is expected to endorse Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.Clinton has released through her campaign comprehensive solutions to reduce gun violence.
She knows we are well past the time to enact proper legislation.This endorsement may come as a surprise to some, but to others it will make perfect sense.
Clinton has long been a supporter of better gun reform while her democratic opponent, Bernie Sanders, voted against the Brady bill five times, and according to CBS news: Sanders voted in favor of 2005 law that absolved gun manufacturers of any legal liability when someone uses their products during the commission of a crime.
Part of Clinton s goals for gun reform includes a repeal to the gun industry s immunity protection: Hillary believes the gun industry must be held accountable for violence perpetrated with their guns.
Hillary will lead the charge to repeal the so-called Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, a dangerous law that prevents victims of gun violence from holding negligent manufacturers and dealers accountable for violence perpetrated with their guns.
Giffords, alongside her husband, want gun reform, and she seems to be endorsing the candidate who has a history of standing strong against the gun lobby and is most likely to continue President Obama s efforts, combat Republicans and their perversion of the Second Amendment, and get the job done.Featured image: Americans For Responsible Solutions
