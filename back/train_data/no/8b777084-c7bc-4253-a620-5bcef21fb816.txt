mocking a liberal snowflake is never a good idea .. cnn severed ties with jeffrey lord on thursday , hours after he ignited controversy by tweeting the words sieg heil !
at a prominent liberal activist.a cnn spokesman said : nazi salutes are indefensible .
jeffrey lord is no longer with the network .
the problem is that lord was responding to the stazi tactics of the speech police known as media matters .
lord said his tweet was misunderstood .
he said he was mocking fascists , not acting like one .
i love cnn , but i feel they are caving to bullies here , he said in a telephone interview shortly after the network s decision was announced.lord said his contract was set to expire at the end of the year .
he said he greatly respected cnn management despite disagreeing with the decision.we re guessing the liberal is unable to tell the difference between a mocking gesture and a serious one
