Megyn Kelly may have departed Fox News for more legitimate pastures at NBC, but she s no less of a right-wing hack.
If anything, she s openly doing Donald Trump s bidding from her new anchor chair.
Case in point Kelly decided to bring fringe conspiracy nut Alex Jones in for an interview.
This is the same guy who says the mass shooting of more than 20 innocent small children and teachers at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown Connecticut is a government hoax that used child actors to fool the world in order to promote gun control.Well, the mother of one of the victims of that very same shooting took Kelly to the woodshed for legitimizing Jones.
Nelba Marquez-Greene took to Twitter and ripped Kelly apart:Hey @megynkelly , let me know if you want to give his victims equal air time.
Promoting this fool is bad news.
Do not encourage his abuse.

How do I explain this to my son?
https://t.co/lEVlBR8LI6 Nelba M rquez-Greene (@Nelba_MG) June 12, 2017Here you go @megynkelly her name is Ana Grace M rquez-Greene.
Say her name- stare at this & tell me it's worth it.

#SandyHook grieving dads will go to the cemetery.
#thisisnotnormal Nelba M rquez-Greene (@Nelba_MG) June 12, 2017Chelsea Clinton then chimed in to comfort the grieving mother:I am so sorry Nelba you continually confront disbelief and derision.
It should be obvious how very, very wrong that is.
Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) June 12, 2017There is no justification for amplifying lies (or a liar), particularly about unimaginable tragedy.
I hope no parent, no person watches this https://t.co/nSt1MGGM2U Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) June 12, 2017After that, Shannon Watts, who founded Moms for Gun Sense in America, took her turn to school Kelly:This is the mother of a child murdered at Sandy Hook a tragedy Alex Jones says never happened.
How could you @megynkelly?
#shameonNBC https://t.co/gHaHEhxGCU Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) June 12, 2017Why isn't @megynkelly interviewing Sandy Hook families instead of lying, cruel man who has caused them added suffering?
#shameonNBC @nbc https://t.co/yBo6NljTkP Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) June 12, 2017Shame on @MegynKelly and #shameonNBC for allowing this cruel and overexposed liar question whether Sandy Hook happened.
@nbc https://t.co/yBo6NlBucn Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) June 12, 2017This is repulsive and immoral.
How dare you highlight this "person" who accused Aurora and Sandy Hook parents of faking children's deaths?
Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) June 12, 2017Once Kelly saw the firestorm coming her way, she insisted that what she is doing is good journalism, since the orange goon in the Oval Office pretending to be president likes Alex Jones and appeared on his show:POTUS's been on & praises @RealAlexJones' show.
He's giving Infowars a WH press credential.
Many don't know him; our job is 2 shine a light.
https://t.co/5e88BJyqnz Megyn Kelly (@megynkelly) June 12, 2017No, Ms. Kelly.
This is not shining a light.
Just because the moron in the White House traffics in conspiracies and gets his news from lunatics doesn t mean that legitimate journalists need to give this kind of thing a platform.
That s the whole point THIS.
IS.
NOT.
NORMAL.You are giving this bigoted fringe conspiracy theorist a huge platform from a legitimate news network, all the while causing more pain to the families of those murdered children.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
You and NBC owe these families an apology.As for NBC if they want to retain their status as one of the main legitimate news networks, they ll fire this hack immediately and refuse to air her garbage.Featured image via Jemal Countess/Getty Images
