Last year, we reported about women who attended an anti-racism music festival in Sweden that were raped and molested by migrant men.
This report is yet another shocking example of how the west is actually importing a real rape culture.According to police spokesman Stefan Dangardt, numerous foreign men sexually assaulted the women during Borl nge s Peace and Love festival, although three suspects who were arrested were later released because they claimed they were minors.It appears that nothing has changed since last year.
Yesterday, Swedish police received several reports of rape after music festivals at various locations on Friday evening.A 15-year-old girl was raped during a concert at the Br valla Festival in Norrk ping on Friday night.According to the police, the girl was held and raped by a man in the midst of the crowd in front of the concert goers, without anyone intervening.
It s terrible that one has to experience such a thing with a lot of people around, says police spokesman, Thomas Agnevik, to Aftonbladet.We have little information about the perpetrator and about what has happened, he said, while encouraging those present during the concert to contact the police if they saw anything suspicious.The girl was taken care of and underwent a medical examination.During the City Festival in V ster s, two rapes were reported, one of a 16 year old girl.
We have talked to her and obtained information, but we currently have no suspects, said spokesperson for the police in V stmanland, Thomas Gustafsson.A 26-year-old woman has also reported rape after the festival.
She has been sent to hospital and we have been unable to talk to her.
Therefore, I do not have any more details, says Gustafsson.Rapes at Swedish festivals are not really news anymore.
It is merely about announcements.
We are actually there now.
