on independence day , national public radio tweeted the entire declaration of independence to accompany their annual reading of the most important document in our nation s history.in congress , july 4 , 1776 .
npr ( @ npr ) july 4 , 2017the unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of america , npr ( @ npr ) july 4 , 2017when in the course of human events , npr ( @ npr ) july 4 , 2017it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another , npr ( @ npr ) july 4 , 2017and to assume among the powers of the earth , npr ( @ npr ) july 4 , 2017the separate and equal station to which the laws of nature and of nature s god entitle them , npr ( @ npr ) july 4 , 2017a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation .
npr ( @ npr ) july 4 , 2017we hold these truths to be self-evident , npr ( @ npr ) july 4 , 2017that all men are created equal , npr ( @ npr ) july 4 , 2017that they are endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights , npr ( @ npr ) july 4 , 2017that among these are life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
npr ( @ npr ) july 4 , 2017 and so on.to people who generally listen to npr and are typically well-informed ( or anyone who graduated kindergarten ) , this was a wonderful expression of patriotism to be proud of .
then , of course , there are conservatives.while our frenemies on the right love to wave their flags and call themselves patriots , the declaration of independence is apparently on their reading lists alongside the first half of the second amendment and parts of the bible they can use to attack human rights .
conservatives swarmed npr to whine and cry because they thought the tweets were get this an attack on donald trump.when npr got to this part , things got a bit crazy : it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it , and to institute new government , npr ( @ npr ) july 4 , 2017seriously , check this out.stop it braeden ( @ wokepolitik ) july 4 , 2017the responses to @ npr tweeting the declaration of independence are sort of hilarious and sad all at once ? ? ?
