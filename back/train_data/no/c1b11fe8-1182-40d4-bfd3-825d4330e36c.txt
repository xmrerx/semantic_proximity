london ( reuters ) - britain s electoral commission said on thursday it was investigating campaign group momentum - which backed the opposition labour party at a june election - over whether it breached campaign finance rules .
momentum is closely associated with left-wing labour leader jeremy corbyn and has helped the party attract new voters , contributing to its unexpectedly strong performance at the june vote in which conservative prime minister theresa may lost her parliamentary majority .
the electoral commission has today announced it has opened an investigation to establish whether momentum , a registered non-party campaigner at the 2017 uk parliamentary general election , breached campaign finance rules in relation to spending , the commission said in a statement .
the electoral commission , britain s election watchdog , said it was looking into a range of issues , including whether the campaign group exceeded spending limits or submitted incomplete or inaccurate expenditure records .
momentum is registered as a non-party campaigner and is subject to different spending rules to labour and other political parties .
momentum are a high profile active campaigning body .
questions over their compliance with the campaign finance rules at june s general election risks causing harm to voters confidence in elections , said bob posner , the electoral commission s director of political finance and regulation and legal counsel .
