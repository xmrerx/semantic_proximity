bogota ( reuters ) - colombia sent a letter to the venezuelan foreign ministry on tuesday protesting the incursion of a military helicopter and troops from that nation over the border , the latest in a series of similar incidents that have drawn criticism from colombia .
the incident occurred on nov. 15 and 16 near the town of tibu in norte de santander province , colombia s foreign ministry said in a statement .
the events have already been protested by the foreign ministry and there has been a meeting arranged between the foreign ministers to analyze what happened and request that measures be taken to prevent a recurrence , it said .
forays by venezuelan troops into colombia have increased in recent years , heightening diplomatic tension between the government of colombia s president juan manuel santos and venezuelan president nicolas maduro .
santos has accused maduro of destroying democracy in venezuela , while maduro has said colombia is part of an international conspiracy seeking to overthrow his government .
colombia and venezuela share a border of 2,219 km ( 1,379 miles ) , over which contraband and illegal drugs frequently pass , according to security sources .
