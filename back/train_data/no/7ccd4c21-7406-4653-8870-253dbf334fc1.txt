united nations ( reuters ) - saudi royal family members , officials and businessmen arrested in an anti-corruption crackdown this month will be granted due process , saudi arabia s u.n .
ambassador abdallah al-mouallimi said on monday .
authorities have detained dozens of top saudis including billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal in a move widely seen as an attempt by crown prince mohammed bin salman to neuter any opposition to his lightning ascent to power .
those held face accusations of money laundering , extortion , bribery and exploiting public office for personal gain .
a saudi anti-corruption committee has been given the power to seize companies , funds and other assets ahead of criminal inquiries .
i can assure you there will be due process for anybody who is detained , al-mouallimi told reporters at the united nations .
when asked how many people had been detained , he said : i do not have a figure to share with you .
this is something that the security authorities will announce in due course .
u.s. president donald trump has endorsed the crackdown , saying some of those arrested have been milking saudi arabia for years , though the state department has urged riyadh to carry out prosecutions in a fair and transparent manner .
human rights watch has also called on saudi authorities to immediately reveal the legal and evidentiary basis for each person s detention and make certain that each person detained can exercise their due process rights .
