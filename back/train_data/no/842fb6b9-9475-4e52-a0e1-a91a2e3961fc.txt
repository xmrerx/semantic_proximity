while the left points the finger at guns , guns , guns , the real blame is being put on the fbi inability to investigate two attempts to alert them to the florida school shooter , yes , they dropped the ball twice on this !
the first were alerted to nikolas cruz last january from a youtube user who reported him .
they got a second tip in september from someone concerned with cruz and his use of a gun.fact : broward county sheriff s deputies were called to the family home of shooter nikolas cruz 39 times since 2010 shouldn t there be better coordination between the fbi and local police departments ? florida governor rick scott just called for the resignation of the fbi director .
is the fbi too busy politicizing a presidential election to see about important tips like this ?
notice how they came out this afternoon with indictments on 13 russian nationals in regards to supposed interference in the 2016 election .
distraction ? richt back atcha fbi ! breaking : florida gov .
rick scott calls for fbi director to resign in wake of florida school shooting : `` the fbi s failure to take action against this killer is unacceptable the fbi director needs to resign .
