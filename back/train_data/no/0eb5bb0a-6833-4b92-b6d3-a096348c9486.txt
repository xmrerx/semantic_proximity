the truth hurts the idea that there are people in america who would willingly vote for a person to be our next president , that most of america considers to be a pathological liar is really quite stunning why would anyone want to associate pathological lying and hillary clinton ? for more than an hour as of approximately 11:50 p.m. sunday , a google search for the terms pathological lying was producing a picture of mrs. clinton.the picture appears as the illustration for what google calls a special featured snippet block at the top of the page .
the snippet quotes from , and includes a link to , the wikipedia article for pathological lying .
by early monday morning , the image had been removed from the google search.part of what makes the result odd is that while mrs. clinton has been accused of dishonesty and dissembling for the entire quarter-century since she became a national political figure as first lady , the wikipedia article itself doesn t mention her or any specific cases of dishonesty by her .
