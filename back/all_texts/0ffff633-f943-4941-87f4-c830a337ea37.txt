According to Pastor Darrell Reid, he was cleaning his gun inside the home he shared with his wife of 35 years on Monday, when the gun accidentally went off, shooting her in the head.Reid s wife, Katie, was rushed to Apopka Hospital, where she was pronounced dead a short time later.According to the Christian Post, the couple met when they were 12 years old.
They ran a church called Happy Hill Ministries out of their home, located in Zellwood, Florida.It appears that the couple s outward appearance of happiness wasn t quite the reality.WKMG reports that police were called to the pastor s home on 23 separate occasions over the past three years.Reid was arrested multiple times for violent crimes.
According to WKMG, the pastor was most recently charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, but the charge was never prosecuted.
He was also charged with resisting a police officer with violence in 2012.
That charge was also never prosecuted.WKMG reports:A close family friend who didn t want to be identified told News 6 the couple had a violent relationship.Reid s attorney, on the other hand, told the Orlando Sentinel that the couple seemed very close, noting that they always came to court together.
A neighbor said that while he couldn t imagine that Reid intentionally killed his wife, he also has a hard time understanding how you can accidentally shoot someone while cleaning a gun.Judging from his criminal background, Reid was someone who should never have been allowed to posses a gun.
Police had been called to the couple s home almost two dozen times.
He was charged with multiple violent crimes, yet his status as a white, Christian minister no doubt helped him walk away from those crimes unpunished, time and time again.According to the website smartgunlaws.org:Florida law does not explicitly authorize or require the removal or surrender of firearms at the scene of a domestic violence incident.Police are currently investigating the accidental shooting death of 62-year-old Katie Reid.In the meantime, Darrell Reid remains free and likely in possession of a gun.Featured image via Happy Hill Ministries
