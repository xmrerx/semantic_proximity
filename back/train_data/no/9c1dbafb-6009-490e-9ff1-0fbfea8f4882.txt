justice for children without voices : we have spoken to detective luerra with arcola police department and confirmed that the children seen in the video are safe and a case now has been opened .
arcola police department is diligently working with cps and the district attorney s office .
we want to send a huge thank you to deputy fisherhill and detective luerra for the fast response in making sure these children are safe .
and a huge thank you to all of our members who gave this child a voice and helped us get the info to the correct investigating department .
we look forward to working with this department , and with all of you , in the future as we advocate for our children and ensure them a voice !
thank you !
when in the course of raising awareness , alarmism occurs , we would do well , as a civilized society , to acknowledge those alarming statistics and act accordingly .
we should never allow ourselves to believe falsely that awareness is enough when action is required .
