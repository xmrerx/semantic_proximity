new delhi ( reuters ) - indian troops exchanged gunfire on wednesday with separatist guerrillas in a remote northeastern region bordering myanmar , killing or wounding several of the insurgents , army officials said .
the army was carrying out an operation against the separatist group , which is believed to have 2,000 guerrillas battling for an independent greater nagaland state carved out of india .
an army patrol retaliated swiftly upon coming under heavy fire from the rebels , the indian army s eastern command , headquartered in the city of kolkata , said in a statement .
heavy casualties reportedly inflicted on nscn-k cadre , it said , using an acronym for the group , the national socialist council of nagaland-khaplang .
no casualties suffered by indian security forces .
wednesday s operation was confined to the indian side of the border , it added .
in 2015 , indian special forces crossed into myanmar to hunt down guerrillas of the group who had taken shelter in the neighboring country .
that year the group launched a series of attacks on security forces in india s northeast , to scrap a ceasefire it had observed with new delhi since 2001 .
in recent years , the militaries of india and myanmar have built close ties , with each pledging not to allow insurgent groups to shelter in its territory .
india has condemned attacks in august by rohingya insurgents on security posts in myanmar s rakhine state that provoked a military crackdown , causing hundreds of thousands of rohingya muslims to flee the country .
