sydney ( reuters ) - australia on tuesday launched a postal vote on whether to legalize same-sex marriage as a widely watched poll indicated the country would be overwhelmingly in support .
the non-compulsory ballot , which runs until the end of october , will determine whether australia becomes the 25th country to legalize same-sex marriage , while also healing a rift in the government .
despite securing 70 percent public support in an ipsos/fairfax poll on tuesday , the issue of same-sex marriage had faced a political deadlock , only broken last week when the high court gave the all-clear for the vote .
the poll illustrates why parliament should simply vote to approve same-sex marriage without holding the national ballot , opposition labor leader bill shorten said .
change in this country only ever happens when people participate in the change , shorten told reporters in canberra .
please don t leave this change to other people .
the ballot of nearly 16 million people at a cost a $ 122 million ( $ 97.86 million ) will help prime minister malcolm turnbull unite his liberal-national coalition , which had been fractured over the issue throughout his two-year tenure .
turnbull had been under pressure to resolve the impasse after two previous efforts to hold a compulsory vote were rejected by the senate , where the government is in the minority .
frustrated progressive members said they would side with the opposition labor party to secure same-sex marriage if the pm could not finally resolve the issue , though some conservative lawmakers threatened to resign if turnbull did not stick to a public vote , threatening the pm s one-seat majority .
the impasse was eventually resolved when the high court ruled the government could proceed with the non-compulsory vote , without senate approval .
