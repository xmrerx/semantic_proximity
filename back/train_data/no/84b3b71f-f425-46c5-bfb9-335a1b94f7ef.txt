tokyo ( reuters ) - japan s shinzo abe was re-elected prime minister on wednesday after his ruling bloc s big election win last month and days ahead of a visit by u.s. president donald trump that is expected to be dominated by concerns over a volatile north korea .
abe , 63 , took office in december 2012 , promising to reboot the stale economy and bolster defense .
his liberal democratic party-led coalition retained its two-thirds super majority in parliament s lower house in the oct. 22 election , reenergizing his push to revise the post-war , pacifist constitution .
abe was expected to reappoint current cabinet ministers and tell them to compile an extra budget for the year to march 31 , 2018 focusing on child care and boosting productivity .
in a telephone conversation on monday , abe and trump agreed to work together on steps to counter pyongyang s nuclear and missile development .
trump told abe he is looking forward to his visit to japan , that japan and america are 100 percent together and there is no room to doubt the japan-u.s. alliance , japanese deputy chief cabinet secretary yasutoshi nishimura told reporters .
the two leaders have developed a close personal relationship since trump was elected , and plan to play golf together during trump s nov. 5-7 visit to japan .
