Are you having a hard time figuring out whether Donald Trump or Ted Cruz is the least awful GOP candidate in the presidential race?
Bill Maher has you covered.During his New Rules segment, the Real Time host mentioned that Republicans come up to him all the time even in the bathroom and ask him for a hand.So Maher decided to settle the question of which Republican candidate is the least worst once and for all.First, he went over the differences between the two.
Comparing them is apples and orange, Maher quipped.
Donald Trump is like Ebola.
He ll violently kill you right away.
Cruz is more like the Zika virus.
We won t see the damage until future generations.Donald Trump wants to build a wall to keep out creepy foreigners.
Ted Cruz is proof we need it.Ted Cruz has a daughter who doesn t want him to touch her, whereas Donald Trump s daughter is fine with it.
Maher went on to say that while Trump is thin-skinned and reacts to every bad thing said about him, Ted Cruz is immune to insult because he is used to be hated by everyone all the time.
Republicans, I feel your pain, Maher declared.
You re stuck between a rock and a gross place.
The House of A*shole or the House of Douchebag.
Team Werewolf or Team Vampire.
Verizon or AT&T.
But we have to accept that being a grown-up means hard choices between disgusting options.
And with that being said, Maher dramatically picked Ted Cruz as the least worst choice for the Republican nominee and washed his mouth out with bleach.Maher explained his choice by pointing out that Donald Trump is a lunatic who might disappear people like him.
The President signs off on a kill list every day and sends out the drones and I like going outside, Maher said before reluctantly putting on a hat that says Better Ted Than Dead.
