WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia s ambassador to the United States, speaking to reporters on Tuesday after the kingdom announced it would permit women to drive, said the decision was not just a major social change but part of the country s economic reforms.
I think our leadership understands our society is ready, Prince Khalid bin Salman bin Abdulaziz said.
He said women would not need to get permission from a legal guardian to get a license and would not need a guardian in the car when they drive.
