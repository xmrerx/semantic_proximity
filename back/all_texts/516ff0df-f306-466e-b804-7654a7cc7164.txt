You won t believe who was spotted in the special section behind Hillary Clinton at her rally yesterday in Kissimmee, Florida?
The section behind a candidate is typically reserved so the campaign knew he was going to be there.
Remember that after the Orlando attack this man was awful and blamed the attack on guns.
He is a local politician and a total creep.What s up with these Democrats?It s Seddique Mateen, father of Orlando terrorist Omar Mateen:Mateen refused to speak to local reporters at the rally but they caught up with him at a rest stop on the road:Via: WPTV We ve been cooperating with the federal government, and that s about it, he said.
Thank you.
Mateen didn t want to answer any other questions, but just hours later, we ran into him by chance at a rest stop on the way back to West Palm Beach.
He wanted to do an interview and show us a sign he made for Clinton.
Hillary Clinton is good for United States versus Donald Trump, who has no solutions, he said.He had a sign with him Note the bullet point that reads GOOD FOR NATIONAL SECURITY .
