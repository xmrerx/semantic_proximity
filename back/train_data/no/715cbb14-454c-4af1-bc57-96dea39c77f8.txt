london ( reuters ) - the wife of british aristocrat lord lucan , who vanished without trace 43 years ago after the murder of his children s nanny , has been found dead , london police said on wednesday .
the mystery of what happened to richard lucan , a dapper , moustachioed lord known as lucky , has fascinated the public for decades and speculation about his whereabouts has long been a staple of the british press .
lord lucan disappeared hours after nanny sandra rivett was found bludgeoned to death in his house in central london in 1974 .
a car he was using was later found on the south english coast with a length of lead piping .
it was alleged the peer had mistaken the nanny for his estranged wife veronica , who was also attacked and fled to a nearby pub covered in blood to raise the alarm .
she later identified her husband as the assailant .
police said on wednesday they had found the body of 80-year-old lady lucan after forcing entry to a house in the upmarket belgravia area of london .
the death is being treated as unexplained but is not believed to be suspicious , police said .
over the years , the british press have reported supposed sightings of lord lucan across the world , including in australia , india , the netherlands and south africa but his relatives believe him to be dead .
the london high court declared him dead in 1999 and last year a judge issued a death certificate allowing his son george bingham to inherit his title .
my own personal view , and it was one i took i think as an eight-year-old boy , is he s unfortunately been dead since that time ( of his disappearance ) , bingham said last year .
one of numerous theories about what became of lucan , who would now be 82 , was that he shot himself and was then fed to tigers at the zoo of his friend john aspinall .
aspinall himself said in 2000 that lucan had weighted himself down with a stone and drowned himself in the english channel .
