united nations ( reuters ) - dozens of countries signed a treaty to ban nuclear weapons on wednesday amid tensions over north korea s nuclear and missile tests , although the united states , britain , france and others boycotted the event at the annual united nations gathering of world leaders .
the treaty on the prohibition of nuclear weapons will enter into force 90 days after 50 countries have ratified it .
only a few states were due to deposit their ratification on wednesday .
there remain some fifteen thousand nuclear weapons in existence .
we can not allow these doomsday weapons to endanger our world and our children s future , u.n. secretary-general antonio guterres said as he opened the treaty for signing .
earlier this month north korea conducted its sixth and largest nuclear weapons test .
u.s. president donald trump told the 193-member u.n. general assembly on tuesday that if threatened , the united states would totally destroy the country of 26 million people and mocked its leader , kim jong un , as a rocket man .
the treaty was adopted in july by two-thirds of the 193 u.n. member states after months of talks , which the united states , britain , france and others skipped .
they instead pledged commitment to a decades-old non-proliferation treaty , which aims to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology .
the united states , britain and france are among nine countries believed to have nuclear weapons .
