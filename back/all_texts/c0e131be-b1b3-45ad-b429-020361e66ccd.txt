I ll bet Obama didn t count on this beautiful young lady pictured below to be our first gold medal was he hoping for a more diverse American to win?
Does it make you gag to hear this horrible president use our Olympians as political pawns?
He did just that during his Weekly Address video below.
During Saturday s Weekly Address, President Obama said, Team USA reminds the world why America always sets the gold standard: We re a nation of immigrants that finds strength in our diversity and unity in our national pride.
I M SURE HE DIDN T MEAN a blond hair, blue eyed white girl named Jenny Thrasher: American shooter Ginny Thrasher won the first gold medal of the Rio Olympics, pulling off an upset in the women s 10-meter air rifle event Saturday morning.She is an NCAA champion at West Virginia competing in her first Olympics.
BUT We re sure Obama was thinking of the fencing champion from suburban Jersey who ll become the first American Olympian to wear a hijab while competing .OBAMA JUST CAN T HELP HIMSELF He knows NOTHING about America and rattles on about diversity: That s why we watch.
And we have a lot to look forward to this year.
Team USA reminds the world why America always sets the gold standard: We re a nation of immigrants that finds strength in our diversity and unity in our national pride.
