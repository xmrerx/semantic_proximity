It s become abundantly clear that Donald Trump doesn t think through what he s saying, basically at any given moment.
His mouth has no filter, and he says whatever is on his mind at any time without thinking about the consequences of his speech.
And then when people call him on his obnoxious rhetoric, instead of backing down or clarifying, he owns the rhetoric and doubles down on it.Now, it yet another moment of being incapable of using critical thinking skills, Donald Trump compares the Rolling Thunder rally, which is pretty much all motorcycles, to Martin Luther King Jr. s march on Washington, and then he also wants the motorcycles to be able to drive all over the National Mall.
He doesn t like that they re only able to drive on the streets.
However, anyone with a thinking brain could tell you that we shouldn t destroy the National Mall and have it torn up with hundreds, if not thousands, of motorcycles.If Trump sincerely means all the things that he says then we ve got a pretty big problem on our hands if he actually becomes president.
So, for the sake of all that is good and decent in humanity, no matter who, vote blue.Watch here:WATCH: @realDonaldTrump says he thought Rolling Thunder rally in D.C. would be like MLK s March on Washington:https://t.co/9HuaDSawUx ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) May 29, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
