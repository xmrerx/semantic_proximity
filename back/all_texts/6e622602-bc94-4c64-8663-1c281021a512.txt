Trump responded to yesterday s tragic suicide bombings at Istanbul s Ataturk Airport the only way he knows how by ramping up the fear mongering and rallying for more violence and torture.
This of course, renewed his weird obsession with waterboarding and other more extreme torture practices.In speaked at a rally in St. Clairsville, Ohio, Trump made his case: We can t do waterboarding but they can do chopping off heads, drowning people in steel cages, they can do whatever they want to do.
You know, you have to fight fire with fire.
The suicide bombings at the airport killed at least 41 people, wounding over 230.
Just the day before the attack happened, the State Dept.
had issued a travel warning about the increased terror threat in Turkey.
According to the Turkish government, Islamic State fighters were likely responsible.
Trump continued to harp on everyone s anxiety: Folks, there s something going on that s really really bad.
All right?
It s bad.
And we better get smart and we better get tough or we re not going to have much much a country left, okay?
It s bad.
Terrible.
Trump then spoke specifically about waterboarding, a torture practice that was banned by the George W. Bush administration ten years ago.
The crowd cheered when Trump said, I like it a lot.
Implying that if he was elected President, torture methods would get much worse, Trump added, I don t think it s tough enough.
Trump also took to Twitter to drive his point home, encouraging the U.S. to do everything possible to stop terrorism.TwitterTwitterHe returned to waterboarding once again in an interview with CNN.
In an appearance on The Situation Room, Trump said he d change our law on, you know, the waterboarding thing in order to be able to fight at least on an almost equal basis.
Nothing s nice about it but it s a minimal form of torture.
We can t water board and they can chop off heads.
