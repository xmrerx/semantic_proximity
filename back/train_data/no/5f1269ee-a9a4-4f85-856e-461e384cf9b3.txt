boston ( reuters ) - former boston red sox pitcher , failed video game entrepreneur and conservative political commentator curt schilling said on tuesday he is considering running against democratic u.s .
senator elizabeth warren of massachusetts in 2018 .
“ i ’ ve made my decision .
i ’ m going to run , ” schilling said during an interview on wpro-am radio in providence , rhode island , about 40 miles from boston .
he added that the decision would be contingent on his wife ’ s approval .
“ ultimately it ’ s going to come down to how her and i feel this would affect our marriage and our kids. ” schilling also fielded phone calls from listeners about a $ 75 million loan the state of rhode island made in 2010 to his video game company , 38 studios , which went bankrupt in 2012 .
“ i ’ m sorry it ended the way it did , ” schilling said , adding that if he had been governor of rhode island he would not have offered financing to that company .
schilling is still warmly remembered by red sox fans for undergoing a medical procedure that allowed him to pitch with an injured ankle and blood-stained sock during the american league championship series and world series in 2004 , helping the team win its first world series championship since 1918 .
despite being associated with a team from a politically liberal state , schilling has long backed conservative politicians , most recently republican presidential contender donald trump .
