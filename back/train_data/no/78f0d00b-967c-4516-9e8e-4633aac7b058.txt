tripoli ( reuters ) - at least five civilians were killed and 12 others wounded among dozens of casualties in recent fighting in the libyan migrant smuggling hub of sabratha , the united nations said on monday .
sabratha s university hospital has twice been hit by shelling , rendering the emergency and surgery units unusable , the u.n. libya mission said in a statement .
the clashes have pitted the anas al-dabbashi brigade , a powerful armed group previously known for migrant smuggling , against the operations room to combat the islamic state , a group formed last year to oust jihadists from sabratha .
the fighting broke out when a dabbashi brigade member was shot dead at a checkpoint , but the brigade s head has said the underlying cause was the group s move to stop the departure of migrant boats to italy following a deal with the u.n.-backed government in tripoli .
sabratha had been the most common departure point for migrants setting off toward italy from libya , until a sudden drop in crossings from july .
the health ministry in tripoli said on friday that , overall , at least 26 people including combatants had been killed and 170 wounded in nearly two weeks of fighting .
