Conservatives love to portray Cuba as an unviting hellhole, and its citizens complete monsters, so Barack Obama decided to do something about that.
Preceding his historic first visit to the island nation, the President filmed a skit with Cuban TV star P nfilo Friday so the Cuban people could get to know him.In the skit, P nfilo accidentally calls the White House while attempting to call the Meteorological Institute in Casa Blanca to check the weather for a baseball game.
Instead of receiving information on what Mother Nature is up to, however, he ends up on the phone with Obama.
Penfilo, unaware of the identity of the person on the other end, asks if the President can convey a message to himself.
When Obama replies, This is President Obama, the comic feigns an exaggerated panic before returning the (corded) phone to his ear.
But Obama, he stammers, the REAL Obama.
Yes, the real Obama, the President replies.
Who s this?
After introductions, P nfilo tells the President he is glad for the upcoming visit so that [Obama] can get to know the country and its people.
The President replies with an important message to which anti-Cuban conservatives should pay attention: The Cuban People and the American people are friends.
P nfilo jokes with the President about long waits at the airport and offers to pick him and the First Lady up.
He even offers to allow them to stay at his house.P nfilo is a fictional character played by Luis Silva.
The show is incredibly popular, reaching about 2/3 of the country s population.
The Obamas will leave for Cuba on Sunday and will stop in Argentina afterward.
Obama s visit will be the first to Cuba by an American President in 88 years, and an effort to solidify or new friendship with our island neighbor to the South.While our friends on the Right still hate Cuba, the response on the Cuban Embassy s Facebook page was overwhelmingly positive a sign that, at least on their end, friendship between our two nations is at least possible.
Let s not f*ck it up.Watch the skit below:// < !
