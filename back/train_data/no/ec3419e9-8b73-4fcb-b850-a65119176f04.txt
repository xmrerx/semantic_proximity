for the first time , we have a woman of color featured on coins here .
she portrays lady liberty on a $ 100 225th anniversary gold coin , which commemorates the founding of the u.s. mint .
it s a reflection of the cultural and ethnic diversity of the united states , and honestly , it s about damn time .
she is absolutely gorgeous on the new coin : treasury & mint officials unveiled the 2017 american liberty high relief gold coin !

admiral theranthrope ( @ theranthrope ) january 13 , 2017lady liberty is based on libertas , the roman goddess of freedom .
the statue of liberty , modeled after the french sculptor s mother , is likewise based on her , as are most of our depictions of lady liberty .
to conservatives , this means that she must remain white , because obviously.except lady liberty is an idea , not an actual person .
this isn t the same as depicting george washington as a black man on the $ 1 bill .
washington was a real person who was white .
the american ideal of liberty encompasses and represents the diversity of america .
lady liberty is a symbol.this coin is the first of a series from the u.s. mint , which will include an asian woman , a native american woman , and a hispanic woman , as lady liberty as well .
cue more crocodile tears from whiny , racist conservatives.featured image via embedded tweet from united states mint
