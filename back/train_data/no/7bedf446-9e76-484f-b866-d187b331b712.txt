why didn t the it firm come forward before now with the backup of hillary s server ?
she s even more busted if the e-mails still exist .
it s believed that she won t take the fall for this but that abedin or mills will .
this entire mess is yet another example of why clinton is not and never will be a good choice to lead america .
platte river networks , the denver-based cybersecurity firm hillary clinton hired in 2013 to maintain her old email server , says it is highly likely a full backup of the device was made and that the thousands of emails clinton deleted may still exist , abc news is reporting.on wednesday , platte river gave the fbi the server clinton used as secretary of state .
the democratic presidential candidate had stated numerous times prior to that that she would not relinquish control of the server to a third party.but the fbi became interested in the hardware after the revelation that the intelligent community inspector general had determined that two emails that traversed the server contained top secret information .
while clinton is not believed to have sent the emails in question , the finding undermines her claims at the onset of the email scandal in march that no classified information ever landed on her server .
