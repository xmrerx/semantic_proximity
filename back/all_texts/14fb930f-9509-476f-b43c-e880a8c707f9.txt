Say what?The Iranian parliament has rejected the formal, legal text of President Barack Obama s nuclear deal, negotiated in July by the U.S., U.K., France, Germany, Russia, China and the Tehran regime.Instead, the majilis approved their own version of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), creating a situation where the Iranian government simply hasn t signed on to the accord that Obama and Democratic Senators obligated the United States to uphold.Western media incorrectly reported that the majilis approved the actual text of the JCPOA, according to experts.New York Post columnist Amir Taheri has explained in a series of social media posts that Iran s version of the deal calls for the cancellation of sanctions against the regime in Tehran.He also noted that Iran s version of the nuke deal calls for the dismantling of Israel s nuclear weapons program, citing Iranian parliamentarian Kazem Jalali.The Middle East Media Research Center (MEMRI), a regional watchdog organization, has confirmed that Iran did not pass the deal agreed upon in July.
They instead voted to pass the amended version by a vote of 161-59.Iranian lawmakers tried to unilaterally amend the deal to strip the United States ability to snapback sanctions should the Tehran regime cheat the agreement.
They also replaced the language to ensure that the deal will cancel sanctions forever, instead of suspending them, MEMRI reported.The Middle East monitoring group added that the decision to amend the deal unilaterally came at the behest of Iran s dictator, Ali Khamenei, who on September 3 promised not to honor the agreement with Obama.Moreover, the American Enterprise Institute s Iran Tracker site noted that Iran considered its unilateral amendments to the deal as four minor changes.
Separately, as Iranian regime parliamentarians were voting on their own version of the nuke deal, its military was testing a precision-guided ballistic missile in direct violation of United Nations Security Resolution 1929.The Iranian government has ramped up its regional aggression in the past few months, as Iran is set to soon receive tens of billions of dollars in unfrozen assets.Tehran s military is now deeply involved in the ongoing civil war in Syria, with some estimates stating that there are 7,000 soldiers in Syria attempting to prop up Bashar al-Assad s dictatorial rule.
Iran has also continued to provide aid and arms to terror groups Hamas and Hezbollah, and has assisted the Houthi insurgents in Yemen.
Multiple Gulf states have also accused the regime of backing terrorist movements that seek to overthrow their governments.
