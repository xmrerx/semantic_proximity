The road to full equality for women has been long and it s been arduous, and we re still not there.
Women are still not paid equal amounts to men for the same work in professions all across the nation.
And to this day, women are still put down for their ambition, or seen as less than even if they hold superior experience and knowledge.One person who is definitely tired of this rampant inequality is President Barack Obama.
He s been talking about women s equality since day one.
He wants a nation where his daughters are treated the same regardless of gender.
He wants their dreams to be just and big and bold as any boy s as they grow in to amazing young women.While speaking at the new Belmont-Paul Women s Equality National Monument, Obama stated: I want young girls and boys to come here 10, 20, 100 years from now to know that women fought for equality, it was not just given to them.
I want them to come here and be astonished there was ever a time when women could not vote.
I want them to be astonished that there was ever a time when women earned less than men for doing the same work.
I want them to be astonished that there was ever a time when women were vastly outnumbered in the boardroom or in Congress, that there was ever a time when a woman had never sat in the Oval Office .
I don t know how long it will take to get there, but I know we re getting closer to that day, because of the work of generations of active, committed citizens.
While this isn t a direct endorsement of any particular candidate, it does show the president s ongoing commitment to making sure women are treated just the same as men, no matter the job.
And there was no greater place to bring this message than at the new Belmont-Paul Women s Equality National Monument.Thank you, Mr. President.
