berlin ( reuters ) - it is up to britain to move brexit talks forward , germany said on friday , warning that time is running out for london to negotiate the deal it wants .
a day after the eu s chief negotiator , michel barnier , said the talks were deadlocked over money and could not progress to discussions about future trade ties , german government spokesman steffen seibert urged britain to act before an eu summit in december .
eu leaders will discuss brexit at that meeting , seibert said .
this means great britain still has it in its own hands whether there will be enough progress so that the second phase of negotiations can be started .
british prime minister theresa may told parliament on monday it was up to the european union to move talks to the next phase , saying : the ball is in their court .
but her spokesman said on friday that may would have more to say on the financial settlement at an eu summit next week .
germany s biggest industry group has advised companies active in britain to make provisions for a very hard brexit as london lacked a clear strategy .
german chancellor angela merkel says london should not expect a special deal , and that it is more important to keep the remaining 27 member states together .
