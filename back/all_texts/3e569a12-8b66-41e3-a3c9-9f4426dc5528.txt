(Reuters) - A spokeswoman for U.S. Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump on Saturday denied a media report that he had canceled an Ohio rally because of security concerns.
The Cincinnati.com news website had quoted Eric Deters, a local spokesman for Trump’s campaign, as saying the candidate’s Secret Service security detail could not complete preparations in time to hold the event on Sunday at Cincinnati’s Duke Energy Convention Center.
But Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in an email: “We don’t know Eric Deters.
There has been no cancellation.” Ohio is among five states holding primary elections on Tuesday.
A Trump rally in Chicago was called off on Friday after scuffles between Trump supporters and protesters.
