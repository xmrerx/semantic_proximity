Once again President-elect Donald Trump has dominated the media by doing something incredibly dumb.
After whining about the recount effort by Green Party candidate Jill Stein on Twitter, Trump kept the pity party going by whining about how he lost the popular vote.But of course, Trump is so delirious that he had to come up with an excuse for why he d lost by over 2 million votes.
To save himself from having to face the fact that most of America hates him, Trump promoted a ridiculous right-wing conspiracy theory about voter fraud, alleging that Hillary Clinton had won only because of illegal voters.As soon as Trump s little orange fingers could finish his tweet, everyone was all over it.
Election experts, historians, reporters and even other Republicans have rushed to debunk Trump s lies and on Monday, the hosts on ABC s The View couldn t wait to tear Trump a new one.Co-host Joy Behar, who has been an amazing critic of Trump in the past, said she was proud of the media for actually calling Trump out and reporting that Trump s claims had no evidence to support them.
She congratulated news outlets for reporting the truth when she said: The news divisions are now stating that it s a lie.
Like, now they re saying with no evidence, it s not true.
Which is what they should have been doing all year when Politifact said he was lying.
But now they re starting to say, This is a lie, this is a lie, this is a lie.
Whoopi Goldberg also jumped in, just as irritated by Trump s nonstop lying.
She said: There is no evidence anywhere anywhere!
that anyone voted illegally, Donald!
And then, she asked what most of us have been wondering when she questioned why Trump was so afraid of a vote recount.
Now more than ever, it s becoming obvious that Trump is terrified of what the recount might determine, and that he might lose his chance to Make America White Again.You can watch The View blast Trump below:Featured image via screenshot and Win McNamee / Getty Images
