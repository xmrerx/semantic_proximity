Senator Lindsey Graham has had an on-again, off-again relationship with Donald Trump, having first condemned and opposed the Republican nominee, then endorsed, un-endorsed, tried to get his other GOP buddies to also stop supporting him, and now he seems to be back on the Trump bandwagon in hopes that by getting The Donald elected, Republicans can keep the Senate.That s why Graham is particularly thrilled about a recent report on the Clinton Foundation that outlines that more than half of the private individuals who met with Hillary Clinton during her tenure as Secretary of State were also donors to the Clinton Foundation in some capacity and that Clinton had given those donors favorable treatment.In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Graham celebrated this gift from the political gods , claiming that this might actually help Trump close the gap with the Democratic nominee but only if Trump plays his cards right (and we all know what the slim chances of that happening are).
Graham said: If Mr. Trump can up his game and he is, he s doing much better.
If he can control if he can close the gap I think the chance of keeping the Senate goes up.
Graham also criticized the Clinton report, saying that it reeks of wrong, it reeks of insider benefits, the inside versus the outside, and Trump represents the outside and he s in a pretty good spot.
Obviously, Graham isn t considering that Trump s own business and charity record is filled with unethical, fraudulent activity.This interview gets somewhat comical when Graham said, with a straight face, that if only Trump could harness his temperament , demonstrate judgment and show that he was qualified to be the next President of the United States, he might be able to make the Republican Party proud.
Unfortunately, we all know that Trump is just going to disappoint Graham and break his heart again.You can watch the interview below:Featured image via Darren McCollester / Getty Images
