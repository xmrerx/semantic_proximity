manila ( reuters ) - philippine troops on tuesday killed a pro-islamic state gunman in the southern city of marawi , a military official said , eight days after the government declared the end of hostilities .
soldiers have focused on securing marawi against surviving militant fighters since ending five months of operations against islamic state-inspired militants who seized control of parts of the city in may , in a bid to win a foothold in the region .
the conflict displaced about 350,000 residents and killed more than 1,100 people , mostly militants , stirring concern that the southern philippines is becoming islamic state s hub in southeast asia .
the military engaged in a gunfight with one of the suspected remaining gunmen in the main battle area , after foiling his bid to escape , army spokesman colonel romeo brawner said .
we still have to put in troops , because there s a possibility for stragglers , brawner told a news conference in marawi .
in the main battle area , there are many possible hiding spots .
indonesians , malaysians and middle easterners were among the fighters who flocked to marawi to support the islamic state s emirate in southeast asia .
thousands of marawi residents have started returning home , only for some to find dwellings ransacked .
brawner said an army official and five more personnel were detained in barracks after being charged with looting .
the main battle area in downtown marawi remains off limits , pending the removal of booby traps and unexploded ordnance .
