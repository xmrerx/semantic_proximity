WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson said on Wednesday that he does not see a “political path forward” in his 2016 bid for the White House.
Carson, a retired neurosurgeon who has not yet won a state contest of the more than a dozen held so far, said he will not attend Thursday’s Republican debate in Detroit.
He has not formally suspended his campaign.
