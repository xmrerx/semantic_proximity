Cracks are beginning to form in the GOP s wall of ambivalence regarding the future platform of the Republican Party.
For months, top Republicans have dodged questions left and right about controversial policies proposed by the presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.
On Sunday morning, during an interview on ABC s This Week, Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) told the show s host, George Stephanopoulos, the following: If you look at the platform that will be written at our convention, we are not changing the basic principles that Republicans believe in.
Our nominee may not agree with every single one of those but the Party will remain America s conservative party.
Stephanopoulos then questioned McConnell for specifics, asking him if the GOP plans on including language into the platform that supports the adoption of a ban on Muslims entering the United States a policy proposal laid out by Trump that has deeply split the Republican Party and their presumptive nominee like no other.
McConnell was also questioned as to whether the Party would continue to advocate for cutting Medicare and Social Security.
McConnell responded by saying: It s my expectation that the platform will be a traditional Republican Platform, not all that different from the one we had four years ago.
Stephenopolous asks, So it won t be Mr. trump s platform?
McConnell responded by saying: It ll be the platform of the Republican Party and I don t expect it to differ that much from the platform we had four years ago.
While still ambivalent, we can clearly see that Trump is not going to have much of a voice in the creation of the Republican Party platform.You can watch the interview below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GCb_GEQOQiEFeatured image from video screenshot
