london ( reuters ) - spanish government bonds and stocks were in demand on thursday after a media report said catalonian president carles puigdemont was set to call a snap regional election for dec. 20 , a move that could ease tensions with madrid .
barcelona-based la vanguardia said puigdemont had taken the decision in a bid to persuade the government of prime minister mariano rajoy not to enforce direct rule in the region .
puigdemont will make a statement at 1330 cet ( 1130 gmt ) , the regional government said .
this news is positive for spain because it looks like puigdemont is looking for ways other than declaring independence , said ing strategist martin van vliet .
it sounds like he is calling these elections so that madrid does not have to invoke article 155 , that would allow central government to suspend the wealthy region s autonomy .
spain s 10-year government bond yield - which moves inversely to price - fell 6 basis points to 1.58 percent on the news .
spain s country stock index ibex rose as much as 1.9 percent to a four-week high .
the gap between spanish and german 10-year government bond yields a keenly watched measure of market sentiment towards spain moved to its tightest in a month .
the spread between the two widened sharply earlier this month after catalonia voted overwhelmingly in favor of breaking away from spain , albeit on a low turnout , in an oct. 1 referendum declared illegal by authorities in madrid .
