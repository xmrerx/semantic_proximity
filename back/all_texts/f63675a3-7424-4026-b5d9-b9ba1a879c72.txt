Just another tolerant violent liberal, shooting a man who defended his nation because he didn t agree with his opinion Who gave the Left the green light to use violence to shut up an opposing view?A political discussion at a bar in Cleveland ended with a Vietnam vet being shot in the leg because of his support for Donald Trump.60-year-old Paul Jones, Jr. was having a conversation with a friend at Winston s Place near E. 131st Street and Miles Avenue on Monday evening.A man sitting nearby overheard the chat and immediately became aggressive.
He butted in the conversation, Jones told WEWS from his hospital bed.
The conversation wasn t directed at him or to him.
The man continued to get more irate, going to his car to retrieve a gun before he returned and shot Jones in the thigh.The shooter fled the scene and detectives are still searching for him.
I m quite sure you have a lot of people having their own opinions.
But that doesn t mean you should hurt somebody because you have your own opinion, said Jones mother Latosca.Via: InfoWarsh/t Gateway Pundit
