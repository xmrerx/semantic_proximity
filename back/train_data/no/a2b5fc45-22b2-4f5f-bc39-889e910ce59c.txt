once again , the gun grabbers are doing anything they can to restrict ammo and guns in the name of common sense reform .
the thought process behind this is just not making any sense but what does with the gun grabbing dems democrats are pushing legislation which bans online ammunition sales that do not include a face-to-face exchange of ids and which requires ammunition dealers to report any purchases of more than 1,000 rounds.the legislation titled the stop online ammunition sales act of 2015 is sponsored by representative rep. bonnie watson coleman ( d-nj-12th dist . )
and co-sponsored by representative rep. frank pallone jr ( d-nj-6th dist .
) , according to the hill.pallone said : far too many times , we have seen the shocking images of unspeakable gun violence that could have been prevented .
our bill to limit the online sale of ammunition is a long-overdue common sense reform that i am hopeful will spark congress to put aside party difference and come together to help prevent such senseless tragedies.pallone and coleman are focusing on aurora theater gunman james holmes online ammo purchases as a selling point for their legislation .
in so doing , they have overlooked the fact that holmes passed background checks for the firearms he acquired and , therefore , would not have been prevented from ammunition purchases even if forced to show id in a face-to-face manner.via : breitbart
