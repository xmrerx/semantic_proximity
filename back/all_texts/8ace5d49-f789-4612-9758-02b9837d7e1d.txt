At this point, Donald Trump is known for his spelling errors on Twitter and, well, in general.
Not a day goes by that The Donald isn t forced to delete a tweet that looks more like a kindergartener wrote it than normal, tweets in which he calls Hillary Clinton a loose cannon with bad instincts and bad judgement.
But on Saturday, he made an unpresidented error and literally got smacked down by the dictionary.Tweeting about China s seizure of a U.S. underwater drone a brash action taken shortly after The Donald created an international incident by chatting with the President of Taiwan and Twitter-trolling China.
Since that call, Chinese state-run media has been calling for their nation to recover Taiwan by force an obvious consequence of Trump s extremely lackluster foreign policy skills.
The Wall Street Journal reports:The incident on Thursday occurred days after President-elect Donald J. Trump raised China s ire by suggesting his administration could abandon a bedrock agreement on Taiwan s status that has kept peace in the area for decades.
Mr. Trump s suggestion that the U.S. would maintain its position on Taiwan only if China makes concessions to American interests came after he broke decades of diplomatic protocol by accepting a phone call from Taiwan s president, hitting one of Beijing s most sensitive issues.
Trump, of course, jumped on the opportunity to further provoke China.
Unfortunately, he made a rather serious error and was forced to delete and retweet it.
Fortunately, George Takei was nice enough to save a copy:Trump deleted it, but not before I saved it.
Freudian slip?
We can all hope he, too, soon will be "unpresidented."

The true heroes of the day are the folks behind the Merriam-Webster Dictionary s Twitter account.
