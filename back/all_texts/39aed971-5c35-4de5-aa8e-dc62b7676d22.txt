Republican officials are reportedly scrambling to tear down signs at the party convention site in Cleveland in order to avoid yet another racial incident.Wall Street Journal reporter Byron Tau photographed a sign in the Quicken Loans Arena labeled White Elevator.
Tau noted on Twitter: I m told it s being replaced for obvious reasons.
Spotted at the #RNCinCLE.
I'm told it's being replaced for obvious reasons.

But the rhetoric of many of their leaders and elected officials, including presumptive nominee Donald Trump, have made such moves difficult.Signs that echo Jim Crow racism, with segregated water fountains and schools are just the latest headache.Party bosses are already keeping their mouths shut over the controversy.It s unclear who vetted the signs or why they were hung in the first place.
Neither RNC organizers nor Trump s campaign immediately responded to the Daily News request for further comment.The white banners are eerily similar to the signs that once kept America segregated: Everything from bathrooms to restaurant entrances were labeled for white and colored use until segregation was abolished in 1964.City officials in Cleveland have expressed concern about the mix of anti-Trump protesters and pro-Trump forces, who have also promised that they plan to carry weapons with them, as Ohio is an open carry state.One of the groups who had previously promised to attend the convention was a white supremacist group, who was also involved in a protest that broke out into violence in California.
The head of that group, the Traditionalist Worker Party, has said they have been attracted to Trump s campaign because they believe that he has tapped into their key issue: immigration.Trump and the Republican Party face an uphill climb among black voters.
While Mitt Romney attracted six percent of the black vote in 2012, even without President Obama on the ballot (he has endorsed Clinton), Republicans are still viewed with skepticism and the party s support of voter identification laws that suppress the black vote don t help.Recent state polling showed Trump receiving ZERO black votes in key swing states like Ohio and Pennsylvania.Featured image via Twitter
