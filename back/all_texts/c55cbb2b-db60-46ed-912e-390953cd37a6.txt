How in the world did this racist thug get elected?
He s disgusting!
He kept calling POTUS 45 then Chris Cuomo asked why he was doing that His answer is idiotic and disrespectful: That s just what I call him.
I believe that when he begins to act as if he deserves to be in that office, and leads in terms of unifying people, then he will deserve the name of President Trump.
But at this point, I believe that he has not done the things in regards to bringing this country together.
CHRIS CUOMO: Do you believe the president helped with what he said yesterday?WES BELLAMY: I believe that 45 did make some strides in regards to specifically condemning the white supremacists and the KKK .
.
.
I would love to move away from the remarks and comments of 45 and focus more on what s going on here on the ground in Charlottesville .
.
.
So again, I m not as concerned with what 45 is doing, I m more concerned with us progressing as a community.CHRIS CUOMO: Wes, quick question.
Why do you refer to the president as 45?
Yes, he is the 45th president, but is that intentional, or is that just a quick term.BELLAMY: Well, that s just what I call him.
I believe that when he begins to act as if he deserves to be in that office, and leads in terms of unifying people, then he will deserve the name of President Trump.
But at this point, I believe that he has not done the things in regards to bringing this country together, he has not done the things in regards to making us a more unified place.
Nor has he decided to condemn the individuals in a rapid pace, or as he should, or speak out in the way we believe he should.
But again, I m not here to talk about 45.BELLAMY IS A KNOWN RACIST BUT CBS IS COMPLICIT WITH THEIR DESIRE TO CENSOR BELLAMY S RACIST TWEETS: CBS reporter Jan Crawford interviewed BELLAMY in her April 13 Evening News segment about the Robert E. Lee statue at the center of Charlottesville controversy.
Crawford downplayed the racist comments and made no mention of Bellamy s punishment for the disgusting tweets he sent (see below) His past tweets suggest that he was part of the race problem.
But CBS purposefully minimized his history, shifting the blame onto the vice mayor s opponents.
Supporters of the statue unearth crude tweets written by Bellamy as a younger man, Crawford noted, and he also was targeted with death threats, but Bellamy feels his fight is justified.
Just what kinds of crude things did Bellamy say?
There were racist tweets, such as his comment in 2009: I DON T LIK WHIT PEOPLE SO I HATE WHITE SNOW!!!!!
FML!!!!
And his 2010 tweet: I really #hate how almost 80% of the black people here talk white.
There were inappropriate and crude tweets.
The same year, he tweeted: ALRIGHT.
My phone goin ham.
Lol.
THERE IS A DIFF BETWEEN ASS& EATIN PUSSY!!!
I repeat THERE IS A DIFF BETWEEN ASS& EATIN PUSSY!
There were also sexist posts.
I m all for equal opportunity..but a Female Principal with a school full of female teachers is fkn a sure fire way to fk our lil boys up smh, he tweeted in October 2011.THIS IS THE BEHIND-THE-SCENES INFO OF THE FIGHT BETWEEN BELLAMY AND KESSLER (ORGANIZER OF THE MARCH TO PROTEST THE REMOVAL OF THE STATUE):
