london ( reuters ) - britain s prince charles will tour southeast asia and india later this month , but the heir to the throne will not visit myanmar , after a spate of violence and allegations that authorities are carrying out ethnic cleansing .
media reports last month said an official visit to myanmar was being suggested for the trip , which the prince is undertaking on behalf of the british government , and aides acknowledged it had been considered as part of the schedule .
but it was omitted from the final program issued on wednesday .
charles and his wife camilla will travel to singapore , malaysia and then to india where he will meet prime minister narendra modi .
we looked at a range of options in the region and , as we re announcing today , we re going ahead with the visit to singapore and malaysia , philip malone , deputy head of department at britain s foreign and commonwealth office , told reporters .
malone and royal aides declined to elaborate .
more than 500,000 rohingya muslims have fled from myanmar to bangladesh in the past month since insurgents attacked security posts near the border , triggering fierce military retaliation that the united nations has branded ethnic cleansing .
last month britain suspended its training program for the military in myanmar because of the violence , and diplomatic relations have deteriorated .
rights campaigners had argued against a royal visit .
to have someone of prince charles s stature go to visit the country would be seen as a reward , and giving legitimacy to the government and the military that are currently violating international law , said mark farmaner , director of burma campaign uk .
charles and camilla will begin their tour in singapore on oct. 31 before going to malaysia , where they will celebrate 60 years of diplomatic ties since the former british colony became independent , before concluding the 11-day tour in india .
