Terkel describes how Watters, an O Reilly Factor correspondent, stalked, ambushed, harassed and accosted her in this Think Progress article.Upon recognizing Watters at the WHCD, Grim decided to give Watters a taste of his own medicine.According to witnesses who spoke with the Washington Post, Grim approached Watters, whipping out his camera phone and filming him.
Grim later posted to Twitter that ambush guy didn t take well to being ambushed himself.Image credit: screen capture Ryan Grim, via TwitterOnce the confrontation became physical, a crowd of bystanders intervened to keep the peace.The Washington Post reports that RNC executive director Sean Spicer stepped in to separate the two men, during what he described as an effort to stay true to the party venue.
The Washington Post reached out to Watters for comment, but did not get a response.They did reach Grim, who was described as unrepentant.
Ambush guy can t take getting ambushed, he said.
Maybe he should think about his life choices.
