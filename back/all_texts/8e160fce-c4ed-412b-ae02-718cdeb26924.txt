Listen:After creating a video that included a vile, beheaded bloody head of President Donald Trump, the not-so-funny comedian Kathy Griffin has watched her career falling apart.
In true liberal form, Griffin is blaming Donald Trump and his children for destroying her life, even though much of the outrage from the Trump children and his wife Melania was over Griffin s stated goal of wanting to beat down Trump s 11-year old son Barron.
Even CNN and CNN s Anderson Cooper, who once considered himself a friend of Griffins have alienated themselves from the ISIS inspired comedian.
No worries though, the man who loves to impersonate Donald Trump on SNL, and who berated his own 11-year old daughter, actor Alec Baldwin has Kathy Griffin s back.The 59-year-old actor, who played President Donald Trump on last season of Saturday Night Live, took to Twitter on Friday to defend Griffin amid the backlash over her controversial photo shoot.
Kathy .baby I ve been there, Baldwin wrote before referencing his own political drama in 1998, when he joked about then-Representative Henry Hyde on Late Night with Conan O Brien.
The whole Henry Hyde thing w Conan, where we bring out an oxygen mask at the end?
A joke, he recalled.
That s what I thought.
That s what we intended.
No one walked out of the studio and said, No, we re serious!
No one.
But all your gutless, weasels in the GOP insisted I actually threatened Hyde.
They played the victim beautifully.
FOX NewsSorry Alec but when you start making jokes about our current president being beheaded and actually create visuals to make your point that s when you cross the line from humor to inhumanity.
Not that we care, but you re not doing your flailing career any favors by defending ISIS Kathy.
