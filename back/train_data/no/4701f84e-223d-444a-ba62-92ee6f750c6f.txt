manchester , england ( reuters ) - a prankster , who has previously targeted u.s president donald trump and former fifa president sepp blatter , interrupted british prime minister theresa may s keynote speech at her annual conference on wednesday .
british comedian simon brodkin , who uses the stage name lee nelson , handed a p45 letter , a document given to employees when they leave their job , to may as she gave her speech to conservative supporters .
as he was bundled out of the hall , may briefly stopped speaking before the party faithful stood to applaud and cheer her .
as security agents escorted him out of the conference hall , brodkin quipped that foreign secretary boris johnson - who is widely believed to have ambitions to be prime minister himself - had told him to hand the p45 to may .
boris told me to hand her a p45 , he told reuters .
he didn t tell me why .
he wanted me to do it .
writing on his twitter feed shortly afterwards , brodkin said : hi @ borisjohnson , i gave theresa her p45 just like you asked .
the comedian interrupted a media conference by trump at his scottish golf course last year by rolling golf balls toward him emblazoned with swastikas and in 2015 showered blatter with fake paper money at a briefing with reporters .
