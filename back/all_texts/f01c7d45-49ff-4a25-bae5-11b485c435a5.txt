Donad Trump s words to Megan Kelly in a 2011 interview about the Republican debates are coming back to haunt him big time today, and reveal the real reason he s backing out.
He s scared of her.Trump was railing at the quality of debate moderators at the time, stating that they were unaware of the big issues and failing to grill candidates sufficiently.
Kelly asked: Do you really think you re a better moderator than I am?
To which Trump responded: No, I could never beat you.
That wouldn t even be close.
That would be no contest.
You have done a great job, by the way, and I mean it.
Flash forward a few years, and when Kelly applied that no-nonsense moderation to Trump himself, he didn t feel quite so complimentary.
In fact, he fully freaked out.First he began hate-tweeting her.Then he claimed she must have been on her period, on national television, in a bid to undermine her.And after refusing to end his relentless vendetta against her, now he is set to boycott Fox s Republican debate on Thursday night.
He is literally unable to face Kelly.
While happy to rail against her in the media, and launch playground bully-style hate-tweets at her on social media when it comes to going up against her face to face, he s bailing.If Trump cannot face a few tough questions from Megan Kelly, how on earth would he handle tough talks with Putin, or Iran, or China or even Congress?
The trust fund tycoon has lived the sort of pampered life where his cash normally protects him from dealing with those who hurt his ego or un-nerve him.
As President of the United States, a far tougher skin and sureness of character is required neither of which Donald Trump possesses.Featured Image via Screengrab
