la paz ( reuters ) - bolivia s socialist president evo morales on wednesday hailed a decision by the country s highest court to allow him to run for another re-election as a great surprise for the people , for the revolutionaries , for the anti-imperialists .
the opposition said it would march against the ruling announced on tuesday by the constitutional court , which paved the way for morales to run for a fourth term in 2019 .
the court decision was final and can not be appealed .
the ruling guarantees a democratic continuity , but also guarantees stability , dignity and work for the bolivian people , morales said during a news conference .
opposition leaders called for several marches to be held on wednesday , protesting what they say is the end of democracy in the land-locked , natural gas-producing country .
it means a coup d etat , it means trampling the constitution and the most worrying is that bolivia is approaching the road that venezuela is on , samuel doria medina , leader of the national unity party , told reuters .
bolivia is allied with venezuela , where leftist president nicolas maduro is struggling with a severe economic crisis .
morales , in power since 2006 , had previously accepted the results of a 2016 referendum , when 51 percent of voters rejected his proposal to end existing term limits .
he later reversed course , saying that while he was willing to leave office , his supporters were pushing for him to stay .
in september , morales movement to socialism ( mas ) party asked the court to rescind legal limits barring elected authorities from seeking re-election indefinitely .
