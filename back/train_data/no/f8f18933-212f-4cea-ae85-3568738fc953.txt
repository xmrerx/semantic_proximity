donald trump is losing it .
on monday , he kicked off his morning with perhaps his dumbest ravings yet about swamps and sewers and fake news ( oh my ? ) .
drain the swamp should be changed to drain the sewer it s actually much worse than anyone ever thought , and it begins with the fake news !
our middle-schooler-in-chief tweeted.drain the swamp should be changed to drain the sewer it 's actually much worse than anyone ever thought , and it begins with the fake news !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) july 24 , 2017if you re thinking what the f * ck is he on about ?
then you re not the only one .
for one , a sewer is a drainage system .
that s the whole point.just like adolf hitler , trump continued his attacks on the l genpresse fake news as trump calls the media.he also once again demanded that everyone focus on crooked hillarys rather than himself .
it is unclear if he meant that as a possessive or a plural.so why are n't the committees and investigators , and of course our beleaguered a.g. , looking into crooked hillarys crimes & russia relations ?
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) july 24 , 2017basically , this tantrum was a gigantic mountain of stupidity and americans were glad to mock him mercilessly for it.you are right .
if dc was a swamp before , you made it a sewer .

conor mac ( @ thefella ) july 24 , 2017yes , change the slogan .
