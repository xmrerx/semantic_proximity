Eric Trump, one of Donald Trump s two creepy adult sons, tried on Monday to defend his father s revolting comments about sexually assaulting women.
His pathetic excuse?
That s just what happens when alpha males get together and start talking.The younger Trump followed the narrative that has been put forth by everybody else in his daddy s campaign: It s no big whoop, it s just locker room banter.
And besides, it s the Clintons who we should really be talking about.
I think that s Hillary going low, Eric Trump said on Tuesday.
I think you ve seen that for a long time.
If you look at her track record with women, I think you saw that yesterday with some of the people we had sitting at the debate.
It s horrible.
She ll dig out dirt on someone from 15 years ago when someone is in entertainment.
And, listen, my father apologized for it.
He was right to apologize for it, and I m glad he apologized for it, he continued.
At the same time, if you look at her track record with women, it s horrible.
It s absolutely horrible.
Nevermind the fact that there isn t one shred of evidence that the Clintons were behind the release of the bombshell p*ssy tape.Eric added that he was completely surprised it came out.
At the same time, I think it s locker room banter, he said, repeating his father s description of it.
I think sometimes when guys are together they get carried away, and sometimes that s what happens when alpha personalities are in the same presence.
At the same time, I m not saying it s right.
It s not the person that he is.
So, there s nothing to see here folks.
Ignore that my father will soon be sitting before a judge after being accused of raping a 13-year-old child.
Forget that he nags out with the likes of proven sexual predators like Jeffery Epstein and Roger Ailes.
He s just an alpha male and all alpha males brag about sexual assault.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images
