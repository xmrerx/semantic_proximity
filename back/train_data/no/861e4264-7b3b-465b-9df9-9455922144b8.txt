london ( reuters ) - british police said reports of a suspicious package near holborn , central london , had turned out to be a false alarm .
pictures on twitter had shown several police cars and officers in the cordoned-off street , but a spokeswoman later said the operation had been stood down .
britain s threat level is currently set to severe , meaning an attack is highly likely , and 30 people were injured last friday when a bomb on a train apparently failed to fully detonate .
