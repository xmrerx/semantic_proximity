Fans of #CrookedHillary are not going to like this WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange has said that the information they have on Donald Trump is not more controversial material than what comes out of Donald Trump s mouth every second day.
We do have some information about the Republican campaign, Assange said.
I mean, it s from a point of view of an investigative journalist organization like WikiLeaks, the problem with the Trump campaign is it s actually hard for us to publish much more controversial material than what comes out of Donald Trump s mouth every second day, I mean, that s a very strange reality for most of the media to be in.
Assange has also claimed he has further information relating to Hillary Clinton that he plans to release closer to the November election.Assange alluded to what information the October surprise as it is now being called may contain saying, I don t want to give the game away, but it s a variety of documents from different types of institutions that are associated with the election campaign, some quite unexpected angles, some quite interesting, some even entertaining.
Assange isn t focusing entirely on Clinton however, urging anyone with information on Trump to come forward, If anyone has any information that is from inside the Trump campaign, which is authentic, it s not like some claimed witness statement but actually internal documentation, we d be very happy to receive and publish it, he said on NPR s Morning Edition in August.
