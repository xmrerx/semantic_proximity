Donald Trump has been acting like nothing more than a child ever since he began campaigning for the presidency.And he has gotten much worse since taking over the White House.Trump constantly whines about the media and brags about himself in an effort to make it sound like he knows what is doing and that anyone who criticizes him is wrong.Since Trump acts like child, the Internet decided to treat him like one by creating the #TinyTrump meme.Now Trump s body size will match his hand size as each photo shows a much smaller Trump sitting or standing next to a full size President Obama or Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.The memes are hilarious and are the perfect way to piss off Trump and his supporters.Reddit users are photoshopping Trump to be about 2 feet tall, and it s hilarious #Trump #TinyTrump https://t.co/r8eUkaCqps pic.twitter.com/7rnXCvGFbk Effeswein (@fswein) February 17, 2017So @realDonaldTrump wants #tinyTrump off the Internet ..ooopsssss pic.twitter.com/Hxao6OSkC8 Zola25 (@295415c) February 18, 2017Can we please RT this?

(@RememberObama) February 18, 2017Donald Trump is sure to be mighty pissed off when he sees these photos.
He is obsessed with the size of his hands and he is incredibly thin-skinned and sensitive about it.
So seeing himself this small will definitely bruise his fragile ego.Featured image via Twitter
