RAMALLAH, West Bank (Reuters) - Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Wednesday that Jerusalem was the eternal capital of the State of Palestine in response to U.S. President Donald Trump s announcement that he was recognizing the city as Israel s capital.
In a pre-recorded speech played on Palestine TV, Abbas rejected Trump s announcement which included a decision to move the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, a move he said was tantamount to the United States abdicating its role as a peace mediator.
