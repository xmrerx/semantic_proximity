london ( reuters ) - foreign minister boris johnson said poles in britain will be protected , whatever happens after brexit , in comments publicized on thursday that appeared to go further than prime minister theresa may on guaranteeing the rights of eu citizens .
johnson was speaking on oct. 17 at the belvedere forum on uk-polish relations , according to the british embassy in warsaw in remarks which were reported by the guardian newspaper on thursday .
i have only one message for you all tonight , you know exactly what it is : you are loved , you are welcome , your rights will be protected , whatever happens , johnson said in a video posted by the embassy on its twitter feed .
earlier this month , may said it was a priority to protect eu citizens rights and an agreement with the eu was near but the government has resisted calls to unilaterally guarantee their rights .
in a letter to eu citizens last week , may said : i want to give reassurance that this issue remains a priority , that we are united on the key principles , and that the focus over the weeks to come will be delivering an agreement that works for people here in the uk , and people in the eu .
a foreign office spokeswoman said johnson was not diverging from may s comments : the foreign secretary was simply reiterating our determination to achieve this .
last year there were just over 900,000 poles living in britain , according to the office for national statistics and johnson praised their contribution to british life including through 30,000 businesses .
but some have returned home in recent months , concerned about their status following the brexit referendum which many saw as a vote against recent immigration from eastern europe .
johnson , who is known for his outspoken comments , has professed loyalty to may in recent weeks but his interventions have been seen as undermining her authority , which was severely weakened after a botched june 7 snap election .
