this is by far the best analysis yet of the entire ordeal of the trump-russia collusion lie .
victor davis hanson goes through what brought us to where we are with this charade .
he goes through all of the things that obama and clinton did that could be misconstrued as supporting the russians remember the sale of our uranium ?
how about the big reset button that hillary clinton presented to the russians yes , if president trump did any of that he would be accused of working for the kremlin.https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? time_continue=3 & v=y5tphhgg6hehanson calls this entire case the big lie and we couldn t agree more !
he nails it !
we think tucker needs to bring hanson back asap !
