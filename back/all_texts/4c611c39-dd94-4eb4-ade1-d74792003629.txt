When Trump s White House released a list of terrorist attacks they say the media did not cover, one thing was clear: the dictionary is the Trump administration s worst enemy.
Attacker was spelled attaker, the list referenced a country called Denmakr, San Bernardino was missing an r, and so on.
Eventually, the Merriam-Webster dictionary caught wind of the error-ridden list and offered some advice.
Reminder that our app has voice search, so you can look a word up even if you re not sure how it s spelled, the Dictionary tweeted, adding a link to their ( there in Trumpspeak) app.Reminder that our app has voice search, so you can look a word up even if you're not sure how it's spelled.

?Was that an attak?

'Side-eye' is now in the dictionary.
Our earliest example of it in use comes from 1797.

Just added it back.

https://t.co/F62W8BBmHl Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) February 7, 2017Trump s team is built from the absolute worst our country has to offer: white supremacists, warmongers, corporate warlords, and the absolute dumbest people one could ever imagine.In just a few weeks, Donald Trump has managed to make a mockery of almost every aspect of our government, appointing a slew of unqualified people to positions they should never be near and even getting tricked into making a white supremacist one of the most powerful men in the country.Take the time to laugh, but be sure to resist the snollygoster in the White House in every way you can for the next four years or, of course, until he is ultimately impeached for being completely and utterly incompetent.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)/screengrab
