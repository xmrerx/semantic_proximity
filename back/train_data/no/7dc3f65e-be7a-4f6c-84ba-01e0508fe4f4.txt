johannesburg ( reuters ) - a sudden decision forcing all congolese nationals to travel on biometric passports from next month has provoked a backlash from lawmakers already vexed by revelations about the documents high cost .
even though democratic republic of congo sits near the bottom of the u.n. human development index , the passports it introduced in 2015 are among the world s most expensive .
a reuters investigation in april showed that $ 60 of their $ 185 purchase price goes to a company registered in the united arab emirates whose owner is believed to be a close relative of congo president joseph kabila .
despite a subsequent outcry , vice foreign minister aggee aje matembo toto said at the weekend that , from oct. 16 , citizens would no longer be able to use non-biometric passports , some of which are not due to expire until 2020 .
those that tried to would have their document confiscated and replaced with a photocopy , he said in a statement that justified the change on security grounds .
the abrupt ban taps into a climate of political instability fed by militia violence since kabila last december refused to step down at the end of his mandate .
not only is this decision inopportune but it is ... above all unacceptable in the ( current ) politico-social context , zacharie bababaswe , a deputy from kabila s majority coalition wrote in a letter to aje matembo toto .
opposition lawmaker juvenal munubo submitted a formal demand for aje matembo toto to give parliament an explanation .
aside from the withdrawal of this unpopular decision ... no remedy will be able to reduce tensions , munubo wrote on twitter .
congolese citizens expressed displeasure on social media , posting under a hashtag translating as : don t touch my passport .
reports in the congolese media and by activist groups about the wealth kabila has accrued over his 16 years in power have also stoked resentment , while his supporters say he and his family have broken no laws .
