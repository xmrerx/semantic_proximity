paris ( reuters ) - french president emmanuel macron on tuesday reaffirmed that he wanted the euro zone to have its own budget and finance minister , adding that it was key to ensure the stability of the single currency union and to weather economic shocks .
the fundamental issue at stake is not a mechanism which will magically solve all our problems , macron said in a speech on the future of europe .
what is at stake is to reduce unemployment which affects one in five european youths .
