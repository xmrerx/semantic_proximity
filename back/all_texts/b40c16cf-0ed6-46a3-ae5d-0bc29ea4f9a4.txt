The Iowa caucuses have come and gone, leaving in their wake a trail of fallen candidates no longer willing to have their dignity handed to them by the likes of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.
Not that Republicans have any actual dignity, so let s just go with the idea that they re tired of being embarrassed.Who can blame them?
Mike Huckabee was the first to fall, joking that it wasn t due to low votes but to illness.
The voters are sick of me, said the Huckster.
Waka waka.
Buh bye.
Rand Paul went down in flames shortly thereafter, deciding to make sure he doesn t lose his senate seat instead, which is a valid concern.For the Democrats, Martin O malley dropped out, which comes as no surprise to anyone.That leaves the two major contenders for the Democrats and a still ridiculously large field of horrible governors, senators who don t bother voting and a few non-politician types who don t understand the first thing about how the real world works.Even with the dropouts and a Cruz victory proving devastating to Donald Trump, the real loser of the Iowa caucuses was Jeb Bush, who outspent every by dropping more than $12 million and walking away with votes in the single digits.
None of the establishment favorites fared well with the exception of Marco Rubio, who stepped up in the absence of Donald Trump at the last Fox News debate and screamed at America every time he was given the chance.It s a circus for sure.
Luckily, we have people like Stephen Colbert who know how to take the ridiculously irritating Republican field and turn them into the buffoons they are for our enjoyment.
Stephen dons his Hunger Games attire, which includes eyebrows that his forehead can t contain, and spends a few minutes making asinine asshats look even worse than they already do.Watch Stephen Colbert lambaste the fallen tributes In this hilarious clip:Featured image from screen capture
