Senator Elizabeth Warren must be doing whatever Nancy Pelosi is doing The very strange comment by Warren must require translation because we hope she didn t mean what she said!What is it anyway with the women in the Democrat Party?
Pelosi, Warren and Maxine Waters are all having bizarre moments on camera.
Keep it up ladies!
It just means more votes for Republicans!https://twitter.com/TEN_GOP/status/858742017521631232Senator Warren is known for her off color and strange speeches Remember the Nasty woman speech?Liz Warren appeared with Hillary Clinton today and delivered a man-hating rant like no other.
She was spewing so much hate towards Trump but missed any substance in policy issues.
She did parrot the free college mantra and gave a shocked comment on how she couldn t believe people have to pay for an education.
Can you say she s way out of touch?
Yikes!Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma): "Get this Donald: nasty women are tough, nasty women are smart, and nasty women vote.
