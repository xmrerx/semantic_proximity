even though senator susan collins voted with the senate gop to move the obamacare repeal effort forward , it should be noted that during the amendment process in which democrats unleashed a flurry of provisions to protect those who rely on obamacare the most she bucked her party almost exclusively to side with democratic proposals ( members who are independent but caucus with the democrats are considered democrats for the sake of their proposals ) .perhaps this may give a hint as to how senator collins will vote when the actual repeal comes to the floor.here are the amendments collins voted for : the gillibrand amendment [ kirsten gillibrand , new york ] to protect women s health care from aca repeal by keeping in place provisions that : the measure failed.the brown amendment [ sherrod brown , ohio ] to prevent children , especially those in low-income families , from losing coverage if obamacare were to be repealedthe measure failed.the casey amendment [ bob casey , pa ] to ban discrimination in coverage based on pre-existing conditions.the sanders amendment [ bernie sanders , vermont ] to prevent congress from cutting social security , medicare or medicaid under an obamacare repeal.the measure failed.the hirono-donnelly amendment [ mazie hirono , hawaii & joe donnelly , indiana ] to prevent congress from further cutting social security , medicare or medicaid from the reconciliation process , mirrored that sanders amendment after it failed.the measure failed.the baldwin amendment [ tammy baldwin , wisconsin ] to allow individuals aged 26 or lower to stay on their parent s insurance plan.the measure failed.the king amendment [ angus king , maine ] to ensure access to affordable healthcare insurance for people who work in high-risk occupations like fishing , public safety ( police , firefighters ) , forestry and farming.the measure failed.the manchin amendment [ joe manchin , west virginia ] to ensure rural hospitals and healthcare providers do not lose or miss out on crucial funding that has been established by the affordable care act.the measure failed.measure after measure , parts of obamacare that republicans said they agreed with were shot down in a vote-a-rama in the wee hours of the morning .
in other words , republicans told the public one thing and then voted another way when they thought no one was looking.susan collins , however , voted with the democrats on every single amendment they offer , minus four ( menendez , wyden , nelson and kaine s amendments ) .
democrats offered 12 amendments , and collins voted for eight.all of these amendments were no brainers .
yet in three of the eight , collins was the only republican to side with the democrats .
in four , she was one of two .
the only democratic amendment that saw more than two republican votes was manchin s , which received four.collins has not yet responded as to why she voted for the final passage of the resolution , but the fight isn t over yet .
this is why it s important to call , email , show up in person , etc.call senator collins , thank her for bucking her party , but keep the pressure up : the hon .
