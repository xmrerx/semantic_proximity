Fox News loves to point the finger at Snowflakes and anybody they think should buck-up and not complain about the way of the world.
Ironically, they also are the first to freak-out over any type of artistic expression that they think puts the President in an unflattering light.
A disgusting New York City play depicting the president brutally assassinated, is how Fox and Friends began a news segment about an NYC Shakespeare in the Park play they found to be offensive.
Fox apparently succeeded at stoking conservative outrage because even Donald Trump Jr. seems to have his panties in a bunch over the play.I wonder how much of this "art" is funded by taxpayers?
Serious question, when does "art" become political speech & does that change things?

A play called The Tragedy of Julius Caesar, which was written by William Shakespeare all the way back in 1599 way before The Donald got his greasy paws on the White House.Most people are familiar with Julius Caesar from high school English class.
The plot highlights the agony of Brutus, Caesar s pal who ends up conspiring to murder him.
This particular version seems to be confusing Fox and Friends because of its anachronistic interpretation the players are dressed in the clothes of today.According to Fox, they are sure this is a depiction of a Trump assassination because the actor looks very similar to the tall, blond businessman elected president in 2016.
It s definitely a unique interpretation of the play, but modern updates of Shakespearean plays are very common think 90 s Romeo and Juliet.On top of that, the play doesn t depict Caesar s assassination as a positive event nor the assassins as heroes.It s pretty snowflakey for Fox to be this pissed about a Shakespeare play.
