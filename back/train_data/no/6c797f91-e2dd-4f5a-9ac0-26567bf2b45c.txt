ankara ( reuters ) - president tayyip erdogan dismissed as lies accusations by turkey s main opposition party that his family has moved millions of dollars into foreign bank accounts to avoid taxes .
the republican people s party ( chp ) filed a parliamentary motion requesting an investigation into its allegations , which chp leader kemal kilicdaroglu says he can back with documents detailing some $ 14 million in money transfers by members of erdogan s family to the isle of man .
erdogan , who has led turkey since 2003 , denied the accusations against his family and said he would take the chp leader to court .
these people haven t sent a dime abroad , erdogan said in a speech , adding that kilicdaroglu was telling lies .
erdogan s lawyer says the documents are fake and has called on kilicdaroglu to hand them over to prosecutors .
chp spokesman bulent tezcan was quoted by hurriyet newspaper as saying the prosecutor had no role to play in the matter .
we know you are trying to drown this out and silence everyone , but we will not be silenced , he said .
it is not ethical .
our chairman did not say whether this was a crime or not .
he has made no evaluation in criminal terms .
to form any investigative commission , a majority vote would be needed in a parliament which is dominated by the ak party that erdogan founded .
erdogan has dominated turkish politics in almost 15 years as prime minister and then president and remains by far the country s most popular leader ; but opponents accuse him of increasingly authoritarian conduct .
