dear san francisco police union : we wanted you to know that if you decide to boycott the 49er s , america supports you 100 % .
if the 49er s are unable to speak out against this sickening bench-warmers anti-american , and anti-law enforcement antics , they can figure out how to protect themselves at their next home game .
maybe they could ask the black panthers or black lives matter thugs to patrol the stadium i m sure the fans would love that idea lol ! the union for police officers who work san francisco home games says its members may boycott policing the stadium if the 49ers don t discipline colin kaepernick for refusing to stand during the national anthem and for his statements about law enforcement.a letter from the santa clara police officers association sent to the 49ers was obtained friday by kntv-tv , the nbc affiliate in san jose.it says that kaepernick s protest has threatened our harmonious working relationship with the 49ers .
about 70 officers from the santa clara police department patrol levi s stadium when the 49ers play there .
if the 49ers organization fails to take action to stop this type of inappropriate behavior it could result in police officers choosing not to work at your facilities , the letter reads .
the board of directors of the santa clara police officer s association has a duty to protect its members and work to make all of their working environments free of harassing behavior .
it also criticized what it called anti-police statements made by kaepernick , calling them insulting , inaccurate and completely unsupported by any facts .
