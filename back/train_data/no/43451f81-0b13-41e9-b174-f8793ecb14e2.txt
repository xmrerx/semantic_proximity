istanbul ( reuters ) - a turkish prosecutor has issued detention warrants for 53 active sergeants over alleged links to the u.s.-based cleric accused of orchestrating last year s attempted coup , state media said on tuesday .
twenty of the suspects have so far been detained in the operation across 12 provinces , state run anadolu agency said .
thirty-three other soldiers were currently being sought , it said .
the interior ministry said on monday that nearly 700 people had been detained over the previous week on allegations of ties to what ankara calls the gulenist terror group .
some 50,000 people have been arrested since the failed putsch in july and around 150,000 dismissed or suspended , including soldiers , police , teachers and public servants , over alleged links with the movement of u.s-based cleric fethullah gulen .
gulen , who has lived in self-imposed exile in pennsylvania since 1999 , has denied the charge and condemned the coup .
rights groups and some western allies fear president tayyip erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to stifle dissent .
the government argues the crackdown is necessary due to the gravity of the coup attempt , which killed 240 people on july 15 , 2016 .
