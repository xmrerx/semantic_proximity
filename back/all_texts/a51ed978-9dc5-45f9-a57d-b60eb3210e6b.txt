WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said on Tuesday the Senate will vote early next week on a motion that would pave the way for a vote on a bill to repeal Obamacare without a replacement plan.
McConnellâ€™s decision to hold a vote comes despite opposition from at least four Republicans, which likely dooms its prospects.
