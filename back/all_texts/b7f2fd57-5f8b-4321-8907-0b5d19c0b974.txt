Remember the criticism George W. Bush received for not doing enough for residents of Louisiana after the horrible floods caused by Hurricane Katrina?
Could you imagine the feeding frenzy by the media would have had if Bush declared a state of emergency and then went golfing?
The media s double standard for our Organizer In Chief compared to the criticism of GW Bush is beyond the pale President Barack Obama declared Louisiana was in a state of disaster on Sunday after a historic flood left at least five people dead, with emergency crews working to rescue thousands more.
Governor John Bel Edwards said more than 10,000 people are now in shelters and more than 20,000 people have been rescued across south Louisiana.More than a foot of rain fell overnight on Friday in a deluge estimated to occur once every 500 years, according to the Pacific Standard.In shocking photos showing the devastation, caskets that had washed up from a graveyard floated down the street in Denham Springs, Louisiana.Four people have been reported dead, said Devin George, the state registrar for vital records, earlier Sunday.A woman s body was later recovered by divers from inside a flooded vehicle in East Baton Rouge Parish, appearing to raise the death toll to five.Witnesses said the woman was seen Saturday night attempting to turn around in high water when her vehicle was swept away, said Casey Rayborn Hicks, a spokeswoman for the sheriff s office.In one dramatic rescue Saturday, two men on a boat pulled a woman from a car that was almost completely underwater, according to video by WAFB.Watch video of dramatic rescue HERE.The woman, who s not initially visible on camera, yells from inside the car: Oh my god, I m drowning.
One of the rescuers, David Phung, jumped into the brown water and pulled the woman to safety.Obama issued the disaster declaration after speaking with Edwards, making federal aid available in the parishes of East Baton Rouge, Livingston, St. Helena and Tangipahoa, hit hardest by the floods.Edwards said in a statement that other parishes could be added to the list.Emergency officials still were working on strategies to rescue an undetermined number of people trapped by the waters.
We re very much still in the search and rescue mode, said James Waskcom, director of the state s Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness.In Livingston Parish, phone service was spotty due to the high waters and most shelters were full.
