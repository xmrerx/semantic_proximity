this woman should be tossed in jail the hardworking american taxpayers are supporting this horrible woman .
if trump does anything at all , he should crack down on the freebies given to people like this .
a single woman can make more money by just sitting around han she can if she works !
there s something wrong with the system and it needs to be fixed pronto ! the government has incentivized having children because these single mothers get more government money per child .
