Sorry Republicans, but your newest vast right-wing conspiracy against Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton has officially fallen flat.
The newest rounds of interrogations began in the fruitless Email Gate against the former Secretary of State, and as expected, she has not been found to have engaged in any criminal wrongdoing or willful violation of the law.According to CNN:The interviews, we re told, are focused on whether classified information was mishandled, and the security of the server.
So far officials tell us, no, there is no evidence of criminal wrongdoing at this point in the investigation, but, again, the investigation is not over.Yes, the investigation is not over, but it certainly isn t going anywhere.
After poring though thousands of documents, countless interviews with aides including Clinton s personal assistant Huma Abedin, and immunity offers on the table:CNN has previously reported that another former Clinton employee, Bryan Pagliano, who helped set up the server has provided documents and other materials as well as interviews to the FBI, under an immunity agreement.
FBI officials overseeing the probe now expect to complete their work in the next few weeks and then turn over the findings to the Justice Department, which will make a final decision on whether to bring charges against anyone.There still has not been a smoking gun.
And like every other scandal in Clinton s life, there won t be.
And considering that the Justice Department has been aiding the FBI in the investigation, and the FBI has turned up nothing, it s highly improbable the DOJ will.Even though it isn t over, CNN s Pamela Brown has word that it will be wrapping up soon, once a date to interview Hillary Clinton is scheduled and done in secret, as to not attract any unnecessary media scrutiny.
However, due to Clinton s crunched campaign schedule, the FBI is having a hard time sitting the frontrunner down for said interview.Donald Trump and other Republicans (and even some left wing voters) are anxious to see Clinton go down for something as silly as emails.
However, it isn t going t0 happen.
Time to focus on the issues.Featured image Joe Readle/Getty Images
