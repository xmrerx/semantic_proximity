rome ( reuters ) - the italian chamber of deputies on thursday gave its final approval to a contested electoral law that is likely to penalize the anti-establishment 5-star movement in next year s election .
the bill , which is supported by the ruling democratic party ( pd ) and mainstream center-right opposition parties , was approved in a secret ballot by 375 votes to 215 , and will now move to the upper house senate for further debate .
the so-called rosatellum law favors parties which group together ahead of the election .
the 5-star refuses to join any alliance and says the reform could cost it at least 50 seats in the next parliament , hobbling its chances of taking power .
