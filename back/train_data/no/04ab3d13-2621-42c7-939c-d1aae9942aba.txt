sarajevo ( reuters ) - forensic experts have found 86 skulls in a mass grave near the scene of a massacre of bosnian muslims and croats by serb forces early in the 1992-95 war , officials said on friday .
the skulls and more than 50 other body parts were found covered with rocks in a remote spot near a ravine in central bosnia , the country s missing persons institute said .
experts began searching on sept 7 , hours after the bosnian war crimes court ordered the exhumations at mount vlasic .
at the time , the teams said they were only expecting to find the remains of around 60 people .
on aug. 21 , 1992 , bosnian serbs told prisoners from detention camps for non-serbs near the town of prijedor that they would be released in a prisoner exchange .
but instead they drove them away by bus , lined them up by the edge of a ravine and shot them .
only a dozen survived what has become known as the koricani cliffs massacre , by tumbling or jumping down the steep ravine .
the 1992-95 war claimed 100,000 lives .
the killings were part of a wave of ethnic cleansing by bosnian serb forces who were trying to create a serb statelet by removing bosniaks - bosnian muslims - and croats from the area .
forensic experts have already identified 117 victims of the massacre in several other mass grave sites .
we hope that the search for the victims of this massacre has completed today , said lejla cengic from the missing persons institute .
eleven bosnian serb ex-policemen were convicted for the ravine killings , including darko mrdja who was jailed for 17 years by the hague-based u.n. war crimes court .
the remainder were convicted by the bosnian war crimes court .
