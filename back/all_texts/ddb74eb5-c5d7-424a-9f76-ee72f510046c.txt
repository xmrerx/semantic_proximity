BEIJING (Reuters) - Denuclearization of the Korean peninsula should be achieved through peaceful and diplomatic means, China s foreign ministry said on Monday, as the United Nations discusses fresh sanctions against North Korea following its latest nuclear test.
At a regular news briefing, ministry spokesman Geng Shuang reiterated China s call for more steps by the U.N. Security Council, saying he hoped its members could reach consensus.
A U.S.-drafted resolution originally called for an oil embargo on the North, a halt to key textile exports and financial and travel bans on leader Kim Jong Un, but appears to have been watered down, according to a draft seen by Reuters.
North Korea drew global condemnation for conducting its sixth nuclear test on Sept 3, which it said was of an advanced hydrogen bomb.
