She s counting on ignorance to get votes for the Dems.Washington, D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser (D.) spoke on Saturday at a Get Out The Vote canvassing event in Arlington, Va. where she claimed Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ed Gillespie s tax cuts will kill us.
Speaking with Democratic supporters and campaign volunteers, Bowser talked about the importance of believing climate change is real and said Democrats will focus on transportation and education before mentioning Republican candidate Ed Gillespie s plan for tax cuts.
Certainly those terrible tax cuts are going to kill us kill us, she said.
And so we need a Governor of Virginia that s going to help lead the entire Virginia delegation so that we re really supporting the middle class and not just the big guys.

No!
the crowd yelled.
