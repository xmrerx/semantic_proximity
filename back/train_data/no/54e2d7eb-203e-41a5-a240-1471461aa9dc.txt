donald trump got hilariously owned on twitter again.on sunday morning , trump took a break from playing golf to post a twitter rant .
first , he bragged about his presidency.the make america great again agenda is doing very well despite the distraction of the witch hunt .
many new jobs , high business enthusiasm , .. donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) june 18 , 2017 massive regulation cuts , 36 new legislative bills signed , great new s.c.justice , and infrastructure , healthcare and tax cuts in works !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) june 18 , 2017and then he insanely declared that his poll numbers are better than president obama s.the new rasmussen poll , one of the most accurate in the 2016 election , just out with a trump 50 % approval rating.that s higher than o s # s !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) june 18 , 2017as you can see , trump used a poll taken by rasmussen , which notoriously leans to the right-wing .
plus , it s the only poll that shows trump s approval rating being this high .
all of the others show trump s approval rating at historic lows.but trump is not only embarrassing himself by ignoring the other polls , he s wrong about having higher numbers than president obama.at this time in his presidency on june 18 , 2009 , rasmussen took a poll and found that 55 percent of americans approved of how president obama was doing his job.that s not even true .
on june 18 , 2009 , obama had 55 % overall approval , with 35 % strong approval .
you can check here https : //t.co/ug3loldlos pic.twitter.com/4shoot3kzd robert maguire ( @ robertmaguire_ ) june 18 , 2017so trump is either lying or he is bad at math .
or both.of course , twitter users mercilessly mocked trump for it.dude rasmussen is a right wing org lol ken klippenstein ( @ kenklippenstein ) june 18 , 2017rasmussen constantly has the highest approval rating for you .
if you look at other polls your numbers are much lower https : //t.co/u01alageub pic.twitter.com/ai6esllrw3 ken klippenstein ( @ kenklippenstein ) june 18 , 2017obama typically has 3 to 4 times as many twitter likes for his tweets .
has about 3 times the followers .
( even without the fakes ) robert belcher ( @ bobbelcher ) june 18 , 2017even though that s way higher than the real figure ( 37 % ) , 50 % is still * terrible * for a recently elected president !
jules suzdaltsev ( @ jules_su ) june 18 , 2017every other polls says 35-40 % .
also , since when was obama s 55 % rating lower than 50 % .
can you do math even ?
impeach donald trump ( @ impeach_d_trump ) june 18 , 2017he s the so called commander in chief that just lost seven sailors , and he s tweeting about ratings instead ?
sad !
