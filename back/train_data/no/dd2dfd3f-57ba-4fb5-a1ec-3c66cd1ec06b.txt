berlin ( reuters ) - the german government has approved the sale of three thyssenkrupp submarines to israel and will provide financial support for the purchase , government spokesman steffen seibert told a regular news conference on monday .
the estimated $ 2 billion deal is under police investigation in israel over suspected corruption and several public officials and private citizens have been questioned in the case .
the 2016 deal has been under public scrutiny since it emerged that prime minister benjamin netanyahu s personal lawyer also represented thyssenkrup marine system s local agent , raising concerns of a conflict of interest .
the attorney has denied wrongdoing and said he never discussed the deal with netanyahu .
israel s justice ministry said in february that netanyahu himself was not a suspect .
addressing israel s parliament , netanyahu told opposition lawmakers that the new deal with germany helped vindicate him .
how sad for you , that you have been staking your hopes on recycling the submarines story , but also understand that this story , too , has been sunk , he said .
seibert said germany would make a contribution of up to 540 million euros to help finance israel s purchase .
seibert said an inter-governmental memorandum of understanding approving the deal would be signed later on monday .
i would like to thank ( german ) chancellor ( angela ) merkel and her government for this memorandum , which touches on a matter that is very important for israel s national security , netanyahu said in his speech .
