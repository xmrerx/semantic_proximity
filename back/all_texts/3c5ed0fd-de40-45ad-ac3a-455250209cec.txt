Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted announced an investigation has uncovered that hundreds of non-US citizens are registered to vote in the state, and dozens of them voted illegally.According to a release from Husted, 385 people who are not citizens of the United States are registered to vote in Ohio.
Out of those, 82 voted in at least one election in the last year.19 of the 82 non-citizens voted in the central Ohio area.
14 of those were in Franklin County, 2 were in Delaware County and 1 each in Fairfield, Licking and Union Counties.The 303 registered voters identified as non-citizens who have not cast a ballot will be sent letters both informing them that non-citizens are not eligible to vote and requesting that they cancel their registration.
A follow-up letter will be sent to any individuals that still remain on the rolls after 30 days.
Any non-citizens identified that remain on the rolls after being contacted twice will then be referred to law enforcement, according to Husted.
