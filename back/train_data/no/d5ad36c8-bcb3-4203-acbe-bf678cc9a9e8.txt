washington ( reuters ) - former texas governor rick perry has endorsed republican presidential candidate donald trump and is open to being his running mate , cnn reported on thursday .
in september , perry was the first member of the initially crowded republican field to drop out of the 2016 white house race , following a failed bid in the 2012 race .
the longest-serving governor in texas history had languished near the bottom of the 17-strong republican presidential pack since entering the current race in june .
trump is now the last one left and the presumptive republican nominee .
