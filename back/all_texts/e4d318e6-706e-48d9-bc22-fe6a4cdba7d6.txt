A Republican member of the Electoral College representing Texas, Art Sisneros, wrote on Saturday that he will resign and turn his position over to an alternate elector.
Sisneros has previously been skeptical of throwing his support behind Donald Trump but now, he says he would rather resign than to vote against his conscience.In August, Sisneros thought of participating as a faithless elector, but in a largely unnoticed blog post over the weekend he wrote that he cannot bring himself to vote for Trump, so he decided to resign from his role as an elector, according to Politico.
The Electoral College was corrupted from its original intent once states started dictating the votes of the Electors, he writes.
If Trump is not qualified and my role, both morally and historically, as an elected official is to vote my conscience, then I can not and will not vote for Donald Trump for President.
I believe voting for Trump would bring dishonor to God, Sisneros wrote.
The reality is Trump will be our President, no matter what my decision is.
Sisneros said that he will mourn the loss of our republic.
Since I can t in good conscience vote for Donald Trump, and yet have sinfully made a pledge that I would, the best option I see at this time is to resign my position as an Elector, Sisneros continued.
This will allow the remaining body of Electors to fill my vacancy when they convene on Dec 19 with someone that can vote for Trump.
The people will get their vote I will sleep well at night knowing I neither gave in to their demands nor caved to my convictions.
I will also mourn the loss of our republic.
This sounds similar to what Ted Cruz demanded people do.
Vote your conscience.
But the Texas Senator lost his spine, soul and conscience during the eleventh hour, then threw his support behind Trump.
Ted Cruz is no Art Sisneros.____________________________________________________________________________________Image via Facebook.
