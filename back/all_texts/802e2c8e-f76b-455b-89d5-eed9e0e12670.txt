WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives’ Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi said on Monday that Republicans and Democrats should join together to pass timely relief for victims of Tropical Storm Harvey, which has been hitting Texas with historic flooding.
“Republicans must be ready to join Democrats in passing a timely relief bill that makes all necessary resources available through emergency spending,” Pelosi said in a statement.
She also said that because the National Flood Insurance Program is expiring at the end of September, lawmakers must move quickly to ensure that affordable flood insurance continues to be available.
