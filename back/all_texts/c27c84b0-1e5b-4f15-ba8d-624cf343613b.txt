If you ve even been on Twitter then you ll know that it s often filled with not only news and updates on events, but also filled with a stream of consciousness from, well, pretty much everyone on the social media site.One of the best at just letting you know exactly what is on her mind, and uses emojis in a way that can only be seen as extraordinary, is none other than the legendary artist/actress/entertainer extraordinaire, Cher.She is currently on a Twitter rampage against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and has unleashed her emoji fabulousness all over her Twitter feed.It all began when she noticed an older Washington Post article that featured Donald Trump s tweet where he displayed his face superimposed over the American flag with Nazi soldiers marching in front of the White House.Scary, right?
Well, Cher clearly thought so, too, and has been angrily tweeting her disgust in the candidate ever since.Check out her tweets, as well as replies, here:Donald Trump tweets image of Nazi soldiers inside the U.S. flag, then deletes tweet The Washington Post ?NAZI ART https://t.co/rtuWNLMtT3 Cher (@cher) August 20, 2016TRUMP HAS NAZI IN AD?WHY AM I NOT SURPRISED?MORE IMPORTANTLY..WTF IS THAT SOCIOPATHS FACE DOING ON MY??.

?n Cher (@cher) August 20, 2016It must be remembered that Trump has been endorsed by several white supremacists and white supremacy groups, including, but not limited to the Ku Klux Klan.
So, when Trump used Nazi soldiers with his face on our flag, it s probably about the worst thing ever.
EVER.Let s listen to Cher, as well as sane people everywhere and make sure Donald Trump gets nowhere near the Oval Office.
Please, for the sake of all humanity.Featured image via Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images Twitter
