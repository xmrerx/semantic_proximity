johannesburg ( reuters ) - south african deputy president cyril ramaphosa has received the most nominations for leader of the ruling african national congress ( anc ) ahead of a party vote this month , voting data from the country s nine provinces show .
ramaphosa is one of two frontrunners in a closely watched contest to take over from president jacob zuma as anc leader at a party conference starting on dec. 16 .
whoever becomes anc leader will most likely be the next president of south africa , owing to the ruling party s electoral dominance .
ramaphosa received 1,862 nominations by anc branches , whereas his main rival for anc leader , former cabinet minister nkosazana dlamini-zuma , received 1,309 endorsements .
reuters compiled the number of nominations for each candidate based on voting data released by provincial anc structures .
anc officials in the provinces of limpopo and kwazulu-natal were the last to release their nominations totals on monday .
ramaphosa , a former trade union leader and millionaire businessman , is seen as more market-friendly than dlamini-zuma , who was previously married to zuma .
signs that ramaphosa has been doing well in the nominations by anc branches have boosted the rand currency in recent weeks .
however , dlamini-zuma could still win the race for anc leader as analysts say the outcome in december could be swayed by inducements and pressure on conference delegates .
delegates are not bound to vote for the candidate that was nominated by their anc branch .
