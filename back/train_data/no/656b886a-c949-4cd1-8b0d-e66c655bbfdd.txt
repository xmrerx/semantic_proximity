the migrants are keen to reach the uk because they can exploit the country s generous welfare system and obtain a much higher standard of living than in france , where they are forced to reside in a makeshift tent village in calais known as the jungle .around 2,500 migrants live in the tent village , with most of them coming from sudan , eritrea , libya and syria.the situation is so dire that a leading haulage group warned earlier this month that freight carriers could suspend supplies going through calais altogether , causing food shortages and massive price hikes.donald armour , international affairs manager at the freight transport association , told the daily express that the uk supply chain is in danger of collapsing as a result of drivers refusing to go through calais.last month , maru international haulage company announced that they were boycotting calais over fears that somebody will be killed by migrants attempting to enter the uk.via : info wars
