donald the trump went to speak at the nra s annual meeting today , and his speech was utterly ridiculous .
he borrowed a lot of what he said from the rhetoric of an extreme right-wing , anti-government group known as the three percenters , including saying that there will be another revolution if the government finds ways to regulate guns.because that s what the people from the group that donated $ 30 million to trump s campaign want to hear .
whenever there s another violent tragedy and guns are involved , we get to hear all about how it happened because not enough people were armed , because it was a gun-free zone , etc .
these people think nothing , care nothing , for the lives lost due to gun violence .
and connecticut senator chris murphy has had it.so he went on a devastating tweetstorm today , complete with pictures of children and young adults who have died at the hands of senseless gun violence .
look below : .
@ realdonaldtrump about to take stage at nra , to celebrate right of criminals to own guns , to glorify weapons that kill chris murphy ( @ chrismurphyct ) april 28 , 2017here s my advice .
turn off cable .
don t watch @ realdonaldtrump s nra speech .
instead , think about who we are fighting for .

let s get to it .
chris murphy ( @ chrismurphyct ) april 28 , 2017but the nra behaves as though it speaks for all gun owners when it advocates for more guns , more guns , and more guns .
even for criminals , even for people who are a danger to themselves and others.murhpy s tweetstorm prompted people to share their tragedies , too : @ chrismurphyct @ realdonaldtrump my niece michel rose david , age 23 , killed by her ex-boyfriend 12/10/10 .
