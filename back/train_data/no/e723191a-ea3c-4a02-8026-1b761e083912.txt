real journalism ended a long time ago , but this is a new low even for leftist barbara walters .
just embarrassing he was named people s sexiest man alive back in 2011 .
and bradley cooper proved just why he had that honour as women of all different ages desire him.the 40-year-old actor may have received a bit more attention than he was expecting from barbara walters recently during her 10 most fascinating people of 2015 special.bradley seemed to be the apple of the 86-year-old journalist s eye , as according to people , she told him during the interview : i could just sit and stare at you but that would take too much time .
but i , i find you very screwable .
after making the surprising admission , the television host commented on his looks as she said : i think you re handsome , i think you re sexy .
the silver linings playbook star definitely seemed to be bashful as he was grateful for the compliments and says : i think that i ve grown to stop thinking about it .
but sometimes i feel better than others .
yeah , i think it has a lot to do with feeling comfortable with yourself .
bradley definitely seems to be very comfortable in his own skin as he added : and i know that i m more comfortable with myself than i ve ever been in my life , so maybe that makes me more attractive .
