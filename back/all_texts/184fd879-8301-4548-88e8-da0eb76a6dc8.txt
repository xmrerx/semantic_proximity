Billionaire Mark Cuban had previously been rooting for Donald Trump, but made the switch over to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton with a powerful public endorsement several weeks ago after wisely deciding that Trump was batsh*t crazy.
Since then, he has fiercely defended the Clintons and he continued to do so on Monday, when Fox News Neil Cavuto complained about Hillary s email scandal and the fees former President Bill Clinton charges for speaking events.Cavuto brought up the fact that Bill Clinton had gotten $250,000 for a speech and Cuban wasted no time in dismantling his criticism.
Cuban completely ripped Cavuto apart as he educated the Fox Business News host about what ex-presidents actually make for speaking, and threw in some conservative shame when he mentioned Reagan: Look.
You have to ask yourself what s the market for a former president giving a speech, right?
So first of all, Ronald Reagan was paid more than a million dollars for speeches in 1989.
He went to Japan and gave two speeches.
Second of all, Bill Clinton made, I think it was $250K give or take, for a lot of speeches.
I ve made $250K for a bunch of speeches.
For the most part, he gets paid a little more than I do, but the point is he was right inside the market.
He wasn t getting paid more or less than the market.
But Cavuto wasn t ready to give up slamming the Clintons that quickly.
He made the foolish decision to continue bashing Clinton, whining that the money had gone to the Clinton Foundation in a pay for play scheme.
Cuban was ready to handle those accusations as well.
He shut it down: In order to determine if there is any quid pro quo, there s got to be some money destined for the trade-off.
Cavuto tried to say it looked suspicious, but Cuban countered, they ve been investigated more than anybody.
