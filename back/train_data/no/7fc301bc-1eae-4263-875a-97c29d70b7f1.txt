mexico city ( reuters ) - mexico is poised to recognize honduran president juan orlando hernandez as the winner of last month s election , according to a draft foreign ministry statement seen by reuters , just days after the organization of american states called for a fresh vote to dispel widespread allegations of fraud .
mexico s announcement was brokered in coordination with the united states , two sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said .
the presidents of guatemala and colombia had recognized hernandez , a staunch u.s. ally .
a statement by mexico , an important player in central america , would strengthen the position of hernandez , who declared himself president-elect on tuesday .
it could pave the way for more countries , including the united states , to weigh in the incumbent s favor .
the government of mexico congratulates juan orlando hernandez for his victory in the general elections , mexico s foreign ministry wrote in a draft of the statement seen by reuters .
the mexican foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
the statement was requested by foreign minister luis videgaray and awaits final approval , one of the sources said .
honduras ambassador in mexico was alerted of the move on monday .
the embassy did not immediately respond to request for comment .
it is likely to enrage the center-left opposition , led by tv star salvador nasralla , who has accused hernandez of stealing the election , sparking violent nationwide protests .
the general secretariat of the oas on sunday said the election was plagued with irregularities and should be redone to meet democratic standards .
