harare ( reuters ) - a zimbabwean court has postponed to jan. 4 the trial of a u.s. citizen accused of attempting to undermine the authority of former zimbabwean president robert mugabe s government .
martha o donovan , 25 , who is currently free on bail , denies the charges which center on a twitter post the state says she wrote in october calling 93-year-old mugabe a selfish and sick man .
mugabe resigned a few weeks later in the wake of a de facto military coup and was succeeded by emmerson mnangagwa , who mugabe had sacked as his deputy only a week before .
the state said it needed more time to complete its investigations into the allegations against o donovan , who works for magamba tv , which describes itself as zimbabwe s leading producer of political satire .
when he released her on bail last month , high court judge clement phiri said there was patent absence of facts in the state s case against her .
