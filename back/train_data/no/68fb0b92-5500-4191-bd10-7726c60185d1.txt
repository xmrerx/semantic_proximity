polls lie the number of supporters who show up to hear a candidate speak when they visit swing states , tells americans everything they need to know about who is truly more popular with voters hillary refused to call for calm in a city that was torn apart over a black man who was shot and killed by police officers .
she was gunning for the black vote .
well , it turned out the black man who was shot dead was also armed , and it also turns out that rioting , attacking innocent people , and demeaning our law enforcement officers isn t very popular with most americans either.here s a shot hillary s pathetic audience in charlotte , nc .
if she was right about backing the black lives matter rioters , shouldn t she have had a better turnout here in the epicenter of the riots ? hillary didn t do much better today at her rally in toledo , oh : disappointing turnout for hillary in toledo train station pic.twitter.com/iwfyxwhzss jack posobiec ( @ jackposobiec ) october 3 , 2016crowd gathering in mlkjr plaza ( toledo ) for hillary clinton campaign rally at 1:30. pic.twitter.com/bz1cmdp72n tom troy ( @ tomftroy ) october 3 , 2016it looks like that darn pneumonia just won t go away : how many presidential candidates need a stretcher at the ready backstage during their rallies ? a gurney was just brought back stage at hillary 's akron rally .
