Trump made a bad decision, or so his ardent followers seem to think.
His attempts to work something out with Congressional Democrats on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, and also his remarks that current construction on his stupid border wall involves mostly existing fencing, have set off their ire.
Big-time and small-time MAGAsh*ts alike are crying today, because their rigid, purist minds suffer from severe tunnel vision that doesn t include Trump doing, well, what he s done.
They want Trump to do what he promised and damn the consequences to millions who aren t like them.Take Joe Walsh, for example.
Walsh is a former U.S. Representative from Illinois 8th district, but his big claim to fame is being a deadbeat dad.
All he wants is for Trump to cut his taxes and build the wall.
With Trump s latest tweets on DACA and the wall, though, he s ready to abandon Trump and throw his support to probably someone worse:Trump: We re close to a deal on amnesty.
The wall will come later.
That s not why we voted for you.

Can someone remind the president why he was elected?
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) September 14, 2017If true, Trump is done.
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) September 14, 2017We voted for #MAGA, not #DACA.Pull your head out Mr President.
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) September 14, 2017He ran on: BUILD THE WALL!
He didn t run on: FIX UP SOME OF THE EXISTING FENCING!
Not surprising.
Just very disappointing.
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) September 14, 2017I m tired of @fox news saying: It s not the Donald s fault.
Big, bad GOP made him do it.
Bullshit.
Trump is responsible for what he does.
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) September 14, 2017NONE of this is a surprise.
I voted 4 Trump knowing he wasn t a Conservative & knowing he had no core.I voted 4 the wall & against amnesty Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) September 14, 2017Then we have Ann Coulter, who seems to have developed some serious regret about writing a book called In Trump We Trust.
If Walsh is crying, Coulter is raging: Put a fork in Trump, he s dead.

https://t.co/g1mMhmm8ng Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) September 14, 2017If we re not getting a wall, I d prefer President Pence.

ANSWER: An Easter egg.
QUESTION: What s the only thing easier to roll than Donald J. Trump?
Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) September 14, 2017Let s just tell @realDonaldTrump there was a hurricane at the border.
Maybe he ll rush down there with FEMA and build a wall.
Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) September 14, 2017What s the only difference between @realDonald Trump & Carrot Top?
Carrot Top might actually build the wall.
Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) September 14, 2017There are others who are sobbing over Trump s about-face on these issues, too.
They were conned, they know it, but they were too dumb and blinded by the racist who said anything they wanted to hear to think this might happen prior to the election.Found this by the side of the road #amnestydon #burnmyMAGAhat pic.twitter.com/QivQ81xClG Mickey Kaus (@kausmickey) September 14, 2017Trump s going to have to PAY people to attend his rallies now .and to chant Build that NEW RENOVATION OF OLD FENCES!
Wait, what??
