seoul ( reuters ) - a former korean air lines executive who went into a rage on an aircraft over the way she was served nuts in first class avoided jail on thursday when south korea s supreme court upheld her 10-month suspended sentence .
heather cho had been charged with , among others , violation of aviation law in 2015 after she took issue with the way she was served nuts and forced the korean air lines plane to return to its gate in a new york airport in december 2014 .
the incident became a national scandal in south korea , as cho is the daughter of the chairman of hanjin group , the conglomerate of which korean air is an affiliate .
cho stepped down from her role as korean air lines vice president and attempted to apologize to crew members .
the supreme court upheld an appeals court ruling that said forcing an on-the-ground plane to return to its gate can not be seen as route deviation , but found cho guilty of abusive language and actions against cabin crew and forcing a crew member to disembark .
cho was originally sentenced to one year in jail , but has been free from custody since may 2015 , when the appeals court suspended her sentence .
