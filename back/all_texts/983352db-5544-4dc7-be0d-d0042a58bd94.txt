It s pretty much common knowledge that all Mitt Romney s speech against Donald Trump did was serve to help the Republican frontrunner with his band of merry morons voting for him.
They, like Trump, see any and all criticism of The Donald as a means to rise up.
If Trump is racist, they love him more.
If he s misogynistic, he rises in the polls.
If he criticizes disabled people, they d give him a medal.So, when you add up all the mean tweets being written by Trump supporters and Trump himself, you can only imagine how many poured in after Romney made his attempt at tearing Trump down.
Appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live, Romney read a few of those tweets, and added a few jabs back that were actually pretty funny.Here are just a couple to give you the general idea of what comes out of the Trump campaign and his minions:Mitt Romney had his chance and blew it.
Lindsey Graham ran for president, got ZERO, and quit!
Why are they now spokesmen against me?
Sad!

I'm now working on a time machine to go back & punch him in the throat!#TRUMP VOTE4TRUMP_2016 (@VOTE4TRUMP_2016) March 4, 2016And while it s clear Donald Trump s skin and his ego are very fragile, kudos to Romney for proving he knows how to take criticism with a grain of salt.
That s what one actually has to do when in the public eye.
However, Trump turns in to a whining schoolboy destined for revenge and ends up being the class bully.Watch the hilarious segment here:Featured image via video screen capture
