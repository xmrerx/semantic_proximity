What s with the cultish attitude coming from our EPA chief?
This is so creepy and Orwellian but the big push on climate change has even sucked in the Pope.
EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy told an audience Tuesday gathered at a White House conference normal people, not climate deniers will win the debate on global warming.McCarthy s remarks came as she was talking about the reasons why the EPA put out a report on the negative health impacts global warming will have on public health.
She said the agency puts out such reports to educate the public, not answer critiques from global warming skeptics.
I am doing that not to push back on climate deniers, McCarthy told doctors, health professionals and others gathered at a White House summit.
You can have fun doing that if you want, but I ve batted my head against the wall too many times and if the science already hasn t changed their mind it never will.
McCarthy then remarked how normal people, and not skeptics would eventually win the global warming debate.
Implicit in her remarks is the contention that skeptics are somehow not normal people.
But in any democracy, it s not them that carries the day, McCarthy said.
It is normal human beings that haven t put their stake into politics above science.
It s normal human beings that want us to do the right thing, and we will if you help us.
