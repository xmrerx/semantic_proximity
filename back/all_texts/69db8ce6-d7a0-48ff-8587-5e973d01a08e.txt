After finding out that Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was endorsing Hillary Clinton for president on Tuesday morning, Donald Trump took to Twitter, as he always does, to try to lure in as many angry Bernie supporters as possible.
He put out such a tweet storm that it actually appeared that he lost his damn mind more than he already likely has.In a series of tweets, Trump showed how desperately he is trying to pander to Bernie Sanders voters who are mad at the Senator from Vermont for endorsing Hillary Clinton.
It s so obvious, in fact, that he s trying to play to that crowd, that if it works, it probably says more about those who could so easily switch to the anti-Bernie that is Trump, than it actually says about Trump himself.He tweeted:Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton.
He will endorse her today fans angry!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2016I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters.
They are not happy that he is selling out!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2016Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2016Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2016To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms.
People first.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2016And don t forget his pinned video:#CrookedHillary is not qualified!https://t.co/6qi7KTW43O Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2016Now, if you ve proudly supported Bernie over the past year and his very progressive agenda, but now see yourself supporting a staunchly conservative racist, misogynistic, Islamophobic reality television star, you never actually felt the Bern, but rather just really hated the idea of Hillary Clinton as president.
Which is fine.
That s your choice, but don t pretend to be supporter of progressive ideology and making the nation better for all, not just the few on top.Trump does and says whatever is necessary to please the audience directly in front of him at any given moment.
He s a fraud and a scam artist, and most certainly is not to be believed ever.
He s a salesman and currently is just trying to sell himself to whoever will buy it Don t buy it.Featured Photo by John Moore/Getty Images
