brasilia ( reuters ) - brazil s president michel temer has agreed with congressional leaders to delay a key vote on pension legislation in the lower house until the week of dec. 18 , the speaker of the body , rodrigo maia , said on thursday .
the pension overhaul , a cornerstone of temer s efforts to reduce brazil s budget deficit , is seen by investors as crucial to boosting the nation s fiscal health .
brazil s currency and benchmark bovespa stock index slipped on thursday amid concerns that temer lacked support to put the measure to a vote .
if a vote were further delayed to next year , it could infringe on campaigning for elections due in 2018 , a move most investors see as reducing the likelihood that the unpopular measure would be approved .
the bill seeks to increase the age at which brazilians can retire and collect social security .
it would also make pension payouts in brazil - some of the most generous in the world - more modest .
temer has held a flurry of meetings in recent weeks with the heads of allied parties to whip the votes he will need to win the bill s passage and send it to the senate .
among the carrots he has offered is increasing the size of the budget each legislator is given to spend on social projects in their districts .
congressional leaders have said in recent days that the coalition supporting the bill is more organized than in weeks past .
however , the government has not yet been able to secure the 308 votes the measure will need for passage .
