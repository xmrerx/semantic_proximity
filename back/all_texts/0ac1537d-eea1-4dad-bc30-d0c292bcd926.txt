@realDonaldTrump : - At least 24 players kneeling this weekend at NFL stadiums that are now having a very hard time filling up.
The American public is fed up with the disrespect the NFL is paying to our Country, our Flag and our National Anthem.
Weak and out of control!
[0745 EST] - Melania, our great and very hard working First Lady, who truly loves what she is doing, always thought that “if you run, you will win.” She would tell everyone that, “no doubt, he will win.” I also felt I would win (or I would not have run) - and Country is doing great!
[0800 EST] - Meeting with “Chuck and Nancy” today about keeping government open and working.
Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes.
I don’t see a deal!
