university of wisconsin madison , where not to send your kids to school the sale of hateful racist sweatshirts or hoodies on campus is really not surprising considering the university of wi madison has been a hotbed for radical students and faculty for quite some time now .
we shared a story about a u of wi madison student who was given cover by his professor when the police came to talk to him during class after he was caught on camera spray painting racist graffiti all over school property .
students at the university of wisconsin-madison are asking people to buy sweatshirts promoting violence against police officers and classifying all white people as racists .
racism , claims one hoodie s page , is a set of systematic , institutional , cultural , and epistemological ( although not limited to said forms ) structures that inherently empowers white folk and in turn disempowers people of color .
this power dictates who lives , have housing , access to education/healthcare etc .
racism has little to do with hatred and mostly to do with who has power .
white folk or those who see themselves as white are given said power inherently regardless of socioeconomic class , education etc .
this is why white men created race in the first place to maintain power .
racism gave birth to the idea of race .
this is a [ sic ] oversimplified definition , the description continues.facebook has already removed an original picture of the sweatshirt for not following facebook s community standards .
however , as of this writing , facebook has yet to remove the post selling the sweatshirts.one of the sweatshirt says if i encounter another cop with a god complex i m going to have to show the world that they are human , seemingly promoting violence towards police.via : campus reform
