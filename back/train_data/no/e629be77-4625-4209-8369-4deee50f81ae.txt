will black lives matter supporters who openly chant pigs in a blanket fry like bacon assume responsibility ?
what about our community organizer in chief ?
what about his lawless ag and the lawless ag before her whose job it is to ensure justice in america , but instead works with obama to encourage blm protesters to carry on with their violent protests and disruptions across america and who can forget the ever-popular `` pigs in a blanket , fry 'em like bacon .
