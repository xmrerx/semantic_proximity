Nate Silver of fivethirtyeight.com is pretty accurate when it comes to election reports.
He has also tweeted just why Hillary Clinton lost the White House: James Comey s email letter.
Just eleven days out from the election, the wind was at Hillary s back.
Trump was still grappling with his issues with women after the infamous grab em by the p*ssy tape, and people weren t focused on anything else.
However, according to Silver, once Comey inserted himself and his baseless email nonsense into the picture, it was a turning point in the wrong direction.
Silver says: Comey had a large, measurable impact on the race.
Harder to say with Russia/Wikileaks because it was drip-drip-drip.

This is nothing short of criminal.
Comey and the entire FBI should be investigated.
He inserted himself into the middle of what is perhaps the most consequential election of our lives, and tipped it to a literal madman.
Of course, it won t happen, because Trump and the GOP don t care HOW they won, just that they did.
To that end, we re stuck with President Trump, and all of the people who put their thumbs on the scale for Trump be it the FBI, Russia, or James Comey himself will be free to do the same in four years.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
