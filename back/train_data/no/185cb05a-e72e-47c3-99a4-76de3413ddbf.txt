rome/montevideo ( reuters ) - one of italy s most wanted mob bosses has been arrested in uruguay after 23 years on the run from convictions for mafia association , drug trafficking and other serious crimes , the interior ministries of both countries said on monday .
rocco morabito was considered the most wanted fugitive member of the calabrian ndrangheta , italy s most powerful organized crime group and one of europe s biggest importers of south american cocaine .
the 50-year-old was arrested in montevideo after uruguayan police and italian authorities worked together to determine his real identity , the italian ministry said in a statement .
dubbed the cocaine king of milan , morabito had been wanted since 1994 after he was caught paying 13 billion lire ( $ 8 million ) to import almost a ton of the drug , corriere della sera newspaper reported .
morabito entered uruguay in 2001 , and took up residence with his wife in the coastal resort city of punta del este , the uruguayan interior ministry said in a statement .
he was living there under the false identity of francisco antonio capeletto souza , of rio de janeiro , it added .
morabito was jailed in uruguay for using false documents while italy s request for extradition is processed , the statement said , adding that $ 50,000 in cash was found at his home along with 13 cell phones .
an international arrest warrant was issued in 1995 with the aim of tracking down morabito and extraditing him to italy , where he has been sentenced to 30 years in jail .
the arrest ticks one member off the italian interior ministry s five-strong list of the country s most-wanted organized criminals , on which morabito had rubbed shoulders with feared sicilian boss matteo messina denaro .
