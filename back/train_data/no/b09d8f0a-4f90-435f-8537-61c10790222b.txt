paris ( reuters ) - the brother of a french islamist who shot dead seven people in 2012 will face an appeal against his acquittal on charges of conspiracy to murder , paris prosecutors said on friday .
abdelkader merah , the brother of mohamed merah , who was killed in a police raid on his toulouse apartment soon after the attacks , was jailed for 20 years on thursday for associating with terrorists , but cleared on the conspiracy charge .
that verdict was criticized by relatives of the murder victims - three soldiers and four jews , including three children - as well as prosecutors who allege that abdelkader was more than just a religious mentor to his younger brother .
france s special terrorism court found there was insufficient evidence that he had knowingly aided his brother s eight-day killing spree .
announcing their appeal , prosecutors said the court had failed to draw the full legal conclusions of the evidence put before it .
such an appeal would typically take years to come to court , but judicial authorities are facing calls to fast-track the case , which is closely watched for the precedent it may set for other terrorism prosecutions .
this is a benchmark terrorism case , particularly for trials of accomplices in the absence of the main perpetrator , said lawyer simon cohen , who represents families of mohamed merah s victims .
and there will be more of those .
