The presidential debates have been comedy gold for Saturday Night Live and a disaster for Donald Trump and that didn t change last night.Like the first two debates, SNL s cold open featured the third and final debate between Donald Trump as played by Alec Baldwin and Hillary Clinton as played by Kate McKinnon.
Only this time, the show featured Tom Hanks as Fox News host and debate moderator Chris Wallace.Hanks Wallace kicks things off by comparing the debate to the the third Lord of the Rings film, you don t really want to watch, but hey, you ve come this far.
McKinnon s Hillary was eager to feast on Trump, remarking that she set the table during the first debate, fired up the grill during the second, and declared that she ll be carving him up and serving up the feast this time around.Baldwin s Trump announced that he would be speaking very quietly like a baby Trump this time around, but quickly blew that idea to smithereens when asked about reproductive rights.
They re RIPPING BABIES OUT OF VAGINAS!
he yelled.Hillary responded by sarcastically claiming that the two people most qualified to talk about women s issues are on the stage because she s had a child and used birth control while Trump is a child and his face is birth control.The next question involved immigration and upon Trump saying bad hombres, Hillary interrupted to inform Wallace that she filled out her bingo card.Trump then bragged about his relationship with Mexican President Mr. Guacamole and his wife Tacito as Hillary banged her head against the microphone.While trying to explain his plan for ISIS, Trump sniffled his way through a confusing statement which Wallace thankfully interrupted much to Trump s relief.The sexual assault allegation against Trump were also addressed, but when Trump claimed that no one has more respect for women than I do, the entire planet erupted in laughter.Trump then complained that the election is being rigged by the media because they take everything I say and everything I do and put it on TV.
Wallace then tries to get Trump to repeat after him the he will accept the results of the election if he loses but Trump tweaked it by saying he ll only accept the results if I win.
Here s the full video via YouTube:It s too bad there isn t a fourth debate, because while America probably doesn t want to see the two candidates again, they ll definitely miss Baldwin and McKinnon adding laughter to this madness.Featured Image: Screenshot
