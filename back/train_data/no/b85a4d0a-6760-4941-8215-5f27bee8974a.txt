yangon ( reuters ) - myanmar s civilian leader , aung san suu kyi , will soon visit beijing , state media said on monday , as the southeast asian nation appears to draw closer to its northern neighbor , china , amid global criticism over an exodus of rohingya refugees .
myanmar has bristled at pressure from western nations over its armed forces brutal response to august attacks on security posts by rohingya muslim militants in the western state of rakhine .
the united states and the united nations have accused myanmar of ethnic cleansing and called for the military to be held accountable over allegations of killings , rape and arson that sent more than 620,000 rohingya fleeing to bangladesh .
china , however , has backed what myanmar officials call a legitimate counter-insurgency operation in rakhine , and stepped in to prevent a resolution on the crisis at the u.n. security council .
news of suu kyi s visit comes after chinese president xi jinping and chinese military leaders welcomed myanmar s powerful army chief min aung hlaing last week and pledged closer cooperation .
the state-run daily global new light of myanmar said nobel peace laureate suu kyi would soon depart to attend a communist party of china-hosted forum of world political leaders in beijing .
suu kyi s spokesman zaw htay could not be reached for more details , but the meeting begins on thursday and runs until dec. 3 , according to china s official news agency xinhua .
myanmar is in the international spotlight this week as pope francis makes the first visit by a head of the roman catholic church to the buddhist-majority country .
he has previously spoken out about the treatment of minority muslims to whom myanmar denies citizenship , but some christians fear doing so in the country could provoke a backlash .
many in myanmar refuse to recognize the name rohingya , preferring to call them bengalis to suggest they belong in neighboring bangladesh .
