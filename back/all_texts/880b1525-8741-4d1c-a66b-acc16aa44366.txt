PARIS (Reuters) - French cosmetics giant L Oreal sacked its first transgender model to appear on a British advertising campaign after she described all white people as racist on Facebook.
London-based model Munroe Bergdorf had announced on her Facebook page on August 27 that she was to be part of the French cosmetics brand s new advertising campaign celebrating diversity.
In an online message that later appeared on Friday to have been deleted, Bergdorf said, according to the Daily Mail newspaper: Honestly I don t have energy to talk about the racial violence of white people any more.
Yes ALL white people.
L Oreal s UK unit said on its Twitter page it had decided to terminate her contract: L Oreal champions diversity.
Comments by Munroe Bergdorf are at odds with our values and so we have decided to end our partnership with her.
In a post on her page on Friday, Bergdorf criticized the Daily Mail article and sought to defend her comments, which she said were a reaction to the violence of white supremacists in Charlottesville in the United States.
When I stated that all white people are racist , I was addressing that fact that western society as a whole, is a SYSTEM rooted in white supremacy - designed to benefit, prioritize and protect white people before anyone of any other race, she said.
