brasilia ( reuters ) - a congressional committee led by evangelical christians has voted to ban abortion in brazil in all situations , including cases of rape and where the mother s life is in danger .
the decision was voted 18-1 late on wednesday by a special committee considering a constitutional amendment to extend maternity leave for mothers of premature babies .
the single vote against the ban was cast by the only woman present during the session , erika kokay of the workers party , who called the decision a maneuver by the committee s pro-life evangelical majority .
abortion is illegal in predominantly catholic brazil except when the pregnancy is the result of a rape or puts the mother s life at risk .
in 2012 , the supreme court authorized the abortion on fetuses with anencephaly .
more than one million abortions are carried out at clandestine clinics each year in brazil and thousands of women end up in hospital as a result of botched procedures , according to government estimates .
but even the limited circumstances where abortions are legal have been targeted by a growing evangelical caucus in congress that has led to a conservative trend in lawmaking on social issues .
to defend abortion , like it or not , is a satanic , diabolical and destructive act , evangelical congressman pastor eurico told the committee , brandishing a replica of a 12-week-old fetus .
the move to criminalize all cases of abortion would require supermajorities , or two-thirds of the votes in both chambers of congress , as it is part of a constitutional amendment .
the measure could clear those hurdles as part of a trade-off for other legislation the governing coalition seeks to pass , such as pension reform needed to plug a gaping budget deficit .
