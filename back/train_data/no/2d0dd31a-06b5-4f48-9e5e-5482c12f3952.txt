21st century wire says this latest diplomatic development certainly appears positive on its surface , this week s declared syrian ceasefire a three-way agreement between washington , russia and the syrian government ( and begrudgingly by the west s other regional stakeholders ) looks increasingly like it may just be the latest attempt to buy time so that washington , turkey and saudi arabia can re-arm and replenish various militant fighting groups currently laying waste to syria.since the entrance of the russian air force into the syrian conflict theatre last october , the washington-led axis has gradually lost proxy-control of a number of key terrorist strongholds in northern syria , namely in aleppo , and thus are unable to dictate crucial facts on the ground required to dictate the international media and political narratives .
unable to craft and package these narratives , the west and its dubious coalition are completely unable to sell an escalation of military violence in syria.the fact that the washington axis has already threatened to move to a plan b even before the agreement has been implemented , indicates that this diplomatic effort may in fact be dead on arrival .
before the ink was even dry on the agreement , sources inside the cia and the pentagon went public with a preemptive statement claiming that , russia can not be trusted to uphold the ceasefire .
