The Democrats in the House of Representatives last week showed a level of spine that the slimy weasel we call the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, will never know.
They staged a sit-in, led by civil rights icon John Lewis, on the floor of the House of Representatives.
Well, Ryan seems to have gotten his cowardly boxer briefs in a twist over the fact that his pals on the other side of the aisle made a fool of him and caused him to lose control of the House chamber, and has issued a stern warning to his Democratic colleagues.Speaking with Upfront with Mike Gousha on WISN, Ryan said the following of what he would do if the Democrats dared to disrupt his ordered, delusional life as Speaker of the House by, oh, you know, standing up for what s right: We are not going to handle it the same way.
We will not take this.
We will not tolerate this.
Ryan could have, as Speaker, had the Democrats who staged the sit-in arrested, but he chose not to do so.
Because, well, he s a coward with no spine.
We already knew this, though.
Instead of admitting this, however, he blamed the Democrats, saying: They said they were hoping to get arrested and hauled off the floor.
They told a number of my staff that and so I did get a brief heads up about it, I highly doubt they were dumb enough to tell your staff, who they knew in turn would be obligated to tell you, sir, what they were planning to do to make sure the sit-in was effective.
You re just embarrassed that you lost control of the House chamber, and with good reason.
You re always talking about doing the people s work in the people s house, yet you defy the gun control measures that 90+% of the American people want.
You are doing the NRA s bidding, and we all know it.
I hope House Democrats tell you to shove your crazy ideas up your ass where they belong, should you ever have the gall to actually confront any of them.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
