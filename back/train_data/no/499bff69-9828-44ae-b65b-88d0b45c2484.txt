cairo ( reuters ) - egyptian security forces have arrested 12 suspected members of the islamist militant hasm movement in the province of fayoum 60 km ( 40 miles ) south of cairo , the interior ministry said on tuesday .
a ministry statement said police also confiscated a number of weapons and explosive devices .
hasm , a group that emerged last year and has claimed several attacks on security forces , including the fatal shooting of a policeman and injuries to three others in the province .
egypt accuses hasm of being a militant wing of the muslim brotherhood , the country s oldest islamist movement which cairo outlawed in 2013 .
the muslim brotherhood denies this and says it strives only for peaceful political change .
an insurgency led by islamic state militants in egypt s rugged sinai peninsula has killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen since the egyptian military overthrew president mohamed mursi of the muslim brotherhood in mid-2013 - although no official death toll has been released to date .
attacks have increasingly moved to the mainland in recent months , targeting coptic christians as well as security officers and checkpoints in and around major egyptian cities .
