express uka major shake up is underway in germany after police refused to take seriously a 999 call from a young man who called in to say his girlfriend was being raped yards from him.the officer who took the call did not believe the desperate man on the other end of the line , and said : you are not messing with me i hope ?
the terrified boyfriend had been threatened with a machete when the ghanaian refugee entered the tent he shared with his girlfriend at a campsite near bonn and told to remain where he was.but the boyfriend had a hard time getting police to take him seriously .
hmm , was the first reaction from the female police officer on the line .
where exactly is this rape happening ?
she added.the man was forced to watch as the attacker violated his 23-year-old partner and the police never arrived.the 26-year-old boyfriend eventually scooped her up and began walking with her along a main road looking for help.he called police a second time and again they did not take their account of what happened at face value.finally , nearly 30 minutes later , officers arrived and the victim was taken to hospital.frank piontek , spokesman for the bonn police , conceded that the incoming official in the control centre , after our findings , did not initially correctly categorize the circumstances of the first call and reacted inappropriately in her language .
the second call was also not handled properly , he added , saying a major review of procedures is underway following the attack in april.a photofit picture of the attacker led to his arrest and dna testing confirmed his guilt.a cd player he stole from the tent was found at his refugee centre.he tried to flee when police moved in to arrest him , flinging a rucksack at one officer.it turned out that the backpack was stolen from a barbecue party shortly before the rape occurred .
