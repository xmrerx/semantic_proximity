rome ( reuters ) - italy s ruling democratic party ( pd ) , hit by internal divisions and a banking scandal , is continuing to slide in opinion polls , with a new survey on saturday putting it more than six points behind the anti-establishment 5-star movement .
the survey by the ixe agency , commissioned by huffington post italia , comes just days before parliament is expected to be dissolved to make way for elections in march .
it gives the center-left pd just 22.8 percent of voter support , down almost five points in the last two months , compared with 29.0 percent for 5-star , which has gained almost two points in the same period .
silvio berlusconi s center-right forza italia ( go italy ! )
is given 16.2 percent , with its right-wing allies the northern league and brothers of italy on 12.1 percent and 5.0 percent respectively .
this bloc is expected to win most seats at the election but not enough for an absolute majority , resulting in a hung parliament .
with the pd s support eroding in virtually all opinion polls , several political commentators have speculated that its leader matteo renzi may choose or be forced to announce he will not be the party s candidate for prime minister at the election .
renzi has given no indication so far he will take this step .
the pd has split under his leadership , with critics complaining he has dragged the traditionally center-left party to the right .
breakaway groups united this month to form a new left-wing party called free and equal ( leu ) , which now has 7.3 percent of support , according to ixe .
the pd s popularity seems to have also been hurt by a parliamentary commission looking into the collapse of 10 italian banks in the past two years .
the commission s findings have put the pd on the defensive , allowing the opposition to claim a conflict of interest involving one of renzi s closest allies who was active in trying to save a bank where her father was a board member .
