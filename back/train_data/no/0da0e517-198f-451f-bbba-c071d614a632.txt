washington ( reuters ) - republican presidential front-runner donald trump vowed on monday to pursue a strong u.s. alliance with israel if elected president in november and said he would resist any attempt by the united nations to impose its will on the jewish state .
in a speech to the american israel public affairs committee , trump said he would side with israel , a close u.s. ally , in any negotiations between the israelis and the palestinians .
“ the palestinians must come to the table knowing that the bond between the united states and israel is unbreakable , ” he said .
“ they must come to the table willing and able to stop the terror being committed on a daily basis against israel and they must come to the table willing to accept that israel is a jewish state and it will forever exist as a jewish state , ” trump told the pro-israel lobbying group .
trump also questioned the role of the united nations in the peace process , saying any attempt by the international body to impose a middle east agreement would be a disaster .
