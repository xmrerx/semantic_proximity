Remember when the world laughed at Donald Trump when he claimed that President Obama put a tapp on his wires at his gigantic golden tower in New York?
Apparently he forgot, because he is still claiming it is true despite multiple intelligence agencies disputing the ridiculous allegation.In an interview with Financial Times, Trump was asked if he regrets any of his tweets like this one:Terrible!
Just found out that Obama had my "wires tapped" in Trump Tower just before the victory.
Nothing found.
This is McCarthyism!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017 Now my last tweet, you know the one that you are talking about perhaps, was the one about being in quotes wire tapped, meaning surveilled, Trump said.
Guess what, it is turning out to be true.
It is not turning out to be true in the least.
Trump Tower was monitored for two years ending in 2013, but President Obama did not order it; the FBI did, and the probe led to gran jury indictments of 30 people involved in a Russian money laundering operation including one of the country s most notorious mob bosses.In addition, numerous Trump transition team members were caught up in incidental collection while intelligence agencies were looking into foreign criminals.Trump s desperate attempts to distract from the Russia investigation especially since Michael Flynn offered to roll over in exchange for immunity are at this point pathetic.Featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla)
