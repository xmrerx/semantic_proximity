21st Century Wire says Trump has begun his war on Hillary.Today, Donald Trump presented a full length speech attacking Hillary Clinton.Trump called on Sanders supporters to join in supporting him, saying that he too is interested in removing special interests from American politics and is also not a political insider.The presidential candidate went on to attack Hillary for making speeches to banking elites and refusing to release their content for public critique.In what may be shocking to some, Trump also advocated a policy of protectionism, through trade tariffs, to protect American jobs and industry, while savaging Hillary for being a massive promoter of free trade deals.Here are some of Trump s striking lines from the speech, which you can watch in full below: Hillary Clinton has perfected the politics of personal profit and even theft.
We got here because we switched from a policy of Americanism, to a policy of globalism focusing on how to make money for large corporations.
She believes she is entitled to the office.
She gets rich making you poor.
It s not just our economy that s been corrupted, but our foreign policy too.
The Hillary Clinton foreign policy has cost America thousands of lives, trillions of dollars, and unleashed ISIS across the world.
Her decisions spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched.
In 2009, before Hillary Clinton was sworn in, it was a different world.
Libya was cooperating, Iraq was seeing a reduction in violence, Syria was under control, ISIS wasn t even on the map.
