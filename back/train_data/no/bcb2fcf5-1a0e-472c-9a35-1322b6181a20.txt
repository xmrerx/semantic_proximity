washington ( reuters ) - u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan said on tuesday that lawmakers would continue to press for new sanctions against tehran “ until the regime ends its violent , provocative behavior against the u.s. and our allies. ” ryan , whose republican party opposed the landmark nuclear agreement the obama administration and five other world powers reached with tehran last year , said iran ’ s latest reported missile test violated international law .
iran ’ s islamic revolutionary guards corps ( irgc ) test-fired several ballistic missiles on tuesday , state television said , challenging a united nations resolution and drawing the threat of a diplomatic response from the united states .
u.s. and french officials had earlier said a missile test by iran would violate u.n. security council resolution 2231 , which calls on iran not to conduct “ any activity ” related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons .
several republican lawmakers called for more u.s. sanctions in response , but there were no immediate plans to introduce new legislation .
the house last month passed a measure that would have limited president barack obama ’ s ability to lift sanctions under the nuclear pact , but there are no plans for the senate to take up the legislation , which obama is expected to veto .
senator bob corker , the republican chairman of the senate foreign relations committee , said his staff was working on an alternative that could win enough support to pass the senate , but which would require democratic support .
“ we ’ re having discussions right now and trying to see what type of legislation is passable , ” he told reuters .
