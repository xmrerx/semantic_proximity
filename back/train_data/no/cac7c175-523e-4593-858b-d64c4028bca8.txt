no wonder obama didn t offer up a prayer , or utter a single word about the arrest of our us sailors before , during or after his embarrassing sotu speech it doesn t matter if the 3 a.m. phone call comes in the middle of the day .
not only will the obama administration not answer it , but they ll aid our enemies instead.first came the fact that president barack obama refused to address the arrest of 10 of our sailors by the iranian military after their boats had mechanical trouble at sea .
then came news that the obama administration had offered the iranians an apology for the release of the sailors.now comes the disturbing revelation , apparently delivered by defense secretary ashton carter , that the obama administration tipped off the iranians that our soldiers were lost at sea and requested their aid.the news came from rep. louie gohmert , r-texas , during an interview on theblaze s dana loesch shortly after iran s arrest of the sailors had come to light .
i understand that ( secretary of state ) john kerry has indicated , look , when he got word , he and ash carter called the iranians to help take care of our navy guys , because they had some mechanical problems , gohmert said .
when our navy ships have problems , we don t call iran .
we call the rest of the navy .
we can call the air force , the army , the marines , coast guard .
we don t call iran , gohmert said.via : conservative tribuneeither col. ralph peters was right about obama , or we have a bonafide traitor in the white house
