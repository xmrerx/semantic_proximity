bangkok ( reuters ) - thirteen activists were ordered to pay a total of $ 16 million in compensation on thursday for shutting down bangkok s two main international airports during protests in 2008 .
thailand s supreme court told the leading members of the people s alliance for democracy ( pad ) to pay the money plus interest to the airports of thailand operator .
protesters occupied don muang and suvarnabhumi international airports for more than a week in late 2008 , disrupting hundreds of flights and stranding hundreds of thousands of travelers .
one of the pad leaders affected by the ruling , suriyasai katasila , told reuters it might take years for them to find all the money .
if we can not pay the compensation then the aot ( airports of thailand ) will have to sue us for bankruptcy , he said .
i believe what we have done was for the public interest in opposing a corrupt government at the time , it was not motivated by personal interests at all , he added .
pad was formed 2005 in opposition to thaksin shinawatra , the former thai prime minister who was ousted in a 2006 military coup .
it supporters include members of the urban middle class and support the traditional royalist-military elite .
a total of 98 pad protesters , more commonly known as the yellow shirts , have also been charged with terrorism and other criminal offences linked to the airports occupation .
