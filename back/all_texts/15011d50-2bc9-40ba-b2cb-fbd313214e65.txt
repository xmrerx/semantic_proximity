He testified that his office discovered more than $200 million in questionable spending at local public housing agencies (PHAs) since 2012.
PHAs are created by states, operate at the city or county level and administer the federal program known as Section 8 to provide low-income people with affordable housing.
Many of these local public housing agencies are run by people with troubled backgrounds that somehow manage to remain in high-ranking positions at the agencies, the watchdog told lawmakers back in 2014.DR BEN CARSON NEEDS TO CLEAN THIS UP STAT!READ MORE: DFP
