Fox News host Sean Hannity is having a Twitter meltdown after Time called out Donald Trump for claiming that the magazine called him regarding the Person of the Year award and that he declined the offer.Time magazine corrected Trump in a tweet, writing, The President is incorrect about how we choose Person of the Year.
TIME does not comment on our choice until publication, which is December 6.
The magazine calling out Trump was too much to bear for Trump cult member Sean Hannity who called it bullshit just hours after Time denied the former reality show star s bizarre claim.
I call total Bullshit on Time.
Answer the question; did you or did you not call the WH and say @realDonaldTrump @POTUS was being considered for person of the year and ask for an interview?
Hannity tweeted Friday.I call total Bullshit on Time.

Let s look at this logically.
@Time magazine has been in business 93 years.
It s never gone bankrupt.
It s a respected institution.
@realdonaldtrump has gone bankrupt 4 times, has been caught in scores of lies including a fake Time cover mounted on his golf club walls.

He knows he ll never be half the man or the President @BarackObama was, and it s eating him up inside.
