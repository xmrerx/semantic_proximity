Donald Trump woke up early as usual to post some bullshit on Twitter, and he got epically trashed.Today is Inauguration Day and Trump decided he would brag about it.It all begins today!
I will see you at 11:00 A.M. for the swearing-in.
THE MOVEMENT CONTINUES THE WORK BEGINS!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 20, 2017As the world waits in horror for what is likely to be a petty and divisive inaugual address, Twitter users launched an all-out attack on Trump in response to his tweet.Happy #Inauguration, @realDonaldTrump!
Some facts for you: Climate change isn t a HOAX.
The U.S. is a melting pot.
Science matters.
David G. McAfee (@DavidGMcAfee) January 20, 2017@realDonaldTrump you really should see a doctor if this movement doesn t stop.
That s not healthy.

That s right.
He s literally using his first two days as president as vacation days.Donald Trump is unqualified to be president and he should be impeached the second he finishes swearing to uphold and defend the Constitution, because he will immediately be violating that oath due to his conflicts of interest and his persecution of the free press.The last eight years of hope and change are being replaced with four years of darkness and hate.
Let s hope America lasts long enough to fix the mess Trump makes.Featured image by Spencer Platt via Getty Images
