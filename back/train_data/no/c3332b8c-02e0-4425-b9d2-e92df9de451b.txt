washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. navy is investigating a rise in health issues reported since 2009 by pilots of boeing co f/a-18 and ea-18g fighter jets , that may be related to insufficient oxygen or other factors , a key u.s. lawmaker said thursday .
representative michael turner , chairman of the house armed services subcommittee on tactical air and land forces , said pilots had to report any episodes in which they experienced “ a loss in performance related to insufficient oxygen , depressurization or other factors present during flight. ” turner said the navy had set up a special team to investigate the incidents and determine the root cause , but it would be a complex process since symptoms related to depressurization , tissue hypoxia and contaminant intoxication often overlapped .
“ we understand that determining the root cause or causes of physiological episodes in f/a-18 aircraft is a work in progress , ” turner said at the start of a hearing on naval strike fighters .
