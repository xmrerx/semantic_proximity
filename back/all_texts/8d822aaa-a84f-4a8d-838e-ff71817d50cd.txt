What goes around finally came around to bite Kellyanne Conway on the ass.In October, Trump s then-campaign manager and current White House counselor posted a message on Twitter aimed at Hillary Clinton.Conway mocked Clinton by writing that honest people are not investigated by the FBI.Most honest people I know are not under FBI investigation, let alone two.
https://t.co/UcSmSA5aTj Kellyanne Conway (@KellyannePolls) October 29, 2016At the time, the tweet was criticized because Trump was in the middle of being slammed by women across the country for saying that he grabs women by the genitalia without their consent.
However, the tweet really didn t gain much, if any, media coverage.But that has all changed.In light of FBI Director James Comey telling Congress that Trump has been under investigation for colluding with Russia during the 2016 Election, Twitter users were quick to use Conway s tweet against her to point out how big of a hypocrite she is, demonstrating once again that Trump and his team really should watch what they say on social media because their words can come back to haunt them..@KellyannePolls well this tweet certainly hasn t aged well ???
