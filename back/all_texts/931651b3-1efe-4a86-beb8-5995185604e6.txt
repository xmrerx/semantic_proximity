Oregon is showing Republicans in Congress how to get sh*t done.Republicans in Congress may be refusing to adhere to the Paris climate agreement, but Oregon Democrats are rolling ahead with legislation that would make the state the first in the nation to rely on 100 percent clean energy for all of their electricity needs.In fact, both the statehouse and the state senate passed the Clean Energy and Coal Transition Plan despite Republican cries that going full renewable energy will make energy costs skyrocket, which isn t true.
As it turns out, clean energy sources are poised to become less expensive than energy generated by coal and gas, both of which are finite resources.When Governor Kate Brown signs this bill into law Oregonians will get to work enacting it to get the state completely off of the coal grid by 2035.
In a statement, Brown praised the legislation, saying it equips Oregon with a bold and progressive path towards the energy resource mix of the future.
Oregon already draws 43 percent of their electricity generation from hydropower, and making the state 100 percent clean energy means Oregon will not be contributing near as big of a carbon footprint as other states in the country.
According to Oregon utility company Pacific Power, the new measure would reduce carbon pollution the equivalent of taking over six million cars off the road.This is the second major liberal victory in Oregon this week.Earlier this month, Governor Brown signed a minimum wage bill into law making Oregon the state with the highest minimum wage in the nation.Even the White House praised Oregon s determination to boost the paychecks of hardworking Americans and help support millions of workers trying to make ends meet, while also urging Republicans in Congress to do the same for the rest of the American people.So not only is Oregon leading the way on making sure Americans make a fair wage, they are leading the way to make sure people have an environment and a planet to enjoy in the future.Featured Image: Wikimedia
