Another day, another revelation in the house of sexism, Fox News.Just as Roger Ailes was ousted over his lewd and harassing comments aimed at Gretchen Carlson, executives for the network quietly settled (for six figures) and swept under the rug a lawsuit aimed at popular commentator Bill O Reilly.O Reilly, Fox s highest rated personality, was accused in August by anchoring host Juliet Huddy of sexual harassment and retaliation when she rebuffed his advances.Huddy also accused Fox co-president Jack Abernathy of doing the same, and thus demoting her to a 4 a.m. time slot before she left in September 2016.Huddy sent the intention to sue letter to executives right around the time Ailes was forced to resign, and executives were aware of the allegations at the time Abernathy signed a new, multi-year contract to run Fox with Bill Shine.The intention to sue letter, six pages long, details the harassment O Reilly subjected her to: trying to kiss her, sexually explicit phone calls, and an incident in a hotel room in New York City.Although admitting to settling with Huddy, the network categorically denied Huddy s accounts, saying that it contained substantial falsehoods.
O Reilly nor Abernathy personally paid in the settlement.
Huddy could not comment on the allegations due to a confidentiality agreement.It should also be noted that this is not the first time Fox had to settle with a female employee due to Mr. O Reilly s indiscretions.
In 2004, O Reilly and Fox settled with Andrea Mackris.In August 2016, Andrea Tantaros, another Fox host, alleged that O Reilly sexually harassed her.Bill O Reilly, self described traditionalist with untraditional tastes, has a wrap sheet almost as big as Donald Trump s. Fox News sexist and shameful behavior has driven away Gretchen Carlson, Greta Van Sustren, Andrea Tantaros, Megyn Kelly, and Juliet Huddy.
There is a sexism issue running rampant in Fox News, and the good old boys club is being protected by hush-hush money at the top.Featured image via Ilya S. Sevenok/Getty Images
