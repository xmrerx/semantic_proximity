this is a great clip from ralph peters , explaining why obama taking an apology trip to hiroshima is so offensiveit was a great point he made about how the atomic bomb actually saved lives versus how many would have been killed if we had to invade , so that there are veterans still alive today from that fight.and he s right to point out the sheer brutality of the japanese when they invaded china.look , there was only one country that we nuked in wwii and we had to do it twice.it wasn t germany .
it wasn t hitler.it was imperial japan.and that right there should tell you something .
