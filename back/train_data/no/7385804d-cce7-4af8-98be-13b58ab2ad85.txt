mexico city ( reuters ) - a key committee in mexico ’ s senate on thursday ratified a deal with the united states that would boost competition in air transportation , a senate spokesman said , paving the way for expansion of the world ’ s second largest cross-border market .
the deal , which both governments have already signed and modifies a 1960 agreement , would open up new routes for airlines to fly between the countries and allow for an unlimited number of flights .
mexico ’ s full senate must still ratify the agreement for it to take effect , which is likely to happen in the coming days .
while some analysts have welcomed the deal , saying it would lower airfares by boosting traffic , mexican airline workers have complained it would put the country ’ s airlines at a disadvantage .
the united states , which has a fleet of 7,500 planes compared to mexico ’ s 300 , accounts for 65 percent of total flights in mexican airspace , well above the 22 percent offered by mexican carriers .
ratification would also remove the main hurdle to a closer tie-up between delta air lines inc and grupo aeromexico sab de cv .
the carriers have asked the u.s. government to grant them immunity from antitrust law so they can coordinate better flight connection times as well as prices , a request that can not be granted until the aviation accord comes into force .
delta said last week its deal to buy up to 49 percent of aeromexico is expected to close this summer .
