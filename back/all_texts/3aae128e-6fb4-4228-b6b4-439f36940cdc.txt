BELFAST (Reuters) - Northern Ireland s political parties are rapidly running out of time to restore a devolved power-sharing government, Britain s minister for the region said on Monday, as he sought to avoid a return of direct rule from London.
The window of opportunity to restore devolution and to form an executive is closing rapidly as we move further into the autumn and with pressures in public services already evident, the need for intervention is becoming increasingly clear, James Brokenshire told a news conference.
I don t want to have to take this action, my intent is for politicians in Northern Ireland to form an executive.
I m not going to pretend that this is easy as clear differences remain but it does remain achievable.
