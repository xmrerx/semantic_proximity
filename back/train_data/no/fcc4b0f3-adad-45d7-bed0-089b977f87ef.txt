chicago ( reuters ) - illinois governor bruce rauner on monday signed into law a bill to send $ 600 million to cash-starved state universities and community colleges , calling the measure “ a first step toward compromise between democrats and republicans. ” an impasse between the republican governor and democrats who control the legislature has left illinois without a budget 10 months into fiscal 2016 .
in bipartisan votes in the house and senate on friday , lawmakers approved $ 600 million , or 34 percent , of the $ 1.7 billion democrats had earmarked for higher education spending for the whole fiscal year , which began july 1 .
“ now is the time to build on this bipartisan momentum and focus on enacting a truly balanced budget for fiscal years 2016-2017 alongside meaningful reforms that create jobs and free up resources for education , social services and infrastructure , ” rauner said in a statement .
illinois comptroller leslie munger said on friday that her office would immediately start processing payments for the universities , colleges and for college student grants funded by the legislation .
