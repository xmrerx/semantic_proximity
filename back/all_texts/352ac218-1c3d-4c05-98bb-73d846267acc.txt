When Ted Cruz announced Carly Fiorina as his running mate last week, it left many, many people scratching their heads.
It d be like a football team getting their finger sizes measured for Super Bowl rings after they ve already been eliminated from making the playoffs.
It just didn t make any sense whatsoever.
It was clearly a move to try to get media attention (which worked) and in hopes of helping him win the Republican nomination (which it won t).Add to this how awkward of a pairing Cruz and Fiorina make.
They go together like orange juice and toothpaste, where the only thing left will be the bitter taste left in everyone s mouths after witnessing their desperation.If you don t believe how awkward they are together, then by all means, witness it for yourselves.Here s Cruz trying to grab Fiorina s hand in the typical politician power pose with their running mate.
Or in Cruz s case, his running mate.
Carly Fiorina Gives Ted Cruz a Hand (by @VicBergerIV) (Vine by @superdeluxe) https://t.co/au7opXLkro Vic Berger IV (@VicBergerIV) April 27, 2016Now, add that together with the fact that both are heavily disliked amongst not only liberals, but conservatives as well, including many in Washington, and you have a recipe for utter failure.
Unfortunately, Cruz is gonna have to learn this lesson the hard way, because common sense and candor are not his forte.Featured image via video screen capture
