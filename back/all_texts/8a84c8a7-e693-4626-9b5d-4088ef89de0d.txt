Remember when Donald Trump claimed that Ford was moving jobs and production to Mexico?
Well, we all knew he was lying then, but he s admitting it now by bragging about it.In September, Trump accused the American car manufacturer of intending to take jobs from workers in Kentucky and take them to Mexico.But that was blatantly false because of a labor contract between the company and the worker s union, and Ford was quick to call out Trump for lying.As it turns out, Ford is only moving production of certain vehicles to Mexico but keeping the same workforce in the United States busy producing other vehicles.
And Kentucky was never going to lose production of the Lincoln MKC SUV, even if Trump had never entered the presidential race at all.Well, Trump decided to take credit for something that wasn t going to happen anyway by bragging on Twitter that he single-handedly stopped Ford from moving the Kentucky plant to Mexico.Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky no Mexico Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky.
I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 18, 2016Let s make something clear.
Trump doesn t get credit for stopping something that was not going to happen anyway.
He is not the great savior of auto workers in Kentucky.
That credit should go to the labor union responsible for negotiating the contract that prevented Ford from moving the plant out of Kentucky in the first place.But by bragging about it anyway, Trump basically just admitted that he lied when he claimed Ford was moving the factory to Mexico.
He flat-out lied, and now he is pretending that he achieved some great victory.It s quite pathetic.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
