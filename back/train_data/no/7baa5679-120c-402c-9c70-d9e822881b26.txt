the department said many federal prosecutors appointed in the obama administration have already left their positions , but that sessions is now seeking the resignations of 46 holdovers.it is customary , though not automatic , for the country s 93 u.s. attorneys to leave their positions once a new president is in office .
the obama administration allowed political appointees of president george w. bush to serve until their replacement had been nominated and confirmed.the federal prosecutors are nominated by the president , generally upon the recommendation of a home-state senator.one u.s. attorney appointed by bush , rod rosenstein of maryland , remained on the job for the entire obama administration and is the current nominee for deputy attorney general.u.s .
attorneys are responsible for prosecuting federal crimes in the territories they oversee .
they report to justice department leadership in washington , and their priorities are expected to be in line with those of the attorney general.via : ap
