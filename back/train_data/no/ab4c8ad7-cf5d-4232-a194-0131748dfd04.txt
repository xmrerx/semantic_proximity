we love ap reporter matt lee !
he is a lone voice in the effort to get the truth from our government the stae department spokespeople are unbelievable in their evasiveness !
how do these reporters get any truth ?
well , they don t it goes in a circle as you ll see in the video below .
ugh ! a newly released state department email features clinton foundation-related requests , raising potential ethical issues about the clinton foundation during hillary clinton s four years as secretary of state .
so that s what a bunch of reporters confronted state spokeswoman elizabeth trudeau about yesterday.three separate reporters starting with nbc s abigail williams asked trudeau about whether there was any improper relationship between state and the clinton foundation .
trudeau repeatedly downplayed the emails and said the department is regularly in touch with a wide range of people.one reporter pointed out that clinton had made a pledge not to involve herself with the foundation while she was secretary of state .
trudeau shot back that the agreement did not preclude others from talking to foundation staff.at one point , as another reporter the ap s matt lee was getting frustrated with the lack of answers , he said this : i m sorry , are you am i not speaking english ?
is this i mean , is it coming across as a foreign i m not asking you if no one is saying it s not okay or it s bad for the department to get a broad variety of input from different people .
asking the question is whether or not you have determined that there was nothing improper here .
we love you matt lee !
