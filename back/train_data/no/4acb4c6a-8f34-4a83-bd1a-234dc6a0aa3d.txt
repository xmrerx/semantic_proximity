london ( reuters ) - forty members of parliament from prime minister theresa may s conservative party have agreed to sign a letter of no-confidence in her , the sunday times newspaper reported .
that is eight short of the number needed to trigger a party leadership contest , the mechanism through which may could be forced from office and replaced by another conservative .
may has been struggling to maintain her authority over her party since a snap election on june 8 which she called thinking she would win by a wide margin but instead resulted in her losing her parliamentary majority .
divided over how to extricate britain from the european union and hit by multiple scandals involving ministers , may s government has failed to assert control over a chaotic political situation that is weakening london s hand in brexit talks .
an earlier attempt to unseat may in the wake of her disastrous speech at the annual party conference fizzled out , but many conservatives remain unhappy with the prime minister s performance and talk of a leadership contest has not gone away .
may has lost two cabinet ministers in as many weeks : michael fallon stepped down as defense secretary after becoming implicated in a wider scandal about sexual misconduct in parliament , while priti patel resigned as aid minister after she was found to have had secret meetings with top israeli officials .
in the event of a leadership contest , if a challenger defeated may he or she would take over as conservative leader and as prime minister .
a national election is not necessary for that to happen .
