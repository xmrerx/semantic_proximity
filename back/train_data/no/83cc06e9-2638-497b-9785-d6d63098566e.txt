time s 100 most influential people in the world list was released , and liberals aren t keen on all of the people who made it .
rather , they re upset republicans are in positions of power and are actually making things happen in the nation and across the globe .
as gossip maven perez hilton wrote , unfortunately , it s a sad ( sad ! )
reality that donald trump , steve bannon , ivanka trump , and jared kushner top the list of the year s most influential people .
sigh .
truth revoltwhen fans of president trump heard he made time magazine s top 100 most influential people in the world list , they were a surprised that the liberal magazine would risk losing subscribers by including the controversial president on their list .
what was even more surprising , is the person who wrote the glowing review of president donald trump that time published alongside his name .
it s entirely possible that republican speaker of the house paul ryan , like so many others , made assumptions about donald trump that turned out to be completely inaccurate .
maybe after watching trump in action ryan realized that he underestimated how much this president loves our country and the lengths he s willing to go to , to protect and defend it .
the other possibility is that ryan , like many others who ve encountered president trump in action have developed a strong respect for one of the hardest working and toughest people in america.what a difference 100 days can make paul ryan had this to say about president trump : wendi murdoch on ivanka trump : michael duffy on about stephen bannon :
