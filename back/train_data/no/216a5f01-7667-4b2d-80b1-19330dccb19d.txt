tripoli ( reuters ) - former libyan prime minister ali zeidan has been released after being abducted during a visit to the capital , tripoli , and held for nine days by an armed group , a relative said on wednesday .
zeidan was prime minister from 2012-2014 , a period when libya slid deeper into the political turmoil and armed conflict that has plagued the country since muammar gaddafi was overthrown six years ago .
he has since been living in germany with his family .
it is not clear why zeidan traveled to libya or why he was abducted .
he was being held by a group aligned with the u.n.-backed government in tripoli , though he faced no judicial charges , a source said .
the u.n.-backed government has not commented on the case .
tripoli is controlled by a number of the armed groups that have held power in the capital since 2011 .
some have been given semi-official status by successive governments , but the groups remain unaccountable and involved in criminal activity .
a lawyer for zeidan , moussa al-doghali , told france 24 arabic tv channel that his client was released without explanation and that he did not know the circumstances of his arrest and detention .
zeidan was in good health and was staying in a tripoli hotel following his release , doghali said .
in october 2013 , zeidan was briefly abducted from a tripoli hotel room by an armed group allied to the parliament that sacked him just over a year later .
