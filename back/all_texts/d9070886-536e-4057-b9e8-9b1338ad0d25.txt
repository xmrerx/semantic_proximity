WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A typical U.S. family with two children earning $100,000 a year can expect a tax cut of $1,000 under President Donald Trumpâ€™s proposed tax overhaul, White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said on Thursday.
Cohn also told reporters at the White House that the repeal of estate tax and alternative minimum tax would be immediate under the proposal.
