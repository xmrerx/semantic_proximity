Tuesday at the White House, several people are set to receive the prestigious Medal of Freedom from President Obama.
Those who will receive them include Tom Hanks, Michael Jordan and Ellen DeGeneres, among others.According to USA Today: For the last time in office, President Obama will bestow the nation s highest civilian honor on 21 individuals from a varying list of categories from science to sports to entertainment.
There s been a slight snag with Ellen DeGeneres entry to the White House, however.
The television host and entertainer extraordinaire seemed to have forgotten her ID, and security at the White House won t let her in.But instead of get freaked out over it, because it likely gets solved in a timely manner, DeGeneres did what she always does, make a joke out of it.
So she tweeted this: They haven t let me in to the White House yet because I forgot my ID.

However, it doesn t make the whole situation any less funny, because even Ellen, as recognizable as she is, was told she couldn t enter without proper identification.So, kudos to White House security for playing it safe no matter what, and congratulations to Ellen on her much deserved award.FeaturedPhoto by Kevin Winter/Getty Images
