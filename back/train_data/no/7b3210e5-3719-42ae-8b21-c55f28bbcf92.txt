we have channels , through which we are conducting a dialogue , and we are ready to deploy them , we are ready to exert our influence on north korea , morgulov was quoted as saying at a conference in berlin .
he also said that neither washington nor pyongyang want a real war but such scenarios exist , according to ria news agency .
the kremlin has traditionally protected the reclusive state though the latest pyongyang tests have irked moscow .
north korea , which conducted its sixth and largest nuclear bomb test in september , has tested dozens of ballistic missiles under kim jong un s leadership in defiance of international sanctions .
morgulov called for other measures than isolation to exercise in dealing with north korea .
we believe that the isolation alone ... will not work , this won t take us forward .
by doing this , we will only worsen the situation , which is dangerous .
we are really on the brink of a real war , he said .
in washington , a u.s. state department spokeswoman said the trump administration still wanted a peaceful , diplomatic solution to the nuclear and missile threat from pyongyang but said : ( north korea ) has shown through its actions that it is not interested in talks .
we must remain focused on increasing the costs for pyongyang to continue to advance its wmd programs .
morgulov was also quoted as saying that north korea was seeking a direct dialogue with the united states on its nuclear program , while it was not in need of security guarantees either from china or russia .
