as a side note , i m just curious when did the world agree to forfeit the rainbow ( a sign from god to noah that he would never again flood the earth ) as the official symbol for the gay community ? the air force announced policy changes thursday that will make it more difficult to discharge transgender troops , a move that mirrors one made in march by the army and puts the pentagon a step closer to allowing transgender people to serve openly.troops diagnosed with gender dysphoria or who identify as transgender are generally discharged from serving , based on medical grounds .
those decisions have been made by doctors and unit commanders .
the new air force policy requires those decisions to be reviewed by high-level officials at air force headquarters .
though the air force policy regarding involuntary separation of gender dysphoric airmen has not changed , the elevation of decision authority to the director , air force review boards agency , ensures the ability to consistently apply the existing policy , daniel sitterly , a top air force personnel official , said in a statement.the air force and army moves follow a number of statements from top pentagon officials about dismantling the policy allowing transgender troops to be kicked out of the services .
defense secretary ashton carter said this year in response to a question about transgender service that ability to perform military tasks should be the standard for eligibility.air force secretary deborah james expressed openness to allowing transgender troops to serve .
from my point of view , anyone who is capable of accomplishing the job should be able to serve , james told usa today .
and so i wouldn t be surprised if this doesn t come under review .
