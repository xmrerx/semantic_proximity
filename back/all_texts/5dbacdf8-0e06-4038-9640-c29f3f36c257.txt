Right-wing super troll and Breitbart.com contributor Milo Yiannopoulos has been banned from Twitter forever.
The announcement comes from the social network after years of Yiannopoulos using the service to direct his followers to hound and harass people with racist, bigoted, and sexist threats.That ended on Tuesday.But this week he went far.
According to Twitter, it was Yiannopoulos who led the harassment campaign against Ghostbusters actor Leslie Jones that inspired the SNL cast member s decision to leave Twitter.
The tweets, many of which targeted Jones for being black and a woman, were the final straw for Twitter, which is taking steps to try to solve its harassment problem.According to the company, the permanent suspension isn t a matter of speech as much as a matter of behavior specifically, a violation of Twitter s rules regarding the targeted abuse of specific users.Yiannopoulos and his rabid fan base went after Jones because they view her role in the all-female Ghostbusters as an attack on men, and believe the movie should be attacked, no matter the merits of the film on its own.As a result, when the so-called alt-right pundit directed his followers to Jones, the actress received numerous tweets comparing her to a monkey or baboon and a torrent of racist and sexist epithets.Jones, frustrated that Twitter was not responding to clear violations of its user policy prohibiting such actions, began to post the threats she received as a form of protest against the company.
Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey finally reached out to Jones, but only after hours of posting the clear violations.Yiannopoulos has styled himself as a provocateur on what he and his followers call the alt-right.
The movement though is not really alt but is a throwback to some of the racist and sexist impulses that have lived on the right for decades.
