melanie trump is more than just a pretty face .
she is brilliant and is not likely someone who is pushed around .
in her interview on fox & friends that will air on tuesday between 6-9 am est , melania talks about her husband s accusers with fox and friends host ainsley earhardt .
she makes a great point about the timing of trump s accusers and suggests the correct way for them to handle their accusations i was not surprised in one way , because as i said before , everything was organized .
it is 3 weeks before the elections , all these women coming out .
these are allegations that are not true .
why now ?
why 3 weeks before the election ?
why they are accusing my husband that is not the man i know .
they want to damage the presidency of my husband class act
