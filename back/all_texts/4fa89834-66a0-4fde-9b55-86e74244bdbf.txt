The Republican National Committee released a bizarre Christmas statement comparing president-elect Donald Trump to a King.
We can recall all those times conservatives mocked our president, calling him King Obama so the irony is not lost on anyone.
Over two millennia ago, a new hope was born into the world, a Savior who would offer the promise of salvation to all mankind, RNC chairman Reince Priebus and co-chair Sharon Day wrote in the statement.
Just as the three wise men did on that night, this Christmas heralds a time to celebrate the good news of a new King.
We hope Americans celebrating Christmas today will enjoy a day of festivities and a renewed closeness with family and friends.
(my emphasis)Some conservatives on Twitter defended the statement saying it was referring to Jesus, but most people did not.
The odd wording that was used seems to indicate the RNC is referring to Trump.
Or they re just trolling us.good lord https://t.co/9etYehnJux pic.twitter.com/srSegSWBoq southpaw (@nycsouthpaw) December 25, 2016In defense of the statement:Every year we welcome the arrival of our King, whose name is Jesus.
Justin Green (@JGreenDC) December 25, 2016Most Twitter users felt otherwise:#GOPChristmasMessage either blasphemy or crowning Trump king of America.
Either way disturbing.

Even as we celebrate, we must also remember those among us who are less fortunate.
Many on this day are without hope, and need the kindness and compassion of those around them.
It is our prayer we will rise to meet the material, emotional, and spiritual needs of individuals all around us, and what better day is there to love our fellow man than today?, it reads.
As we open presents, enjoy Christmas dinner, and celebrate our own family traditions, we are mindful of our men and women in uniform.
Many are stationed around the world today protecting our freedoms, and cannot be with their own spouses, children, parents, and siblings, the message continues.
We express the deepest gratitude for service that takes them away from celebrating with loved ones, and we ought to remember them in our thoughts and prayers not just on Christmas Day, but the whole year round.
By compassion, they mean they ll take away healthcare from Americans who cannot afford it, lower taxes for the wealthy, and go after Medicare, Medicaid and welfare.Merry Christmas!Photo by Alex Wong via Getty.
