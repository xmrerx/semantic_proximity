moscow ( reuters ) - russia s defense ministry has sent an oceanographic research ship to the south atlantic to help with the search for an argentine submarine which went missing more than a week ago , tass news agency reported on thursday .
the vessel , called yantar ( amber ) , is equipped with two self-propelled deep submergence vehicles allowing it to examine underwater areas up to 6,000 meters ( 3.75 miles ) deep , tass quoted the russian military as saying .
dozens of planes and boats are searching for the san juan submarine .
the search entered a critical phase on wednesday as the 44 crew on board could be running low on oxygen , an argentine navy spokesman said .
if the german-built submarine , in service for more than three decades , had sunk or was otherwise unable to rise to the surface since it gave its last location on nov. 15 , it would be using up the last of its seven-day oxygen supply .
