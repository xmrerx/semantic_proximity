holy smokes !
could someone tell obama he doesn t need to dump more money into the baltimore school system .
i think they need to point the finger somewhere else the baltimore school system ranked second among the nation s 100 largest school districts in how much it spent per pupil in fiscal year 2011 , according to data released tuesday by the u.s. census bureau.the city s $ 15,483 per-pupil expenditure was second to new york city s $ 19,770 .
rounding out the top five were montgomery county , which spent $ 15,421 ; milwaukee public schools at $ 14,244 ; and prince george s county public schools , which spent $ 13,775.the census bureau also noted the first decrease in per-pupil spending nationally since 1977 , the year the figures were first tracked.the per-pupil expenditures were calculated based on taking the districts current spending on day-to-day operations and deducting payments to charter schools and capital funding .
the remaining money was divided by the number of students enrolled in traditional schools .
the amounts were not adjusted for inflation.baltimore schools ceo andr s alonso said the city s total could have reflected large infusions of cash to the district , including millions in federal stimulus dollars and federal race to the top funds.he also credited state lawmakers for maintaining funding .
as many states pulled back on spending , with many districts losing funding , maryland held the line on education , which is why you see three districts at or near the top , he said.on monday , the school board passed a $ 1.2 billion budget that includes per-pupil funding of $ 5,190 .
that amount is different from what the census bureau reported because the school system takes out other expenses , such as transportation costs and special-education services , before allocating money to individual schools .
in addition , the school system provides extra funding for certain groups of students , such as those in special education and dropout-prevention programs.via : baltimore sun
