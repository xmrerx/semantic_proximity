Just a few months ago, the idea of Donald Trump s actually being able to get Congress to agree to a massive wall along the U.S.-Mexico border seemed like an absolutely insane idea to Democrats and Republicans alike.
Now, however, it seems that Trump s crude, nationalistic monument is about to become a reality and Speaker of the House of Representatives Paul Ryan is rolling over like the spineless puppy dog we all know him to be when it comes to Trump, and he insists that Trump s wall will be built.
Also, it will come at the cost of the American taxpayer.Sitting down with MSNBC s Greta Van Susteren, Speaker Ryan says of Trump s wall: We re going to pay for it and front the money up.
After that, Ryan rambled on about how it s about national security and keeping America safe from immigrants you know the kind of rhetoric that was unthinkable from an American leader just a few shorts months ago: This is about keeping Americans safe.
We are committed to working with the administration to stop the influx of illegal immigration along the southern border, protect our homeland, and uphold the rule of law.
I applaud President Trump for keeping his promise to make this a national priority.
Then, he went on to agree with the looniest part of Trump s plan to force Mexico to pay for the wall.
Ryan says: There are a lot of different ways of getting Mexico to contribute to doing this.
So, let me get this straight Paul Ryan, who likes to pretend he s one of the reasonable Republicans on Capitol Hill, the guy who people looked to in order to challenge Trump s insanity, is now caving to one of the craziest plans Trump has hatched.If anyone had any comforting delusions that GOPers on The Hill would do anything about Trump s nutty plans, you best get rid of them now and #RESIST.Watch a short clip of the interview below:Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images
