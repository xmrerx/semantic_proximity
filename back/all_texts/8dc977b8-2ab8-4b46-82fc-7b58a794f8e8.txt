Former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice sat down for an interview on Sunday and had a few words to say about the birth of America, which was plagued by slavery from its very conception.While discussing her newest book, Democracy: Stories from the Long Road to Freedom, Rice told CBS Sunday Morning that the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s was the second founding of America.
We forget in the United States how long it has taken us to make We the People mean people like me.
And indeed, I do think that America was born with a birth defect; it was slavery.
And so I do think that when we were finally able to deliver the promise of the Constitution to people like me, little girls growing up in Birmingham, Alabama, when finally my father was able to vote without difficulty, yes, it s the second founding of America.
The first founding wasn t quite complete.
Rice, who spent eight years in the White House serving as national security adviser and secretary of state under President George W. Bush, also called forth a memory from her childhood during the interview.
She grew up in Alabama, where Jim Crow was the law of the land.
In the summers, her family would travel to Denver.
However, these were not your average family vacations.
Rather, they were a quest for an education denied to them because of the color of their skin.
If you were black, you couldn t go to the University of Alabama for graduate school in 1961, she said.
And so my father, who was getting an advanced degree in student personnel administration, and my mother, who was qualifying to teach music in the schools she was a science teacher before that would go to Denver.
