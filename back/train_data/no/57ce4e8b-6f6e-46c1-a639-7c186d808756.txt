the uk will remain unconditionally committed to maintaining europe s security , may said in a speech at the guildhall in london s financial district .
the comprehensive new economic partnership we seek will underpin our shared commitment to open economies and free societies in the face of those who seek to undermine them .

we will take the necessary actions to counter russian activity , she said .
may also said she wanted better relations with russia if it worked to promote peace .
russia can , and i hope one day will , choose this different path , she said .
but for as long as russia does not , we will act together to protect our interests and the international order on which they depend .
