Brent Bozell does political commentary on Fox News.
He just put the hurt on FAKE CONSERVATIVE Senator Jeff Flake with a great oped calling Flake out for being a RINO On behalf of my late father and my family, I am denouncing Senator Jeff Flake and his new book, dishonestly titled, Conscience of a Conservative.Since entering the Senate in 2013, Jeff Flake has, time and again, proven he is part of the indulgent hypocrisy in Washington.
While he waxes poetically about conservative principles, his Conservative Review Liberty score is an abysmal 53%, also known as: F .
In 2013, I watched first-hand as Flake refused to sign a letter pledging to defund ObamaCare, among his many betrayals to conservatism.
Jeff Flake is neither a conservative nor does he have a conscience.As every conservative leader knows, my father, L. Brent Bozell, Jr., ghost-wrote Conscience of a Conservative for Barry Goldwater.
While the Goldwater Institute may own the rights to the book s title, neither the organization nor Senator Flake have the right to unjustifiably trade on my father s work.
Conscience of a Conservative is the greatest selling polemic in history, and Senator Flake is trading on its reputation to shamelessly promote himself and disguise his own conservative deficiencies.
My father would be appalled to see this fraud as the author of the so-called sequel, which it most certainly is not.The media need to know, when reporting on Senator Flake and his book, that the author is a deceiver out for personal and financial gain.
I also call on my conservative brethren to denounce this impostor, who dishonorably claims to speak for conservatism, in the strongest possible terms.
