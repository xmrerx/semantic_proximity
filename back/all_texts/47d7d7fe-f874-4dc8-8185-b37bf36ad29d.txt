This is the kind of trash Donald Trump is bringing into the political field.When Daily Beast reporter Olivia Nuzzi posted a story on her Facebook page about the relationship between Donald Trump and Marla Maples written by colleague Brandy Zadrozny, she didn t think it would cause conservatives to lose their shit.After all, the piece seems to reveal a Trump with a more human side, while expressing admiration for Marla Maples for the way she put up with his bullshit all those years.
Regardless, there is no excuse for this kind of response.Nevertheless, a New Jersey Republican who clearly has not read the piece nor understood that Nuzzi did not write the story herself lashed out by openly replying that he hopes somebody rapes her, preferably a Syrian refugee.
I hope somebody rapes you today, wrote Mike Krawitz, a GOP candidate running for a seat on the West Deptford Township CommitteeThis man who wants me to be raped today was a Republican candidate for office in NJ https://t.co/NgxtjOTaJ9 pic.twitter.com/H31Q5VmXVc Olivia Nuzzi (@Olivianuzzi) September 5, 2016Here s an image of his posts as they appeared on Facebook.So far, the West Deptford GOP is failing horribly at handling the matter.
They are actually defending Krawitz by claiming that his Twitter account got hacked.
The executive board of the WDGOP does not condone any repulsive, threatening, or demeaning rhetoric in any social media form or otherwise, they began.
We are in the process of contacting Twitter for confirmation that someone hacked his account and posted his facebook thumbnail on the hacked twitter entry.
Except that Krawitz, who is an avid fan of the Republican nominee, posted his disgusting attack on Facebook, something Nuzzi reminded the West Deptford GOP when she took them to the woodshed over their pathetic response.Wishing rape upon any woman is despicable and should automatically disqualify the person who said it from seeking political office.
But apparently, the GOP thinks it s a virtue.Featured image via Facebook
