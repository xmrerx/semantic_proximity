Atlanta, Miami, Orlando.
What about the other 297 airports nationwide?
asked committee co-chair Senator Bill Nelson (D-Florida).TSA (Transportation Security Administration) head Robert Neffenger answered that while the TSA has increased the inspection of employees five-fold in the last five months, more needs to be done.Neffenger said that all airports were asked to provide a report by the end of the month assessing their vulnerabilies.A 2015 TSA committee concluded most airports could not afford daily employee screening.
In addition, they said the full screening would not appreciably increase the overall system-wide protection.
No single measure can provide broad-spectrum protection against risks or adversaries, the committee concluded.
Therefore, risk-based, multi-layered security offers the greatest ability to mitigate risks through the application of flexible and unpredictable measures to protect commercial aviation.
The report argued daily screening is incapable of determining a person s motivations, attitudes and capabilities to cause harm, among other limitations.
