Donald Trump and his team are desperate to cover up and stop the reporting of the FBI s investigations into Trump s Russia ties, and they just made a major mistake while trying to control the media.Earlier today during the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), Trump railed against the media in a bizarre rant.
Just hours after Trump spoke, the White House decided to take this hostility one step further and banned certain media outlets that Trump had taken issue with from a press gaggle.
There were several others such as The New York Times and BuzzFeed, but the most predictable network that was shunned was none other than CNN, who Trump has often referred to as fake news.
In response, CNN put out a public statement calling the Trump administration s behavior unacceptable.
And the network wasn t done.
CNN s Jake Tapper weighed in on the White House s actions and tore into Trump.
He said: This White House doesn t value an independent press.
There s a word for that line of thinking: The word is un-American.
You can watch Tapper s brilliant takedown of Trump below:Tapper couldn t have been more correct, and he s perfectly demonstrating how the media should be responding to Trump.
Tapper didn t attempt to sugarcoat anything and brilliantly called Trump out for trying to run America like a dictatorship.Trump and his team have done everything they can to distract from their wrongdoings, and it s all coming to a head now.
They are trying to discredit the country s free press and create distrust with American citizens so that Trump and his minions can continue to get away with their scandals.
Americans need to stand by the media and continue to pay attention whenever Trump tried to pull a disgusting stunt like this one.
It s really our only chance against such a dishonest administration.Featured image via screenshot and Pool / Getty Images
