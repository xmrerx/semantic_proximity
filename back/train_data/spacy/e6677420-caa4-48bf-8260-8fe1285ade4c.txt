moreover standard articulate minimization instruction vague predicate criminal liability
-PRON- require masking concealment identity american incidentally intercept unless intelligence value intercept communication understand without know american identitywithin reasonable parameter subjective judgment call
criminal law judgment call
-PRON- provision must precise put people clear notice exactly proscribe
reasonable mind differ much identify information incidentally intercept american necessary intelligence value lawfully intercept communication fully understand
stuff crime
technical legality particular instance unmasking beside point
question abuse powerhere -PRON- critical bear mind something easily forget
sole purpose foreign intelligence collection understand action intention foreign power -PRON- operative
government purpose understand action intention american citizen two proper way go conduct criminal investigation american citizen target courtauthorize surveillance base probable cause crime b conduct fisa investigation american citizen target courtauthorize surveillance base probable cause -PRON- act agent foreign power

snooping -PRON- subject incidental byproduct ie unintentional albeit inevitable consequence snoop foreign power
incidental snoop deprive -PRON- privacy protection root law requirement government obtain judicial warrant seize eavesdrop -PRON- communicationsthe law allow happen post hoc safeguard apply
director james comey testify congress fbi obsessive conceal identity americans
unmasking big deal
american intercept collect agency fbi cia nsa shrug -PRON- shoulder say well -PRON- could provide marginally well understanding meaning communication -PRON- reveal name american
-PRON- practice along line -PRON- reveal name unless -PRON- absolutely necessary understand communication even -PRON- prefer use substitute eg
american diplomat
1 rather actual name
agency take position -PRON- good honorable people though -PRON- arethey take -PRON- -PRON- interest successfully carry -PRON- nationalsecurity mission
-PRON- know -PRON- fail protect identity privacy americans inevitable scandal arise irate public demand congress curtail -PRON- spy power
hand anyone make mistake
failure unmask american identity know -PRON- would essential understanding crucial bit foreign intelligence could disastrous consequence
consumer intelligence sometimes rarely sometimes ask collector unmask
even though collect official know -PRON- investigation consumer eg white house staffer national security council -PRON- intelligence report -PRON- always possible consumer could notice something collector miss
-PRON- could think intelligence angle occur collectorsso gray area -PRON- know whether unmasking massive abuse power perfectly appropriate exercise discretion
-PRON- apply common sense
questionable unmask single isolate instance -PRON- part pattern
communication question real foreign intelligence value -PRON- blather americans participate mention -PRON- may appear unmask americans objective collection effort something incidental series unmasking particular american group americans
-PRON- would seem incidental collect unmask people would look like target
standard apply consistently unmasking protocol apply americans equal rigor -PRON- appear americans like maybe


americans connect trump give less protection
