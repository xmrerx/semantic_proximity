Donald Trump is absolutely LIVID that the crowd for his presidential inauguration crowd yesterday was so pathetic and small (like his hands) in comparison to the massive turnout for former President Barack Obama s two inaugurations.He started throwing a temper tantrum yesterday, and it s continued into today as the Women s March On Washington drew massive support from around the world, making history as the largest, most widespread protest against a President.The resistance to his presidency has bothered Trump so much that he went off on the media in a speech at the CIA, claiming that the media has been lying about his shamefully low attendance numbers.
Despite the fact that many Americans witnessed just how any empty the inauguration was through live footage, Trump is still trying to convince everyone that the media is dishonest.
He s gotten so desperate for approval and attention that he actually put photos of the crowd (comprised mostly of his own VIPs) in the White House press briefing room in a sorry attempt to show that people actually attended his big day.
However, one of Trump s main targets in the press has just hit back.CNN, a network that Trump has called fake news , ran a segment on Trump s ridiculous claims by talking about Trump s CIA speech.
Jim Acosta, a CNN reporter that Trump had attacked recently, explained Trump s numerous comments to his colleague, Jake Tapper.
After the long list of childish remarks and behavior was finished, Tapper couldn t have been more hysterical as he completely deadpanned and said: I can t think of anything more important to the American people.
The moment was so awkward and perfect, that CNN closed the topic completely and that s what hurts Trump the most.
Nothing makes him more upset than when attention is taken away from him.
