pic.twitter.com/bt13ishqqp heidi siegmund cuda ( @ foxycuda ) june 30 , 2017holder isn t a frequent twitter user so that makes his tweet seem peculiar .
the trump administration is plagued with scandals and alleged president donald trump seems to incriminate himself with his own tweets .
the former reality show star s twitter timeline is a goldmine for prosecutors and investigators .
the amateur president launched a war on every u.s. intelligence agency and that won t fare well for him .
trump s war against the free press is backfiring big time , too .
perhaps trump should stop tweeting for a moment and read holder s warning .
nah , trump would just tweet about holder s wife , saying she once had blood coming out of her whatever.we re not trying to go all alex jones on you but for a man who typically tweets about his objections to repealing obamacare , this does seem a bit odd .
look out , trump .
you re about to lose this war .
a former attorney general doesn t just tweet out a be prepared message all willy nilly unless something is coming .
the trump administration fired preet bharara , sally yates and james comey and all three were investigating donald trump .
that s rather suspicious , don t you think ? as of now , holder s tweet has been liked over 30,000 times and it s garnered 13,00o retweets .
i suspect the twitter-addicted alleged president has already taken notice.featured image via chris graythen/getty images
