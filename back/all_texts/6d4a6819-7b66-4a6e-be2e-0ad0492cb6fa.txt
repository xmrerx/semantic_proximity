WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Tuesday that the military had presented to Congress an unfunded requirements list of $33 billion for fiscal year 2018.
“I have reviewed the unfunded requirements, I believe it is $33 billion and I think if we were to receive more money those requests are appropriate,” Mattis said appearing before a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing.
Mattis added that the Pentagon is likely to seek budget growth of three to five percent from 2019 to 2023.
