that contest launched the parties ’ process to nominate candidates for the november election .
“ it ’ s been an incredible honor to run a principled campaign for the white house .
today , i will end where i began , ready and willing to fight for the cause of liberty , ” paul said in a statement .
in the republican race , the libertarian-leaning paul finished in fifth place in iowa with 4.5 percent of the vote .

senator ted cruz finished first in iowa , putting a dent in real estate tycoon donald trump ’ s standing as front-runner to be his party ’ s nominee .
paul , who is also focused on winning another u.s. senate term , said he would continue fighting for limited government , criminal justice reform and “ reasonable ” foreign policy .
the heir apparent to the libertarian-minded voters who helped his father gain a standing in the last two presidential elections , paul struggled to attract support in a crowded republican field .
