Sean Spicer is doing his level best to make enemies out of the press and paint Trump as a victim of the media s alarmist lies.
Or something.
Today it was about Trump s Muslim ban Spicer seems to be irritated that the media keeps saying ban.
Apparently, Spicer thinks that everyone needs to stop using that word because Trump s Muslim ban is not a ban of any sort.
Trump said so.CNN s Jake Tapper couldn t seem to keep his jaw off the floor while covering Spicer s comments.
Trump said ban on Twitter, and Sean Spicer has said ban multiple times himself.
Tapper starts off with Spicer s comments, and then launches into a fact-check: Not a ban, okay.
But I could ve sworn I heard somebody in the Trump administration using the term ban before.
Was it possibly President Trump, on Twitter?
Oh well gee, with it up in print, one would think Spicer would be a little smarter.
Not only is he not, though, he seems to have forgotten that he himself used the word ban to describe the Muslim ban multiple times himself.Tapper wonders aloud why, if Spicer objects to a term, he keeps using it.
The way he ends it is so spot-on that it s almost side-splitting.Watch below:.
