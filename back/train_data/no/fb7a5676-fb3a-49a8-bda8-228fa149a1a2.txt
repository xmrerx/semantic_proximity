mogadishu ( reuters ) - a roadside bomb killed at least seven people on sunday - mostly women farmers - in an area outside the somali capital dominated by islamist insurgents who have defied public protests to end years of violence , residents and the army said .
a truck bombing in mogadishu last weekend killed at least 358 people , with 56 people still missing .
almost all of the dead were civilians and the attack triggered angry demonstrations in the capital .
sunday s bombing hit a minibus in daniga village about 40 km ( 25 miles ) to the northwest of mogadishu .
we heard a huge crash today and we went to the scene , we saw a ruined minibus and at least seven dead bodies , mostly women .
we could not identify some people , they were just pieces of human flesh , farmer nur abdullahi told reuters by phone .
the area of the bombing is close to areas held by al shabaab , the al qaeda-linked insurgents who want to overthrow the weak u.n.-backed government and impose strict islamic law .
we are scared , abdullahi said hundreds of masked militants are everywhere and we anticipate the government will attack here .
they also planted mines everywhere and today we pack our clothes to flee .
an army officer said the death toll might be higher .
we know the minibus left afgooye ( town ) this morning and it was carrying farmers , mostly women , said captain isa osman of the somali national army .
it was carrying more than 10 people .
we can not get many details because the area is not controlled by government .
after last saturday s attack , the government promised new offensives against the insurgency .
somalia has been riven by civil war since 1991 , when clan warlords overthrew a dictator then turned on each other .
