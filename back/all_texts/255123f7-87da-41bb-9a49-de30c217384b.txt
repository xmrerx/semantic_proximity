Kirstie Alley hasn t been relevant in the world of acting in many years.
Usually, the only way she can get any news attention is by either appearing on the cover of The National Enquirer or by making outrageous statements which is just what she did on this weekend when she tweeted out complaints regarding President Obama s response to the flooding situation in Louisiana.Everyone is well aware that the people of Louisiana are hurting due to a massive amount of flooding that swept the state.
However, due to the fact that the President or any presidential candidates visiting the area would be nothing but a distraction and a drain on resources, the Governor of Louisiana has asked the president and the presidential candidates to not go to the state until things are more controlled.
This information somehow missed Kirstie Alley, who, of course, supports Donald Trump for president.
It s no wonder she supports him; after all it seems that her tweeting style is just like his ignorant and self-congratulatory to the extreme.Or on a golf course in Martha's Vineyard instead of in Louisiana?

I didn't need an invitation Kirstie Alley (@kirstiealley) August 19, 2016This woman is an idiot.
She knows nothing about why the president isn t there.
It doesn t matter what people think, it is the president s job to do what is BEST, not what is popular.
This dumb ass actress needs to go back into whatever hole she crawled out of, or, better yet, stay in her house watching her old flicks and reliving her very brief glory days on Cheers.
After all, that s all she s good for.Featured image via Albert L. Ortega/Getty Images
