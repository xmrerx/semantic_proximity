NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources is to hold a hearing on Puerto Rico on Feb. 25, it said in a statement, as Congress tries to come up with a solution for the debt-ridden U.S. territory.
The oversight hearing will be about the U.S. Treasuryâ€™s analysis of the situation in Puerto Rico, the statement said.
The island has around $70 billion of debt and has defaulted on some of its borrowings.
