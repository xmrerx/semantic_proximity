Donald Trump is so desperate to hear praise that he is retweeting anyone who congratulates him for withdrawing the United States from the Paris climate deal.In an effort to prevent and reverse climate change, the developing nations of the world came together in Paris, France and agreed to curb their carbon emissions.Trump, however, is a climate change denier.
So he promised to pull America out of the deal and he did exactly that on Thursday.
In order to fulfill my solemn duty to protect America and its citizens, the United States will withdraw from the Paris climate accord, Trump announced.
We re getting out.
And then he referred to himself in the third person and patted himself on the back.
The Paris accord is a bad deal for Americans and the President s action today is keeping his campaign promise to put America first.
The accord was negotiated poorly by the Obama administration out of desperation.
Trump s decision has spurred outrage across the nation and around the globe as world leaders feel that the United States has betrayed them.
One of the big reasons why the Paris Agreement became reality is because the United States led the way.
Now America is retreating from that leadership role.However, Trump was only interested in hearing praise for his monumentally moronic decision, so he proceeded to retweet anyone who kissed his ass, including Lindsey Graham, Reince Priebus, and Kevin McCarthy.I support President Trump s desire to re-enter the Paris Accord after the agreement becomes a better deal for America and business.
Lindsey Graham (@LindseyGrahamSC) June 1, 2017Promise kept.
@POTUS exits flawed #ParisAccord to seek better deal for U.S. workers & economy.
This WH will always put #AmericaFirst.

@POTUS made the right call in leaving a deal that would have put an unnecessary burden on the United States.
