johannesburg ( reuters ) - south africa s president jacob zuma has filed an appeal against a court ruling that his appointment of a state prosecutor to decide whether to reinstate corruption charges against him was not valid , local media reported on thursday .
the high court ruled last week that zuma s appointment of head prosecutor shaun abrahams should be set aside immediately and that deputy president cyril ramaphosa should appoint a new public prosecutor within 60 days .
the ruling was among a series of judicial blows to his administration , which has been hit by a series of scandals .
zuma filed papers saying that people exercise presidential powers at the same time , according to television station enca .
zuma s spokesman could not immediately comment .
the national prosecuting authority ( npa ) has also said it will appeal the ruling .
in october the supreme court of appeal upheld an earlier decision by a lower court that the nearly 800 corruption charges filed against zuma before he became president be reinstated .
it then fell to abrahams , appointed by zuma , to decide whether or not the npa would pursue a case against him .
the charges against zuma relate to a 30 billion rand ( $ 2.22 billion ) government arms deal arranged in the late 1990s and have amplified calls for zuma to step down before his term as president ends in 2019 .
