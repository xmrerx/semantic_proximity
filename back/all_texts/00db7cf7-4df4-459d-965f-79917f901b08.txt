While Republicans whine and complain that their right to be a bigot is being infringed on by the big bad liberal government, the Obama Administration is (once again) doing the right thing by directing the Department of Health and Human Services to ban all forms of discrimination against transgender individuals.Not only does it ban discrimination against the transgender community, it goes even further: all discrimination on the basis of sex overall is banned fully and completely within health programs and entities that receive any federal funding.Regardless of what Republicans will say about this federal overreach, the Obama Administration has every right to implement this ruling under the Nondiscrimination in Health Programs and Activities rule which is enforceable as part of Section 1557 of the ACA.Once again, Republicans have been outplayed, and their hatred has hit another legal wall.
In a statement, Sylvia Burwell, Secretary of Health and Human Services, gleefully defended the decision, saying: A central goal of the Affordable Care Act is to help all Americans access quality, affordable health care.
Today s announcement is a key step toward realizing equity within our health care system and reaffirms this Administration s commitment to giving every American access to the health care they deserve.
The HHS website plainly lays out a feminist agenda that benefits all women, trans and non:Prohibiting denial of health care or health coverage based on an individual s sex, including discrimination based on pregnancy, gender identity, and sex stereotyping.The decision comes as the Obama Administration also set up blueprints for legal safeguards for trans students in public schools all across the country and sued North Carolina over HB 2, which was found to be in violation of the Civil Rights Act.As Obamacare faces yet another threat in court, Republicans have put forth a candidate that promises to repeal every word of the landmark healthcare law on his first day in office.That means everything this law has corrected sexism, ageism, racism and classism will again hang over the heads of every American should the buffoon known as Donald Trump become President (assuming Democrats don t take back the House or the Senate).Not only are Democrats winning the culture wars led by President Obama and his progressive administration, they are literally putting in place the legal safeguards to see it cemented for the rest of American history.If Democrats don t see the need to come out and vote, this should open the eyes of every weary, disgruntled voter.
Democrats can continue the course for four more years and beyond.
As Rob Reiner said, transgender rights are the last pieces of the civil rights puzzle.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
