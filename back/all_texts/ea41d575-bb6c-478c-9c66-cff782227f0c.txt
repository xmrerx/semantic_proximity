Too funny!
Diamond and Silk did a video warning everyone about Bikers for Hillary and that they were on their way to Philly for the convention.
Then the video cuts to John Kerry on a girl s bike.
And then there s Obama who rides like a girl too.There were no Bikers for Hillary, but there were Bikers for Trump and they showed up by the thousands in Cleveland to help keep the peace.
Big difference there on real men versus girlie men.
