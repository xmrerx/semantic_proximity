berlin ( reuters ) - germany s social democrats ( spd ) will do everything in their power to ensure that berlin embraces the european ideas of french president emmanuel macron , spd leader martin schulz said on wednesday .
chancellor angela merkel s conservatives are hoping to form a coalition with the spd after failing to get a three-way coalition with the liberal free democrats and greens off the ground .
the spd will debate the idea of once again joining such a coalition at a congress on dec. 7-9 .
schulz criticized merkel indirectly for not embracing macron s ideas , which include closer cooperation in defense , migration and a deeper integration of the euro zone .
our congress will be about this tomorrow .
what are our possibilities , our options , our instruments for ensuring that germany embraces these french ideas , schulz said at an spd conference in the party s berlin headquarters .
france is making proposals and germany is not engaging .
this is not acceptable , he added .
