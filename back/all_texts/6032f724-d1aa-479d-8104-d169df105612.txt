Liberal hack Mika Brzezinski made a ridiculous claim today that there are no real men in the White House who can stand up to President Donald Trump.
Yes, this is the same woman who said it s the media s job to tell people what to think.Scarborough began by playing a clip from Fox News Sunday in which one of President Donald Trump s new lawyers, Jay Sekulow, said that Trump is not under investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller.Scarborough had the nerve to mock Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow s by waving a stack of papers and shouting loudly.Joe Scarborough started it off by saying, I have all of this evidence right here, and it is right here that I ve got all of this evidence.
I m holding this paper.
That means what I am saying is official and I got it from a certified letter.
Brzezinski then emasculated men in the White House: Think about it.
There are no men in the White House.
Literally, no real men.

Nobody can get him to stop tweeting.
Maybe bring in a woman.
Maybe just one who can get this guy to stop tweeting and shooting himself in the foot.
