Cruz has recently gone on the attack against Donald Trump, but as recently as December, he kept the Republican frontrunner close to him, despite the fact Trump had already made many crazy statements.
Cooper called out Cruz during a CNN town-hall event.
Cooper said: Back in December, you tweeted, The establishment s only hope: Trump and me in a cage match.
Sorry to disappoint, Donald Trump is terrific.
That was after he had already made fun of Carly Fiorina s face, that was after he had gone after Megyn Kelly.
At that point, in December, did you really believe Donald Trump was terrific?
Cruz tried to divert the conversation, saying, What I knew was that the media was engaged in a lovefest, giving Donald Trump $2 billion in free media.
However, Cooper wasn t having it, responding, Sounds like you were engaged in a lovefest.
There are many reasons why the slippery Cruz wanted to keep all of his options open regarding a potential Trump win.
Cruz, never a man with a moral compass, not only didn t go on the attack against Trump, he also embraced some of Trump s racist and nasty policies, including those on Muslims and immigrants.If you look closely, there isn t much of a difference between the two except Trump has a bigger mouth, but since Cruz is an ideologue and actually believes the stupid things that come out of his mouth, it makes him more dangerous.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2WpO24C8I6Y]Featured Image via video screenshot.
