BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The future free trade agreement between the European Union and Britain will have to be along the same lines as the one the EU has with Canada, the EU s chief Brexit negotiation Michel Barnier said on Friday.
Barnier said that there was no other option, given Britain s terms for a future relationship with the EU, after it leaves the bloc in 2019.
Britain does not want to be part of the EU s single market, customs union or be subject to rulings by the European Court of Justice.
If you take that - what are you left with?
Just one thing: a free trade agreement on the Canadian model, Barnier told a news conference.
