berlin ( reuters ) - a 96-year-old former paramedic at the auschwitz nazi death camp is no longer fit to stand trial due to his dementia , a spokesman for the court said on tuesday , bringing to an end one of germany s last prosecutions linked to the holocaust .
hubert zafke worked as a paramedic in auschwitz for one month starting on aug. 15 , 1944 .
he stood accused of being an accessory to the murder of at least 3,681 people at the concentration and extermination camp in nazi-occupied poland .
during his time at auschwitz , at least 14 deportation trains arrived there from places as far away as lyon , vienna and westerbork in the netherlands .
although zafke was not accused of having been directly involved in any killings , the prosecution s office said he was aware of the camp s function as a facility for mass murder .
the trial against zafke began in the northeastern town of neubrandenburg in 2016 but was repeatedly delayed due to his ill health .
germany had faced criticism for not prosecuting those who were small cogs in the nazi machine and did not actively take part in the killing of 6 million jews during the holocaust .
that criticism has abated thanks to many recent trials and convictions , such as the 2011 conviction of sobibor extermination camp guard john demjanjuk , which gave prosecutors new legal means to investigate suspects under accessory to murder charges .
former auschwitz guard reinhold hanning and oskar groening , known as the bookkeeper of auschwitz , have also been convicted of complicity in mass murder in recent years .
another case against a woman who worked as a radio operator at auschwitz was dropped last year after a court in kiel ruled she was unfit to stand trial .
