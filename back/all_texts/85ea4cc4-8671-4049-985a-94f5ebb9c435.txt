Maxine Waters made an appearance on CNBC trying to push the term Kremlin Klan to push the Russia scam.She tried to name the offenders in the group but drew a blank after naming a few people.
It s always interesting to hear her talking points and hear what the Democrats are lying about every day.
Notice that the anchors repeat the term at the end do you think they might want this term to stick?
Clever Waters is on the Financial Services Committee that s scary!
