rio de janeiro ( reuters ) - brazilian former president luiz in cio lula da silva and right-wing congressman jair bolsonaro would make it to a second round of voting in the 2018 presidential elections if they were held today , an ibope poll showed on sunday .
the poll , published in the o globo newspaper , showed center-left lula winning 35 to 36 percent of the vote in the october 2018 race regardless of the candidates he theoretically runs against .
law-and-order congressman bolsonaro , whose popularity has been spurred by rising violence in cities like rio de janeiro that were hard-hit by the country s troubled economy , would win 15 percent if he faced off against lula .
marina silva , former environmental minister for lula , would take third placed in any voting field that included lula as a candidate with 8 to 11 percent of the vote .
silva would tie with bolsonaro for first place if lula were out of the picture .
despite lula s popularity , his political future hangs in the balance after he was convicted in july of receiving bribes from a construction firm in return for help winning government contracts .
in august , he said his workers party might have to run a different candidate .
ibope s poll of 2,000 people in all of brazil s states was conducted between oct. 18 and 22 .
it has a margin of error of two percentage points .
