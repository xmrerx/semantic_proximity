WARSAW (Reuters) - The European Commission s decision to launch the so-called Article 7 procedure against Poland may be related to Warsaw s refusal to accept Muslim migrants, spokeswoman of the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party Beata Mazurek said on Wednesday.
This may be an effect not only of the opposition s informing (on Poland to the EC) but also because we don t want to accept immigrants, we don t want to accept Muslim migrants, as we care for the security of Poles, Mazurek told reporters.
