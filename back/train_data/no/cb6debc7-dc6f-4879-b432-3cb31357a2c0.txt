manila ( reuters ) - pro-islamic state militants killed six soldiers and wounded four others on a southern philippine island , the military spokesman said on friday , as the army focused on the remaining rebel groups after regaining control of marawi city .
the army shifted its operations on basilan island after ending the five-month combat operations in marawi last month after killing the militants top leaders , including isnilon hapilon , the emir of pro-islamic state groups in southeast asia .
we were going after the abu sayyaf elements who continue to exist in basilan and up to this time , there have been skirmishes reported to us , specifically this morning , military spokesman major-general restituto padilla told news channel anc .
ten soldiers were wounded , but six died on the way to a medical facility on wednesday evening after troops , searching for abu sayyaf sub-commander furiji indama , clashed with militant groups in sumisip town , he added .
militants from the abu sayyaf , notorious for bombings , beheadings , extortion and kidnap-for-ransom in the south of the mainly roman catholic philippines , took part in the attack on marawi in may which led to the bloody five-month battle .
two army battalions were sent to reinforce soldiers who were taking heavy gunfire from well-entrenched militants , spokeswoman captain jo-ann petinglay told reporters , adding two attack helicopters also provided close air support .
an undetermined number of militants were killed or wounded in the four-hour battle , petinglay said .
we will continue to chase the abu sayyaf and finish them off , she added .
the presence of pro-islamic state militants is among the top internal security threats for the philippines .
the marawi siege raised alarms that southern philippines is fast becoming an asian hub for the ultra-radical group .
