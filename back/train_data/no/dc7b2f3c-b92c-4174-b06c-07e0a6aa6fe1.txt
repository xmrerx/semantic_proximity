( reuters ) - lockheed martin corp is expected to receive pentagon approval on thursday to begin production for 200 new heavy cargo helicopters for the u.s. marines , a defense department official said on tuesday .
the long-expected award for the ch-53k king stallion will cost $ 87 million on average each and $ 105 million including spare parts and certain service contracts , said colonel hank vanderborght , who heads the program for the pentagon .
the $ 27 billion program also includes more than $ 6 billion in research and development costs .
the new helicopter , in development by lockheed ’ s sikorsky helicopter business , can lift 36,000 pounds and would replace the ch-53e super stallion , which has operated as the backbone of field logistics for the u.s. marines since the mid-1980s .
the pentagon ’ s defense acquisition board will meet on thursday and it is expected to approve the beginning of production of the new helicopter , vanderborght told reuters .
a lockheed martin representative declined to comment .
the expected approval by the pentagon ’ s defense acquisition board would be a major milestone for the largest u.s. defense contractor .
final terms of the production deal still are being finalized , a defense department official said .
lockheed ceo marillyn hewson told reporters at the company ’ s annual media day last week that the 2015 purchase of helicopter maker sikorsky from united technologies corp for $ 9 billion helped reshape the company .
