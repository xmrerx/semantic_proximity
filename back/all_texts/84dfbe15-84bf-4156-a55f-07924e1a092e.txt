According to The Independent, people who support the regime in Syria are sharing pictures of food on social media in an attempt to taunt starving civilians trapped in a town currently being bombed in Syria.
The town of Madaya, a holdout for opposition forces, has been held under siege for six months by the Syrian government.
The famine has become so bad that locals report that there are no more cats or dogs left in the area.
The local population has even resorted to eating the leaves off from trees in an attempt to curb their hunger.
