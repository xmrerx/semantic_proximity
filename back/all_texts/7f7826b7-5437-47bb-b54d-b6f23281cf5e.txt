KAMPALA (Reuters) - Fighting erupted in Uganda s parliament for a second consecutive day on Wednesday over a plan to change the law to extend President Yoweri Museveni s rule in the east African country, a Reuters witness said.
Some lawmakers opposed to the move were also roughed up and ejected from the parliament s chambers after Speaker Rebecca Kadaga suspended them from parliament for misbehavior on Tuesday.
