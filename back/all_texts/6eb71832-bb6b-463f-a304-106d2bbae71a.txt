Nothing shows a person s character more than their willingness to be properly interviewed.
Because a proper and honest interview is going to yield proper and honest answers.
This is something New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is apparently very nervous about doing, because he just told MSNBC host Rachel Maddow, to her face, that he won t go on her show.While at a Christie event, Maddow tries to grab the governor s attention, but he responded: Rachel, you beat the crap out of me for years, you expect me to voluntarily come on your program, come on.
So she replied: Oh, come on You love the back and forth And you know that he does, because he loves to argue.
However, instead he admits he s absolutely terrified of the MSNBC host by saying: With a lot of people, maybe not with you.
He s likely terrified of her because she doesn t let him get away with any of his asshole shenanigans that he loves to regularly display.
Maddow holds him to facts and doesn t let him finagle himself away from what s being discussed.
Between his hatred for Hillary Clinton, and his fear of Rachel Maddow, it seems powerful women make him very nervous.
Good thing he ll never be president.Does he seem surprised?
He was probably surprised.
:) Watch tonight!
