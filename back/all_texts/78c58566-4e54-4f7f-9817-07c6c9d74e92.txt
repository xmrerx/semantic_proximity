After suffering the massively humiliating experience of being led on by the White House over former National Security Advisor General Michael Flynn, Vice President Mike Pence has finally broken his silence and shared his feelings over being made to look like a total idiot in front of America.On Monday in Brussels, Pence spoke alongside the NATO Security General, where he was asked the one question he probably didn t want to answer.
The Associated Press Ken Thomas flat-out asked Pence if he felt misled by the Trump administration over Flynn s communications with Russia, particularly after Pence viciously defended Flynn in January.
Thomas asked: Do you feel like your were misled by members of the Trump administration or were you frustrated that you were left out of the loop on this situation, and what assurances have you received from President Trump that something like this will not happen again?
He may be spending a lot of time with Trump, but Pence has not yet learned how to distract, lie, and bullsh*t his way out of answering questions like his boss yet.
Pence gave a measured, careful response, but ultimately revealed that he had been let down.
The former governor of Indiana said: Let me say I m very grateful for the close working relationship I have with the President of the United States and I would tell you that I was disappointed to learn that the facts that have been conveyed to me by General Flynn were inaccurate.
Pence also addressed Flynn s resignation, where he gave another cautious response: We honor General Flynn s long service to the United States of America, and I fully support the president s decision to ask for his resignation I have great confidence in the national security team of this administration moving forward.
