another stunning , arrogant slam against hillary supporters by the hillary campaign a clinton campaign email released as part of the wikileaks data dump earlier today talks about the need to maintain political power by producing an unaware and compliant citizenry .the email was sent to hillary clinton s campaign chairman john podesta by former clinton administration official bill ivy on march 13 , 2016.ivy was appointed chairman of the national endowment for the arts during bill clinton s second term .
according to his bio , ivy is a trustee of the center for american progress ( a clinton campaign front ) , and was a team leader in the barack obama presidential transition .
in the email , ivy outlines the panic amongst some democrats that donald trump s celebrity politics persona can not be matched by hillary , who is not an entertainer , and not a celebrity in the trump , kardashian mold .
money isn t all that important if you can conflate entertainment with the electoral process .
trump masters tv , tv so-called news picks up and repeats and repeats to death this opinionated blowhard and his hairbrained ideas , free-floating discontent attaches to a seeming strongman and we re off and running , complains ivy.ivy wonders how clinton can combat trump s larger than life appeal , worrying that simply defaulting to policy won t work .
and as i ve mentioned , we ve all been quite content to demean government , drop civics and in general conspire to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry , he writes .
the unawareness remains strong but compliance is obviously fading rapidly .
this problem demands some serious , serious thinking and not just poll driven , demographically-inspired messaging .
to emphasize , ivy admits that the left has conspired to produce an unaware and compliant citizenry but that they re not as easy to manipulate anymore and that this is a problem .
he characterizes unawareness amongst the public as a positive thing for the clinton campaign.ivy ends the email by saying he will attend a clinton fundraiser and that he fears , we are all now trying to navigate a set of forces that can not be simply explained or fully understood .
