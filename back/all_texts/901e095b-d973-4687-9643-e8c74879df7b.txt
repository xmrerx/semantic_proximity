Paul Goodloe was covering Hurricane Harvey for The Weather Channel when he spotted a downed American flag.
What he did next was fantastic!
Not only did he pull the flag out of the water but he folded the flag properly Moment @weatherchannel reporter retrieved fallen American flag during Harvey pic.twitter.com/0l7f7VfLjg Breaking911 Nature (@B911Nature) August 27, 2017 Showing respect for our flag is so refreshing since way too many people have been burning it lately.
HOW TO FOLD AN AMERICAN FLAG:Fold the lower half of the stripe section lengthwise over the field of stars, holding the bottom and top edges securely.
Fold the flag again lengthwise with the blue field on the outside.
Make a triangular fold by bringing the striped corner of the folded edge to meet the open (top) edge of the flag.
