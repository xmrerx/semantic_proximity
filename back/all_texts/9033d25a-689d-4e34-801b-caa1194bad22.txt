SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Deputy Prime Minister Barnaby Joyce said on Friday he respected a High Court verdict that ruled he was ineligible to sit in parliament because he held dual citizenship, a decision that cost the government it s one-seat majority.
I respect the verdict of the court, Joyce told reporters in the rural New South Wales town of Tamworth.
It s a pretty simple story, we re off to a by-election.
