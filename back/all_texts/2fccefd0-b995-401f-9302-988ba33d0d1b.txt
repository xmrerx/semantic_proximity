Good news, everyone!
Michelle Obama s former assistant, Kristen Jarvis, is getting married to one of the President s former Secret Service agents.
While the President himself will not be attending, Michelle Obama is expected to make an appearance and Malia and Sasha Obama are even going to be bridesmaids!
It s sure to be a beautiful wedding and everyone involved is sure to have fun but of course conservatives have to sh*t all over everything beautiful.When TMZ reported the story, some of Trump s deplorables jumped right out of their basket to let the world know why Hillary Clinton was justified in calling them that to begin with.This fine person really wants the White House to be white again.
Welfare Mammy probably not a real name thinks the Obama family are a bunch of n-words.
President Trump (we re trying to figure out which candidate he supports) is just an outright racist.
Max agrees with Mr. President s primate theory.
Freedom is very passionate about this issue, even postulating that the Obamas are all f*cking each other.
The rest are just deplorable.
The Right jumps on the Obama girls every chance they get including when Malia graduated high school and again when she was accepted to Harvard, and when the girls hang out with their friends they even wished rape on Sasha Obama when she turned 15 years old.All of these people will be voting in November.
Make sure you are out there doing the same.
The last thing we need is 4-8 years of normalizing this behavior.Featured image via Pinterest/screengrab
