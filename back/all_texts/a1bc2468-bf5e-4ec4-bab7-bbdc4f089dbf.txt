Iowa Rep. Steve King (R-Of Course) is currently under fire for tweeting out something that would only be said by a white supremacist that we can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies.
While King s message earned ALLCAPS praise from former KKK leader David Duke, the rest of us are left wondering why Iowans would want this alleged man to represent their state.On Monday, King stopped by CNN to attempt to explain away his hateful tweet, and it didn t go well for him at all.
Well, of course I meant exactly what I said, King told CNN s New Day as he blamed the Left for wanting to destroy Western civilization : This is an effort on the left, I think, to break down the American civilization, the American culture, and turn it into something entirely different.
I m a champion for western civilization and yes our English language is a big part of it.
It s a carrier of freedom.
Embarrassingly, King refused to say that Muslim-Americans, Christian-Americans, and other Americans of different background are equal, instead saying that they contribute differently to our culture and our civilization.
I d say they re all created in the image of God, and they re equal in his eyes.
And if they re citizens of the United States, they re equal in the eyes of the law, King said.
Individuals will contribute differently not equally to this civilization and certain groups of people will contribute more to this society than other groups of people will, that s just a statistical fact.
King says he is promoting the birth rate in America to restore the rule of law to what he views as a superior civilization.
In short, he thinks white people need to have more babies.Watch the video below:Rep. Steve King defends his controversial tweet: "I'm a champion for Western civilization" https://t.co/9WJa7A89nH https://t.co/nZbCzzOMLz CNN (@CNN) March 13, 2017Featured image via screengrab
