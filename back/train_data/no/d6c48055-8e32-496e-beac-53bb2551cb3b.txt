berlin ( reuters ) - a senior member of germany s pro-business free democrats ( fdp ) , a potential coalition partner for chancellor angela merkel , generally welcomed french president emmanuel macron s european union speech but criticized his proposal to create a joint euro zone budget .
this was a courageous speech by president macron , even if not all of his proposals meet approval of the fdp , said alexander graf lambsdorff , fdp leader in the eu legislature .
while lambsdorff welcomed macron s call to strengthen military cooperation in the eu and seize the opportunities of digitization , he rejected the idea of a join euro zone budget .
the problem in europe is not a lack of public funds , but the lack of reform .
a euro zone budget would set exactly the wrong incentives , he said .
