cairo ( reuters ) - egypt summoned several western ambassadors on sunday in protest against a statement criticizing the country s detention of a human rights lawyer who was helping investigate the case of a murdered italian student .
germany , italy , the netherlands , britain and canada issued a statement late on friday critical of the detention of ibrahim metwaly , who was helping investigate the murder of giulio regeni .
the phd student s body was discovered in a ditch on the outskirts of the egyptian capital in 2016 showing signs of extensive torture .
an egyptian foreign ministry statement said the german , dutch and italian ambassadors had been summoned and that procedures to summon the british and canadian ambassadors were ongoing .
the ministry said the criticism from the five western countries was a blatant and unacceptable interference in domestic affairs and the work of the judiciary .
it is unfortunate that such a statement would be issued from countries that call for respecting rule of law and the principles of separation of powers , it said .
metwaly founded the association of the families of the disappeared after his son disappeared four years ago .
he was taken by airport security in september while heading to geneva to attend a u.n. conference on enforced disappearances , members of his group said .
they later said a state prosecutor had ordered his detention .
judicial sources told reuters on saturday that metwaly was detained on charges of spreading false news and joining an illegal group , and that his pre-trial detention was in accordance with the law .
rights activists say egyptian authorities kidnap dissent and keep them in secret jails without charges .
egypt denies the accusations .
