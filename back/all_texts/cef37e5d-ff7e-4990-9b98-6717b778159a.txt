Bill O Reilly reacted to the approximate $500,000 (currently up to over $560K) that has been raised for the Talladega College Marching Tornadoes band s trip to participate in the Inauguration Day ceremony for President-elect Donald Trump in Washington.In his Talking Points Memo, he said that much of the money raised for the historically black college was bankrolled by people that mainstream entities often demonize as racist .
Generalizing about any group is foolish and dishonest, O Reilly said, calling the impromptu fundraiser a repudiation of race-baiters.
O Reilly recalled how college president Dr. Billy Hawkins appearance last week on the O Reilly Factor was not intended as a fundraising announcement, but that subsequent guest Omarosa Manigault mentioned the GoFundMe account.Hawkins has since received threats and derogatory comments for standing firm on sending his students to the District of Columbia.Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer added that the nationwide response to the appeal by Talladega is what Martin Luther King Jr. Day, and Inauguration Day, is all about.
FOXThe haters came out on social media and made outrageous statements like the one below:The sons of two deceased Talladega graduates posted on Facebook that they are returning their parents diplomas in opposition to the school s decision to march.
Both of our parents have passed away since receiving this cherished recognition from the College.
But we have no doubt that they would be angered and deeply disappointed if they knew of the plans for Talladega College to pay tribute to Donald Trump by participating in his inaugural, Peter, David and Steven Rasmussen wrote.
Mr. Trump has demonstrated in innumerable ways, during the electoral campaign and his time as president-elect, that he is the antithesis of all they worked and stood for and of the values they nurtured in their students.
