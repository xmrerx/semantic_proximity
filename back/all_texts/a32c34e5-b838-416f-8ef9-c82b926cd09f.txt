Trump s desperation to convince people that the Great Liberal Media Conspiracy Against Him is real is getting way out of control.
On Twitter earlier, he cried that nobody was asking about the media s totally biased coverage of Hillary during the election.
He also claimed at a rally a while back that the press was turning their cameras off during his speech because they didn t want their audiences to hear what he had to say.
CNN made him look stupid for that.
Then tonight, in Alabama, he did it again, and CNN made him look even worse for it.He said, Fake news.
They won t show this, referring to his obsession with his crowd sizes.
He then went on to say: They ll say Donald Trump spoke before a small crowd in Alabama last night.
It was a small crowd.
A very unenthusiastic crowd.
It was a terrible evening.
CNN had split the screen between him and his crowd before he started this diatribe.
Seriously he said this while CNN was showing his crowd.
Watch below:Trump says the fake news media won t show the crowd at his rally while CNN is literally running a split screen of the crowd.

Give it up, Donnie.
