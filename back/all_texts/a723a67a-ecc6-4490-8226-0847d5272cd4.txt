LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May is not considering resigning, Sky news reported on Thursday, citing her Downing Street office.
Downing Street: Resignation is not an issue, Sky said on its screen.
A spokesman for PM May did not comment on the report.
A spokesman for the Conservative Party did not comment.
May s bid to reassert her dwindling authority was ruined on Wednesday when her keynote speech was interrupted by repeated coughing fits, a prankster, and even letters of her slogan falling off the set behind her.
