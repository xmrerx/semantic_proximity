algiers ( reuters ) - algeria s ruling parties retained their majority in local elections , taking more than 50 percent of the vote , the interior minister said on friday .
turnout in thursday s vote reached 46.83 percent , slightly up on 42.92 percent in 2012 , the minister noureddine bedoui told reporters .
participation is closely watched by officials as they attempt to reverse a trend of increasing political apathy .
more than half of algeria s population are under 30 and many feel disconnected from the ageing elite which runs the country .
the elections come amid continuing questions over the health of president abdelaziz bouteflika , who has been in power since 1999 and has made only rare appearances since suffering a stroke in 2013 .
in thursday s election the two ruling parties , the national liberation front ( fln ) and the national rally for democracy ( rnd ) , got 30.56 percent and 23.21 percent respectively , bedoui said .
the rnd , which is led by prime minster ahmed ouyahia and which made gains also in parliamentary elections in may , boosted its number of seats to 463 , from less than 250 in 2012 .
the fln s share of seats was slightly lower than five years ago .
a total of 1,541 seats were being contested .
islamists including the movement for society and peace ( msp ) and a coalition of three smaller parties lost ground , taking only 57 seats between them .
bouteflika is credited by many for bringing opec member algeria out of a 1990s conflict with islamist militants and for overseeing a period of high oil prices and vast public spending .
but the government has recently been attempting to reduce spending to cope with a sharp fall in oil revenues since 2014 .
