Outspoken conservative CJ Pearson hasn t heard from the White House and doesn t expect to receive an invitation A teacher at Columbia Middle School in Evans, Georgia allegedly told his students that outspoken 13-year-old black conservative CJ Pearson was not worth saving in a fire, and that he hated him.
This is just the latest example of how liberals seem to believe that hate speech is acceptable so long as it s directed at those on the right and especially minority conservatives.Via Paul Joseph Watson at Infowars:Pearson previously made headlines after his Twitter account was blocked by President Obama s official Twitter account following a video in which Pearson criticized Obama over his response to the Clock Kid controversy.
White House officials also made fun of the teenager.Pearson was told by several other students in his class that teacher Michael Garrison said CJ is not worth saving in a fire and that he hates him.
The teacher also accused Pearson of cheating on a vocabulary test when he was in sixth grade, a claim that Pearson denies.
It s always great having a teacher that s not only a liberal bully, but someone who engages in slander, Pearson told BizPac Review.
My words are bold and I don t expect everyone to agree.
But to have a teacher say this about me?
Completely inexcusable.
School principal Eli Putnam has promised a full investigation into the matter.
Pearson accuses the teacher of violating the school s bullying policy.
