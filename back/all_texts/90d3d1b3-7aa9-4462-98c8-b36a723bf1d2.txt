Things started to fall apart faster than ever just hours before Donald Trump would face off against Hillary Clinton in the final presidential debate.As everyone geared up and prepared for one of the most monumental moments of this election cycle, Ivanka Trump was stuck trying to defend her father s ridiculous whiney complaints at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit this afternoon.
While the event was certainly not focused on Trump, he would undoubtedly come up in conversation, as America has never had a candidate that hates and disrespects women to the degree that Trump has.However, it seems that even Ivanka may be fed up with defending her father s outrageous acts and comments.
When Ivanka was questioned about her father s insistence that this election has been rigged against him, Ivanka refused to back up his claims and instead tried to pivot the conversation away from The Donald s voter fraud conspiracy.
Instead, Trump s favorite (and most lusted after) daughter avoided the question and said: I will tell you that the media has been vicious.
Ivanka then went into a cringe-worthy rant about how the media s reports weren t fair and fact-checked and that Trump s campaign has been held to a different level than what is normally allowed (did she mean a much lower level?
).As her embarrassing response dragged on, Ivanka also tried to insist that somehow her father s campaign hasn t permanently ruined the Trump brand, which is pretty preposterous.
While Trump may have attracted racists, misogynists and white power advocates, the majority of America is appalled by Trump and his views and this will undoubtedly be reflected in the future of Trump s businesses.

Trump has destroyed everything his family built during this election, and we won t be surprised if they also abandon him along with the majority of Americans in November.Featured image via Joe Scarnici / Getty Images
