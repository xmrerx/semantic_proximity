washington ( reuters ) - virginia officials started recounts on wednesday in the first of four state house of delegates races , a process that could lead to a democratic takeover of the chamber after the party ’ s historic election gains last month .
republicans have a narrow 51-49 majority in the house after democrats erased a two-to-one advantage in november , part of the party ’ s first big wave of victories since republican donald trump won the white house last year .
four of the legislative races were close enough to lead to recounts .
if democrats gain one seat in the house , the chamber would be tied 50-50 with no tiebreaking mechanism .
governor-elect ralph northam is a democrat , and republicans hold a 21-19 edge in the state senate .
the first recount was scheduled for wednesday and thursday in suburban washington ’ s district 58 , where republican incumbent tim hugo narrowly won re-election by 106 votes over democrat donte tanner .
others are planned for next week , including one where the republican leads by only 10 votes .
in a recount set for dec. 21 in northern virginia ’ s district 28 , democrat joshua cole trails republican robert thomas by 82 votes .
the state elections board has said at least 147 voters were assigned to the wrong district , and voters have filed a federal lawsuit to hold a new election .
andrea gaines , a state elections spokeswoman , said in an email that she had no information on when results for the recounts would be announced .
