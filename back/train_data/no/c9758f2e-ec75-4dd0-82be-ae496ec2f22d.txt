dubai ( reuters ) - saudi arabian banks have frozen more than 1,200 accounts belonging to individuals and companies in the kingdom as part of the government s anti-corruption purge , bankers and lawyers said on tuesday .
they added that the number is continuing to rise .
dozens of royal family members , officials and business executives have been detained in the crackdown and are facing allegations of money laundering , bribery , extorting officials and taking advantage of public office for personal gain .
since sunday , the central bank has been expanding the list of accounts it is requiring lenders to freeze on an almost hourly basis , one regional banker said , declining to be named because he was not authorized to speak to media .
the banker did not name the companies affected but said they included listed and unlisted firms across many sectors .
he added that if the freezes stayed in place for long , they could start to hurt day-to-day business activities such as paying staff and creditors or making other transactions .
a second banker said , however , that most of the frozen accounts belonged to individuals rather than companies , and that banks were being allowed by the regulator to continue to fund existing commitments .
a central bank spokesman was not available to comment .
among top business executives detained in the probe are billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal , chairman of investment firm kingdom holding 4280.se ; nasser bin aqeel al-tayyar , founder of al tayyar travel 1810.se ; and amr al-dabbagh , chairman of builder red sea international 4230.se .
the stocks of all three companies , which have issued statements saying they continue to operate as normal , plunged between 9 and 10 percent on tuesday .
one of the bankers speaking to reuters said the central bank had met with some foreign banks this week to reassure them that the freezing of accounts targeted individuals , and that firms linked to those people would not be damaged .
