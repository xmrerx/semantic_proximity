last week the commerce department released its third revision for fourth-quarter 2016 gross domestic product .
the number came in at a paltry 2.1 percent , meaning that growth during president obama s final year in office the end of an error of hope landed with a big thud at just 1.6 percent.that low-water mark puts the obama presidency in last place among all the post-world war ii presidents when it comes to economic growth.there have been 13 post-wwii presidents , beginning with harry truman , who had the disadvantage of beginning in the aftermath of war in 1946 , during which the economy contracted 11.6 percent four times the contraction any other negative year since and even he bested obama s economic record ! truman , a moderate democrat , also posted the two best years of growth on record : 1950 at 8.7 percent and 1951 at 8 percent , and there was no zero percent interest rate to gin up the economy back then.thirteenth of 13 presidents is no mild distinction .
obama had eight full years to enact a growth policy , while many of his predecessors never had two complete terms .
george h.w .
bush and jimmy carter had just four years each , gerald ford had less than three years and richard nixon had five.i m not the least bit surprised the obama economy was a failure .
