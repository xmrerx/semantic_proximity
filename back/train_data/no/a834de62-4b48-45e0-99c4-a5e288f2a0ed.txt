rome ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump s policies in the gulf are dangerous and misguided , iran s foreign minister said on thursday , adding that pressure from washington had only succeeded in strengthening tehran s resolve .
speaking at a conference in rome , foreign minister mohammad javad zarif criticized trump for seeking to renegotiate a 2015 deal aimed at curbing iran s nuclear program .
he also questioned the u.s. response to a crisis between qatar and its neighbors .
we have problems with the policies that are coming from washington and i believe those policies are extremely dangerous , impulsive , not grounded in reality , zarif said .
generally a revision , or a reorientation , or a cognitive adjustment to our region is highly necessary in washington .
he said trump did not understand the nature of the nuclear accord and was trying to dissuade foreign investors from doing business in iran .
in spite of the arm twisting , more and more european companies have been coming in , he said .
zarif led iran s negotiating team for the nuclear deal and faced criticism from hardliners at home over the terms of the accord .
he said this dissent had faded over the past year .
the united states pressure has in fact created more solidarity inside iran .
i am being attacked much less in iran today than i was before trump was elected .
so i thank him for that , zarif said .
trump said in october he would not certify that tehran was complying with the 2015 deal and warned he might ultimately terminate it , accusing iran of not living up to the spirit of the accord .
other signatories of the agreement britain , france , germany , russia , china and the european union have said they believe iran is living up to its commitments .
