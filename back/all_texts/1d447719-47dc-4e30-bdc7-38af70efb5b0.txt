Donald Trump topped off his disastrous press conference on Thursday by calling the press the enemy of the American people on Friday, and is thankfully getting all the criticism and backlash he deserves.One of Trump s harshest and most outspoken critics, author J.K. Rowling, slammed Trump s comments about the press without even using any of her own words.
Brilliantly quoting former President Theodore Roosevelt, Rowling tweeted to educate Trump on just how the free press worked, in case dictator Trump and the GOP forgot.
In the tweet, Rowling pointed out that Roosevelt had written: To announce that there must be no criticism of the President, or that we are to stand by the President right or wrong is morally treasonable to the American public.
Rowling even used the trending #NotTheEnemy hashtag to show her support for the press.
Check out the full tweet below:Exactly.
The free press is protected by the U.S. Constitution, a document that Trump desperately needs to read before he does or says something else that will make him look foolish.
In his attacks on the media, it s clear that Trump wants unquestioned, unchecked and unlimited power and doesn t care if it interferes with the very values that this country was built on.
Trump wants to operate as if his word is law and that his alternative facts are the only truth Americans should be digesting without a second thought.Trump seems to be oblivious to the real responsibilities of the job he signed up for, as well as the fact the he actually works for the American people not the other way around.
What Rowling did perfectly put Trump in his place and reminded the undeserving POTUS just exactly how a democracy is supposed to work.Featured image via Ben A. Pruchnie and Mario Tama / Getty Images
