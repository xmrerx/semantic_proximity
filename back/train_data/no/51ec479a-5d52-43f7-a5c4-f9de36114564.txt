he s being nominated to sit in garland s seat , sharpton said .
president barack obama nominated judge garland , who has got as much or more qualifications as this nominee , to have been the supreme court judge they stalled , they filibustered , they would not even give a hearing to judge garland .
it is time for the democrats now to say since you changed the rules , you re going to have to live by the rules that you applied to president obama s nominee , and we are not going to allow you to change it , and we will use those rules to block this nominee , judge gorsuch .
