moscow ( reuters ) - russian deputy prime minister dmitry rogozin said on wednesday the failed launch of a 2.6 billion-rouble ( $ 44.95 million ) satellite last month was due to an embarrassing programming error .
russian space agency roscosmos said last month it had lost contact with the newly-launched weather satellite - the meteor-m - after it blasted off from russia s new vostochny cosmodrome in the far east .
eighteen smaller satellites belonging to scientific , research and commercial companies from russia , norway , sweden , the united states , japan , canada and germany , were on board the same rocket .
speaking to rossiya 24 state tv channel , rogozin said the failure had been caused by human error .
the rocket carrying the satellites had been programmed with the wrong coordinates , he said , saying it had been given bearings for take-off from a different cosmodrome - baikonur - which moscow leases from kazakhstan .
the rocket was really programmed as if it was taking off from baikonur , said rogozin .
they didn t get the coordinates right .
the vostochny spaceport , laid out in the thick taiga forest of the amur region , is the first civilian rocket launch site in russia .
in april last year , after delays and massive costs overruns , russia launched its first rocket from vostochny , a day after a technical glitch forced an embarrassing postponement of the event in the presence of president vladimir putin .
