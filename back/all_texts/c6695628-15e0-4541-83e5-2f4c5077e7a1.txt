President Trump called Obama s agreement with Australia to bring in economic parasites disguised as refugees to the US a bad deal and a dumb deal .
President Obama made this deal right before leaving office dumping it into the lap of the incoming administration.
Trump was unhappy about this dumb deal but reluctantly decided to send US officials to vet the refugees:US Officials just abruptly halted screening and left the offshore detention centre on Friday.
Is this a sign that this bad deal is upside down and will not go forward?
We certainly hope so!AUSTRALIA, Christmas Island: Here are some of the so-called asylum seekers from the hordes of Muslims who have been washing up on the shores of Australia and demanding asylum, even though most are not political refugees, but economic parasites.
Do these Iranian illegals look like they are starving to you?
THIS WAS A SETUP BY OBAMA THE US HAS NO BUSINESS TAKING ECONOMIC PARASITES FROM IRAN!THE LATEST ON THESE ECONOMIC PARASITES:Reuters Reports:US officials interviewing refugees held in an Australian-run offshore detention centre have left the facility abruptly, throwing further doubt over a plan to resettle many of the detainees in America.US officials halted screening interviews and departed the Pacific island of Nauru on Friday, two weeks short of their scheduled timetable and a day after Washington said the United States had reached its annual refugee intake cap.
US officials were scheduled to be on Nauru until July 26 but they left on Friday, one refugee told Reuters, requesting anonymity as he did not want to jeopardise his application for US resettlement.In the United States, a senior member of the union that represents refugee officers at US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), a Department of Homeland Security agency, told Reuters his own trip to Nauru was not going forward as scheduled.Jason Marks, chief steward of the American Federation of Government Employees Local 1924, told Reuters his trip has now been pushed back and it was unclear whether it will actually happen.The Australian Immigration Department declined to comment on the whereabouts of the US officials or the future of a refugee swap agreement between Australia and the United States, which President Donald Trump earlier this year branded a dumb deal .An indefinite postponement of the deal would have significant repercussions for Australia s pledge to close a second detention centre on Papua New Guinea s Manus island on October 31.Only 70 refugees, less than 10 per cent of the total detainees held in the camp, have completed US processing.
The US deal looks more and more doubtful, Ian Rintoul from the Refugee Action Coalition said.Former US President Obama agreed a deal with Australia late last year to offer refuge to up to 1250 asylum seekers.The Trump administration said it would only honour the deal to maintain a strong relationship with Australia, and then only on condition that refugees satisfied strict checks.In exchange, Australia has pledged to take Central American refugees from a centre in Costa Rica, where the United States has taken in a larger number of people in recent years.The US government confirmed on Thursday that its refugee intake cap of 50,000 people had been reached with the new intake year not due to begin until October 1.The majority of the detainees interviewed on both Manus and Nauru by US officials in April are from Sudan, Somalia and Afghanistan.Australia has already offered detainees up to $25,000 to voluntarily return to their home countries, an offer few have taken up.
