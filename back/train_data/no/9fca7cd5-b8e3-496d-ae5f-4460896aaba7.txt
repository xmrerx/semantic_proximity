vatican city ( reuters ) - tens of thousands of people , many of them children , serenaded pope francis on his 81st birthday on sunday , as the pontiff appealed for the release of catholic nuns kidnapped last month in nigeria .
the crowd sang happy birthday in italian as the pontiff appeared at the window of the apostolic palace overlooking st. peter s square for his weekly message and blessing .
the first latin american pope was born jorge mario bergoglio on dec. 17 , 1936 in buenos aires .
the former cardinal of the argentine capital became leader of the world s 1.2 billion roman catholics in 2013 .
in keeping with a long-standing tradition in rome , the children faced the pope s window and held up small statues of the baby jesus for him to bless .
the statues are placed in home nativity scenes , a custom still practised in many italian families .
francis , who has often warned against excessive materialism during the holiday season , departed from his address to say : this is the real christmas .
if we remove jesus , what is left ?
an empty feast .
he appealed for the release of six roman catholic nuns kidnapped from their convent in the town of iguoriakhi , nigeria , last month .
francis said he hoped they and all other victims of kidnappings could be home for christmas .
