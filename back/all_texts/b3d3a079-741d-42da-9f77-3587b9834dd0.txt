WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Congressional Budget Office expects to release its analysis of the U.S. House of Representatives’ healthcare overhaul legislation on May 24, the agency said in a statement on Friday.
The Republican-led House passed its bill earlier this month without a final CBO analysis, or “score,” on how the measure would impact the U.S. budget or affect health insurance coverage.
