A retired general has had enough of Donald Trump denigrating the men and women of the U.S. military currently engaged in the fight against ISIS and other terrorist elements.
In an appearance on CNN, retired Army Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling blasted Trump for his recent claim that simply asking generals to come up with a plan to defeat ISIS would lead to the terrorist group s end in a neat and tidy thirty-day period.The former commanding general decried Trump, calling his orders simplistic and insulting to individuals working to defeat ISIS.
It shows a complete lack of understanding of the threat and the ways to fight it, Hertling said.
It s a sophomoric approach to elements of national security policy because if he s just calling in the military, he s missing the point that there are several other elements of national security that will help defeat ISIS.
Trump has been all over the map on ISIS, as he has been on hundreds of other issues.
The former reality TV star has claimed that ISIS is on the march (it is in retreat) and that he has a plan to defeat ISIS (which he is keeping secret).
Trump has also claimed that he knows more than all the generals on how to win the war on terrorism.In reality, Trump s reckless comments have proven to be the right kind of material for ISIS leaders attempting to recruit new members.
Compared to the measured tones offered by President Obama and Secretary Hillary Clinton, Trump s rhetoric attacking Islam often sounds like the clash of civilizations the radical Muslim world wants so badly.Daily, American military assets are fighting against ISIS elements, most notably American fighter jets that have been bombing ISIS targets in multiple countries for years now, in addition to work via intelligence agencies with governments fighting the ISIS threat.
To minimize their work as Trump does is a clear insult.Featured image via screen capture
