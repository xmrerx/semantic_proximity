kigali ( reuters ) - the u.n. subcommittee on torture prevention has suspended a visit to rwanda , citing obstructions imposed by the government that compromised its fact-finding mission .
rwandan authorities barred the u.n. delegation from accessing some detention sites and made it impossible for them to conduct private and confidential interviews , a statement from the u.n. body published on friday said .
the body said it was only the third time in 10 years it had suspended a mission .
it called on rwanda to cooperate with the body and abide by its international obligations .
the incident further mars the human rights record of the government led by president paul kagame , which faces mounting criticism for what human rights groups say are widespread abuses , a muzzling of independent media , and suppression of political opposition .
the u.n. body said the people the group interviewed before suspending its seven-day mission said they feared reprisals .
we must not place the persons that have cooperated with us in danger , it said .
the rwandan authorities were not immediately available for a comment , but it has denied accusations of unlawful detention and torture documented most recently by human rights watch in a report published this month .
the report said the government routinely tortured detainees with beatings , asphyxiations , mock executions and electric shocks .
a prominent critic of rwandan president who was barred from running for presidency , diane shima rwigara , was detained in kigali in september and faces charges of forgery of electoral documents and inciting insurrection .
she said in court last week said that her family and supporters were subjected to torture .
judges have said they will rule on her bail request on monday .
