Likely the last thing you d ever want to envision is Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz with adult toys, or doing things to himself, but hey, this is America, and hypocrites need to be called out.As Mother Jones just reminded us, Ted Cruz defended a ban on adult toys.
In fact, he helped defend a law criminalizing the sale said toys.
You see, Texas, the state where the senator is from (besides Canada), has a law that outlaws these obscene devices.
Ted Cruz found it un-American to self-stimulate yourself with such a thing, and according to The Week: Cruz s office defended the obscenity law by saying that any alleged right associated with obscene devices is not deeply rooted in the Nation s history and traditions.
I m sure this is what the Founders of our nation were thinking about when declaring war on England, and writing up the Constitution.
Jefferson was probably all like, oh, yes, we mustn t forget the devices used for self-pleasure.
They must be strictly prohibited.
Probably not.Anyway, all of that aside, enter Craig Mazin, Ted Cruz s freshman roommate at Princeton.
He just took to Twitter with likely the best burn ever to be written calling out the Texas junior senator s hypocrisy.
He wrote:Ted Cruz thinks people don't have a right to "stimulate their genitals."
I was his college roommate.
This would be a new belief of his.
Craig Mazin (@clmazin) April 13, 2016Now that you ve picked yourself up off the floor after laughing incredibly hard, you ll now have that image in your head for the rest of your day.
BUT knowing Ted Cruz was just utterly humiliated in such a pretty amazing way may make it all worth it.Featured Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images Twitter
