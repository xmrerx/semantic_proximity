protesters were out in large numbers on michigan avenue today calling for the resignations of mayor rahm emanuel and the state s attorney .
chicago mayor rahm emanuel spoke publicly earlier in the day and apologized for the handling of the laquan mcdonald investigation .
protesters shut down michigan avenue to hurt the city in the pocketbook .
idiotic !
they were chanting , no justice , no profit !
because they want to hurt the retail stores in the downtown area too .
they moved into the division and state street area but were being blocked from the gold coast area which is the upscale area of town .
when some of the protesters broke into an alley at north ave. they were turned back .
please listen to this video ( if your ears can stand it ) and see if you hear someone screaming , allah akbar !
