WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will visit Poland ahead of next month’s G20 summit in Germany, the White House said in a statement on Friday.
The visit will emphasize the “priority of strengthening NATO’s collective defense,” and Trump will also attend the Three Seas Initiative Summit to “demonstrate our strong ties to Central Europe,” the statement said.
Leaders from several central, eastern and southern European countries are to meet in the city of Wroclaw in western Poland for the so-called Three Seas Initiative summit on July 6-7.
