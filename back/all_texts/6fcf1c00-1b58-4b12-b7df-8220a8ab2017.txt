Poor GOPers looking forward to participating in conversations about the Republican National Convention are going to be disappointed that their only option is to live stream and watch.
Thanks to Donald Trump s supporters, the RNC was forced to close its live chat when the conversation became bombarded with hateful anti-Semitic messages.This hatefest happened when former Hawaii Gov.
Linda Lingle took the stage to talk about the inroads the GOP has created with Jewish voters and to criticize the Democratic party for its supposed hostility toward Israel.
It didn t take long for Trump s moronic followers to take things a step further and bombard the chat with disrespectful phrases such as Press H for Hitler , JOOS, BAN JEWS , OY GEVALT, and KIKE .
There were also a few N-bombs dropped in the chat before it was shut down.Here are some screenshots that show what was being said online before the chat was closed down:RNCRNCRNCRNCAs shown in the screenshots, the Star of David made many appearances, as did references to Adolf Hitler.Clearly, Trump s supporters are only following in their beloved presidential candidate s footsteps, as it wasn t too long ago that Trump landed himself in hot water for tweeting an anti-Hillary Clinton meme that included the Star of David.
Even while he was being accused of anti-Semitism, Trump expressed disappointment that his social media manager had chosen to take the tweet down and replace it with something less offensive.Things like this can only be expected as Trump continues to run his convention this week.
His fans are known racists, white supremacists and misogynists, so I m sure we re going to see much more of these hateful messages in the near future.
If the RNC was trying to get people to take it seriously this election, they seriously underestimated the stupidity of Trump and his supporters.Featured image via screen capture
