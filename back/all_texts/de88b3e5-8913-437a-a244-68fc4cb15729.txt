Each year, the People For the American Way s Equine Posterior Achievement Award is granted to public figures who drag America to a new low of right-wing extremism.
For several years now, Ted Cruz has been honored with the top spot.
But this year, the prize has been handed to Donald Trump.It s official Donald, you are the biggest horse s a$$ in America according to the adjudication panel of People for the American Way.Will Trump be as quick to crow about this victory as he was when he was crowned Man of the Year by WorldNetDaily?
It didn t seem to bother him that the site is conspiracy theory central, and as Right Wing Watch points out, is convinced that Obama is about to throw every man, woman and child in America into a FEMA camp.Trump worked hard for this honor though.
He labeled all latin American immigrants as drug dealers and rapists, he called for Muslims to be banned from entering the U.S. (even Muslim Americans returning from holiday), he lied that thousands and thousands of Muslims in America cheered while 9/11 was happening, and failed to retract or apologize when he was busted for it.
Instead he chose to stand up at his next rally and physically mock the disabled reporter who had exposed his lie.
On top of this, he spends the majority of time hate-tweeting any journalist or media outlet that dare refuse to kiss his trust fund tycoon posterior.This level of commitment to running for President as a bigoted man child needs to be honored somehow, and thankfully, People For The American Way solved the problem for us.
Sadly, it does mean that Ted Cruz winning streak is over.
He will clearly have to work harder to win back the accolade next year.
His brand of evangelical, homophobic, anti-choice, anti-science, pro-gun BS might well appall any rational human being but there s a new bigot in town.Featured Image via Flickr/Flickr
