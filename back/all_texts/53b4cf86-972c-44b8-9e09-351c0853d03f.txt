In the world according to presumed Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, women apparently have it better than men.
Who knew?Trump told his band of merry morons: All of the men, we re petrified to speak to women any more the women get it better than we do, folks.
They get it better than we do.
If by get it he means understand then maybe he s on to something, but if he meant it in terms of have it better off in life, well, then he s absolutely just full of shit.Women earn, on average, only 79% of what men make.
This isn t due to men s greater ability, or being smarter, or having more training.
It s based upon the fact that they have an extra appendage between their legs that women don t have.
And the pay gap is even worse among women of color.
Not to mention the fact that many women are treated with far less respect in the work place.
Often times their opinions are treated as hostile or bossy compared to a man s assertiveness and drive to succeed.
Trump is a bully, and he thinks that he can belittle women by saying how much they have it better than men.
He says this because he gets in trouble for belittling them.
He doesn t think people should call him out on his misogynistic bullshit.
That s what he means by women get it better, because women these days are finally being heard, and he hates it.
Absolutely despises it.Honestly?
Any person who votes for Donald Trump, a man with zero policy or diplomacy experience, is an idiot, but women who vote for Trump?
Seriously?
Have a little more respect for yourself than that.Watch Trump s remark here: All of the men, we re petrified to speak to women any more the women get it better than we do, folks.
