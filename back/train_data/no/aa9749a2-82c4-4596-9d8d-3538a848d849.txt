the inauguration was a beautiful day full of great images but the images of the hate coming from anti-trump protesters will shake you .
inaugural ball attendees were spat upon and had water thrown at them .
the people trying to just walk from one area to the next were assaulted .
bar patrons were even taunted with images of an isis beheading from a phone video .
sick !
is this what the democrats represent ?
anarchy and chaos rules the day for the lefty lunatics .
one woman even tried to light another woman s hair on fire dc police are now asking for anyone to id her so they can arrest her .
luckily , a man in the video was seen putting the fire out .
please watch the video below and hopefully someone will come forward :
