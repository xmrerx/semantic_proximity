On Tuesday night, Ted Cruz dropped out of the Republican race for the White House and Donald Trump was named the presumptive nominee by the Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.
However, while the RNC may be ready to embrace Trump as their chosen one GOP voters are not and they took to Twitter to express their disgust.Fox News contributor Stephen Hayes said Trump isn t going to happen for him:Under no circumstances.https://t.co/6yS3fxGsMT Stephen Hayes (@stephenfhayes) May 3, 2016Conservative Ben Howe, an editor for RedState went as far as to say he s voting for Hillary: #ImWithHer Ben Howe (@BenHowe) May 3, 2016I am no longer a Republican.
Ben Howe (@BenHowe) May 4, 2016Managing Editor at the Washington Examiner, Philip Klein declared that he is no longer a Republican: I have officially de-registered as a Republican.

Guy Benson (@guypbenson) May 3, 2016Conservative radio host and founder of RedState Erick Erickson is echoing the sentiments of other Republicans, saying, If Trump is the Republican Party nominee, I won t be a Republican.
:This is going to be a huge problem for the Republican Party in November.
These people are not just random GOP voters who don t like Donald Trump, they are very prominent, high profile voices of the party and they are so disgusted with the nominee that they are LEAVING the party.
But regular GOP voters are leaving too.I will not be a member of a party that supports sexism, racism, and hatred.
My party left me, so I m leaving it.

That means tonight sees the birth of #RepublicansForHillary Louise Mensch (@LouiseMensch) May 4, 2016That means not only is the RNC going to have to try to figure out how to woo minority voters, women voters and Independent voters, they are going to have to try to woo their OWN voters and minimize the damage their anti-Trump pundits are doing.If the GOP thought they were stomped in 2012 when they picked Mr. Binders Full of Women as their nominee, they have no clue how painful November is going to be.
Grab your popcorn, Democrats.
It s about to be quite a show.Featured image via Instagram
