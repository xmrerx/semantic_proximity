Donald Trump has not even taken office yet and Republicans are already launching a full-scale war on women s rights.Emboldened by the thought that Trump will only appoint anti-choice judges to the Supreme Court, Ohio Republicans tacked an amendment on a child abuse bill banning abortion six weeks after conception.Known as a fetal heartbeat measure, the amendment would be the most extreme anti-abortion law in the nation if Governor John Kasich signs it.Most women don t even know they are pregnant by the time six weeks passes, which means they would be forced to carry unwanted pregnancies to term.
And that includes women who are raped since the amendment did not include an exemption for rape and incest.Ohio Senate President Keith Faber said his party made the move because Donald Trump won the election.
A new president, new Supreme Court appointees change the dynamic, and there was consensus in our caucus to move forward, Faber said.If Trump is able to replace deceased Justice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme Court, not much would change from when he was alive since Scalia was anti-choice himself.
However, if Trump gets to replace a liberal like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, it could tip the scales and pave the way for a ruling that destroys Roe v. Wade, which ruled abortion constitutional by a 7-2 margin in 1973.In addition to the fetal heartbeat portion of the amendment, doctors would be imprisoned for performing an abortion after six weeks, which also flies in the face of the Supreme Court decision in Roe, which barred states from outlawing abortion until fetal viability around 22 to 24 weeks of pregnancy.Donald Trump is already a disaster for women s rights and reproductive health and he hasn t even taken office yet.
And you can bet that other red states are going to be emboldened by his election as well so we will see more fetal heartbeat bills or worse over the next four years.Featured Image: Eduardo Munoz Alvarez/Getty Images
