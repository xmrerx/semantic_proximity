clooney added , anybody who says as intolerant words as those should be laughed at and that s pretty much [ what ] i think eventually history will do .
who d have thought donald trump would be at 30 percent ?
during his june presidential announcement , trump ignited a firestorm when he said , the u.s. has become a dumping ground for everybody else s problems , and the united states has no idea what kind of people might be coming across the border .
they re sending people that have lots of problems , said trump .
they re bringing those problems with us .
they re bringing drugs .
they re bringing crime .
they re rapists .
and some , i assume , are good people .
clooney came under fire in july , when he sought to install security cameras around the property of one of his expensive european homes , in order to keep unwanted guests away.neighbors complained the added security measures jeopardized the privacy of the neighborhood.lake como , italy also has special fines in place , specifically for clooney , which are designed to keep out of towners from entering his private property .
