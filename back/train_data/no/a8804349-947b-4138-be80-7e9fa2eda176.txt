washington ( reuters ) - president barack obama ’ s deputy national security adviser ben rhodes will travel to miami next week to meet with leaders from the cuban-american community to allay concerns about obama ’ s historic trip to cuba later this month , a white house official told reuters .
“ miami has long been at the heart of the cuban-american community , and this trip will provide an opportunity to continue the important dialogue about the president ’ s efforts to normalize relations with cuba , ” the official said .
rhodes , who helped negotiate the thaw in washington ’ s relations with the island nation , will meet with human rights advocates , religious leaders , and private sector representatives during his march 11 trip .
obama goes to havana in mid-march in what will be the first visit by a u.s. president to the caribbean nation since 1928 .
republicans and some leaders in the cuban-american community oppose the trip , believing it will give legitimacy to the island ’ s communist government .
rhodes will seek to allay those concerns and discuss what the president hopes to achieve by going to havana , the official said .
obama plans to meet with dissidents as well as president raul castro during his stay in cuba .
