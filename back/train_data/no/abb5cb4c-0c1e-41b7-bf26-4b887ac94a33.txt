berlin ( reuters ) - germany s foreign minister siegmar gabriel met his turkish counterpart mevlut cavusoglu in turkey on saturday , in a chance to discuss strained ties between the nato allies after a series of diplomatic incidents .
gabriel and cavusoglu discussed bilateral relationships as well as difficult themes and expectations on both sides in an informal meeting in the turkish city of antalya , the german foreign ministry said on twitter , without giving further detail .
the meeting came a day after the announcement of the release of a further german national who had been detained in turkey for political reasons , leaving the tally of those still in jail at nine .
ties between the two allies deteriorated after turkish president recep erdogan launched a crackdown on political opponents after a failed coup last year .
germany has criticized the mass arrests and refused to extradite people turkey says were involved in the plot .
relations with turkey are a contentious issue in talks on forming a coalition government that chancellor angela merkel s conservative bloc is holding with two other parties after she lost support in an election in september .
