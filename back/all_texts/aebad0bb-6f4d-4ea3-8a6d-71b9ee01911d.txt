House Republican Steve King received a lesson on what the Constitution says during an interview with Tamron Hall.The MSNBC host and Iowa Rep. were discussing the death of Justice Antonin Scalia and whether or not President Obama is allowed to nominate someone to fill his vacant seat on the Supreme Court.Hall noted that Republican Senator Chuck Grassley also opposes President Obama picking the next Supreme Court Justice, but pointed out that Grassley s past statement on the subject of nominating and confirming judges in the final months of a presidency is going viral.During the final months of the Bush Administration, Grassley said that the Senate has never stopped confirming judicial nominees during the last few months of a president s term.
In addition, Hall informed King that most confirmations only last on average under 80 days in the Senate and there are still over 300 days left in Obama s final year.
Hall wanted King to explain why Republicans are running away from their previous position when it comes to doing their constitutional duty and King tried to spin what Grassley said as if the Supreme Court is not part of the judicial branch.
You ll find Chuck Schumer in his own words, and others also that contradict themselves, and you re going to see, if people have been in that senate long enough, that they have been on the opposite side of this equation, there will be arguments that are made on both sides of this.
But if I heard Chuck Grassley s words right, he said judicial nominees, he didn t say Supreme Court justices.
And that s when Hall absolutely embarrassed King by asking him to actually read what the Constitution says.
And others would say please see the words correctly in the Constitution, it clearly states the role of the President, and that of the Senate.
Hall then ended the interview before King could spill any more bullshit out of his mouth.Here s the video via YouTube.Republicans are always bragging about how much they love the Constitution, but just like the Bible, they apparently have never read it.If Steve King needs a refresher on what the Constitution says, I suggest he read Article II Section 2 which reads:[The President] shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur; and he shall nominate, and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, judges of the Supreme Court, and all other officers of the United States, whose appointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be established by law: but the Congress may by law vest the appointment of such inferior officers, as they think proper, in the President alone, in the courts of law, or in the heads of departments.The President shall have power to fill up all vacancies that may happen during the recess of the Senate, by granting commissions which shall expire at the end of their next session.
