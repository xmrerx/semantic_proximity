as president obama prepares to leave office , he leaves behind a stunning , historical legacy : 75 months of continuous job growth , a record not seen since 1939.that s right , president obama has overseen a feat not matched since at least 78 years ago .
while the bush administration lost millions of jobs ( 800k a month in 2008 ) , the obama administration has created over 2 million in 2016 alone , and a whopping 11.3 million over the course of his presidency.because of the hard work and dedication of this man , 11.3 million more americans can rest easier at night knowing they have employment in a recovering economy.the unemployment rate , which peaked at 10 percent in october 2009 , has slipped down to 4.7 percent , as of december 2016.not only have millions of americans been put back to work , the average american saw their earnings rise almost three percent in the last year alone , the largest increase since president obama took office in 2009.as the final weeks come to a close , the president can look back and know that he built this and never wavered in that promise.while the republicans called his signature achievements obamacare , the auto bailout , wall street reform job killing programs , the facts speak for themselves .
rhetoric v. results.it s amazing , really .
the only president s that have managed this kind of economic growth to this magnitude are presidents obama and roosevelt , both of whom are democrats.after listening , for 7 years , to john boehner and paul ryan and mitch mcconnell exclaim where are the jobs ! ?
we can finally lay it out of them , in black and white : 11.3 million .
thanks for your help .
barack obama , the job-creating president , will be handing over the keys to donald trump .
the facts laid out above should not be forgotten .
after years of unprecedented obstruction , nothing would be more unjust than to give credit , no matter how slight , to donald trump.featured image via winn mcnamee/getty images
