One of the most beloved public figures in the entire world is Pope Francis.
He has seemingly restored grace and dignity back to the Vatican, where most people were losing hope and feared that corruption and deceit had taken too much of a stronghold.
Pope Francis humble nature and openness to the world has the world humming with gratitude for a return to solemnity within the Vatican walls, so wherever he goes, massive crowds follow who want to meet him, or if anything, merely catch a glimpse.However, it looks as though one person became too eager and failed to recognize others around them in their own selfish desire to come into contact with the Pontiff.According to Inside Edition: In a rare sight of public agitation, Pope Francis lost his composure as he greeted a crowd of worshippers in Morella, Mexico.
When a devotee grabbed him by his cassock and wouldn t let go, it caused the Pontiff to fall into a wheelchair-bound man.
The Pope sternly told the man in Spanish don t be selfish.
Pope Francis recovered and kissed the man on the head following the incident.
He waved to people in the open-air gathering for a few more minutes after the incident before leaving.
Pope Francis was exactly right to get mad at what this person was doing to him and made him do to another.
They were being selfish and needed to be told that what they were doing was unacceptable.
And as far as the Pope showing he was upset, that s more than okay, too.
Heck, even Jesus tossed a few tables in anger back in his day.This is more than just a soundbite for a story, but a lesson in life.
You may want something for yourself, but always respect and think of others who may get hurt if your quest for selfish glory.
