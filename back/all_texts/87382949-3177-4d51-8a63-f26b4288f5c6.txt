Donald Trump supporters thought that when they donated to his presidential campaign, they were actually receiving Make America Great Again hats, books, and other merchandise actually autographed by their idol.
But like so much else with Trump, this was a scam too.These items offered on his website, including signed hats and signed copies of his book The Art of the Deal, were heavily advertised on social media and by Trump himself.
But what some buyers may not have realized is that it seems Trump didn t actually sign any of the items available for purchase on his website with his own hand.
Instead, the autographs all appear to have been done by an autopen machine, a device used to automatically sign a signature.The use of an autopen machine only became evident to some after Trump won the election, when opportunists who had purchased such items off Trump s website took to eBay to re-sell what they believed would be a more valuable John Hancock.On eBay, the Trump Tribe suddenly realized that all the merchandise had been signed in the exact same identical position, impossible if he had been signing them by hand.One fan told ABC News, You think for $183, you have to be getting the real thing.
Had I known, not only would I not have bought this, but I m pretty sure no one would have.
Another told the news outlet that he would like to receive a refund after shelling out money for a fake Trump autograph.Trump relies on a world in which people simply accept the snake oil he s selling and don t bother to actually verify what he s saying and compare it to reality.
It s a formula that has worked for him for years and years, while he profits and walks away from businesses in collapse.
And now he ll be running the country.Featured image via Flickr
