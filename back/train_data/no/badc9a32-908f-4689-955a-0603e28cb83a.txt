cairo ( reuters ) - a saudi-led military coalition said on saturday an air strike that hit a market in yemen s northern saadah province was a legitimate military target , the saudi news agency reported .
on wednesday , medics and a reuters witness said an air strike carried out by the coalition killed 26 people at a hotel and an adjoining market .
the attack , which struck the sahar district of the vast territory that borders saudi arabia , demolished the budget hotel and reduced market stalls outside to a heap of twisted sheet metal .
the coalition statement reviewed the incident and quoted its spokesman as saying the target was the gathering point for some armed houthi militants .
the military alliance led by saudi arabia has launched thousands of air strikes against yemen s armed houthi movement , which hails from saadah and now controls much of the country .
