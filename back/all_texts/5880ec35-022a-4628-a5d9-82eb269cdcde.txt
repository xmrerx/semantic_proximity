Thousands of Starbucks customers cut up their gold cards and boycotted their favorite coffee spot after Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz stuck his foot in his mouth, when he defended immigration of unvetted Muslims from terror hotbed nations to the US.
Schultz was hammered on social media after offering to hire Syrian immigrants before Americans to prove his point about how inclusive he is.Well, it appears as though the arrogant leftist CEO of Starbucks has done it again.
Howard Schultz tweeted from the Starbucks account: I know we re better than this.
The bigotry, hatred, and senseless violence against people who are not white cannot stand.

Who exactly are you calling racists or bigots?
Who has actually been committing the violence at pro-Trump and pro-freedom of speech rallies across America?Maybe it s these guys?Maybe he was referring to this white guy punching this black guy because he s supporting our president or because he s holding an American flag:Oops!
Never mind that s a black guy punching a white guy.So tell us again Howard, what was it again you wanted your customers to know about violence against people who are not white?Here are just a few responses Schultz s ignorant and offensive tweet provoked:Howard Shultz violence against ANYONE can not stand!
Anything less inclusive is bigotry.

Implies only whites are to blame.
It is about a specific group, no backpeddaling.
Michael (@wouldabeen) August 17, 2017Violence against whites is okay.
No one cares about whites, they are just trash.
White lives DON'T matter.
So says Howard Schultz.
