mexico city ( reuters ) - mexico ’ s government on tuesday unexpectedly changed two of its top officials responsible for u.s. relations , citing concerns about an increasingly anti-mexican climate across the border .
carlos sada , previously the consul in los angeles , was named ambassador to the united states while paulo carreno , one of president enrique pena nieto ’ s communications chiefs , was appointed the deputy foreign minister for north america .
the new ambassador must still be approved by the senate .
“ we have been warning that our citizens have begun to feel a more hostile climate , ” foreign minister claudia ruiz massieu told local radio after the announcement .
“ this ( anti-mexican ) rhetoric has made it clear that we have to act in a different way so that this tendency being generated doesn ’ t damage the bilateral relationship , ” she added .
mexican government officials have expressed concern about the rise of republican presidential front-runner donald trump due to his repeated verbal attacks on mexico , and his insistence that mexico should be made to pay for a border wall .
trump on tuesday threatened to block remittances from undocumented mexican migrants if elected president unless the country pays billions for his planned wall .
trump also called ford ’ s announcement that it would build more cars in mexico “ an absolute disgrace . ”
