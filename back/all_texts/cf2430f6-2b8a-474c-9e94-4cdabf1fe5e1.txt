WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the United States is prepared to tackle the crisis surrounding North Korea without China if necessary.
The president made the comments at a joint news conference with visiting NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg.
Trump met Chinese President Xi Jinping last week and spoke to him by phone on Wednesday night.
“President Xi wants to do the right thing.
We had a very good bonding, I think we had a very good chemistry together, I think he wants to help us with North Korea,” Trump said.
“We talked trade, we talked a lot of things, and I said the way you’re going to make a good trade deal is to help us with North Korea, otherwise we’re just going to go it alone, that’ll be all right too, but going it alone means going with lots of other nations.”
