democrat senator and fake indian elizabeth warren took to twitter to criticize the evil republican s plan to replace obamacare.while her tweet in and of itself , is just more of what we expect from the democrats , it s what s sitting on a side table next to her coffee maker that has everyone laughing.i 'm reading the latest way that senate republicans plan to rip health care away from millions of people .
i 'll share my thoughts soon .

of course , any sane person who follows the biased and very fake news network cnn shouldn t be surprised to see their new favorite democrat sporting their mug in her senate office .
we d like to offer a special thank you and well done to @ thealx who , according to his profile , lives in fake indian elizabeth warren s home state of massachusetts.looks like @ senwarren is a friend to @ cnn just like hillary !
watch out for # fakenews !

our guess is that congresswoman maxine waters ( d-ca ) would have already called for his impeachment .
