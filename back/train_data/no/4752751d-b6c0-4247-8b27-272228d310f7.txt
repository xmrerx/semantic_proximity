if you only attack black conservatives , does that make you exempt from being called a racist ?
when will americans stop supporting foreigners like josh rogen who openly spout off about about their disdain for conservatives while advocating for gun control in our country ? on the eve of the release of universal s steve jobs , star seth rogen fired off a hate-tweet at black republican presidential candidate ben carson .
fuck you @ realbencarson , the tweet said .
in another tweet , rogen , a high-profile hillary clinton supporter ( and canadian citizen ) , expressed his anger over comments carson made about gun control and nazi germany.carson believes jews might have had a better chance at resisting the nazi regime had they not been disarmed by that regime in advance .
rogen , who is jewish , and much of the national media are horrified over the idea of jews with guns fighting nazis , something jews did frequently throughout wwii with scrounged guns.whether it is kids in classrooms or jews in nazi germany , carson proved this week that if you want to enrage a leftist , suggest that they might have been better off had they been in a position to fight back.the social media backlash against both rogen and his upcoming film was immediate , and some 12 hours later , even though it is very early in the morning , is still intense.here is rogan s vulgar tweet : a search of tweets containing only seth rogen s names finds that almost all of them are critical of the comedian s attack on carson , many accusing rogen of outright racism .
the venomous , dehumanizing attacks black conservatives face from leftists like rogen have been well-documented going back to clarence thomas .
