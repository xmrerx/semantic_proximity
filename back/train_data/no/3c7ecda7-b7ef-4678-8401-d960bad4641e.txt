beirut ( reuters ) - the leader of lebanon s hezbollah group , sayyed hassan nasrallah , on monday said the group and its allies in the region would renew their focus on the palestinian cause after what he called their victories elsewhere in the region .
nasrallah called on hezbollah s allies to put in place a united strategy in the field to confront israel .
the iran-backed group has been fighting islamic state in syria alongside regional allies and the group has been largely defeated .
nasrallah was speaking by video link to a large protest in beirut over the united states decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel and move its embassy there .
on saturday a video was released of the commander of an iraqi shi ite militia allied to hezbollah visiting lebanon s border with israel , apparently accompanied by a hezbollah commander .
nasrallah said in june that any future war waged by israel against lebanon or syria could draw in fighters from countries including iran and iraq .
on monday he repeated a call he made last week for a new palestinian uprising against israel and called on arab states to abandon the peace process , describing negotiations with the united states as futile .
today the axis of resistance , including hezbollah , will return as its most important priority ... jerusalem and palestine and the palestinian people and the palestinian resistance in all its factions , he said .
hezbollah was formed in the 1980s as a resistance movement against israel s occupation of southern lebanon and they remain bitter enemies .
israel and hezbollah fought a brief war in 2006 and tensions rose again this year as israel struck hezbollah arms stores and convoys in syria .
