Wow!
This young Asian student nails it!
He speaks for every American who has been a victim of Obama s failed government experiment.
The Left has turned our world upside down and many people in America believe that we are very close to a civil war.
This brilliant young Asian student warns the Left to turn back now, warning them it s a line you don t want to cross.
He blames them for normalizing violence and completely ignoring the rule of law as a way to threaten people who don t agree with you.Here is a part of his message that can be seen in the video below: Once you cross that line, you re starting a war you cannot win.
You think you re so big and powerful.
Step out of your bubble.
Step out of the liberal cities, and look at the rest of the country.
You re outnumbered, outmanned and outgunned.
You cannot win this if it turns violent.
If you normalize violence, if violence is okay, you cannot win.
You can win by reaching out to conservatives.
Talk to them.
Talk to Trump supporters and ask them why they believe what they believe and maybe, maybe you ll find common ground.
Maybe you might even convince us to adopt your positions.
Who knows?
Put down your fists.
Take off your masks.
Fight with your words, not sticks and stones.
Because if you do not change, you re going to lose.
You need us on your side.
You need to convince us why you re right.
You cannot divide us.
You need us on your side because Generation Z, the kids that are growing up and being born right now, they re projected to be the most conservative generation in decades, more conservative than your grandparents.
These kids are growing up on the internet.
The future s in their hands, and they re on our side.
So unless you change your ways you ve already lost.
