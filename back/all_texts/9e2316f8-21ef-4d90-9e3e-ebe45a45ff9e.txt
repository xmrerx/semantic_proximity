MSNBC s Chris Hayes couldn t resist trolling Trump a bit after Friday morning s insane tweet about the GOP healthcare plan.
After seven horrible years of ObamaCare (skyrocketing premiums & deductibles, bad healthcare), this is finally your chance for a great plan!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 24, 2017Now, everyone has figured out by now that The Donald has no idea how healthcare works at all (and, of course, that Obamacare is a boon to working Americans.
But Hayes just had to do it.
He asked Trump a question to which Dear Leader could not possibly know the answer.
Can you tell us a little more about how community rating requirement will interact with ditching EHB requirements?
Hayes replied to Trump s tweet.
Chris, New York Times columnist Ross Douhat chided him.
Can t blame a guy for trying!
Hayes replied.Naturally, other Americans showed up to mention the numerous problems with Trump s crusade against the Affordable Care Act:@realDonaldTrump what it will do is cause millions to lose their coverage Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) March 24, 2017.
@realDonaldTrump You're like if cancer were a person.
OhNoSheTwitnt (@OhNoSheTwitnt) March 24, 2017@realDonaldTrump this plan will cut taxes for the 400 richest people in America and leave the rest of us to die w/out care.
It will kill us Stefanie Iris Weiss (@EcoSexuality) March 24, 2017@realDonaldTrump *donald trump when he sees other people talking about how health care actually works* pic.twitter.com/N3yrVP2h8L Steve Benko (@SteveBenko) March 24, 2017.
@realDonaldTrump my premiums didn't skyrocket.
I've had slowest & lowest increase in decades.
#TrumpCare would give me NO coverage.

@realDonaldTrump Day 79: Can you just say that you hate poor people instead of trying to make life miserable for them?
#AskTheDrumpf Sum Mehrnama (@VoiceOfSum) March 24, 2017@realDonaldTrump "Are you rich, white, male, and entitled?
Have we got a plan for you!"
#trumpcare Lori (@njgirlinmd) March 24, 2017@realDonaldTrump This plan is shit.
How about single payer, and get rid of profits on healthcare?
Then we can all be healthy together!
Matt (@nocheez17) March 24, 2017The GOP healthcare plan is a disaster, but Trump believes in it so much that he threatened to leave Obamacare in place if Republicans failed to pass their monstrosity.That actually sounds like the best plan of all.Featured image via Getty Images (Alex Wong)/ screengrab
