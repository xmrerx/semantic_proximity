WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.
Senator Richard Burr, the Republican chairman of the committee responsible for investigating any Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. election, said on Thursday he trusted Attorney General Jeff Sessions to decide if he should be involved in the probe.
“The Attorney General has said he would recuse himself when needed and I trust him to make what he feels is the appropriate decision as to his involvement in any investigation into Russian active measures and the 2016 election,” Burr said in a statement.
