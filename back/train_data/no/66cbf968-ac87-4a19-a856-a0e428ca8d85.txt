washington ( reuters ) - u.s.-backed militias fighting islamic state are not planning to enter the city of deir al-zor in eastern syria , a u.s. military spokesman said on thursday , reducing the chances of the american allies coming face to face with syrian government forces .
the syrian army and its allies recently broke an islamic state siege of an enclave in deir al-zor that had lasted three years .
the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) , a u.s.-backed alliance of mostly arab and kurdish fighters , meanwhile have also launched a separate assault in deir al-zor province , which has become islamic state s last major foothold in syria .
earlier this week , the sdf said it had reached an industrial zone miles to the east of deir al-zor city .
the advances bring the sdf to within 15 km ( 10 miles ) of the syrian army .
the advances against islamic state , another blow to its control over territory it held for years as part of a self-declared caliphate , has raised concerns that it would bring the sdf into closer proximity to the syrian government side , which is backed by russia and iran .
u.s. army colonel ryan dillon , a spokesman for the u.s.-led coalition fighting islamic state , told reporters that the battlefield was already congested and the plan was for the sdf to move down the middle euphrates river valley .
i ll just tell you that the plan is not to go into deir al-zor city but there ( are ) plenty of isis fighters and resources and leaders that continue to have holdouts throughout the middle euphrates river valley , dillon told reporters in washington through a video briefing .
