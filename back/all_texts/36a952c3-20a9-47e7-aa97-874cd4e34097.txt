WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Joe Biden said on Thursday that he thinks Donald Trump could win the Republican presidential nominating race and should be taken seriously in the Nov. 8 presidential election because he appeals to voters’ fears.
“I think it is very possible he could be nominated and depending on how this all plays out, I would take him seriously in terms of being able to win because he’s appealing to fear,” Biden said in an interview with MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow.
