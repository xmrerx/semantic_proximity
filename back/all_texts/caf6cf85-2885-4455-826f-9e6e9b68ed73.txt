WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.
Congressman Steve Scalise, the No.
3 Republican in the House of Representatives, underwent another surgical procedure on Thursday, a source familiar with the lawmakerâ€™s condition told Reuters one day after the Louisiana Republican was shot.
Additional procedures may also be necessary, the source said, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation.
