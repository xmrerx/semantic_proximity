geneva ( reuters ) - the united nations human rights boss called on mexico s senate on tuesday not to adopt a proposed law on internal security , saying it would enshrine the role of the military in law enforcement at a time when a stronger police force was needed .
zeid ra ad al-hussein , u.n. high commissioner for human rights , said that more than a decade after the armed forces were deployed in the war on drugs , violence had not abated and extrajudicial killings , torture and disappearances continue to be committed by various state and non-state actors .
in a statement recognizing mexico s huge security challenge and violence sown by powerful organized crime groups , zeid said : adopting a new legal framework to regulate the operations of the armed forces in internal security is not the answer .
the current draft law risks weakening incentives for the civilian authorities to fully assume their law enforcement roles .
