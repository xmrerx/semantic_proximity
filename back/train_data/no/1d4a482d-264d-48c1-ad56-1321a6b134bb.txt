dubai ( reuters ) - yemen s houthi forces have detained a u.s. citizen in the capital sanaa for reasons that were not immediately clear , two colleagues of the man said on monday .
the iran-aligned houthis control much of northern yemen , including sanaa , and are battling a saudi-led coalition that is trying to restore the internationally recognized government .
nadia burch told reuters that her husband , danny lavon burch , was seized on saturday after taking his children to school .
he had been working in yemen since the late 1980s , currently with the oil company safer , said burch , a yemeni .
he has no problems or disputes with anyone , which is why he didn t leave as others did , she said .
i ask for the release of my husband and his safe return to me .
a u.s. state department official said they were aware and concerned about the report .
the houthi movement did not respond to a request for comment and the safer oil company was also not immediately available for comment .
two of mr. burch s colleagues in sanaa said houthi forces were responsible , without elaborating .
but nadia burch said the kidnappers had not contacted her and she was unsure of their identity .
more than 10,000 people have been killed in yemen s civil war .
it began in march 2015 when the houthis advanced on the interim headquarters of president abd-rabbu mansour hadi in the southern port city of aden , forcing him to flee the country and seek saudi help .
