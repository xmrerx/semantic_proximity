during a friday interview , virginia rep. dave brat slammed democrats who want to impeach trump without any evidence of criminal wrongdoing .
what you got ta do is just name the statute that s been violated , brat explained of democrats going after trump .
democrats are upset that trump won the election and so they ve been saying impeach , impeach since day one .
brat took shots at fellow virginia senators mark warner and tim kaine , who have respectively called potential russia collusion disturbing and close to treason .
my senators from virginia are getting apoplectic , brat argued .
mark warner s seeing smoke everywhere he goes like he s in a cheech and chong movie and [ tim ] kaine now thinks the son is worse than benedict arnold .
cnn may have thought they were safe from the destruction , but brat quickly turned on them too .
there s collusion everywhere but the question is whether a statue has been violated , he said .
there s collusion between cnn and the dccc and the washington post and i don t complain about that it s not illegal .
i think it s unethical but it s not illegal .
