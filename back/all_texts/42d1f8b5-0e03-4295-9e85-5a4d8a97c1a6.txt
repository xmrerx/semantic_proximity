#MerkelLegacy pic.twitter.com/wBh5Cjj2IW James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) February 24, 2017In August 2016, Angela Merkel defended her open-borders policy: Aug. 23, 2016 ANGELA Merkel has defended her open-door immigration policy claiming it was a humanitarian duty to let in almost two million migrants last year.However, the German Chancellor admitted some areas of her immigration stance could be improved following a U-turn in public opinion against refugees.This was sparked in part by the Cologne sex attack, carried out by migrant gangs on thousands of women, and a string of recent terror attacks where the attacker was an asylum seeker.Nearly a year on from when Germany s borders were opened, Mrs Merkel still defended the controversial decision but identified certain areas where change was needed.Faced with international criticism, she claimed the open-door policy was necessary and right .On September 4, 2016 Angela Merkel s party CDU party was soundly defeated by the anti-migrant AfD party in the German state election.
Merkel assumed some of the blame for her reckless immigration policy, but still defended her position.On September 19, 2016, Merkel admitted for first time she may have blundered over the migration crisis in the wake of another bitter poll drubbing.The German Chancellor admitted she was unprepared for last year s one million strong migrant influx.
If I could, I would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015, for which we were rather unprepared.
So why are the mainstream media sources ignoring what is really happening to countries like Germany, Sweden, Austria, Italy, Hungary, Greece, France and the UK?
Why are they not reporting the truth about the damage this invasion of refugees has done to their culture, to crime rates (specifically rape and sexual assaults) in their communities and to their welfare systems?Watch this eye-opening interview with filmmaker Ami Horowitz as he explains to FOX News Tucker Carlson what he found when he traveled to open-borders Sweden to make a documentary on the effects of the invasion of refugees:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aVs2u-R1Mk
