SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Conservative Sebastian Pinera took an early lead in Chile s presidential election on Sunday evening, garnering 36.13 percent of votes, with 6.44 percent of ballots counted, Chile s electoral agency Servel said.
Center-left Alejandro Guillier had 22.62 percent and leftist Beatriz Sanchez had 20.78 percent.
Chileans were voting for a successor to President Michelle Bachelet.
Sebastian Pinera, a former president, has long been the favorite to come in first but is not forecast to win the 50 percent of votes needed to avoid a December runoff.
