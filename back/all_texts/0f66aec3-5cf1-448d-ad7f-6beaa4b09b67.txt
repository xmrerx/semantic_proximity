The unwarranted violence against innocent White people by Black Lives Matter protesters terrorists is getting out of control!
This young girl in a dress and heels is walking down the stairs when she is approached by and angry mob of Blacks and is sucker punched in the face.
Someone in the background can be heard yelling, Hey hey hey she didn t do anything!
The point is they don t care if she did anything.
This is the gut-wrenching, divisive legacy of our First Black President #CharlotteProtest Young woman struck down last night at @EpiCentreNC.
See reply for streetview of staircase.
