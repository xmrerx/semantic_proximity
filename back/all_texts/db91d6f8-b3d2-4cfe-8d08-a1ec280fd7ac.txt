LONDON (Reuters) - British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson on Monday apologized for causing distress with remarks about a Iranian-British aid worker jailed in Iran.
Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a project manager with the Thomson Reuters Foundation, was sentenced to five years after being convicted by an Iranian court of plotting to overthrow the Islamic Republic s clerical establishment.
She denies the charges.
Johnson said on Nov. 1 that she had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in April 2016, contradicting her and her employer, who said she had been on holiday visiting her family.
Of course I apologize for the distress, for the suffering that has been caused by the impression I gave that I believed she was there in a professional capacity.
She was there on holiday, Johnson told parliament.
I do apologize.
Of course I retract any suggestion she was there in a professional capacity.
