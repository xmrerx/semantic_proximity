This could get ugly and should!
A treasure trove of new documents found linking Hillary to the Russia deal to sell uranium Nick Short said it best: This could get ugly This is not just about bribery and kickbacks but about a U.S. company that was transporting yellow-cake for the Russians with our approval.
There's a treasure trove of documents tying Russia to Uranium One.

At the time Uranium One controlled roughly 20 percent of American uranium mining capacity.In fact, the evidence obtained by the Department of Justice and FBI, starting as early as 2008, paint a much different picture than that of recent reports regarding the confidential informant, William D. Campbell Jr., and his role.
According to the documents, Campbell gained insight into Russia s strategic plans to gain global dominance in the uranium industry and to build a closer relationship with Obama administration officials.Read the full report at: SaraCarter.com
