washington ( reuters ) - u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said on tuesday the iran nuclear agreement must be changed or the united states could not remain part of the pact .
tillerson , in an interview on fox news , said the so-called sunset clauses , under which some of the 2015 deal s restrictions on iran s nuclear program expire over time , were of particular concern .
if we re going to stick with the iran deal there has to be changes made to it .
the sunset provisions simply is not a sensible way forward , tillerson said .
it s just simply ... kicking the can down the road again for someone in the future to have to deal with .
