washington ( reuters ) - president donald trump is actively considering when and how to move the u.s. embassy in israel to jerusalem , vice president mike pence said on tuesday .
pence made the comment in remarks at israel s mission to the united nations at an event celebrating the 70th anniversary of the united nations vote calling for the establishment of a jewish state .
trump has vowed to move the u.s. embassy to jerusalem but in june he signed a waiver to keep it in tel aviv .
he is facing a new deadline in early december on whether to extend the waiver again , a practice that his predecessors used to avoid inflaming tensions in the middle east .
