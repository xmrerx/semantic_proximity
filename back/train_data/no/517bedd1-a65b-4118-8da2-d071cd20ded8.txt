dublin ( reuters ) - the irish government would insist on a role in the running of northern ireland if power-sharing devolved government is not restored in the british province , but it hopes that will not happen , foreign minister simon coveney said on wednesday .
the british government moved on wednesday to directly set northern ireland s budget after the province s main political parties failed to reach agreement on restoring a power-sharing government that collapsed in january .
we will have to fall back on the full detail of the ( 1998 ) good friday agreement , in terms of the structures that are required in the absence of devolved government , coveney told irish state broadcaster rte .
the prospect of direct rule in northern ireland and the irish government s insistence on having a role in that an appropriate role consistent with the good friday agreement is not where we want to be , he said .
