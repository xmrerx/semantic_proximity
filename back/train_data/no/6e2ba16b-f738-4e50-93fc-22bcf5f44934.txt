has their ever been a more vengeful and hateful first lady ? they are the elite group of women who occupy the east wing of the white house as their husbands serve as presidents of the united states.viewed as the true modern power brokers of 1600 pennsylvania avenue , the first ladies have had different takes on their public positions and either love the proximity to the country s top policy advisers or view it as serving a prison term of teas , luncheons , dinners and photo ops.there are friendships among this sorority of first ladies and turbulent rivalries as well as relationships fraught with hurt feelings and resentment , like that between hillary clinton and michelle obama , kate andersen brower writes in her new book , first women , the grace and power of america s modern first ladies , published by harper .
the 2008 presidential campaign left deep and lasting scars on both the clinton and the obama camps , and they are still shockingly fresh .
michelle , now 52 , never forgot how hillary mocked her husband s message of hope and change at a campaign rally in ohio during that campaign .
the sky will open , the light will come down , celestial choirs will be singing , and everyone will know that we should do the right thing , and the world would be perfect , clinton said.watch hillary starting at the 45 second mark : hillary was right ; that certainly didn t happen and she has remained bitter for years that senator ted kennedy , who had been her mentor in the senate , did not support her presidential candidacy in 2008.a source in hillary s inner circle told the author that hillary , now 68 , is running again for president out of vengeance for that loss .
she needs to win.obama is viewed by hillary s circle of people as not having the same work ethic as hillary who they see as having a long record of dedicated public service.those clinton acolytes also suggest that michelle has not done enough as first lady and has failed to prioritize funding for some programs that subsequently lost their federal support.one such program was save america s treasures , a program that hillary started to help preserve and protect historic sites , arts and published works and was lovingly carried on by laura bush , the next first lady.michelle felt no such obligation to those treasures and let the program dissolve.michelle s feelings towards hillary were blatantly obvious when no couple dinners were scheduled at the obama white house while hillary was secretary of state and frequently meeting with the president.michelle is very close to jill biden and vice president joe biden .
she was hoping that biden would run against hillary for the democratic nomination and his win would take away the sweet taste of victory once again for hillary .
