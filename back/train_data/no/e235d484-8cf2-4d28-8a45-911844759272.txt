piraeus ( reuters ) - greek authorities on thursday moved a few hundred asylum-seekers from the island of lesbos to the mainland in an effort to ease overcrowding in its camps .
thousands of asylum-seekers have become stranded on lesbos and four other islands close to turkey since the european union agreed a deal with ankara in march 2016 to shut down the route through greece .
i came to heaven from hell , said 30-year old mohammad firuz , who lived for two months in a state-run camp in lesbos .
firuz was among 300 people , many of them women and children , aboard a ferry that reached the port of piraeus early on thursday morning .
the asylum seekers would be taken to camps and apartments in the mainland , authorities said .
lesbos is now hosting some 8,500 asylum-seekers , nearly three times the capacity of state-run facilities .
violence often breaks out , mainly over delays in asylum procedures and poor living standards .
lesbos residents went on strike earlier this month to protest against european policies they say have turned it into a prison for migrants and refugees .
