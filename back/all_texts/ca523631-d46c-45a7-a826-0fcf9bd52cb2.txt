The recent unveiling of the new Beyonc wax statue sent activists into a frenzy when it was claimed that the celebrity pop singer was too white.
America s unofficial cultural Stasi slammed the museum for purportedly whitewashing the singers skin tone.The liberal outcry on social media prompted the museum to withdraw the statue temporarily to avoid any further uproar, confirming that it will be off the floor until further notice.
