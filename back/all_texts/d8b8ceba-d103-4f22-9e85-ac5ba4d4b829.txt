Alleged President Donald Trump created worldwide chaos with his latest executive order banning Muslims from entering the U.S.
Yes, it is a Muslim ban.
I ll tell you the whole history of it, Giuliani said in an interview with Fox News Jeanine Pirro.
When he first announced it, he said Muslim ban.
He called me up.
He said, Put a commission together.
Show me the right way to do it legally.
Of course, the ban isn t implemented in Muslim countries Trump does business with.
Protests have erupted across the country for two days straight over Trump s highly controversial move.
Travelers, including a 77-year-old woman and a 5-year-old boy were detained.So, what do you do when you re a newly minted president and you just created worldwide chaos?
You watch Finding Dory while protesters are outside of the White House, angry over his reckless decision.Trump, along with family members and White House staff, screened the Disney Pixar film in the afternoon after prohibiting foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering the U.S.Finding Dory is an animated story of a character s attempt to reunite with her parents despite outside forces working against her.The Internet was not amused.The nation is in turmoil over the Executive Order, and @POTUS @realDonaldTrump will be watching @findingdory.
