Donald Trump told an audience in Fresno, California on Friday, that there is no drought in California.
This has to be the most absurd claim that Trump has made during his campaign.
During the event, Trump implied that the water shortage in California was created by the government and environmentalists.
We re going to solve your water problem.
You have a water problem that is so insane.
It is so ridiculous where they re taking the water and shoving it out to sea, Trump told the crowd made up of mostly California farmers.
They don t understand it.
There is no drought, they turn the water out into the ocean.
California has been in a state of drought for half a decade.
In 2015, the drought was less severe than it has been in previous years.
Though to claim that there is no drought and to imply that California s water shortage problem has been solely caused by poor water management systems is ridiculous.Trump pointed towards efforts to keep the Delta Smelt, or a three-inch fish as Trump referred to it in his speech, from going extinct as an example of environmentalists and the big-bad-government stealing water away from farmers.
While water has been redirected in a last-ditch attempt to save the species from complete extinction, the idea that it has had any major impact on farmers is nothing more than a flimsy talking point.Trump is pandering to California farmers who are trying to get legislation passed to build new water infrastructure that would help farmers out.
It s probably just due to the fact that he is Trump, that he has chosen to do so in such a ludicrous fashion.
I m personally surprised that Trump is spending so much time trying to win over voters in California, a state that is certain to vote blue in November.You can watch the event below in full.Featured image via video screenshot
