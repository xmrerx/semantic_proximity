Sorry Tiger, Hillary has a lot of influence but it s unlikely she can do anything for your golf game Adulterer and former golf star Tiger Woods donated between $25,001 and $50,000 to the Clinton Foundation in the first half of 2015, records show.
The charitable organization was founded by adulterer and former President Bill Clinton.
The two men are perhaps the most renowned philanderers in America, yet for whatever reason Clinton is far more respected in the public eye, and occasionally wins father of the year awards.Woods is one of more than 10,500 individuals and organization who donated to the Clinton Foundation in the first half of the year.
That s a significant increase from the 8,800 donors who contributed during the same period last year, but it probably has nothing to do with the fact that Hillary officially announced her presidential campaign in April, because the Clinton Foundation is exclusively a charitable organization that does a lot of good in the world and is definitely not a slush fund for influence peddlers.Via: WFB
