What just happened on CNN would be sad if it weren t so gosh darn funny.It would seem it s not only Donald Trump who is in complete denial that he s losing because that denial has clearly spread to all his campaign surrogates.While being interviewed by Wolf Blitzer stand-in Brianna Keilar during a segment of CNN s Situation Room, Trump surrogate Michael Cohen just made himself look absolutely foolish and kind of insane.Keilar was questioning Cohen about the new shake-up in the Trump campaign where there is yet another new campaign manager.
It seems the campaign is in emergency maintenance mode considering how dismal Trump s poll numbers have been across the board, including in pretty much every single battleground state.Keilar reiterates the point that Trump is down, which Cohen must have been trained not to accept, because he replies fast with: Says who?
So, Keilar quickly responds with: The polls.
Most of them.
All of them.
However, Cohen clearly not grasping this reality into his head again says: Say s who?
And Keilar again says: Polls.
I just told you.
I answered your question.
So Cohen says: Which polls?
Keilar again says: All of them.
It was awkward to say the least, but really kind of funny, yet scary at the same time that Trump is actually the Republican nominee and this sort of stupidity has now become the norm.Watch the hilariously embarrassing moment here:Featured image via video screen capture
