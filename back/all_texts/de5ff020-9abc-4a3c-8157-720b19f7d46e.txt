If this so-called celebrity said that he would have killed former President Obama if he was given the chance, he would likely be sitting in a jail cell somewhere facing serious charges, but apparently when a celebrity says they d like to kill President Trump, foreign authorities, as well the leftist media, simply shrug their shoulders Just another day in the life of an unhinged, Trump-hating celebrity Yawn.British musician Morrissey says if given the chance, he d kill President Donald Trump to ensure the safety of humanity.
The 58-year-old former Smiths frontman said in an interview with der Spiegel this week that if he were presented with a button that could instantly kill Trump, he wouldn t hesitate to press it.
I would [push it], for the safety of humanity, Morrissey told the outlet.
It has nothing to do with my personal opinion of his face or his family, but in the interest of humanity I would push.
The singer also explained that it was the media, who so derided Trump during the 2016 campaign season, that ultimately created Trump, ensured consistent coverage of his campaign, and led to his victory over Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.The American media helped Trump, yes, they first created it, he explained, according to a translation of the interview by the Washington Times.
Whether they criticize him or laugh at him, he does not care, he just wants to see his picture and his name.
The American media have shot themselves in the leg.
Watch Morrissey push for a Hillary presidency on Larry King Now prior to the election.
Is there anything more heartwarming than watching a British musician tell an American host who Americans should vote for?
Thank goodness no one listens to this unhinged overrated celebrity.Morrissey added that he never expected Trump to be elected president and has no faith in the political establishment anymore.
