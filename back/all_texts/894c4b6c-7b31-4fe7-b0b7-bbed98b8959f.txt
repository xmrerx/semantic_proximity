Donald Trump and his team are getting absolutely hammered for their lies or as they called it alternate facts.
And rightfully so Trump hasn t even been President for a week and his team is already proving to be riddled with falsehoods and a complete lack of transparency.On Monday, new White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer gave a truly infuriating response during his first White House press conference.
When a member of the press asked Spicer if he could produce some sort of proof to validate the claims that Trump had resigned from his businesses, America got a terrifying look at what the next four years were going to bring.Spicer said I believe we have to a question regarding documents showing that Trump had handed his businesses over to his two sons.
However, White House staffer Hope Hicks jumped in and stated that these documents are not public.
Spicer continued: Yeah, but he has resigned from the company as he said he would before he took office.
Don and Eric are fully in charge of the company.
He s taking extraordinary steps to ensure that that s happened.
So once again, we have more and more secrecy from Trump s team combined with a lack of kept promises to the American people.
It should be noted that ProPublica stated that Trump has not stepped away from his businesses at all.As of last Friday, ProPublica examined several of Trump s major companies.
These companies were registered in three different states Florida, Delaware and New York.
These states make changes to companies almost instantly documents are pretty much added to the system immediately or within a day or two at the latest.
However, when ProPublica spoke to officials in these states recently, it was discovered that Trump has not submitted any filings to transfer the control of his companies to his sons.You can watch Spicer lie through his teeth below:Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images
