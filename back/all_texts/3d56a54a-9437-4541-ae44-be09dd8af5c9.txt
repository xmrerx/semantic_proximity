Remember when Jon Stewart humiliated Tucker Carlson on his own show many years ago?
Well, this time it was Teen Vogue writer Lauren Duca doing the humiliating.During an appearance on Fox News on Friday, Duca refused to let Carlson talk over her and misrepresent what she has said.Earlier this week, a man confronted Ivanka Trump on a JetBlue flight and yelled at her.
The man was removed from the plane and Trump supporters immediately threw a hissy fit because someone dared criticize Trump s daughter in public.Despite conservative whining, a majority of people sided with Ivanka in the moment because it s pretty damn rude to approach someone, especially a mother who is with her kids, and yell at them.Duca is also against yelling on airplanes but warned people not to let Ivanka off the hook because of this rude incident.Ivanka Trump is poised to become the most powerful woman in the world.
Don t let her off the hook because she looks like she smells good.

Apparently, she needed to speak more slowly.But the interview grew more contentious as Carlson acted smug and repeatedly tried to prevent Duca from speaking to defend herself, causing her to refer to him as a partisan hack.
Carlson even repeatedly focused on Ivanka being accosted on the plane, which forced Duca to once again explain to Carlson that she is firmly against yelling at people on planes.Once that issue was settled, Carlson moved on to mocking Duca for being a writer at Teen Vogue.
That didn t go down so well for Carlson either.And once he finally stopped being an asshole about where Duca works, he attacked her for defending religious freedom, telling her that she should stick the thigh-high boots all while laughing at her before cutting her off before she could respond.Here s the video via YouTube.Seriously, Tucker Carlson was rude and out of line and he owes Duca an apology.But Duca responded later on Twitter..@TuckerCarlson is an enemy of rational discourse.
In this fraught moment, his bully tactics are profoundly damaging, and achieve nothing.
