Since sexual harassment is almost a sport at Fox News, it is unsurprising that a man who worked as a Miami correspondent for the network until fairly recently was just arrested for raping someone.Orlando Salinas, who worked for the network from 2000-2012 until he was hired by a CBS affiliate in Roanoke, Virginia, was arrested Tuesday and charged with forcible sodomy and rape.
Due to the horrific nature of the allegations, the victim s identity is being shielded but reports specify that the accuser is not his wife or a relative.Salinas, whose prior criminal record includes contributing and three counts of larceny, faces five years to life for each of his felony charges.Salinas was an employee of WDBJ7 from 2012-2015, but was terminated last April for insubordination.
Since then, he has been working as a real estate agent in the New River Valley.
In a whatever happened to article published by the Roanoke Times in December, Salinas current employer called him a wonderful person and said that people who know who he is really trust him.
The judge, however, apparently doesn t really know him because he is being held without bail for the horrific crimes.Salinas told the Times that his firing was the result of a refusal to tone down his aggressive interview style, an idea with which he disagreed because he seeks truth like a missile.
But, hey, he says some of the most annoying people make the best reporters.
Seems like they make pretty accomplished rapists, too.Watch a report on the Fox contributor s arrest below:Featured image via screengrab
