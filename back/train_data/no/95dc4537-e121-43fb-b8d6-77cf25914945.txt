london ( reuters ) - iran s continued detention of jailed iranian-british aid worker nazanin zaghari-ratcliffe is unacceptable , british trade minister liam fox said on tuesday , adding that she should be released as soon as possible .
zaghari-ratcliffe is serving a five-year jail sentence after being convicted of plotting to overthrow iran s clerical establishment , and was brought into court on saturday accused by a judge of spreading propaganda against the regime , the thomson reuters foundation , a charity organization for which she works , said .
this is a very very aggressive , unacceptable way to treat a uk citizen , fox said on bbc radio .
this detention is completely unacceptable to the british government , it is completely , in our view , illegal , and she should be released as soon as possible .
fox had earlier defended foreign secretary boris johnson after johnson last week said that zaghari-ratcliffe had been training journalists in iran , which the foundation said was incorrect .
the charges against zaghari-ratcliffe are denied by her family and the foundation , a charity organization that operates independently of reuters news .
