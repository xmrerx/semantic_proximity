london ( reuters ) - british customs authorities will be able to cope even if the government is unable to reach a deal with the european union to smooth britain s departure from the bloc , finance minister philip hammond said on tuesday .
( customs agency ) hmrc is preparing for all eventualities , including for a no-deal scenario , hammond told the economic affairs committee of britain s upper legislative chamber .
we recognize that the timescales are very challenging , and in a no-deal scenario , not everything we would want to put in place will be in place on day one .
but we will have a working system in place on day one , i have that assurance from hmrc .
hammond said the government was seeking the smoothest possible customs arrangements as part of a negotiated exit from the eu , which is due to take place in march 2019 .
