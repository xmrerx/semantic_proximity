This is a perfect example of the effort by liberals to erase our American history.
Like it or not, we have a history and we should never try and erase the good OR the bad.
The priest is praying over the Indians who re wearing just what Indians wore back then.
Why is this racist?
Why is this anything but a moment in time captured in a statue?
Saint Louis University has removed a statue on its campus depicting a famous Jesuit missionary priest praying over American Indians after a cohort of students and faculty continued to complain the sculpture symbolized white supremacy, racism and colonialism.Formerly placed outside the university s Fusz Hall in the center of the private Catholic university, the statue will go to the university s art museum, a building just north of the bustling urban campus.The statue features famous Jesuit Missionary Pierre-Jean De Smet S.J.
praying over two American Indians dressed in traditional clothing.
Last Monday, just two days after graduation, it was removed from the location it has called home on campus for decades.A university spokesperson told St. Louis Magazine the statue will be placed within the historical context of a collection that s on permanent display in our SLU Museum of Art.
The statue is set for the museum s Collection of the Western Jesuit Missions.
In more recent years, there have been some faculty and staff who have raised questions about whether the sculpture is culturally sensitive, SLU spokesman Clayton Berry said.Berry did not respond to The College Fix s request for comment.The De Smet statue has long drawn the ire of progressive students and scholars at the Jesuit university who argue the statue was a symbol of racism and white supremacy, among other oppressions.In a recent op-ed published in SLU s University News, senior Ryan McKinley stated the sculpture sent a clear, unwelcoming message to American Indians at Saint Louis University.Via: College Fix
