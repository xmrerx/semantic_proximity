daniel pantaleo was caught on video using an illegal chokehold on eric garner , killing him in front of the entire world for the crime of selling loose cigarettes .
there was a lengthy investigation , but ultimately no indictment , despite public outrage and widespread protests .
now , a new report of payroll records shows just how delighted the nypd was with pantaleo and his deadly actions.ever since pantaleo killed garner on that new york city street , he has consistently gotten raise after raise , even while being actively investigated for garner s death , and is now making upwards of $ 120,000 a year.a report from politico reads : pantaleo earned $ 119,996 in fiscal year 2016 , which includes earnings between july 1 , 2015 and june 30 , 2016 .
his base pay was $ 78,026 and he earned $ 23,220 in overtime , according to a review of payroll records .
he received an additional $ 12,853 in unspecified pay , which could include retroactive pay or bonuses.pantaleo s earnings in 2016 represent a 35 percent increase in overtime pay , and a 14 percent overall increase from the previous fiscal year , which began shortly before garner s death on july 17 , 2014.in that 12-month period , ending june 30 , 2015 , pantaleo earned $ 105,061 , with $ 76,488 base pay , $ 17,109 in overtime and $ 11,673 in additional earnings , records show.in fiscal year 2014 , which was completed before garner s death and pantaleo s subsequent reassignment , he made $ 99,915 , which included $ 17,189 in overtime .
an investigation into garner s killing by the department of justice is ongoing and the nypd has still not released the results of their investigation .
mayor bill deblasio insists that state law prevents pantaleo s full disciplinary file from being released .
this claim prompted governor andrew cuomo to call bullshit and he told deblasio not to blame the state law when a judge interpreted the law otherwise and your office is now contradicting the judge .
so far , this is what we do know about pantaleo s record as one of new york s finest , according to latest.com : pantaleo was involved in at least three lawsuits in which he allegedly violated a ( black ) citizen s civil rights .
he was disciplined for a bogus stop and frisk incident before the nypd banned the practice .
in april he was named as a defendant with the nypd for allegedly crashing his cruiser into another man s car and injuring the driver .
so in america , when a cop kills an unarmed black man with an illegal chokehold and there is video proof , not only does he get a paid vacation , he also gets one hell of a pay raise .
