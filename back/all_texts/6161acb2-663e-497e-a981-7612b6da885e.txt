21st Century Wire says While the US media continue to scrutinize President-Elect Donald Trump s transition team over its numerous Cabinet recommendations and nominations, powerful factions within American politics are vying for a seat at the table in a new Trump Administration and with that comes the power to nudge and influence policy objectives.
Trump s Cabinet picks will be a mine field for pursuing previous statements in favor of a common sense foreign policy.
Will neoconservative relics and war hawks from the Bush-Cheney era like John Bolton or Rudy Giuliani secure a place in the new Cabinet, and what about the NeoHawks like Sen. Tom Cotton?
What would this mean for Syria s Assad and for bilateral relations with Russia, China and Iran?
21WIRE s Patrick Henningsen speaks to Sputnik Radio International this past weekend with his analysis of where thing might be heading Sputnik Radio: Syrian President Bashar al Assad said he would welcome Donald Trump s decision to fight terrorism.
In an interview with a Portuguese TV channel the Syrian head said Damascus cannot predict the policy of the 45th president of the US, but would ally with Washington, if the 70-year-old Republican decides to fight against terrorist groups such as the Islamic State and the Jabhat Fateh al-Sham formerly known as Al Nusra front.
During his election campaign Donald Trump said that the Barack Obama administration should give up the idea of regime change in Syria and instead seek the diplomatic solution of the 5-year-old conflict.
The US has been conducting airstrikes against ISIS since 2014, however without permission of Damascus.
Radio Sputnik discussed the issue with Partick Henningsen, founder of the news website 21stCentury Wire.com.
