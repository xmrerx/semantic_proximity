beirut ( reuters ) - the u.s.-backed syrian democratic forces alliance reached an industrial zone miles to the east of deir al-zor city in rapid advances against islamic state militants on sunday , it said in a statement .
the sdf announced on saturday it had launched an operation against the jihadists in northern and eastern parts of deir al-zor province , which borders iraq .
the advances bring the sdf to within 15 km ( 10 miles ) of the syrian army and its allies , which this week broke a years-long islamic state siege of government-held parts of deir al-zor on the other side of the euphrates river .
