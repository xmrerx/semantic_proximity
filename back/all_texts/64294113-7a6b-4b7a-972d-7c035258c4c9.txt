There have been plenty of accusations made against President Obama before and during his presidency.
Birthers, led by Donald Trump, have for years, accused the president of being foreign born.
He s even been accused of being a Muslim, as if being a Muslim is somehow indicative of being something bad.
Now, a GOP politician has come out with another accusation: that president Obama has a soft spot for homosexuals because he was once a gay prostitute.
Mary Lou Bruner, a retired teacher and a Republican candidate for the Texas State Board of Education said: That s how he paid for his drugs.
He has admitted he was addicted to drugs when he was young and he is sympathetic with homosexuals; but he hasn t come out of the closet about his own homosexual/bisexual background.
What is her evidence?
Well, as is the case with Republicans when they make terrible accusations, they usually have no evidence but they simply play on the fears of people.
What s especially troubling about this case is that Bruner s a serious contender for the 15 member education body which already has a vein of lunacy.
This is the same body that enacted: Curriculum guidelines requiring students to learn about Confederate heroes, and required teachers to explain the equivalency of Abraham Lincoln s and Jefferson Davis s inaugural addresses, as well as the ways international institutions such as the United Nations threaten U.S. sovereignty.
Bruner fits right in with the lunacy and she should be perfect.
In the past, she s made other interesting accusations.
She s claimed that evolution is a religious philosophy with propaganda supporting the religion of Atheism.
She also said that scientists have hidden hard evidence that humans and dinosaurs lived at the same time.Despite these crazy accusations and far fetched theories, Bruner is not an anomaly.
She has become a standard bearer of the Republican party.
