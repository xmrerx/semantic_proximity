geneva ( reuters ) - the u.n. committees for women s and children s rights called on myanmar s authorities on wednesday to immediately stop violence in northern rakhine state , which hundreds of thousands of rohingya muslims have fled in the past six weeks .
we are particularly worried about the fate of rohingya women and children subject to serious violations of their human rights , including killings , rape and forced displacement , the committees on the elimination of discrimination against women and on the rights of the child said in a statement .
such violations may amount to crimes against humanity and we are deeply concerned at the state s failure to put an end to these shocking human rights violations being committed at the behest of the military and other security forces .
