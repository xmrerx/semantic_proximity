Asked in an interview on CNN if Trump would back putting the Obamacare payments in the legislation to the keep the government open past Friday, Mulvaney said: “No.” He said the White House had offered to include the Obamacare subsidies if Democrats agreed to funding for a wall on the border with Mexico.
“We made it very clear early on that yeah, OK if you want to talk about those payments to the insurance companies, we’ll trade you a dollar for dollar on bricks and mortar for the wall, but they said no to that and we agreed to put that off for another day ...,” he said.
