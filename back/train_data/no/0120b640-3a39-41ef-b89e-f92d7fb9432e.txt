istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish prosecutors have issued detention warrants for 360 people in an operation targeting supporters of u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen within the army , state-run anadolu news agency reported on wednesday .
it said 333 of those facing arrest in the istanbul-based operation were soldiers , 216 of them serving personnel .
ankara accuses gulen and his network of orchestrating an attempted coup last year .
gulen denies the charge .
istanbul police officers were continuing operations to capture the suspects , it said .
the private dogan news agency said seven of those facing arrest were pilots .
more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over links to gulen , while 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the public and private sectors since the july 15 failed putsch , in which 250 people were killed .
sixteen months on , operations targeting supporters of the u.s.-based preacher are continuing on a daily basis .
last week , nearly 700 people were detained in related investigations .
while turkey s western allies and rights groups have voiced concern that ankara is using the investigations to crack down on dissent , turkey says only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by gulen s network , which it says infiltrated institutions such as the military , judiciary and schools .
