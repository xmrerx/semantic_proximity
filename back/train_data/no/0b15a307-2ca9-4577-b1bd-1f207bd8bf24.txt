when you agree with liz warren you know something s wrong ! democrat sens .
joe manchin ( wv ) and sen. elizabeth warren ( d-ma ) went to the senate floor to push for immediate consideration of a bill that would make the obamatrade text public .
currently , congress has to go to a secured room to review the text and can t take notes out or discuss what is in it with the public .
the motion to make the text public failed when sen. orrin hatch ( r-ut ) objected.manchin and warren even praised president george w. bush , who released his free trade text in 2001 .
president obama , who promised to have the most transparent administration in history , is not releasing his trade deal text .
we re just asking for some transparency before we have this crucial vote , said warren .
she said people have heard a lot about the trade bill , but haven t seen it .
the press hasn t seen it , neither have economists or legal experts because the administration is making it impossible for any of those people to read it .
we should keep the deal secret because if the details were made public now , the public would oppose it , mocked warren .
well , that s not how our democracy is supposed to work .
warren went on to introduce her legislation with manchin in order to make the bill public and transparent .
this bill would require the president to publically release the scrubbed bracketed text of a trade deal at least 60 days before congress votes on any fast-track for that deal .
that would give the public , the experts , the press an opportunity to review the deal .
it would allow for some honest pubic debate , warren said.via : breitbart
