london ( reuters ) - hate crimes in britain surged by the highest amount on record last year , official figures showed on tuesday , with the vote to leave the european union a significant factor .
the home office ( interior ministry ) said there were 80,393 offences in 2016/17 , a rise of 29 percent from the year before and the largest percentage increase since the figures were first collated five years ago .
while better recording by police was one reason , last june s vote for brexit which sparked attacks on some eastern european communities , was another significant reason .
part of the increase since 2015/16 is due to a genuine increase in hate crime , particularly around the time of the eu referendum , the home office report said .
the report also noted that race hate crimes , which made up the vast bulk of all hate crimes , had increased after a man drove a car into pedestrians on westminster bridge in london killing four people before stabbing a policeman to death outside parliament .
the westminster bridge attack occurred on the 22 march 2017 .
although there were only nine days remaining in march when the attack took place , an increase is still apparent , the report said .
in august , police said hate crimes had spiked in the aftermath of three attacks this year blamed on islamist militants but that the number had decreased quickly in the following days .
