Donald Trump and Elizabeth Warren are engaged in a Twitter feud for the ages and she s kicking his ass.On Saturday, the Massachusetts Senator ripped the Republican nominee to shreds for picking Indiana Governor Mike Pence as his running mate on the 2016 ticket..@realDonaldTrump & @mike_pence are a perfect match: Two small, insecure, weak men who use hate & fear to divide our country & our people.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) July 16, 2016 Of COURSE @realDonaldTrump a guy who calls women fat pigs & bimbos picked a VP who is famous for trying to control women s bodies.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) July 16, 2016What s worse?
@realDonaldTrump & @mike_pence s sexism isn t some radical fringe of the @GOP.
They re in line with the party platform.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) July 16, 2016 And OF COURSE @realDonaldTrump a guy who [doesn t] feel good about marriage equality picked a VP famous for LGBT discrimination.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) July 16, 2016Terrifying to think of @mike_pence being a heartbeat from presidency but the direction @GOP wants to take our country is MORE terrifying.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) July 16, 2016In response, Donald Trump threw a temper tantrum which, of course, included another instance of referring to Warren as Pocahontas and goofy.
Trump also called her lazy and a fraud, and suggested she didn t earn her Senate seat with hard work.
Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U.S. Senate, must prove she is not a fraud.
Without the con it s over Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 17, 2016I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V.P.
Then we can litigate her fraud!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 17, 2016 If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn t lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today.
Pick her H Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 17, 2016Well, Warren wasn t going to let Trump get away with any of that bullshit, and she launched a barrage of tweets leveling Trump into a pile of rubble.Nasty name-calling & lies about my family aren t going to shut me up, @realDonaldTrump.
Is that really all you ve got?
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) July 17, 2016 Pres Reagan s Solicitor General was the Harvard prof who hired me, @realDonaldTrump.
He says your right-wing conspiracy theories are a lie.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) July 17, 2016It might blow your mind that a woman worked hard & earned a good job on her own, @realDonaldTrump, but it s not the 1800s.
It happens.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) July 17, 2016 You want to talk about who s a fraud, @realDonaldTrump?
How about this?

The sham is over.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) July 17, 2016Donald Trump really should stop picking on Elizabeth Warren, because unlike the Republican leadership, she can t be bullied and has no problem burying him for his bullshit.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
