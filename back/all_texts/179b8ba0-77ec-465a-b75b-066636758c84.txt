It s not often that the stupidity of a racist has layers.
Typically a slur is aimed at a minority that is easily recognizable, disgusting and crass followed by a video being released and the internet calling the bigot in question out for it.
Occasionally, the imbecile will be found and karma will collect their job, or in the very least, they re forced to quit the internet.In this case, the story has one added hilarious twist: The dumbass shouts the slur, loses his job and gets called out and he couldn t even get it right.
During his hand-clapping chorus of Beaner!
Beaner!
Wetback!
Wetback!
the poster child for more education funding ignores one fun fact: The woman he is shouting at for being Latino tells him repeatedly that she is, in fact, of Arabic descent.That in and of itself shows just what a doofus the a-hole is.
In the obvious circles he has to run in, being Arabic is far worse than being Hispanic.
Hispanics are just drug dealers and rapists while Arabic people are all packing suicide vests.
Maybe he felt if he called her something as clever as towel head she would detonate.Or perhaps he really is just that stupid.The man, an Oregonian identified as an employee of a small company, Wolcott Plumbing, now has bigger fish to fry.
He ll be waiting in line Monday at the unemployment office.
After local station KGB got hold of the video and reported on it, a company official wrote: First of all, this is a very upsetting situation.
Under no circumstances do I personally nor do we as a company condone the use of abusive language of any kind to anyone.
Upon further investigation today, I learned and confirmed it was one of my employees in the video.
This employee was immediately terminated.
When will idiots like this racist numbskull learn that those cell phones aimed at them while they spew their stupidity are recording?
Hopefully not until after every single one is exposed.Featured image via screen capture
