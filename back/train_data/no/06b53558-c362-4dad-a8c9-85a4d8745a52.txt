a rookie dr. ben carson : i haven t said anything about me being the only one to do anything .
i m the only one to separate siamese twins .
the only one to operate on a babies while still in a mother s womb .
i m the only one to take out half a brain , although you would think if you go to washington that someone had beat me to it .
