harare ( reuters ) - zimbabwe s political parties want to give voters another two months to sign up for next year s election after political turmoil disrupted the registration process , an opposition official said .
the ruling party and opposition groups will ask electoral authorities on wednesday to extend next week s voter registration deadline into february , said douglas mwonzora , the secretary general of the movement for democratic change .
the army forced former president robert mugabe out of office last month , ousting the only leader the country has known since independence .
the military coup disturbed a lot of things .
during that period , many potential voters did not go out to register because there was serious political uncertainty in the country , said mwonzora , who also co-chairs an inter-party group monitoring voter registration .
so after taking all this into account we realized that we need to extend the registration exercise .
if we don t we will see voter apathy next year , he added .
zimbabwe started registering voters in september .
but its electoral commision said on tuesday just over 4 million voters out of a target of 7 million had signed up , eight days before the deadline to end the process .
part of the problem , said mwonzora , was that thousands of potential voters - who are classified as aliens because their parents are from other countries in southern africa - have only been able to register since last week , after a court ruling .
emmerson mnangagwa , who took over from mugabe , will be running to keep the job in the presidential and parliamentary elections due to take place by july .
