santiago ( reuters ) - chilean police prevented u.s. boxer mike tyson from entering the country citing non-compliance with immigration laws and were putting him on a flight home , the investigative police ( pdi ) said on thursday .
local media reported that the former world heavyweight champion was planning to attend an awards ceremony for action films taking place in santiago , chile s capital .
detectives from the international police are re-boarding mike tyson for not complying with immigration law , the pdi said on its verified twitter account on thursday , alongside a photograph of tyson walking in an airport with two individuals wearing pdi jackets .
the pdi did not specify which part of the law tyson did not comply with , and did not immediately respond to an email and a phone call seeking additional information .
tyson served three years of a six-year u.s. jail sentence for rape in 1992 .
in 2012 , new zealand revoked an entry visa for tyson after a charity that was going to benefit from his visit dropped its support due to his rape conviction .
