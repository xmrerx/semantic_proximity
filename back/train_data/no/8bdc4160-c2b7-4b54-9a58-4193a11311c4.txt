washington ( reuters ) - the united states on wednesday voiced concern about malaysia ’ s media crackdown and suggested that the extent of press and internet freedom in the asian country could affect prospects for expanded bilateral cooperation .
u.s. state department spokesman john kirby said washington was “ very concerned ” by malaysia ’ s recent restrictions of access to reporting on its domestic current affairs , including last week ’ s blocking of access to the malaysian insider , a news portal .
the malaysian insider has published reports on the scandal around 1malaysia development berhad and investigations into $ 681 million deposited into prime minister najib ’ s personal accounts .
the malaysian communications and multimedia commission said the news portal had breached laws under the communications and multimedia act , a 1998 law that bars using a website to publish “ any comment , request , suggestion or other communication which is obscene , indecent , false , menacing or offensive in character with intent to annoy , abuse , threaten or harass another person. ” najib has denied any wrongdoing over the money transferred into his account , saying that the funds were a political donation and that nothing was taken for his personal gain .
the united states is also troubled that the government has failed to provide due process to targeted media groups before blocking access and has begun criminal investigations of reporters , editors and publishers , kirby said .
“ of equal concern , many malaysian social media users face charges for postings critical of the government and national leaders , ” he added , saying malaysian officials have spoken about legal amendments “ that would further restrict online space. ” he said the united states hoped “ to expand our cooperation ” with malaysia on shared challenges , adding “ in that context , we urge the government of malaysia to ensure that all its laws , existing and future , fully respect freedom of expression , including the free flow of ideas on the internet . ”
