BERLIN (Reuters) - The European Union s budget commissioner Guenther Oettinger said on Thursday he expected German parties exploring a three-way Jamaica coalition government to strike a deal, warning that a failure of talks would damage Europe and strengthen populists.
There will be a Jamaica coalition ... nobody wants new elections, Oettinger told a business conference in Berlin.
The possible three-way alliance Chancellor Angela Merkel is trying to form is also called a Jamaica coalition because the parties colors match those of the Caribbean country s flag.
The Social Democrats (SPD), the second biggest party in the Bundestag lower house after Merkel s conservatives bloc, have decided to rebuild their forces in opposition after suffering their worst election result since 1933.
