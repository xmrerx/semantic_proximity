If you spent your weekend vacationing under a rock, you may be unaware that alt-Right (that means Nazi in a suit ) superstar Milo Yan Yann Yiann whatever the fuck his name is was busted in resurfaced videos saying that it s totally kosher for older men to have sex with children as long as they are 13 and have gone through puberty something he falsely claims is normal in the homosexual world.
The Breitbart editor had a pretty sweet book deal and was set to headline the annual Stupid People Convention (CPAC for short) but he lost both because of those goddamn liberals, according to conservative commentator and parttime scarecrow Ann Coulter.
Well, Milo learned HIS lesson.
Pederasty acceptable only for refugees and illegals.
Then libs will support you, Coulter tweeted Monday night.Well, Milo learned HIS lesson.
Pederasty acceptable only for refugees and illegals.

Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) February 21, 2017Now, of course no one has said pederasty is acceptable for anyone, let alone refugees and illegals, but that seems to be what we re going with here.
Those damned liberals at CPAC took everything away from Milo all because he indicated that he likes them really young.
Naturally, Twitter wasn t about to let Skeletor get away with defending pedophilia:@AnnCoulter, wait are you saying you support pederasty?
Colonel Lingus (@colonel_lingus) February 21, 2017@AnnCoulter Well that may be one of the most hateful, vial tweets I've ever read.
Do you know the definition of the term refugee?
Mark Schick (@synikol6) February 21, 2017@AnnCoulter either you are repulsed by what Milo has done, or you are normalizing his pedophilia.
Please choose wisely.

Thor Benson (@thor_benson) February 21, 2017@AnnCoulter Odd how the alt-right is outraged at FAKE Comet Pizza, but supportive of one of their own caught on tape supporting it.
SAD!
Sy Beck (@sy_beck) February 21, 2017@veelabgm @AnnCoulter No one is ok with this.
Pls stop being insulting.
It's not political.
No one should be ok with this.

@AnnCoulter How about doing what a human would, say his comments are repugnant and move on.
You can't help yourself can you girlfriend?

An angry monkey (@SageMonkeyMafia) February 21, 2017@AnnCoulter So republicans were ok with raping 13 yr olds, right?
It was liberals who got Milo booted?

@AnnCoulter Where your heart is supposed to be is a vile, black rottenness no one loves you, do they TenneyNaumer (@TenneyNaumer) February 21, 2017It s interesting that conservatives are up in arms over a fake story about a child prostitution ring run by Hillary Clinton out of the basement of a Washington, D.C. area pizza shop that doesn t even have a basement yet when one of their own literally says it s totally cool to molest children they re all like \_( )_/ .Here s a video of Milo saying this completely acceptable stuff for which liberals are persecuting him completely unfairly:Featured image via screengrab
