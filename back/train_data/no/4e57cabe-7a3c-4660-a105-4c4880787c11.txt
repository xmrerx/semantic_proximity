day in and day out , cnn works hard to try and convince american audiences that it s a legitimate news outlet , and it hopes that the public will take seriously the troubled news network s various on-screen actors and quasi-journalists .
on new year s eve , one of cnn s highly paid anchors , don lemon could be seen on national tv in new orleans with co-presenter brooke baldwin , as lemon proceeded to pound shots of tequila live on air , slurring his speech and shouting , while simultaneously getting his ear pierced during the program .
lemon then went on to sink into a melancholy diatribe about not being in a relationship ( lemon is gay ) and personal struggles with his own narcissism.the episode prompted many critics to question his psychological state , and also to ask whether or not lemon might have a serious drinking or substance problem.things got so bad that network producers had to pull the audio feed while drunk lemon began shouting 2016 was awful .
on the new york city feed , onlookers from cnn were obscure female american comedian , kathy griffin , joined by news presenter and actor anderson cooper , both of whom were enjoying the spectacle not at all concerned with the potential damage to lemon s reputation as a result of his alcoholic episode on air.griffin could be seen shouting , nipples !
nipples !
nipples !
