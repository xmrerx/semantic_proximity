One agent Gilad Azaria has 7 listings in Trump buildings, and since the election he s had 4 serious buyers in the $3 million range.
He also says 2 of his clients who already live in Trump properties want to trade up in the same buildings to more expensive places.
The agents with whom we spoke say the Trump properties are top quality, and the brand is now stronger than ever.
Celeb agents Josh and Matt Altman say it s a no-brainer living in a building owned by the president is awesome and a super good investment.
