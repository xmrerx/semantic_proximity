isis released a new video yesterday , where they threatened america and every other country they identify as the infidel .
meanwhile , we have a commander in chief who still refuses to identify them as terrorists or admit isis is actually fighting a holy war.i don t know maybe we re misunderstanding their message , but we re pretty sure they mention several times throughout the video that they are fighting a war for allah their latest video is pretty repulsive and we don t normally share their propaganda , but we thought is was worth viewing , given our president s insistence on convincing the world that isil is not islamic .
here s the jv team s latest video .
you be the judge .
are these evil beings waging a holy war , or are they as obama said only two days ago , just bad guys with guns and good social media ?
here s what obama has to say about isil in 2014 : do you ever wonder why barack obama refers to isis as isil when every terror expert refers to them as isis ?
