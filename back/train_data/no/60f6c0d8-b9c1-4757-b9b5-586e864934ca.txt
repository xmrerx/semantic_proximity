yenagoa , nigeria ( reuters ) - four britons have been kidnapped in nigeria s southern delta state , a police official said on wednesday .
the police are attempting to rescue the four people , who were taken by unidentified gunmen on oct. 13 , said andrew aniamaka , a spokesman for delta state police .
kidnapping for ransom is a common problem in parts of nigeria .
a number of foreigners have , in the last few years , been kidnapped in the niger delta region , which holds most of the country s crude oil - the country s economic mainstay .
the abductors have not made any contact but we are doing our investigations to know the motive and have them rescued without jeopardising their lives , said aniamaka .
information available to us shows they are missionaries giving free medical services , he said , adding that the british nationals had been working in a very rural area .
there was an increase in crime in the southern region last year that coincided with a series of attacks on energy facilities .
however , there have been no militant attacks on energy installations so far this year .
