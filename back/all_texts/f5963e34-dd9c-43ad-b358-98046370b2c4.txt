President Trump s deputy assistant Sebastian Gorka appeared on Anderson Cooper s 360 show, where he admonished the network for making up news about the Trump administration being in crisis and that they were in bunker mentality following the news story that broke about a June 2016 meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian Lawyer who promised dirt on Hillary, but instead wanted to talk about Russian adoptions.
Gorka told Cooper, It s laughable.
Your chyron talked about a bunker mentality.
I actually work in the West Wing, I work in the White House.
It is absolutely nothing of the kind, Trump s Deputy Assistant continued, We are pushing the Make America Great Again agenda, the president is a steam locomotive that cannot be stopped, it s just fake news.
I m sad to see CNN fall to this.
Gorka continued with his tongue-lashing of CNN s stone-faced host Cooper Anderson: I know you want salacious, sensational coverage for your ratings, so your corporate sponsors and owners will have more money but that s not media, that s not reportage, it s just fake news.
Cooper, remained surprisingly stoic as Gorka outed CNN s real agenda, which is clearly not reporting actual news, but instead, chasing ratings and ultimately money from advertisers.
When Gorka appeared to be finished, Cooper replied, Okay, I m just going to ignore the insults because I don t think it gets us anywhere.
Gorka quickly replied saying, It s not about you, its about actually having journalism back on TV.
Where are the Walter Cronkite s of yesteryear?
This is just about ratings and money.
It s actually quite sad.
