A former employee of Donald Trump s Trump University has become the star of a new campaign ad in which he testifies to some of the shady business practices used by the current Republican frontrunner s enterprise.
Cliff appears in a new ad from the conservative American Future Fund.
He identifies himself as a former salesman for Trump University, and tells viewers, with Donald Trump, you always have to read the fine print.

Despite the expensive advertising commitment, the most recent polling shows Trump is positioned to win the primary in the winner-take-all state, as he is currently leading Senator Marco Rubio by 7 percent, even though it is Rubio s home state.Trump has claimed that even though Trump University was labeled a bait-and-switch scheme by the New York State Attorney General, he and the company that operated it did nothing wrong.
Trump even said that should he be elected president, he had plans to resurrect the now-defunct company with his children running it.Featured image via YouTube
