Just call him Bring it Ben Ben Carson says he would have led a charge against the Oregon shooter if he were in the community college classroom when the gunfire erupted.
Not only would I probably not cooperate with him, I would not just stand there and let him shoot me.
I would say, Hey, guys, everybody attack him!
He may shoot me but he can t get us all, the soft-spoken Carson said Tuesday on Fox and Friends.
The gunman, Chris Harper-Mercer, asked his victims at Umpqua Community College their religions before opening fire last Thursday, killing nine and injuring nine others.
