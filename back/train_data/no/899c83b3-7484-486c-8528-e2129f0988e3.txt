kyle s own words : so for those of you who don t know , this past friday ( 12.16.2016 ) i was given the diagnosis i didn t want to hear .
it seems that i have stage 4 glioblastoma .
it s a very aggressive type of brain cancer .
currently , there is no cure , but there is a chance .
the doctor said it all depends on how hard we go after it , and how my body responds to the treatment .
i fully believe that god is still in the miracle-making business as well !
i m putting complete trust in god and i know regardless of the outcome , i ll be healed one way or another !
please continue to keep me in your thoughts and prayers .
thanks ya ll !
