algiers ( reuters ) - algeria s coastguard has picked up 286 illegal migrants heading across the mediterranean to europe by boat , the defence ministry has said .
the migrants were detained on several boats between thursday and saturday , according to a ministry statement carried on sunday by the state news agency , aps .
algeria has so far seen relatively few attempts to cross to europe by boat , compared to the hundreds of thousands of mostly african would-be migrants who have set off in search of prosperity or security from elsewhere along the north african coast , mostly from libya .
most illegal crossings from algeria take place in summer , when sailing conditions are more favorable .
neighboring tunisia has recently seen a surge in such departures as young unemployed people seek work in italy .
algeria s economy is also suffering as its vital energy revenues have been hit by a sharp fall in prices .
