i know there are only 60 days left to make our case and don t get complacent , don t see the latest outrageous , offensive , inappropriate comment and think well he s done now .
we are living in a volatile political environment .
you know , just to be grossly generalist , you could put half of trump s supporters into what i call the basket of deplorables .
the racist , sexist , homophobic , xenophobic , islamaphobic you name it .
and unfortunately there are people like that .
and he has lifted them up .
he has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people now have 11 million .
he tweets and retweets their offensive , hateful , mean-spirited rhetoric .
now some of these folks , they are irredeemable , but thankfully they are not america .
but the other basket and i know this because i see friends from all over america here i see friends from florida and georgia and south carolina and texas as well as , you know , new york and california but that other basket of people are people who feel that the government has let them down , the economy has let them down , nobody cares about them , nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures , and they re just desperate for change .
it doesn t really even matter where it comes from .
they don t buy everything he says , but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different .
they won t wake up and see their jobs disappear , lose a kid to heroin , feel like they re in a dead end .
those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well .
clinton : trump supporters in basket of deplorables : we need to add # basketofdeplorables to the list of hillary s unifying rhetoric : going to have to add # basketofdeplorables to the list of hillary s unifying rhetoric .
way to go hill ! # neverhillary pic.twitter.com/oahavpkkfq deplorable d owens ( @ nubianawakening ) september 10 , 2016
