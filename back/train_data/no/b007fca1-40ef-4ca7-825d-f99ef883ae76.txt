( reuters ) - florida power & light said on wednesday it had provided power to part of a nursing home that housed six residents who died after the facility lost electricity due to hurricane irma , adding that it was not on a county priority list for emergency power restoration .
parts of the facility itself were energized by fpl , i can t give you anything more specific than that at this point , fpl spokesman rob gould told a news conference , referring to the rehabilitation center of hollywood hills .
two elderly residents were found dead at the nursing home , and four later died at a hospital .
police opened a criminal investigation at the nursing home in broward county , which is north of miami .
some residents were evacuated on early sunday morning and some woke up feeling sick at the center , which had been without air conditioning , broward county mayor barbara sharief said .
gould said fpl met with broward county officials in march before the storm season to discuss what facilities would be prioritized for power restoration this year .
they identified which facilities were to be critical top infrastructure facilities , this was not one of them , he said about the hollywood hills center .
broward county officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
fpl , a subsidiary of nextera energy inc , has said earlier this week that the company prioritizes restoring power to critical facilities such as hospitals , police and fire stations , communications centers , water treatment plants , transportation and shelter .
gould said the incident at hollywood hills emphasizes that all facilities need to have backup plans in case power is lost during storms .
memorial regional hospital , a facility across from the nursing home , was identified as a top priority by the county and had power , gould said .
florida has more than 680 nursing homes that house about 73,000 residents , the florida health care association said .
