Mubashra Uddin, a 20-year-old Muslim college student and daughter of Pakistani immigrants dropped her newborn infant out of an eight-story apartment window in Chicago on November 11, 2015, and was just sentenced to only four years of probation.In the strict Muslim home where Uddin was raised, even speaking to boys particularly African-American ones was forbidden, relatives said.When her Pakistan-born parents found out about her boyfriend, they pulled her out of the high school and home-schooled her for her last two years, according to her family and friends.Uddin found out she was pregnant when she was 19 and only told her boyfriend and her closest friend.
But in the strict Muslim home where Uddin was raised, even speaking to boys particularly African-American ones was forbidden, relatives said.
When her Pakistan-born parents found out about her boyfriend, they pulled her out of the high school and home-schooled her for her last two years, according to her family and friends.She gave birth in her room in a three-bedroom apartment shared with her family in Chicago s Uptown neighborhood.Shortly after giving birth, she heard her mother coming down the hall and dropped her newborn out of her eight-story window.The newborn suffered broken ribs, a fractured skull, and spine, and a lacerated aorta and liver.
A neighbor found the infant, still alive, on the ground, wrapped her up, and brought her to the hospital where she later died.
The act of dropping a newborn out of an eighth-story window to its eventual death is exceedingly evil, exceedingly cruel, Judge James Brown said Thursday as he ordered Uddin held without bail.
With all her family has put her through, I m surprised she didn t jump out of the window herself, said the mother of Uddin s former boyfriend, who asked not to be identified in order to keep her son s identity secret.
Sometimes she felt under pressure to be this perfect daughter even pressure to be this perfect Muslim woman that prayed, fasted, was humble and also didn t make mistakes, a longtime friend, identified only as Nina O., wrote to the judge.Uddin loved babies, according to family and friends.Prosecutors said that after she admitted guilt, police searched her home and found bloody sheets, bloody scissors and blood on the floor next to her bed, as well as near and on the window.
