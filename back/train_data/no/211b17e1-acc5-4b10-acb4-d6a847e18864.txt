budapest ( reuters ) - hungary is facing a frontal assault from u.s. financier george soros who is attacking the country via his non-government organizations and european union bureaucrats , a top ruling party politician said on monday .
fidesz vice chairman gergely gulyas said soros claims that the hungarian government lied in its campaign against him were not substantial , adding the billionaire and the european union pushed the same pro-migrant agenda .
