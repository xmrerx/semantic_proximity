athens ( reuters ) - greek centrists elected politician fofi gennimata on sunday to lead a center-left party alliance , hoping to win back voters disillusioned after seven years of crisis and boost their popularity as the country emerges from bailouts .
past attempts by centrists to form parties and alliances have not fared well and the latest bid is seen as a last-ditch effort to restore unity and attract voters , many of whom defected to the ruling leftist syriza party over the years of painful bailout reforms .
the new alliance includes greece s once-powerful socialist pasok party , which gennimata already leads , the democratic socialist movement , the democratic left and the to potami party .
gennimata won about 58 percent of the vote .
pasok ruled greece for decades but has seen its popularity sliding to single-digit figures since 2010 , when it signed up to greece s first bailout from the eu and the international monetary fund in return for draconian austerity .
it has 19 seats in the 300-member parliament .
the centre-left potami , which was founded in 2014 and first entered parliament with 6.1 percent in a 2015 national election now ranks eighth in opinion polls with 1.5 percent .
it has six mps .
greece s leftist-led syriza government was catapulted to power in january 2015 promising to end austerity .
it was forced to sign up to a new rescue package , the country s third bailout a few months later .
that bailout expires in august .
prime minister alexis tsipras term ends in 2019 and he says he will seek a new four-year mandate then .
but his ratings have been sagging in opinion polls behind the main opposition , the conservative new democracy party .
