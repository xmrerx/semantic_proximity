STEPHANIE RUHLE of MSNBC was on with a panel of liberals when she blurted out: I too have a pre-existing condition.
I m a woman, Ruhle said to a panel that seemed to agree with her.The left has been broadening and redefining what a pre-existing condition is but this is ridiculous!Ruhle said that president Trump will have a hands-off approach to healthcare now because he got his win, but another panelist couldn t let that comment go as he claimed five times that this was not a win for the president.
No, he didn t get a win.
He got something he could claim is a win.
It is so far from being a win; it is disgusting what he does by having a ceremony in the White House Rose Garden making it seem like he has a win but he s doesn t have a win.
His win is not a reality.
The anger and hate runs deep with this group https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=44&v=tWSH3JMVUaU SHE S BEEN IN HOT WATER BEFORE:OOPS!
She had to apologize for saying FOX held their Christmas party at the Trump hotel.
