geneva ( reuters ) - a blockade of yemen s key ports appeared to have been broken on wednesday as ships arrived with food and fuel for the desperate population , the head of the norwegian refugee council ( nrc ) , an humanitarian aid agency , told reuters .
a saudi-led military coalition fighting the armed houthi movement in yemen has blockaded yemeni ports since nov. 6 , after saudi arabia intercepted a missile fired toward its capital riyadh .
although it later eased the restrictions by allowing u.n. flights and aid ships , that has not changed yemen s dire situation much .
about 8 million people are on the brink of famine with outbreaks of cholera and diphtheria .
today for the first time ( there was ) a little glimmer of hope ... the first commercial goods have arrived in port , and the first ships that were let through this iron grip , nrc chief jan egeland said .
egeland said the first food and fuel had arrived in the key ports of hodeidah and saleef , but it remained a trickle compared to what was needed , since yemen s population of 27 million is almost entirely reliant on imports for food , fuel and medicine .
we need a lot of ships every single day and now we ve had months with no ships , so i still fear the famine , i still fear starvation , i still fear epidemic disease in new areas .
citing information from the u.n.-led logistics cluster of aid agencies , egeland said three vessels had berthed at hodeidah with 87,000 tonnes of food , and one with 38,000 of food had arrived at the anchorage area of saleef port .
there were seven other vessels with more than 177,000 tonnes of food waiting to enter hodeidah anchorage area , as well as three vessels with 52,000 tonnes of fuel .
