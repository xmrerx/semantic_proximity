moscow ( reuters ) - the kremlin on tuesday warned supporters of detained opposition leader alexei navalny not to hold unsanctioned rallies , saying the organizers of such events would be prosecuted .
a russian court sentenced navalny to his third jail term this year on monday , disrupting plans by the long-time kremlin critic to campaign before russia s presidential election in 2018 .
his 20-day jail term means he will miss a campaign rally planned in president vladimir putin s hometown of st petersburg on oct. 7 - the russian leader s birthday .
the kremlin warned navalny s supporters to refrain from holding any unsanctioned rallies in his absence .
public calls for unsanctioned events and rallies run counter to the legislation in force and , certainly , their organizers will be prosecuted , kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told a conference call with reporters .
