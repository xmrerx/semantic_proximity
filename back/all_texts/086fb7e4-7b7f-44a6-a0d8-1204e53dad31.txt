Here s a news flash for Donald Trump: Mexico won t be paying for his racist little wall Not now, not tomorrow, not six months from now, not ever.
On Friday, Trump made himself the subject of mockery after inexplicably claiming that Mexico will pay for the wall later if American taxpayers foot the bill first, and that he would seek repayment through a negotiation of NAFTA.
In other words, you re paying for the wall and Mexico will still not be paying for it later, but at least Trump can get it built.Trump s team has made a number of wacky proposals related to paying for the wall, including amending the Patriot Act to include wire transfers as accounts that could be frozen and otherwise punishing Mexico for their refusal to fund what could possibly be the most fiscally irresponsible undertaking since, well, any of the bazillion businesses Trump has bankrupted.
They have even discussed tying it to the appropriations process, which could force Democrats to agree to funding to keep the government from shutting down but, once again, don t worry, Mexico will totally pay us back.
Dishonest media says Mexico won t be paying for the wall if they pay a little later so the wall can be built more quickly, Trump tweeted, once again attacking the well, his followers seem very fond of the phrase Lugenpresse, or lying press.
He ended this rant with a phrase that certainly appeals to a crowd that calls everything they hate fake news, but makes the rest of us question his sanity: Media is fake!

Media is fake!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017If you think this sounds like a night out at the bar with a drunk friend of a friend of a friend who lost his wallet but assures you his roommate Chubbs will reimburse you for his beer later minutes after Chubbs told him to buy his own f*cking beer, that wasn t lost on the rest of the world.
You re never getting your beer money back.
He knows it, you know it, and Chubbs knows it because he s not giving the dude a cent.
Naturally, Twitter was all over this:@NewsOnPictures @Prairies @DaveSFoley He sure does live in his own fantasy world.
Like thinking Mexico will pay for the wall.

The beginning of state run media #UnapologeticBitch (@isabellegirlxo) January 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump Career journalists are fake!
Game show host who claims he can force foreign country to pay for our infrastructure is real!
Jon Bershad (@JonBershad) January 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump I'm sure Mexico will pay for it.
Just like I know you're going to drain the swamp and release your taxes.

@realDonaldTrump is straight channeling Wimpy: "I'll have a hamburger, for which I will gladly pay you on Tuesday."

Ever.
They've said as much.
Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) January 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump No Mexico said they won't be paying for the wall.
You know Mexico.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump until you show a check Mexico wrote for that wall or a contract to pay later, the only fake thing is you saying they'll pay Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) January 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump BTW, I joined Twitter to just call you out on your bullsh*t. It helps me sleep at night.

@realDonaldTrump if you want the wall built so quickly, put your hands in your own pockets and pay for it.
Ceindreadh (@ceindreadh) January 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump I'm mexican and the only wall I'd build is one made of tacos!
Tacos for everyone cabrones!
Gerardo Perry (@gerardoperry) January 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump This tweet doesn't even make sense.
But if Mexico says they won't pay, I trust them.
That has nothing to do with the media.
pinkieBEAN (@pinkiebean) January 9, 2017@realDonaldTrumpWTF?
HOW CAN ANYONE NOT REGRET VOTING FOR YOU?
Cobblestone Creative (@hankpena) January 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump The only wall you should be building is the one between you and your conflicts of interest.
tim simon (@TimFlight57211) January 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump asking people to believe Mexico will pay layer is the lamest political trick ever.
Mario Ferro (@Mario4change) January 9, 2017Following Trump s new Mexico will pay for the wall later claim, former President of the country Vicente Fox Quesada called the wall another promise Trump can t keep:Trump may ask whoever he wants, but still neither myself nor Mexico are going to pay for his racist monument.Another promise he can't keep.
Vicente Fox Quesada (@VicenteFoxQue) January 6, 2017Former Mexican ambassador to China Jorge Guajardo explained that it would be better for Mexico to scrap NAFTA and find a trade agreement with a country that doesn t expect them to pay for such a monumental waste.After meeting with Trump last year, President Enrique Pe a Nieto made it very clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall a stance repeated later by then-foreign minister Claudia Ruiz Massieu, who told a TV station Paying for a wall is not part of our vision.
Look, Trump, Mexico isn t paying for the wall, and your incessant claims to the contrary only make yourself and our nation look stupid.
Let s make one thing crystal clear: Mexico will not be paying for the wall, nor will we.
