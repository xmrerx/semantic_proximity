Donald Trump has been crowned 2016 Person of the Year by Time Magazine.
He is no doubt over the moon with all of his winning.
The rest of us were left looking at his orange face staring back from the cover and wondering WTF?
However, when you look at past recipients of this award you begin to see that maybe this designation is fitting after all.Adolf Hitler started WWII and inflicted human suffering on an unprecedented level.
He was responsible for the death of tens of millions of people, including more than 20 million in the Soviet Union.
Hitler was the man behind concentration camps and gas chambers.
And he was named Man of the Year by Time in 1938.Image via TimeJoseph Stalin was the dictator of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) from 1929 to 1953.
Under Stalin, the Soviet Union was transformed from a peasant society into an industrial and military superpower.
However, he ruled by terror, and millions of his own citizens died during his brutal reign.
He was named Time s Man of the Year twice, receiving the title in both 1939 and 1942.Image via TimeMore recently, in 2007, Vladimir Putin was Time s Person of the Year.
This guy requires no history lesson.
He is the president of Russia and was so anxious for Trump to win the presidency that he interfered in the U.S. election to ensure Hillary Clinton was defeated.Image via TimeWhen you look at it in that context, Trump being named this year s Person of the Year isn t so out of place.
Indeed, Time has bestowed this award upon some of the most brutal dictators in recent history.
With this understanding, Trump s face on the cover is all the more terrifying.
Actually, it makes you wonder if maybe, just maybe, Time is trying to tell us something.Featured image via Twitter screen shot
