naypyitaw ( reuters ) - myanmar leader aung san suu kyi said on tuesday there had been an erosion of trust and understanding between communities of rakhine state , but did not refer to the hundreds of thousands of rohingya muslims who have fled since a military crackdown there .
of the many challenges that our government has been facing , the situation in the rakhine has most strongly captured the attention of the world , suu kyi said in a speech at a ceremony to welcome pope francis in the capital , naypyitaw , on the second day of his visit to the country .
as we address longstanding issues , social , economic and political , that have eroded trust and understanding , harmony and cooperation , between different communities in rakhine , the support of our people and of good friends who only wish to see us succeed in our endeavors , has been invaluable , she said .
more than 620,000 rohingya have left northern rakhine state over the past three months to escape what amnesty international has dubbed crimes against humanity , gathering in refugee camps at the southern tip of neighboring bangladesh .
the united states has accused myanmar of ethnic cleansing against the rohingya , but china has stood by the country and suu kyi is due to travel to beijing later this week .
suu kyi , a nobel peace laureate and champion of democracy who for years faced down the junta that long ruled her country , has faced condemnation from around the globe for expressing doubts about reports of rights abuses against the rohingya and failing to condemn the military .
