berlin ( reuters ) - some 59 percent of germans want a three-way coalition of chancellor angela merkel s conservatives , the pro-business free democrats and the environmentalist greens to rule after a national election last sunday , a poll showed .
the survey for broadcaster zdf found around one fifth ( 22 percent ) of germans thought a so-called jamaica coalition would be bad while 15 percent would not mind it .
the alliance is so called in reference to the three parties colors : black , yellow and green , which are also those of the jamaican flag .
appetite for a repeat of the grand coalition of merkel s conservatives and the social democrats ( spd ) , who have governed germany for the last four years , was weak , the poll found .
only around a fifth ( 23 percent ) would prefer such a tie-up to a jamaica coalition while 41 percent thought it would be worse .
the spd , which suffered its worst result in the post-war era in sunday s election , has said it will go into opposition at the national level - a move that almost two-thirds ( 63 percent ) found good .
