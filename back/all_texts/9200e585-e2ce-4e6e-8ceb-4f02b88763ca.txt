On your way into work you may occasionally see portable electronic traffic signs that keep you aware of oncoming traffic problems or perhaps an exit being closed.
Here s the thing, though, those signs can be programmed to say anything.
Which is exactly what happened to the Texas Department of Transportation early on Tuesday morning in Dallas, Texas.Three signs seemed to be affected, with one reading, Bernie for President, and another reading, Work is Canceled Go Back Home.
However, the third one said something pretty damn hilarious, and perhaps honest, who s really to know without proof it s not.
It read, Donald Trump is a Shape-Shifting Lizard!

I mean, for goodness sake, Donald Trump is the presumptive GOP nominee.
It really doesn t get much more bizarre than that.
And for the sake of America, let s make sure he doesn t actually win.Featured image via video screen capture
