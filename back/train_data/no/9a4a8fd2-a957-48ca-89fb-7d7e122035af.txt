dubai ( reuters ) - - enemies are unlikely to attack iran , especially on the ground , the country s military chief predicted on saturday , saying even unwise leaders in the west know that any such conflict would have huge costs for them .
u.s. president donald trump , adopting an aggressive posture towards iran after its test launch of a ballistic missile , said in february that nothing is off the table in dealing with tehran , and the white house said it was putting iran on notice .
in the remote case of an aggression ( by enemies ) , this won t be on the ground because they would face brave warriors , iran s semi-official news agency tasnim quoted military chief of staff general mohammad baqeri as saying .
thank god , even the unwise who lead world arrogance ( the west ) ... can conclude that attacking the islamic republic would entail heavy costs , baqeri said at an air defense exhibition .
even if they would control the start of an aggression , they would not have a say about its end and they won t even be able to limit the war to iran s borders , baqeri added .
the united states imposed unilateral sanctions against iran last month after saying the ballistic missile tests violated a u.n. resolution , which endorsed a 2015 nuclear deal between tehran and world powers to lift sanctions .
the resolution called upon tehran not to undertake activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons , including launches using such technology .
it stopped short of explicitly barring such activity .
iran denies its missile development breaches the resolution , saying its missiles are not designed to carry nuclear weapons .
