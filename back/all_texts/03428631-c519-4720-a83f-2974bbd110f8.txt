With only three clowns left in GOP clown car, Republicans are doing everything they can to prevent Donald Trump from winning the Republican presidential nomination.
During a segment on The Late Show, Stephen Colbert hilariously mocks Trump s victory tantrum and explains the only two ways to stop Trump from securing the nomination.Since the Republican primary race is being dominated by a has been reality TV star, Colbert appropriately likens the race to The Bachelor.
Colbert lampoons Ohio governor John Kasich s claim that he can still win the nomination after his only win in Ohio.
Colbert quips that Kasich would have to be made the governor of every remaining state in the U.S. in order for the candidate to have any real chance of winning the nomination.So, even though Kasich has not dropped out of the race, the only possible person left in the race who could defeat Trump is The Zodiac Killer Ted Cruz.
That isn t good news for the GOP or the U.S. Cruz, while he has yet to start a race riot at a campaign event, is actually far worse than Trump in terms of policy.
Cruz is also incredibly creepy.
Colbert jokes at the idea of Cruz winning the Republican nomination, saying: If every single Trump voter unites behind him, he could get enough delegates to be the nominee.
Then the GOP establishment can say, Goodbye, candidate we don t like!
Hello, candidate, we can t stand!
If Cruz cannot secure enough votes to secure the nomination, Republicans will have one final shot at defeating Trump a brokered convention.
So if Trump doesn t get to 1,237 delegates in the first round of voting, they re all free to vote for whoever.
Which is great news.
The Republican campaign can start all over again, only this time it s all crammed into one week.
You can binge watch the death of the GOP!
