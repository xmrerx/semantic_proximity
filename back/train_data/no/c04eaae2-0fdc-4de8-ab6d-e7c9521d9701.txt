berlin ( reuters ) - a syrian man living in germany was jailed for three and a half years on wednesday for his part in the kidnapping of a u.n. peacekeeper near damascus four years ago .
the man , who was not named , was found guilty of being an accessory to the abduction , according to a statement from the german court that tried him which did not go into details on what he did .
the u.n. peacekeeper , who served in the demilitarized zone between syria and israel on the golan heights , was kidnapped in feb. 2013 , the higher regional court in the southwestern german city of stuttgart said .
prosecutors had in january 2016 identified the syrian man as suliman a.-s. under german privacy laws and said they suspected him of being a member of the islamic militant nusra front group .
they said the group had demanded a ransom from the united nations , the canadian government and the peacekeeper s family in exchange for his release .
the court did not give his nationality .
the u.n. peacekeeper eventually escaped eight months after his abduction , the court said .
it said there was not enough evidence to conclude that nusra front was behind the kidnapping nor that the syrian man was a member of the militant group .
the accused was found guilty under the code on international criminal law of being an accessory to a war crime against a peacekeeping mission that involved kidnapping for ransom , three counts of attempted robbery by blackmail and grievous unlawful detention , the court wrote in a statement .
