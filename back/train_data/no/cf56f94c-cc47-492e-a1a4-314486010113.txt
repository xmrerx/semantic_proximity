paris ( reuters ) - marine le pen , the leader of france s far-right national front , said the party would rebuild after her number two quit on thursday and said she would continue to campaign against the eu and for national sovereignty .
the national front will rebuild itself without difficulty , she told lcp television .
there are lots of talented people , lots of people with profile ... that i am going to lead .
her deputy florian philippot , who advocated a strong line against the euro and drafted the manifesto for this year s presidential election , when le pen resounding lost the run-off to emmanuel macron , quit over policy differences .
rather than softening her stance on the eu in the wake of his departure , le pen said she would pursue that line .
national sovereignty is a mainstay of our struggle , she said .
we will continue to fight the european union with all our soul because it is an instrument for the elimination and impoverishment of our people .
