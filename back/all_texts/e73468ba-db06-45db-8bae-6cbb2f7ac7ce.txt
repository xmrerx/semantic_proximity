Thank goodness someone is closing down the free-for all that s been happening with immigration for way too long!
Did you know we let 50k diversity lottery winners come to America every year just because some government bureaucrat decided we needed more diversity.
Oy vey!
This lottery has gotten to be scam whereby favored people are given preference to immigrate.
It needs to end NOW!Sen.
Tom Cotton and Georgia Sen. David Perdue have started taking steps to crack down on legal immigration, a focus shared by the Trump administration.
They ll formally propose legislation on the matter as soon as today.

Restricts the number of refugees allowed into the country to 50k annually similar to rates outlined in Trump s travel ban.
