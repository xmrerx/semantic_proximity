benghazi , libya ( reuters ) - armed men blew up a pipeline pumping crude oil to es sider port on tuesday , cutting libya s output by up to 100,000 barrels per day ( bpd ) , military and oil sources said .
the state-run national oil corporation ( noc ) said in statement output had been reduced by 70,000-100,000 bpd .
the cause of the blast was unclear , it added .
the attackers arrived at the site near marada in two cars and planted explosives on the pipeline , a military source said .
pictures purportedly showing a huge cloud from the blast in central eastern libya circulated on social media .
the damage was still being assessed , one oil source said .
oil prices rose on the report .
islamic state fighters had a presence in the area until government forces expelled them from their main stronghold in sirte a year ago .
the operator of the pipeline is waha , a subsidiary of the noc and a joint venture with hess corp , marathon oil corp and conocophillips .
waha pumps a total 260,000 barrels a day , its chairman said last month .
the north african state s oil production was last put by officials at around one million bpd but exact figures are hard to obtain in a country riven by factional conflict .
