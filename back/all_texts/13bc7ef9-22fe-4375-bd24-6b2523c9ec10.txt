CNN political hack Alison Camarota wants to nail President Trump but Former Independent Counsel Ken Starr says he sees no obstruction .
Starr goes on to say that it s a very hard case to make.
Camarota comes back and tries to make the HOPE comment by Trump to be an admission of guilt Starr isn t buying it:She really, really wants this but Starr says she s going to intent .
It s very hard to prove and to know someone s intent BINGO!
Starr hit the nail on the head with the last comment!Starr also goes through the same thing with George Stephanopolous: Notice how Stephanopoulos tries desperately to get Ken Starr to claim Trump is guilty It s a full-on deep state press with the constant media bashing of President Trump.
It s become a surreal experience to just attempt to listen to the blathering liberals on CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, MSNBC and other local liberal hack stations.
All credibility is lost
