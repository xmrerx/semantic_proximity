LONDON (Reuters) - Former Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said on Friday that both supporters and opponents of Brexit were among the 30 lawmakers who back a plot to topple British Prime Minister Theresa May.
Divisions over May s future burst into the open on Friday after her conference speech was ruined by a comedian, coughing fit and even letters falling off the slogans behind her on stage.
Shapps told BBC radio that there was a broad range of lawmakers urging May to step down.
These are Remainers, they are Brexiteers.
They would never automatically agree on a single candidate and this is not about promoting an individual, he said.
