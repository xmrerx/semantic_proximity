21st century wire says no doubt about it .
in comparison to washington s other weapons trafficking exploits , like operation fast & furious , this one is even more reckless , dangerous , totally unethical and completely illegal .
back in 2011 , president obama green-lighted one of the cia s worst ever operations one which resulted in a five year-long flood of weapons , ammunition right into the hands of moderate terrorist fighters running wild in syria.in total , hundreds of millions in us taxpayer funds have been spent on arming terrorists in syria .
this is no accident .
obama assured arab monarchs that the us would supply the weapons for the proxy war in syria.the twisted logic and naive optimism of washington elites was such that they were convinced that these terrorists would eventually bring syria to its knees and topple the government in damascus enabling the us-led coalition to divide up syria and rules over a protracted period of chaos in the region , not caring about the collateral damage they have caused along the way.somehow , we are meant be believe that the current us president really cares about gun control , and yet here he is running point one of the largest illegal weapons-tracking operations in history , and not a crocodile tear is shed for any of the hundreds of thousands of innocent syrian lives that have been lost because of this criminal us policy.this is proof that the us has been actively undermining the ceasefire in syria , but it s only the tip of iceberg ihs janes 360documents released by the us government s federal business opportunities ( fbo ) website have provided an indication of the types and numbers of eastern european weapons and ammunition the united states is providing to syrian rebel groups as part of a programme that continues despite the widely respected ceasefire in that country .
[ the following manifest was make available through official channels ] the fbo has released two solicitations in recent months looking for shipping companies to transport explosive material from eastern europe to the jordanian port of aqaba on behalf of the us navy s military sealift command.released on 3 november 2015 , the first solicitation sought a contractor to ship 81 containers of cargo that included explosive material from constanta in bulgaria to aqaba.the solicitation was subsequently updated with a detailed packing list that showed the cargo had a total weight of 994 tonnes , a little under half of which was to be unloaded at agalar , a military pier near the turkish town of tasucu , the other half at aqaba.the cargo listed in the document included ak-47 rifles , pkm general-purpose machine guns , dshk heavy machine guns , rpg-7 rocket launchers , and 9k111m faktoria anti-tank guided weapon ( atgw ) systems .
the faktoria is an improved version of the 9k111 fagot atgw , the primary difference being that its missile has a tandem warhead for defeating explosive reactive armour ( era ) fitted to some tanks.read more syria news at : 21st century wire syria files
