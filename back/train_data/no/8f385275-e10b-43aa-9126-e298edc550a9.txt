riyadh ( reuters ) - britain and saudi arabia signed a framework deal on military and security cooperation , saudi state news agency spa said on tuesday , redoubling efforts to counter iran in the gulf region and defeat islamic state .
prime minister theresa may said in december that britain would invest over 3 billion pounds ( $ 4.05 billion ) in defense in gulf arab states over the next decade as it seeks to build on traditionally strong ties with the conservative , oil-wealthy monarchies before its planned departure from the european union .
british defence secretary michael fallon discussed military cooperation with crown prince mohammed bin salman , who serves as the kingdom s defense minister and deputy prime minister , the spa report said without providing details of the agreement .
gulf arab states say iran is trying to expand its influence in arab countries , including syria , iraq and yemen .
since march 2015 , saudi arabia and arab allies have been waging war against iran-aligned houthi forces that seized control of much of yemen .
britain s close relationship with gulf states has drawn concern from human rights groups , including criticism of saudi air strikes in yemen s war that have killed hundreds of civilians .
british military personnel have been working with the saudi forces .
