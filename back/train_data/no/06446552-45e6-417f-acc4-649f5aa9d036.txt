the day after a federal judge in san francisco blocked part of alleged president donald trump s executive order threatening sanctuary cities with losing federal funds if they do not comply with requests from immigration enforcement agents , the former reality show star began attacking the decision on twitter in an early morning tweetstorm .
you knew this was coming.once again , the man-baby potus called his muslim ban a ban , thus proving why the ninth circuit court previously ruled against his executive order .
first the ninth circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings .
see you in the supreme court ! , it tweeted.first the ninth circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings .
see you in the supreme court !

donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) april 26 , 2017trump s executive order on tuesday was halted by judge william orrick who granted a preliminary injunction against section 9 ( a ) of executive order 13768 , which sought to ensure , in part , that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable federal law do not receive federal funds , except as mandated by law .
orrick noted that the order threatened hundreds of millions of federal dollars at the local level , writing that , the constitution vests the spending powers in congress , not the president , so the order can not constitutionally place new conditions on federal funds .
the internet was quick to respond to trump s latest twitter-tantrum .
@ realdonaldtrump this is a lie.the supreme court only takes 0.1 % of ninth circuit cases for review .
of that , 80 % get overturned.tiny percentage .

( @ rvawonk ) april 26 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump pic.twitter.com/dknli3bp0a hassan ( @ hassanprg ) april 26 , 2017so much winning with donald trump !
he can not ban muslims from entering the country .
he couldn t get support behind the shit sandwich healthcare plan he endorsed to replace obamacare .
trump is holding the highest office in the land and can not legislate .
he s an abject failure who has duped his supporters into believing that he will build a wall across our southern border , lock hillary clinton up , defeat isis and repeal obamacare on day one .
none of that is happening and yet , his supporters stick by him .
however , on social media , there appears to be less enthusiasm for the amateur president.he can t defeat isis while banning refugees who are fleeing from terror at the hands of isis .
it plays right into the terrorist group s agenda .
