tripoli ( reuters ) - libyan families displaced from a town ransacked after the toppling of muammar gaddafi in 2011 will be allowed to return home in february , the u.n.-backed government said on tuesday after more than a year of negotiations .
the deal , if implemented , would be a step toward reconciliation in the north african oil producing country , which is heavily divided between competing factions , communities , tribes and governments since 2011 .
residents of the town of tawergha were expelled by former anti-gaddafi rebels in 2011 in retaliation for the strongman having used their settlement as a launch pad for attacks on the western city of misrata during the uprising .
they have been living in camps and makeshift settlements in poverty across libya and were banned from returning home .
they faced abuse and arbitrary arrest since videos surfaced purportedly showing some of them joining gaddafi forces in 2011 .
within the frame of achieving the national reconciliation ... as well as to develop the basics of state of law and institutions , i declare today the beginning of return of tawergha families to their town on the first of february , the tripoli-based prime minister fayez seraj said in a statement .
the town , which is east of misrata , has been a ghost town since it was looted by misrata forces in 2011 .
some 40,000 people were displaced , according to human rights watch s website .
the government will pay compensation to the relatives of those who were killed and to those who had been detained , wounded or whose homes were destroyed in the conflict , it said .
a spokesman for the misrata city council confirmed the deal , saying it was up to the government to implement it .
