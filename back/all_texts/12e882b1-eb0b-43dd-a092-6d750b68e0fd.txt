Sharpton, that we are prepared when this happens so we don t just wake up one day blindsided, she added.
I think it s just going to get so tight and it s going to close in and then everybody is going to be indicted around this president, and then he is going to realize he is probably next on the list.
And I think he is going to come up with an excuse like somebody is trying to kill Barron, and so I m going to resign.
