After his joint press conference with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto, Donald Trump told the press that the two had discussed his wall, but not who would pay for it.It was Trump s easy out on the issue the ability for him to say that discussions on the wall were preliminary.
While Trump may have been correct that the two nations respect the right of either nation to build a physical wall, his claim that it wasn t discussed was, as is everything else he says, complete bullsh*t. The AP reports that Nieto has spoken out on the wall issue, and Trump is surely furious.
Pena Nieto says he told Trump that Mexico won t pay for border wall, contradicting Trump, who says it was not discussed, the Associated Press Twitter account shot out shortly after Trump s photo-op in Mexico was completed.BREAKING: Pena Nieto says he told Trump that Mexico won't pay for border wall, contradicting Trump, who says it was not discussed AP Politics (@AP_Politics) August 31, 2016President Nieto was also very clear on the issue via Twitter:Al inicio de la conversaci n con Donald Trump dej claro que M xico no pagar por el muro.
Enrique Pe a Nieto (@EPN) August 31, 2016 At the beginning of the conversation with Donald Trump, he said, I made it clear that Mexico will not pay for the wall.
The border wall has been the central part of The Donald s campaign since the early days when he called all Mexicans rapists drug dealers and criminals, and pledged to build The Wall to keep the brown people from further ruining our Great White Nation.
This promise has been an important part of growth with key Trump demographics like white supremacists, Klansmen, neo-Nazis, and closet racists.Unfortunately for the 2016 Republican nominee s followers, he appears to have all but given up on building their favorite thing ever.
What you guys didn t think it was really going to happen, did you?
Still think Mexico is going to pay for it, guys?
