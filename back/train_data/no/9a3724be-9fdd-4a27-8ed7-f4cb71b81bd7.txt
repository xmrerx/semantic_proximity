is anyone else thinking what we re thinking about the violent riot that happened in berkeley , california last night ?
where the hell were the police ? ? ?
this was being reported on live tv and all you could see were protesters and not cops .
it s up to the local authorities to send in protection so it s not up to the cops .
why were the local authorities not prepared for this ?
