nice , france ( reuters ) - russian businessman and lawmaker suleiman kerimov was arrested by french police at nice airport on monday evening in connection with a tax evasion case , an official at the french prosecutor s office said on tuesday .
kerimov is ranked by forbes magazine as russia s 21st wealthiest businessman , with a net worth of $ 6.3 billion .
his family controls russia s largest gold producer polyus .
he is being held for questioning in a case related to laundering of tax fraud proceeds , the official said .
representatives for kerimov could not immediately be reached for comment .
polyus declined to comment .
a source said the investigation centers on the purchase of several luxury residences on the french riviera via shell companies , something that would have enabled kerimov to reduce taxes owed to the french state .
the source added kerimov would be held in custody for at least another 24 hours .
russia s foreign ministry said in a statement carried by interfax news agency that kerimov held a diplomatic passport and had immunity .
it said it had informed the french authorities .
kerimov does have a diplomatic passport , but that does not protect him from prosecution , the french official said .
the french foreign ministry could not immediately confirm it had been in contact with moscow .
a french diplomatic source said immunity was given by governments to people on diplomatic lists or if they had been mandated with a specific mission in the country .
