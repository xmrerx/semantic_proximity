it s fascinating that even before any facts related to the flint water crisis were available , the hollywood liberal elite and leftist s across america were calling for the head of michigan s republican governor .
now that the evidence is overwhelmingly pointing to a corrupt and incompetent epa along with incompetent democrat public officials in flint , mi. , will the media start correctly placing the blame where it belongs ?
watch big mouth activist michael moore attempting to inject his rancor into the flint water crisis , as a way to draw attention to himself and place blame on republican governor rick snyder instead of the actual culprit , the incompetent epa : four months after being notified about high lead levels in a flint home , the environmental protection agency was prepared to let the city continue giving lead-contaminated water to customers until at least 2016 , emails released friday show.jennifer crooks , the michigan program manager for the epa s drinking water state revolving fund , sent out an agenda on june 8 , 2015 , for a planned call with michigan department of environmental quality officials.in that email , crooks said it was known that flint had not been adding any corrosion-control chemicals to its water to prevent lead from leaching from the pipes into drinking water since april 2014 .
she said the city was in its second six-month testing period.it didn t make sense for the city to start a corrosion control program in june 2015 , crooks wrote .
since flint has lead service lines , we understand some citizen-requested lead sampling is exceeding the action level , and the source of drinking water will be changing again in 2016 , so to start a corrosion control study now doesn t make sense , crooks wrote .
the idea to ask flint to simply add phosphate may be premature ; there are many other issues and factors that must be taken into account which would require a comprehensive look at the water quality and the system before any treatment recommendations can/should be made .
the email was sent almost four months after epa researcher miguel del toral was made aware of high lead in flint s water.via : washington examiner
