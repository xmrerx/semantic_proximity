The liberal third-world hell hole (as Ann Coulter calls it) that is California has some of the strictest gun-control laws in the United States, far surpassing Illinois and New York.
Naturally, Republicans will use these facts to somehow smear the liberal state as being one that exhibits the most gun violence around even though red states produce more gun violence per capita than blue.Surprisingly, what many people may not know and what they won t hear on Fox News is that California has experienced a sharp decline in gun violence over the last 20 years, putting a fatal dent in the right s scare tactics when it comes to guns and the Second Amendment.Gavin Newsome, California s current Lieutenant Governor, recently spoke at a press conference regarding Prop 63, which limited magazine sizes, banned the sale of assault weapons, and conducted background checks on ammunition sales.
It passed on election day by an overwhelming margin.
During this press conference, Newsome pointed to a very interesting statistic: since California began passing stricter gun laws in the 1990s, the state has seen a staggering 56 percent drop in gun homicides.Now, those were Gavin Newsome s numbers, and they took into account gun violence rate.
If you look at the numbers from Center for Disease Control, between 1993 and 2014 (Newsome s numbers did not include 2014), the rate for murder rate has actually fallen 67 percent, from 9.60 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 3.14 per 100,000 in 2014.
The data for 2015 and 2016 are still being collected, and have not been factored into Newsome s or the CDC s report.Whereas the state s gun laws may or may not be directly responsible gun rights groups and gun control groups of course have differing opinions, naturally it remains that the talking point more gun control harms citizens has been proven effectively false, in California of all places.It looks like the good guys with the guns may not be stopping the bad guys with the guns.
Because guns have increasingly been hard to come by in he state, a trickle effect has been felt.While red states like Louisiana continue to top the list for gun murder and violence, blue states like California have taken action, and are literally saving lives in the process.
In raw numbers, 1,233 were killed in 2014 compared to 1993 when 3,183 were killed.For the All Lives Matter bunch, this should be cause for celebration, and a big you were right.
The numbers for 2015 and 2016 should further these trends that have been set by liberal politicians.
The only thing standing in the way between more un laws and more lives being saved is the NRA.Midterm elections will be here before we know it.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
