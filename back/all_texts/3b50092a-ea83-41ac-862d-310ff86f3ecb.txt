The mainstream media is guilty of fake news when it serves their desired narrative.
In this case, the desire by the media to make the Florida shooter out to be a white nationalist is huge.
They often go with the lie because by the time the lie is corrected, no one is listening.
This is how the media hijacks the narrative in order to shape minds to think a certain way.
Pretty evil, huh The media ran with the story but it s not true FAKE NEWS from the Associated Press to serve the purpose of the lefty media.
This is nothing new but with the invention of social media and citizen journalists, we re able to correct the lies and hopefully get the truth out there.
Nick Short and others called out the AP and other main stream media outlets for their lack of integrity in making claims that are a lie:According to law enforcement, there are no ties linking Cruz to the white nationalist group but it appears AP & the rest of the media didn t even bother to corroborate with authorities about this and instead gave a racist white nationalist free publicity.
