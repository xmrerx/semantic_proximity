Senator Lindsey Graham is on the attack after Nunes blew the credibility of the House Intel Committee s investigation into collusion with Russia.
He appeared on NBC s Today show this morning to tell the entire world exactly what he thinks of Nunes at this point, and he didn t hold anything back: I think it s a little bizarre.
There s nothing been revealed to suggest the Obama administration surveilled the Trump campaign.
That s not even what Nunes is saying.
He s saying there s incidental collection outside of Russia.The problem he s created is he s gone out on a lark by himself, sort of an Inspector Clouseau investigation here, trying to find some unmasking information about collection incidental with the Trump campaign and some foreign agent outside of Russia.
I think the only way this can be repaired is if he tells his colleagues on the House Intelligence committee who he met with and what he saw.
Graham wants Nunes to do the right thing to fix this investigation, but believes that Nunes objectivity is now in question.
Graham also says that if he s not willing to share the information he has with his panel colleagues (Republican and Democratic), then he s lost his ability to lead.
At this point, Graham says the Senate is doing a great job with its investigation and suggested that maybe it s time for the Senate to take the reins on this.Watch below:Featured image by Justin Sullivan via Getty Images
