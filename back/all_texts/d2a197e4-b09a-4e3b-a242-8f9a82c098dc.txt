What the what?
I had to start firing people, people that I counted as my friends, best friends, partners.
And the process that I began was the hardest process of my life.
Yeah, almost as hard as picking myself up off of that carpet when I was facing suicide, that carpet that smelled like soup.
But this time I had something I didn t have before: I had you.
I knew you existed.
I knew that you believed in the same principles I believe and that we no, that I had made a promise to you.
Our lives, our fortunes, and our sacred honor.
In a special video posted to his website today, Glenn Beck addressed news reports of the latest mass layoffs at his troubled media empire.According to a report yesterday in the Daily Beast, Beck laid off 40 employees of his Blaze media organization in order to satisfy the requirements of a multimillion-dollar bank loan taken out recently to keep Beck s revenue-challenged enterprise running.
As the Daily Beast noted, This latest round of mass firings comes as no surprise to insiders at The Blaze and Mercury Radio Arts, which laid off dozens of employees last May on a day referred to internally as Black Monday, around the same time that Beck was purchasing a private jetliner and a $200,000 Maybach sedan.
In the video released today, Beck is seen seated at a replica of the Resolute desk in his mock Oval Office set delivering the opening monologue of his radio show.
