North Carolina Republicans just would not listen when everyone kept telling them not to re-legalize discrimination by passing its hateful religious freedom law.
Now they are going to be paying a huge price literally as you will see below.The Obama Administration is stepping in this time and has given the state s Republican legislature an ultimatum: Repeal the law or We pull billions of dollars in federal aid from your state.In a way, this should be a wonderful thing for Republicans.
They hate the federal government and hate handouts.
So, logically thinking, if Obama pulls out billions of dollars that normally funds their roads, schools, and housing assistance programs it will be a great thing for the state.
Right?My, how quickly Republicans forget literally all of their ideology when it s something that benefits them.
They re actually calling it illegal for the federal government to single out North Carolina for what they call unfavorable treatment.
Republicans don t seem to care about the unfavorable treatment they just legalized against their own LGBT citizens.
I mean they can only get fired, evicted from their homes, or denied basic things like being able to shop in stores if the owners sincerely believe they are bad people for being LGBT.
But that s totally different.
Right?There are already costly lawsuits coming in from the passage of the law, and businesses are already threatening to leave the state if they have not done so already.
Add all that expense and loss of business and jobs on top of a few billion dollars less from the government.
Soon their schools will be closing and roads crumbling with disrepair.
The same people who voted these idiots in and supported the law will be crying about how bad it is in their state.
But, Jesus will be happy with them.
Maybe they can pray for the roads to get fixed.Featured image via camel city dispatch
