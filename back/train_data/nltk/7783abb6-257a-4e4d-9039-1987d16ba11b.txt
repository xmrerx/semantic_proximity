white house begin panic
least logical conclusion latest jawdropping move
order pretty much unprecedented nice one day without something unprecedented come white house
trump white house tell various government department cooperate democrat periodreportedly happen since trump take office
formulate policy say agency allow respond committee chair
republican hold house congress every committee chair republicanthe declaration amount new level partisanship washington president administration already feel besiege medium report attack democrat
idea republican say choke democratic congressional minority gain new information could use attack president
republican lead house senate white house white house official say
think democrat respond every minority member request position
white house spokeswoman say policy administration accommodate request chairman regardless political party
democratic chairman congress control republicanssource politicothe information blackout least accord white house official toward every request democrat request oversight committee
whew make u feel much better
agency tag make sure law follow hobbledwhile obama white house answer every request republican admittedly many mean back opposition corner never explicit policynow course agency executive umbrella work office presidency president personally
trump though seem far nuanced distinction
agency legally free would argue ethically obligate abide oversight request even minority party trump prove fire anyone step linethis could certainly backfire though
trump still office time midterms roll around keep destroy republican party could see democratic takeover least one house congress
would give democrat committee chair
white house could still ignore democrat request would way around word obstruction
