The Atlanta NAACP is totally over the top on this demand: Those guys need to go.
They can be sand-blasted off, or somebody could carefully remove a slab of that and auction it off to the highest bidder, said NAACP Atlanta branch President Richard Rose.The Atlanta chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People called Monday for the removal of the 90- by 190-foot carving of three Confederate leaders, Jefferson Davis, Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson, from the side of Stone Mountain, television station WSB reported Tuesday.
Those guys need to go.
They can be sand-blasted off, or somebody could carefully remove a slab of that and auction it off to the highest bidder, NAACP Atlanta branch President Richard Rose told WSB: Stone Mountain Park is a state park of Georgia about 30 minutes outside Atlanta and the sculpture in question is part of what s described as the largest high relief sculpture in the world.
The sculpture was dedicated by Vice President Spiro Agnew in 1970 and finished in 1972.A spokesman for Stone Mountain Park told WSB any change or removal of the monument is up to the Georgia legislature.The call for the massive carving s removal comes on the heels of the removal of the Confederate flag from the statehouse grounds in South Carolina.
The legislature voted to remove the flag after a 21-year-old white supremacist, who was repeatedly photographed posing with the Confederate flag, was charged with killing nine worshippers at one of the state s oldest black churches.VIA: TPM
