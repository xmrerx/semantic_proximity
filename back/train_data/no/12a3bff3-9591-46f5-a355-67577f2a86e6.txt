n djamena ( reuters ) - chad has rejected allegations made in the united states that its president idriss deby was paid a $ 2 million bribe in exchange for providing a chinese energy company with oil rights without international competition .
the united states announced charges on monday against former hong kong home secretary chi ping patrick ho and former senegalese foreign minister cheikh gadio for allegedly funnelling bribes to high-level officials in chad and uganda .
the government is indignant and questions this fierce attack against our head of state , chad s government said in a statement late on wednesday , adding that deby had always sought transparency in the country s natural resources sectors .
the u.s. justice department said gadio had received $ 400,000 from ho via wire transfers through new york to act as a go-between for bribes to deby on behalf of an unnamed energy firm headquartered in shanghai .
