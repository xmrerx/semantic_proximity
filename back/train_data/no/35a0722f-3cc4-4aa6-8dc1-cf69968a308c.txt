kinshasa ( reuters ) - about 30 people were killed and more than two dozen injured when a train derailed then caught fire in democratic republic of congo , a provincial governor said on monday .
the freight train was traveling from the southern copper and cobalt mining hub of lubumbashi to luena , in lualaba province , on sunday when it left the tracks and tumbled into a ravine near the town of buyofwe .
there s major damage because the tanker cars caught fire , lualaba s governor richard muyej told reuters .
around 30 dead and 26 wounded were transferred to the hospital in lubudi , 25 km ( 16 miles ) from the scene of the accident .
the train had taken on a number of passengers before the accident , and muyej said the death toll could rise further .
eleven of the train s 13 cars caught fire following the derailment .
officials from congo s national railway company , the sncc , were investigating the cause of the crash , which was not immediately known .
rail accidents are relatively common in congo due to aging , poorly maintained infrastructure and lax enforcement of safety standards .
