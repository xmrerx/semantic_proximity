it s really quite ironic that the guy who has paid and non-paid protesters inciting violence and riots at virtually every trump rally across america is being attacked by leftists on him home turf .
seriously though bernie sanders is as far left as a politician can go without becoming a declared communist .
what bone could a leftist protester possibly have to pick with bernie ?
the guy is like santa claus , but with other people s money .
he s promising to punish every rich person in american while rewarding the lazy .
what more do these freaks want ?
at least four people at a bernie sanders rally in oakland rushed the stage monday evening , spurring secret service agents to jump onto the raised platform and protect him.the democratic presidential candidate was uninjured and continued speaking , but not before several agents hugged him and pushed him away from the microphone .
the identities of the individuals , who yelled as they approached the stage , were not immediately known .
they were apprehended and led away by secret service from the podium at the frank ogawa plaza , where the rally was being held .
after the events of monday night in northern california , sanders spokesman michael briggs said , it was handled professionally by the secret service .
watch here : the vermont senator began receiving secret service protection in early february during the early part of the presidential primary season , in his challenge to democratic front-runner hillary clinton .
