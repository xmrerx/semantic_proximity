tegucigalpa ( reuters ) - salvador nasralla , the honduran opposition candidate whose early lead against president juan orlando hernandez in a presidential election has evaporated , on wednesday said he rejected the vote count of the electoral tribunal .
earlier , both candidates vowed to respect the final result once every disputed vote had been scrutinized , issuing signed statements brokered by the organization of american states .
but nasralla told a news conference a few hours later that the document had no validity and rejected the count .
nasralla initially held a five point lead against hernandez until the electoral count suddenly stopped on monday .
when it restarted on tuesday , the count began favoring hernandez who edged ahead earlier on wednesday before it stopped again .
