BEIJING (Reuters) - China’s Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday it hoped the United States would not allow transit by Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen when she visits Guatemala next month.
China hopes the United States “does not allow her transit, and does not send any wrong signals to ‘Taiwan independence’ forces”, the ministry said in a statement sent to Reuters.
