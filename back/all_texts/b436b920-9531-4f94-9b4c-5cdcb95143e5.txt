WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump maintains his support of Republican House leaders’ healthcare plan, U.S. Health Secretary Tom Price said on Friday, adding that the proposed measure tackles key issues important to the president.
“The president’s very supportive of this plan, thinks that it addresses his priorities,” such as the coverage of patients with pre-existing medical conditions, among others, Price told reporters at a news conference.
