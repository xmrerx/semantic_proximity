addis ababa ( reuters ) - clashes along the border of ethiopia s oromiya and somali regions have displaced around 50,000 people , a senior regional official said on sunday , in violence that has prompted the government to send the military in .
spokesmen from the two regions told regional news outlets earlier this week that at least 50 people were killed .
each side blames the other .
lema megersa , president of oromiya province , told local journalists on sunday : it is not just deaths that occurred .
more than 50,000 people were displaced from their homes .
those responsible should also be held to account , he added .
he did not give a death toll .
the area has been plagued by sporadic clashes for decades .
a referendum held in 2004 to determine the status of disputed settlements failed to ease tensions .
unrest in 2015 and 2016 in oromiya - and to a lesser extent other regions - killed 669 people , according to a parliament-mandated investigation .
the clashes are likely to fuel further fears about security in ethiopia , the region s biggest economy and a staunch western ally .
each side gave contradictory explanations about the cause of the clashes .
some officials in oromiya said it was sparked by the killing of a local district head and raids by a paramilitary force from the somali region .
officials from the somali region denied those claims .
fifty ethnic somalis were killed in the town of aweday in oromiya on tuesday , a spokesman for the somali region told local media on friday .
international media were not permitted at the briefing .
on sunday , prime minister hailemariam desalegn said soldiers deployed to the region to quell the violence would disarm residents and safeguard highways straddling the regions .
