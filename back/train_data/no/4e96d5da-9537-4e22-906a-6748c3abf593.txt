dinesh d souza appeared on fox news hannity show with guest host kimberly guilfoyle and dr. gina loudon .
guilfoyle asked d souza about president trump and the media .
d souza suggested president trump has a gladiator style with the media.d souza told guilfoyle that the media has decided that the democrat party by itself , can not take down donald trump , so the leftists in the media and academia have basically told the media to step aside and let them take him down.d souza told viewers that , not since the election lincoln , have the democrats so obstinately refused to accept the results of a lawful election .
the reason the left is freaking out is not because president @ realdonaldtrump is ineffective it 's because he 's so effective .
