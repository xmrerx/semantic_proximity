The apple truly doesn t fall far from the tree and Eric Trump proved that in a recent interview on Fox News.
In his very first sentence during an interview on Fox s Hannity program, the third-born child and second son of Donald Trump made it clear how he really felt that he doesn t even think ofDemocratss as human beings.When Trump appeared on the program on Tuesday night, host Sean Hannity opened with a simple question, Don t you wish you went to Washington so you could deal with this every second of every day?
The light-hearted query was in reference to the ongoing investigation into Russia s possible ties to the 2016 presidential election and Eric decided to take a page out of his father s book, answering off the cuff without really even thinking, rather just letting his true feelings known.
I ve never seen hatred like this, he said.
To me, they re not even people.
It s so, so sad.
Morality s just gone, morals have flown out the window and we deserve so much better than this as a country.
Trump tried to justify his statement by adding, You see the Democratic Party, they re imploding.
They re imploding.
They became obstructionists because they have no message of their own.
But Eric Trump s diatribe against the Democratic party didn t stop there.
Although he didn t stoop to naming Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez directly, Trump made it abundantly clear who he was referring to.
You see the head of the DNC, who is a total whack job, he told host Sean Hannity.
There s no leadership there, however, Trump couldn t end his criticism there without making a reference to his old man s deal making abilities.
They lost the [2016 presidential] election that they should have won because they spent seven times the amount of money that my father spent.
