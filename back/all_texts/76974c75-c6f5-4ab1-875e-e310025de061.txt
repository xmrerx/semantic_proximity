If you didn t know that Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson was once a neurosurgeon, you would never believe he had any hint of intelligence just from the idiotic things he says.Today, Ben Carson was quoted in a New York Times interview painting an extremely solemn picture of what public housing will look like under the Trump administration.
As Carson has said several ridiculous things during his own failed presidential campaign and while he was helping with Trump s campaign, this should hardly be surprising but it will still infuriate you.Carson defended disabled and elderly people who might need public housing, and said we can t expect to do a great deal to take care of themselves.
But when it came to others who did not fall into those two categories but still needed public housing, Carson had something else to say.
He said: There is another group of people who are able-bodied individuals, and I think we do those people a great disservice when we simply maintain them.
The Times reported:Compassion, Mr. Carson explained in an interview, means not giving people a comfortable setting that would make somebody want to say: I ll just stay here.
They will take care of me.
It s safe to say that most of us have been taught a VERY different meaning of the word compassion , and Carson s definition clearly does not fit.
Carson has been traveling all over the United States to get a scope of public housing in places like Detroit and Miami.
While he was in Ohio, Carson visited a facility for drug abusers and reportedly said: We are talking about incentivizing those who help themselves.
Carson s attitude toward public housing is disgraceful, and ABC s Sunny Hostin was right to slam him immediately:Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images
