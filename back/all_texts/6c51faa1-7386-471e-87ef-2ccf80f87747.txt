The country woke up to confusion today as Budweiser beer company abruptly announced that America s No.
1 full-flavored lager will be replacing its name with America on its cans and bottles until the election in November.
Why?
Who knows.
But that s not all.
The company will also pack in even more patriotism per can (PPC) by adding a potent mix of quotes from the Pledge of Allegiance and lyrics from The Star Spangled Banner and America the Beautiful.
If that seems like something conservatives would be all over, then they are about to be very disappointed.
As Hemant Mehta over at the Friendly Atheist noticed, the cans have opted to replace In God We Trust with E Pluribus Unum the original, albeit unofficial, motto of the United States.
Out of many, one.The Latin phrase, which was widely used from the country s inception, and has only recently taken a backseat to America s later official motto putting the country s faith in God, is a reminder that from America s outset, the founders put a lot of stock in the concept of national unity and strength in togetherness.
The lesson: God is great and all, but a country full of varied and immensely multi-cultural backgrounds needs to unify around itself, not any particular god.For some, that may be some bitter beer to swallow.
Given the nearly endless capacity for conservative Christians to get offended, this motto change will likely prompt a strong backlash from the people who brought you the Starbucks red cup boycott.
Suddenly, a watery beer will become ground zero for the ever expanding war on Christianity that conservatives assure us is really, definitely, totally happening.Ironically, the fact that a beer can emblazoned with America on the front will now be heavily politicized along party lines and highly controversial kind of says it all, doesn t it?
