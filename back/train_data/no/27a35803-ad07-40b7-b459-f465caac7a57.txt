cairo ( reuters ) - palestinian president mahmoud abbas said on wednesday , the trump administration s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel was the greatest crime and a flagrant violation of international law .
jerusalem is and always will be the capital of palestine , he told an emergency meeting of muslim leaders in turkey .
he said the united states was giving away jerusalem as if it were an american city .
it crosses all the red lines , he said .
abbas said it was unacceptable for the united states to have a role in the middle east peace process because it was biased in favor of israel .
