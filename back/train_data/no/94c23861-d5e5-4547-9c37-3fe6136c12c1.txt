lima ( reuters ) - peruvian president pedro pablo kuczynski pardoned former authoritarian leader alberto fujimori late on sunday , clearing him of convictions for human rights crimes and graft before completion of a 25-year prison sentence .
kuczynski s office said in a statement that a medical review showed that fujimori , 79 , who governed peru from 1990 to 2000 , suffered from a progressive , degenerative and incurable disease .
the pardon comes just days after a faction of fujimori s supporters in the opposition-controlled congress saved kuczynski from a motion that would have forced him from office in the wake of a graft scandal .
