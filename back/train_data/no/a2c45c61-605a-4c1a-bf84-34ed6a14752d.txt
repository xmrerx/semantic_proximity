if you didn t know , friday was holocaust remembrance day a day in which we remember the victims of a man who was very much like our current president * .
surprisingly , someone on donald trump s staff took time away from celebrating the other side of that battle and put out a halfhearted , generic , and disrespectful statement on his behalf one which trump then made his own by tweeting it the american people : statement on international holocaust remembrance day : https : //t.co/kju0moxchk donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 27 , 2017trump s statement is three paragraphs long and reads like it was written by the same guy who has been writing his executive orders white supremacist steve bannon .
trump says he wants to honor the victims , survivors , heroes of the holocaust though many of his neo-nazi supporters would surely disagree with others on the identities of the heroes of the holocaust .
notably , trump didn t specifically mention jewish people a single time a clear fan service for the klansmen and sieg heilers who rally behind him.trump concludes with a pledge to do everything in his power to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good .
for instance , if a thin-skinned egomaniac backed by an army of neo-nazis , christofascists , and other assorted terrible people teamed up with a foreign dictator to manipulate the election and place himself in the oval office so he can build a walkl to keep brown people out of the country , ban people of a specific religion from entering , and generally abuse the powers of the office to make the bigoted dreams of his deplorable supporters come to life trump would totally put a stop to that .
together , we will make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world , said the man who is holocaust remembrance day signing an executive order banning refugees from countries he thinks have too many muslims.if this all seems crazy and hypocritical to you , you re not the only one .
seemingly all of twitter showed up to kick trump in his tiny orange nards : @ realdonaldtrump dude neo-nazis love you ken klippenstein ( @ kenklippenstein ) january 27 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump your chief strategist 's ex-wife says he does n't like jews in a sworn court declaration : https : //t.co/zbfz83vci8 ken klippenstein ( @ kenklippenstein ) january 27 , 2017 .

@ realdonaldtrump maybe you could honor victims of the holocaust by not ushering in another ethnic cleansing ?

baked alaska ( @ bakedalaska ) january 27 , 2017 @ bakedalaska @ realdonaldtrump pic.twitter.com/8sjjtvonrp that mika face ( @ ct_muhdick ) january 27 , 2017trump is a guy who has done nothing but attack people for their ethnicity , gender , and race since he assumed office a week ago .
in that time he has signed executive orders banning a large number of muslims from entering the country based solely on where they live and effectively signing the death warrants of countless would-be refugees , stripped federal funding from any international health organization that so much as mentions abortion , ordered the construction of a wall along our southern border and authorized the construction of concentration camps for undocumented immigrants .
during his campaign , he retweeted neo-nazis and their propaganda almost constantly.he should probably just not talk about the holocaust.featured image via getty images ( pool ) /screengrab
