johannesburg ( reuters ) - south african veteran politician and anti-apartheid activist nkosazana dlamini-zuma , a leading contender to take over as head of the ruling anc in december , will be sworn in as a member of parliament next week , a senior party official said on friday .
dlamini-zuma , the ex-wife of current anc leader and south african president jacob zuma , does not hold a top position and could use a seat in parliament to raise her profile ahead of the party s december leadership conference .
she is going to be sworn in , anc secretary general gwede mantashe was quoted as saying by the local ewn news network .
the former health and foreign affairs minister s main opponent in the anc leadership race is expected to be deputy president cyril ramaphosa , a trade unionist-turned-business tycoon whom many investors would prefer to see running a country with serious economic challenges .
dlamini-zuma is pushing for a more radical redistribution of wealth from whites to blacks , a policy that appeals to many poor people who resent the stark racial inequality that persists 23 years after the end of apartheid .
the next head of the anc will be the party s presidential candidate in 2019 general elections .
