Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has had about enough of the blatantly racist antics happening right within the walls of the company s Menlo Park, California offices.
In an internal memo obtained by Gizmodo, Zuckerberg is outright furious over some employees going to the famous wall, where everyone is free to write what they want, and crossing out Black Lives Matter to replace it with All Lives Matter.
Zuckerberg seems absolutely disgusted by this continued disregard for others, and reprimanded those culpable.Here s what he wrote: There have been several recent instances of people crossing out black lives matter and writing all lives matter on the walls at MPK.Despite my clear communication at Q&A last week that this was unacceptable, and messages from several other leaders from across the company, this has happened again.
I was already very disappointed by this disrespectful behavior before, but after my communication I now consider this malicious as well.There are specific issues affecting the black community in the United States, coming from a history of oppression and racism.
Black lives matter doesn t mean others lives don t it s simply asking that the black community also achieves the justice they deserve.We ve never had rules around what people can write on our walls we expect everybody to treat each other with respect.
Regardless of the content or location, crossing out something means silencing speech, or that one person s speech is more important than another s. Facebook should be a service and a community where everyone is treated with respect.This has been a deeply hurtful and tiresome experience for the black community and really the entire Facebook community, and we are now investigating current incidents.I hope and encourage people to participate in the [email protected] town hall on 3/4 to educate themselves about what the Black Lives Matter movement is about.

Zuckerberg is spot on in his memo, and this sort of behavior is not only unprofessional, but outright racist.Featured image: greeneggsandlam/Wikimedia
