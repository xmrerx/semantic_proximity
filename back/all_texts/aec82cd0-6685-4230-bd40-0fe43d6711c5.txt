Democrats staging a sit-in on the floor of Congress won t go hungry we spotted their food order on its way into the Capitol and it s pretty damn ironic.
A couple carts full of Chick-fil-A food were toted in by Congressional interns.
We get it protesters gotta eat, but consider this: The push for gun control legislation was prompted by Omar Mateen s heinous attack on a gay nightclub and Chick-fil-A s ownership has a long history of opposing LGBTQ rights.
To be fair, the company s undergoing an image makeover, and has contributed tons of food and money to relief efforts in Orlando.
Still odd choice.
DC s a big city.

THIS LOOKS MORE LIKE A EAT IN OR FEAST IN!
