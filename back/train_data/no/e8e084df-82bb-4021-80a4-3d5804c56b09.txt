berlin ( reuters ) - german police have launched an investigation into the theft of at least 12 inscribed metal memorial stones embedded in the pavement in berlin to commemorate nazi victims .
the stones , called stolpersteine , bear the names of the victims and are set in the ground in front of the last address where they lived before being murdered or detained by the wartime regime .
it s upsetting and it hurts , cologne artist guenter demnig said on tuesday , the day after the thefts were made public .
demnig said some 600 stones had been stolen out of the total 63,000 laid across europe since he launched the project in 1996 .
police said it was not clear who was behind the thefts , though a local politician blamed members of the far right linking the action to the approaching anniversary of the 1938 kristallnacht pogrom of jews in germany and austria .
a similar theft in the eastern city of greifswald four years ago also took place on the eve of the anniversary of the attacks when government-backed mobs looted jewish property , set fires and killed dozens of jews .
if someone makes the effort to remove them , systematically picking out each stone , then they have political motives , said a spokesman for berlin politician fritz felgentreu , pointing to what he said was a strong far-right presence in the neighborhood where the thefts took place .
