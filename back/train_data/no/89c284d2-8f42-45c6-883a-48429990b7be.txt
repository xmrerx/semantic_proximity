i ve never had anybody point a gun at me before .
a man came on the loudspeaker and told us to stop , and to get out and have our photo-id .
and they approached us with guns .
you just don t expect it in our lives we re americans .
i mean i feel like i in africa or something .
i mean , i ve been in africa at checkpoints before and it s scary .
you never know if you re getting through .
we re in western united states , we re good people , we re easy to get along with .
we don t create trouble .
this is alarming .
this isn t the attention we want .
we re stewards .
we re good people .
we posted a video released by the fbi showing the shooting death of lavoy finicum , father of 11 , who traveled to oregon from arizona to join the ranchers protest of the unfair treatment by the federal government s blm agency .
finicum was reportedly shot several times by federal agents during a traffic stop on highway 395 in harney county.his daughter , challis finch had this to say about her father : he s a great man , and just because he s dead doesn t mean his fight will not go on .
he s now a martyr .
