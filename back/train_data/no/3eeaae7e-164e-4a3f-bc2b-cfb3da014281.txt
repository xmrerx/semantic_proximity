some 2,500 americans have died in afghanistan and iraq under obama .
under obama , america has been at war for longer than under any other u.s. president .
when is the last time you heard those statistics mentioned by our leftist media ? somewhere along the way , obama decided that winning ( or ending ) the wars in the middle east was less important than starting a full-blown race war in america .
does anyone care that hillary is openly advocating to carry on his legacy of hate and division over concern for our military or our national security ? this is obama s legacy a california high school football team staged a bizarre die-in to protest the singing of the national anthem.kaepernick came to oakland , ca .
he kneeled on one knee , players laid on their back with hands up during the anthem .
