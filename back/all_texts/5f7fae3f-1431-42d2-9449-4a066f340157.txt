This just goes to show, never judge a book by its cover, and never judge a person by a scripted reality television show.Austin Lee Russell, better known as Chumlee on the hit History Channel reality show Pawn Stars has been arrested Wednesday in Las Vegas after police searched his southwest Las Vegas home.
The police were there as part of a sexual assault investigation, but that s not why he was arrested.Russell was held at the Clark County Detention Center for being in possession of methamphetamine, marijuana and at least one gun.
All in all, he had 19 drug-possession charges and one weapons charge, with his bail set at $62,000.
Allegedly, the 33-year-old reality TV star has not been charged with sexual assault, but the investigation is ongoing.
As many of you have probably watched Pawn Stars over the past several years, you d see Chumlee as the dopey guy with the imbecilic one-liners to often add comedic relief to the show about buying and selling treasured relics.
In 2014, he told the Las Vegas Sun: People can relate to me, and they root for me because on the show I am the dumb guy, the one who is a little rougher around the edges.
When people come in the store, they want to give me a hug and say hi.
They want to see the Old Man sitting in his chair, they want to talk to Rick about whatever item they have.
They interact with us differently It takes a special person to be a Corey fan (laughs).
But me, I m the guy they want to hug.
Well, probably not anymore now that his true colors are coming out and release of this arrest hits the newswire.
Chances are, we may not be seeing much more of him on the beloved show, at least if the showrunners are smart.Watch the report from KTNV here: Featured image via Fox News
