President Donald Trump says that the Oakland Raiders should suspend running back Marshawn Lynch for the rest of the season for disrespecting the flag after he did not stand for the anthem.Before Sunday s game against the New England Patriots in Mexico City, Lynch sat during the playing of the Star Spangled Banner, as he has done all season.

Great disrespect!
Next time NFL should suspend him for remainder of season.
Attendance and ratings way down, Trump tweeted on Monday morning.

By the looks of her tweet, the only one who should be embarrassed by Delisha Lynch s tweet is Delisa Lynch, whose grammar and punctuation is almost as embarrassing as her loser son s behavior.
Lynch starts each sentence in her tweet with lower case letters and ends her tweet with a sentence followed by a space, a comma, and two exclamation points for emphasis.
Lynch s tweet was apparently intended to embarrass President Trump, when she asked, what NFL team do Trump own ?
oh yeah they wouldnt let him have one ,!!
LMAOwhat NFL team do Trump own ?
