the event attracts more than 16,000 community and student activists from all 50 states.here are a few nuggets from his speech : donald trump : obama may be the worst thing that ever happened to israel .
when i become president the days of treating israel like a second class citizen will end on day 1 .
hillary clinton , the former secretary of state , was a disaster by the way .
