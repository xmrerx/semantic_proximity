as americans we insist that no one should be targeted because of who they are , what they look like , who they love , what they worship .
( unless of course , you re a cop or a person who enjoys white privilege ) .doesn t mooch target privileged white people every time she has a microphone placed in front of her ?
whether speaking at a commencement speech or museum opening , mooch doesn t miss an opportunity to point out how mistreated she and her husband , ( the two-term elected president of the united states ) are by dragging race into every speech .
why is that okay ? barack obama hosted an iftar dinner at the white house on june 22 , 2015 .
he paid tribute to three muslim students ( victims killed by a white man ) who were murdered in chapel hill , nc .
he managed to tie the recent hateful act by another young white man who killed 9 innocent black church members in charleston , sc into his speech .
the koran teaches that god s children should tread lightly above the earth and that when confronted with ignorance , reply peace .
where was your peaceful muslim speech following the attempt by two muslims in texas to commit mass murder during pamela gellar s free speech event ?
