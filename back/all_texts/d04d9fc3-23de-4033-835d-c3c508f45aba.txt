President Trump just signed a law overturning a last-minute Obama-era regulation forcing states to fund Planned Parenthood, America s largest abortion business.The regulation, which pro-life groups call former President Obama s parting gift to the abortion industry, forced states to give Title X money to organizations that commit abortions.
Now, states if they wish will be able to withold Title X money from abortion-committing organizations, instead prioritizing non-abortion businesses.Federal Title X dollars fund family planning services, but technically not abortion.
However, government money Planned Parenthood receives helps the abortion-centered organization overall.
This money is fungible, pro-life advocates say.REMEMBER OBAMA WAS THE MOST PRO-ABORTION PRESIDENT EVER!
Audio of his cold-hearted testimony before the Illinois State Senate:In 2001, then IL State Sen. Barack Obama for the 2nd year in a row was the sole senator opposing Born Alive Infant bills:The U.S. House voted 230 to 188 to overturn this regulation on February 16.
The U.S. Senate voted 50-50 on it on March 13.
Vice President Mike Pence broke the tie, sending the bill to Trump s desk.Rep.
Diane Black, R-TN, Penny Nance of Concerned Women for America, and Marjorie Dannenfelser of the Susan B. Anthony List were at the White House bill signing.
This week the pro-life movement had two huge victories: first, the swearing-in of Justice Gorsuch and now, President Trump will undo former President Obama s parting gift to the abortion industry, said Dannenfelser.
The resolution signed today simply ensures that states are not forced to fund an abortion business with taxpayer dollars.
Rather, states have the option to spend Title X money on comprehensive health care clinics that better serve women and girls.
