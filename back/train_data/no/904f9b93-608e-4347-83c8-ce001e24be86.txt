part of the problem is that organizations are registering people without any proof they are legal american citizens .leaked funding documents reveal an effort by george soros and his foundations to manipulate election laws and process rules ahead of the federal election far more expansively than has been previously reported.the billionaire and convicted felon moved hundreds of millions of dollars into often-secret efforts to change election laws , fuel litigation to attack election integrity measures , push public narratives about voter fraud , and to integrate the political ground game of the left with efforts to scare racial minority groups about voting rights threats.these soros-funded efforts moved through dozens of 501 ( c ) ( 3 ) and ( c ) ( 4 ) charities and involved the active compliance with civil rights groups , government officials , and purportedly non-partisan groups like the league of women voters.the leaked documents also reveal deliberate and successful efforts to manipulate media coverage of election issues in mainstream media outlets like the the new york times.if you live in one of the states below , please demand that voter id is enacted : although some states require some form of id before voting , california , illinois , iowa , maine , maryland , massachusetts , minnesota , nebraska , nevada , new jersey , new mexico , new york , north carolina , oregon , pennsylvania , vermont , west virginia , wyoming , and washington , d.c. all require no identification before voting.please contact true the vote for any and all information regarding voter fraud .
