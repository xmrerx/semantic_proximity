In a stunning reversal, Donald Trump said that he will strengthen the rights of the LGBT community and bring people together.
His new stance comes just days after he said that as president, he would strongly consider overturning Obergefell vs Hodges, the Supreme Court decision that found that same-sex couples have a legal and constitutional right to marry.
I m a lesbian, we ve had some great progress for the gay and lesbian community, NECN reporter Sue O Connell told Trump.
When President Trump is in office, can we look for more forward motion on equality for gays and lesbians?
Here is Trump s response: Well, you can.
We re going to bring people together, and that s your thing, and other people have their thing.
We have to bring all people together and if we don t we re not going to have a country anymore.
Now that s one big flip-flop because in addition to Trump saying he would appoint judges to overturn Obergefell vs Hodges, he has stated in the past time and time again that he only supports marriage between a man and a woman.
He has said: I m not in favor of gay marriage.
I don t feel right about marriage equality.
Trump has even gone as far as to compare same-sex relationships to choosing the wrong kind of golf putter!
He said: It s like in golf.
A lot of people I don t want this to sound trivial but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive.
It s weird.
You see these great players with these really long putters, because they can t sink three-footers anymore.
And, I hate it.
I am a traditionalist.
I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist.
In trying to rationalize the irrational, it s most likely that Trump is pandering to New Hampshire voters for the primary, 67% of whom support gay marriage.
Whatever his reasoning, his new position is going to upset his bigoted right-wing conservative following.Featured image via video screen capture
