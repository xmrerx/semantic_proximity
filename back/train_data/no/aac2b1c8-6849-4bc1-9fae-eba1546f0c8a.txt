cnn host don lemon asks guest simone sanders , former press secretary for bernie sanders : how can you say it s not a hate crime against a white person ?
simone answers lemon s question by suggesting that this is not a hate crime .
she goes on to say that if the 4 black thugs that beat and tortured this mentally disabled teen did it because they hated trump , it shouldn t be a hate crime .
sanders explains , motive here matters .
so was this for hate of donald trump , the president-elect because of things that he has said , or was this for pure hate of white people ?
yeah , so torturing another human being you kidnapped for hours is okay , as long as it was just about something trump said .
