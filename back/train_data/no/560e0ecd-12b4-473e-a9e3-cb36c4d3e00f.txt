riyadh ( reuters ) - the draft of a final statement by a syrian opposition meeting in riyadh calls for the departure of president bashar al-assad at the beginning of any transition , saudi-owned al arabiya television said on wednesday .
an array of opposition groups and figures began meeting earlier in the day in a bid to unify the group s position ahead of u.n.-backed peace talks to end the country s six-year civil war .
some opposition members have hinted that the new communique could drop any mention of assad , softening a long-standing demand that he not have a role in any transition .
