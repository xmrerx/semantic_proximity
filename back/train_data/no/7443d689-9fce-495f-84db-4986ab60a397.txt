rome ( reuters ) - italy s anti-establishment 5-star movement narrowly won the first round of a vote to govern ostia , one of rome s largest neighborhoods , as the center-right surged , official results showed on monday .
sunday s closely watched contest in the beachfront district comes more than a year after the 5-star took control of rome s city hall for the first time , winning two-thirds of the vote .
five-star candidate giuliana di pillo won just over 30 percent of the vote compared with almost 27 percent for monica picca , who headed a coalition that included silvio berlusconi s forza italia and the far-right brothers of italy party .
the two will face each other in a runoff to be held on nov. 19 .
the ruling center-left democratic party , which came in second to the 5-star in rome last year , won less than 14 percent of the vote , while far-right parties gained ground .
the neo-fascist , anti-immigrant casapound party , which is not part of the center-right coalition , garnered 9 percent against just 1.8 percent last time around .
the previous center-left administration for the capital s seaside borough , which has more than 230,000 inhabitants , was dissolved two years ago after police said it had fallen under the influence of organized crime .
the ostia vote took place on the same day as a regional vote in sicily that appeared to signal a comeback for berlusconi s center-right coalition , with the 5-star trailing marginally , according to projections on monday morning .
