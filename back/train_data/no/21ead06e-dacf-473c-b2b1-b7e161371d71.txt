helsinki ( reuters ) - finnish government should actively push the european union to abolish its directive on daylight saving time , a parliament committee said on thursday .
the parliamentary transport and communications committee gave its recommendation to the government after more than 70,000 finns signed a citizens petition asking the state to give up the practice .
under daylight saving time clocks move forward by one hour during summer months so that daylight lasts longer into evening .
most of north america and europe follows the custom , while the majority of countries elsewhere do not .
the committee said that after hearing several experts , it concluded that people do not adapt smoothly to the changes .
it added that turning the clocks caused short-term sleeping disorders , reduced performance at work and could also lead to serious health problems .
the primary objective should be to abolish the clock movements on uniform basis throughout the european union , the committee said in a statement .
