cairo ( reuters ) - egyptian security forces have arrested three supporters of presidential hopeful and former prime minister ahmed shafik , security sources and members of his party said on wednesday .
the men were charged with spreading false information harmful to national security , two security sources familiar with the incident said , on condition of anonymity .
egypt s interior ministry could not be reached for comment after several attempts to contact it on wednesday .
shafik announced last month his intention to run against president abdel fattah al-sisi in egypt s upcoming presidential election early next year .
no date has been set for the vote .
the former premier and ex-air force commander is seen by sisi s critics as the most serious potential challenger to the incumbent .
those arrested were all members of shafik s egyptian national movement party .
one of them , hany fouad , was arrested at his family s home on the outskirts of cairo , his brother wael fouad said .
hany is very close to ( shafik ) , he said .
security forces entered the family home around 3 a.m. local time ( 0100 gmt ) and searched the house , confiscating two mobile phones and giving no reason for the arrest , he said .
sisi has yet to announce that he will seek a second term but is widely expected to do so .
shafik made his announcement from the united arab emirates where he has lived in exile since 2012 , when he fled egypt after a narrow electoral defeat to former president mohamed mursi of the muslim brotherhood , who was removed from office in a military takeover led by sisi in 2013 .
shafik returned to cairo ten days ago and said he was still deciding whether to run .
he has not made any public appearances since .
