detroit ( reuters ) - three congressional leaders on monday asked top federal environmental and safety officials to extend by 60 days the public comment period on new vehicle emissions and fuel economy standards .
the public and their advocates need more time , beyond the comment period that ends sept. 26 , to absorb more than 1,000 pages of a draft technical assessment report , the three said in a letter to the environmental and safety chiefs .
a week ago , u.s. regulators denied a similar request for an extension by major automakers .
the u.s. environmental protection agency and the national highway traffic safety administration said in a july report that automakers have the technology to meet aggressive mandates to hike fuel efficiency , but improvements will not be as great as the obama administration once forecast because buyers are switching to pickup trucks and sport utility vehicles from lighter cars .
when the administration first outlined its goal of boosting average fleet fuel economy to 54.5 miles per gallon , regulators forecast that 67 percent of vehicles sold in 2025 would be cars .
since then , gasoline prices have fallen and truck and suv sales have surged .
regulators now estimate the fleet will average 50 to 52.6mpg in 2025 .
the letter dated monday was sent to epa administrator gina mccarthy and national highway traffic safety administration administrator mark rosekind .
it was signed by three members of the u.s. house of representatives : fred upton , chairman of the committee on energy and commerce ; ed whitfield , chairman of the subcommittee on energy and power ; and michael burgess , chairman of the subcommittee on commerce , manufacturing and trade .
