Chicago s Urban Prep Charter Academy for Young Men is one of the only high schools in the United States to boast a 100 percent rate of college acceptance for graduates.The nonprofit school, which has a mission of providing a strong, college-preparatory high school option for boys in under-served African-American communities, first began enrolling students during the 2005 2006 school year.Urban Prep was created in response to a 2006 study published by the University of Chicago which showed that just one in 40 Black male students enrolled in Chicago s public school system would go on to graduate from a four year college or university.Urban Prep, which now has three separate campus locations in Chicago, was the first all male charter school in the United States.
According to wikipedia, the overwhelming majority of students, 85 percent, are from economically disadvantaged households.In 2010 the students of Urban Prep made national headlines after every single graduate was accepted to a college or university.That amazing achievement has been duplicated by Urban Prep students every year since 2010.This year is no different.
The 252 graduating seniors received more than 1500 college acceptance letters in 2016, many from prestigious schools such as Yale and Georgetown.Urban Prep graduates also received more than $15 million in scholarships and grants.School officials cite small class sizes, a rigorous curriculum and devoted teachers as reasons for the unprecedented rate of student success.More than that, though, Urban Prep Academy founder Tim King stresses that everyone working with students strives to empower them to believe in themselves and their own potential.King says: Urban Prep students will not fall into the trap of negative stereotypes and low expectations.
Instead students believe in their potential and believe in their ability to exceed that potential.
