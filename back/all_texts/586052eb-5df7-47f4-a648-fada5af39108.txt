Remember the fabled pee pee tapes?
Well, it seems that we have a little bit more info on them including that Donald Trump s staff was seen arguing with hotel security about whether or not a couple of prostitutes would be allowed in his hotel room during a stay in Russia.In his infamous dossier, former British spy Michael Steele alleged that Trump had paid prostitutes to come up to his room and urinate on one another on a bed that Barack and Michelle Obama once shared.
Steele claimed at the time that the incident was filmed and would be used by the Kremlin as kompromat (compromising material).Award-winning British journalist Paul Wood reports for The Spectator that not only do multiple witnesses confirm the pee pee tape, but there are more extreme recordings of Donald Trump than just a couple of Russian girls urinating:I heard of Russian kompromat compromising material on Trump from two sources months before the Steele dossier came to light.There are, though, reports of witnesses in the hotel who corroborate Steele s reporting.
These include an American who s said to have seen a row with the hotel security over whether the hookers would be allowed up to Trump s suite.
The dossier s account of hookers in a Moscow hotel room was the subject of gossip among politicians and intelligence people for months before it was published.
Now claims are circulating of more tapes showing more extreme behavior.
Expect these allegations to emerge in due course, Wood says cryptically.Will the pee pee tapes finally surface?
Who knows but Trump must be sweating his fake tanner off thinking about it.Featured image via Getty Images
