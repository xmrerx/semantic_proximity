dhaka ( reuters ) - indonesian foreign minister retno marsudi said on tuesday the country is ready to ease the burden of bangladesh in dealing with rohingya muslims fleeing from myanmar , but the help is likely to be only humanitarian , not financial .
we will continue to discus what sort of support indonesia could make to ease the burden of bangladesh government , marsudi told a news conference after she met with the bangladeshi pm and her counterpart in dhaka .
myanmar has come under pressure from countries with large muslim populations to stop violence against the muslim rohingya .
