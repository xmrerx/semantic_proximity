oslo ( reuters ) - hopes of finding survivors from a russian helicopter which disappeared off the coast of the arctic svalbard archipelago faded on friday as norwegian rescuers searched in vain for a second day in ice-cold waters .
eight russian men - five crew and three passengers - were listed as missing by norway s rescue coordination center , while the location of the russian-made mil mi-8 aircraft remained unknown more than 24 hours after it disappeared .
the helicopter was on its way from the abandoned pyramiden settlement to the coal mining port of barentsburg where the russian coal company arktikugol runs a mine employing russian and ukrainian miners .
the assumption is that the helicopter has crashed during the approach two kms north of kapp heer , the accident investigation board said in a statement , referring to the local helicopter base .
snowy weather and high waves were complicating efforts in a region that has almost no daylight at this time of the year , while the air temperature was around minus three degrees celsius ( 27 degrees farenheit ) .
a search using a small , remotely-operated submarine , yielded no sign of the helicopter , the rescue coordinators said , dashing earlier hopes that a submerged wreckage had been located .
a somewhat bigger submarine will be flown in and is expected to be operational on saturday , the rescue center said .
we re still conducting a search and rescue operation .
we ve not moved to a recovery phase , and won t do so until the new submarine has completed its search a spokesman for the norwegian coordinator said .
located around 700 kms ( 435 miles ) north of the european mainland , svalbard is governed under a treaty that grants nato-member norway sovereignty while allowing other signatories to do business and exploit natural resources .
more than 40 countries are parties to the treaty .
moscow has maintained a presence on the islands for decades as a strategic foothold in the high north .
