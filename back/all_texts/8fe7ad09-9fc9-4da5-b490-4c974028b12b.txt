Trump and his staff are so sure the media lies about everything that they ve put together a media accountability survey designed to gauge how people feel about the media, how they re representing Trump and Republicans, and numerous other things.
Of course, because true scientific polls don t ever tell them what they want, this survey is anything but scientific.
They want to feed their confirmation bias.
But what s really happening is hilarious and it s made Trump call his own poll rigged.Seriously.The email that was sent to supporters asking them to take the survey again reads:The President emailed you to take the urgent Mainstream Media Accountability Survey.Since then, mainstream media outlets have viciously attacked it and thousands of Democrats have taken it to try to sabotage the results.Which is why we need your IMMEDIATE help as one of President Trump s biggest supporters.Please take the Mainstream Media Accountability Survey now.>>Thanks,Team Trump Not only does this email demonstrate that Trump is only interested in answers from people who think the exact same way he does, but it also demonstrates the sheer desperation on Trump s part to prove that the media is engaging in one giant conspiracy to bring him down.
Or something.The questions in the survey are leading and biased, and were definitely not crafted by an experienced pollster.
He wants specific answers and the questions are worded so he s more likely to get those answers: And those are just a sampling of the questions in the survey.At the end, it asks you for your name, email address and zip code, but there s no verification on it, so you can make up a name and email address, and pick a zip code.
Any zip code.
And you don t have to create dummy email accounts for it either so really, what did they expect to happen here?After you fill it out it takes you to a donation page, because of course it does.The bottom line is that, unless he gets the results he s looking for, he s going to keep crying rigged!
If you d like to see what s in it, it can be found here, if you d like to take it for yourself.
