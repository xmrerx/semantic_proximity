melbourne ( reuters ) - australia s military watchdog has issued a public plea for information regarding rumors of possible war crimes committed by australian troops in afghanistan .
the australian broadcasting corporation reported in july on an alleged cover-up of the killing of an afghan boy as well as hundreds of pages of leaked defense force documents relating to the secretive operations of the country s special forces .
on friday , the inspector-general of the australian defence force released a statement saying it was conducting an inquiry into rumors of possible breaches of the laws of armed conflict by australian troops in afghanistan between 2005 and 2016 .
the inquiry would like anyone who has information regarding possible breaches of the laws of armed conflict by australian forces in afghanistan , or rumors of them , to contact the inquiry , the statement read .
australia is not a member of nato but is a staunch u.s. ally and has had troops in afghanistan since 2002 .
as recently as may , australia recommitted to the 16-year-long , seemingly intractable war against the taliban and other islamist militants by sending an additional 30 troops to afghanistan to join the nato-led training and assistance mission .
that brought australia s total afghan deployment to 300 troops .
