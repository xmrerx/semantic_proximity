A blizzard fell upon Washington D.C. over this past weekend, basically shutting down the whole city, including the U.S. Capitol building.
It left many people digging out for days, and some may still be trying to find their cars under the mounds of snow.
However, not everyone took this as an excuse to sit at home.
Some folks chose to put on their warm coats, lace up their boots, and get to where they needed to be.
After all, the country needs them.Now, this may or may not be indicative of the future, but it seems women were they only ones to trudge through the snow to get to the Capitol to get back to work.
Yes, women, at least in the Senate chamber.And because she was one of the few people who decided to show up to work on Tuesday, Sen. Lisa Murkowski (I-AK) took over the job of handling Senate business.
And as she did so, she stated: As we convene this morning, you look around the chamber, the presiding officer is female.
All of our parliamentarians are female.
Our floor managers are female.
All of our pages are female.
Adding: Something is genuinely different and something is genuinely fabulous.
Murkowski was there alongside Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME) who was exercising control over the Senate gavel.Not to let the moment escape without something thoroughly honest being said, Murkowski also noted: Perhaps it speaks to the hardiness of women.
That put on your boots and put your hat on and get out and slog through the mess that s out there.
Damn right it does!
Women know how hard it is for them to get elected, they aren t about to sit back and let a few snowflakes get in their way.
They re going to show up, and they re going to get the job done.Featured image: Flickr
