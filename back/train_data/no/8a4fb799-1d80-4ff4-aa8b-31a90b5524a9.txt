brussels ( reuters ) - european council president donald tusk warned on tuesday that completing a brexit treaty and agreeing on future relations with britain would be a furious race against time where eu states would have to stick together to avoid economic disruption .
writing to national leaders ahead of a summit he will chair in brussels on thursday and friday , tusk noted his plan to seek their approval to launch a second phase of negotiations , on transition and future ties , after achieving sufficient progress last week and agreeing an outline of the divorce .
the conclusion of the first phase of negotiations is moderate progress , since we only have 10 months left to determine the transition period and our future relations with the uk , tusk wrote .
this will be a furious race against time , where again our unity will be key .
and the experience so far has shown that unity is a sine qua non of an orderly brexit .
