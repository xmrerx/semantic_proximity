tuesday national review online column contend reported involvement former nationalsecurity adviser susan rice unmasking trump official appear major scandal suggest obama white house highranking staffer abuse power collect intelligence foreign target use spy opposition party presidential candidateit come surprise defense rice obama apologist mount heavily reliant fact dispute viz intelligence collection issue legal
anticipate line argument week ago
issue technical legality monumental abuse power
analogize judge impose 20year jail term man pass marijuana cigarette second man sentence would perfectly legal distribution schedule narcotic drug control substance call sentence 20 year imprisonment see 21 usc
841b1cnevertheless sentence would also outrageous abuse judicial power
judge thing would unfit worthy condemnation impeachment
abuse power offense public trust
often overlap criminal offense thing criminal offense
example politician accept money exchange political favor commit crime bribery impeachable offense corruptionthe juror bribery case need find politician breach public trust need find intentional quid pro quo payoff exchange favor
contrast breach public trust central impeachment case remove pol office would need prove legal element criminal bribery charge beyond reasonable doubt would demonstrate politician unfit office
petty bribe prosecutor might ignore public want throw bum
high crime misdemeanor constitutional standard impeachment need indictable criminal offense
may chargeable crime need one
famous example though one much remark last several year second article impeachment president richard nixonit allege italic use power office president united state richard nixon violation constitutional oath faithfully execute office president united state best ability preserve protect defend constitution united state disregard constitutional duty take care law faithfully execute repeatedly engage conduct violate constitutional right citizen impair due proper administration justice conduct lawful inquiry contravene law govern agency executive branch purpose agency
impeachment allegation go describe nixon among thing direct fbi cia irs investigate innocent american reason unrelated national security law enforcementfor part directive violation penal statute
individually collectively heinous abuse presidential power warrant impeachment
new reporting believe rice orchestrate unmasking communication involve democrat political rival trump campaignher current stress lawfulness intelligence collection straw man
credible commentator claim base currently know intelligencecollection activity fbi cia nsa illegal
explain yesterday aforementioned column surveillance collection operation undertaken pursuant statute foreign intelligence surveillance act well president constitutional authority collect foreign intelligence exercise authority lay longstanding executive order eo 12333the allegation rice obama administration unmasking trumpcampaign transition official appear cumulatively probably many specific instance run afoul minimization instruction
instruction propose justice department order fisa court
discuss noncompliance minimization instruction context crime fool errand
violate minimization instruction applicable electronic surveillance crime
nothing unusual
every offense law court order regulation guideline etc crimemost law violation fact crime
moreover standard articulate minimization instruction vague predicate criminal liability
require masking concealment identity american incidentally intercepted unless intelligence value intercepted communication understand without know american identitywithin reasonable parameter subjective judgment call
criminal law judgment call
provision must precise put people clear notice exactly proscribe
reasonable mind differ much identifying information incidentally intercepted american necessary intelligence value lawfully intercepted communication fully understood
stuff crime
technical legality particular instance unmasking beside point
question abuse powerhere critical bear mind something easily forget
sole purpose foreign intelligence collection understand action intention foreign power operative
government purpose understand action intention american citizen two proper way go conduct criminal investigation american citizen target courtauthorized surveillance base probable cause crime b conduct fisa investigation american citizen target courtauthorized surveillance base probable cause act agent foreign power
neither two alternative choose american citizen suppose subject intelligence collection effort suppose protect
snooping subject incidental byproduct ie unintentional albeit inevitable consequence snoop foreign power
incidental snooping deprive privacy protection root law requirement government obtain judicial warrant seize eavesdrop communicationsthe law allow happen post hoc safeguard apply
director james comey testify congress fbi obsessive conceal identity american
unmasking big deal
american intercept collecting agency fbi cia nsa shrug shoulder say well could provide marginally better understanding meaning communication reveal name american
practice along line reveal name unless absolutely necessary understand communication even prefer use substitute eg
american diplomat
1 rather actual name
agency take position good honorable people though arethey take interest successfully carry nationalsecurity mission
know fail protect identity privacy american inevitable scandal arise irate public demand congress curtail spying power
hand anyone make mistake
failure unmask american identity know would essential understanding crucial bit foreign intelligence could disastrous consequence
consumer intelligence sometimes rarely sometimes ask collector unmask
even though collecting official know investigation consumer eg white house staffer national security council intelligence report always possible consumer could notice something collector miss
could think intelligence angle occur collectorsso gray area know whether unmasking massive abuse power perfectly appropriate exercise discretion
apply common sense
questionable unmask single isolated instance part pattern
communication question real foreign intelligence value blather american participate mention might appear unmask american objective collection effort something incidental series unmasking particular american group american
would seem incidental collect unmask people would look like target
standard apply consistently unmasking protocol apply american equal rigor appear american like maybe


american connect trump give le protection others
unmasking go unprecedented presidential decision make disseminate intelligence information widely across community 17 intelligence agency include official obvious need know
go administration official include former one like evelyn farkas leave administration join clinton campaign pressure congress seek much disclosure intelligence community possible regard trumpwhether deal major abuseofpower scandal depend answer question
contrary susan rice latest version event little nothing whether law break
