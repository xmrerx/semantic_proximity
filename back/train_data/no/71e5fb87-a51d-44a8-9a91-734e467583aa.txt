moscow ( reuters ) - the security minister of ukraine s pro-russian rebel region of luhansk said on friday he was taking over power from regional chief igor plotnitsky , who days earlier had said he was facing an attempted armed coup to force him out .
in a video posted on a rebel news portal in luhansk , the security minister , leonid pasechnik , said he was taking over after plotnitsky resigned for health reasons .
but there was no immediate word from plotnitsky itself .
luhansk region , along with the neighboring donetsk region , rebelled against rule from kiev in 2014 and declared themselves independent .
but since then the regions , which are backed by moscow , have been troubled by infighting that has at times turned violent .
today igor venediktovich plotnitsky resigned for health reasons .
multiple war wounds , the effects of blast injuries , took their toll , pasechnik said in the video .
in accordance with his decision , i am taking on the duties of head of the republic until forthcoming elections .
earlier this week , armed men in camouflage uniforms blocked access to central streets in the city of luhansk , capital of the self-proclaimed people s republic of luhansk .
plotnitsky said it was a coup attempt by supporters of igor kornet , the rebel region s interior minister whom he had sacked .
but plotnitsky said he had the situation under control and that the plotters would be dealt with .
moscow denies having any influence over the rebel regions but multiple separatist leaders have told reuters kremlin officials effectively select the rebel leaders .
a kremlin spokesman this week declined to comment on events in luhansk .
the two self-proclaimed republics are not recognized by russia or any other nation .
