paris ( reuters ) - european parliament president martin schulz said on saturday that neither europe nor the united states was prepared for a donald trump presidency as the likely republican candidate had no international experience and was a populist .
“ trump belongs to these people that we also have here in europe , who have a scapegoat for all issues but never have a concrete solution , ” schulz told french television i-tele .
“ honestly , i prefer another candidate , ” he said , referring to democratic front-runner hillary clinton , a former u.s. secretary of state .
schulz , a german social democrat , is president — or speaker — of the european union ’ s directly elected parliament , whose 751 members have the power to approve , amend or reject legislation affecting the whole 28-country bloc .
billionaire trump has a significant lead in primary contests for the republican nomination for november ’ s election to the white house .
he has drawn fervent support as well as harsh criticism for his calls to build a wall along the u.s.-mexico border and to impose a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states .
a trump rally scheduled for friday night in chicago was canceled after the event turned into a chaotic scene , with thousands of attendees split into opposing camps of his supporters and protesters inflamed by his candidacy .
