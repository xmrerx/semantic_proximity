This HUGE arrest by the FBI is proof that we need to end the food stamp program as it is now.
The fraud is so rampant that even illegals are making millions off of the program and off of the backs of the American taxpayer.
We ve reported on way too many immigrants who have robbed the American people by doing the same thing these 22 latinos did.
One particular case is of a woman who robbed us all blind of $3.6 million with her food stamp fraud:IMMIGRANT Ghanaian Woman Pleads Guilty To $3.6 Million in Food Stamp Fraud Media Ignores Her Immigrant StatusYET ANOTHER CASE:ALABAMA FRAUD: FOOD STAMPS TO CASH SENT TO YEMENHopefully, you get the picture legal AND illegal immigrants are coming to America to rob you blind!
The bust from Operation Stampede/Cash Hungry in Florida involved more than $13 million in fraudulent food-stamp transactions and could be the largest food stamp bust in the nation s history.
The Palm Beach County Sheriff s Office, state and federal law enforcement conducted a joint identity theft investigation involving obtaining SNAP EBT cards with the stolen identities.
According to the sheriff s office, the fraudulently obtained EBT cards were taken to the Opa Locka Flea Market where the SNAP(food stamp or EBT) benefits allocated to them were exchanged for cash.
Twenty two people have been charged with crimes.Opa-locka Fruit and Produce Market didn t just sell fruits and vegetables.Instead, owners Karla Rodriguez Diaz and Luis Marzo Machado allegedly used their produce market inside the Opa-locka Hialeah Flea Market to bilk the government out of $2.4 million, Wifredo A. Ferrer, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida, said Wednesday.Diaz and Machado were two of 22 people charged in 15 cases Wednesday in Operation Stampede, organized to bust business owners and their employees who allowed customers to use their government-issued EBT food stamp card as a means to get cash, in exchange for a cut.
In total, Ferrer said there were more than $13 million in fraudulent food stamp transactions stemming from markets throughout South Florida, the largest food stamp fraud take-down in U.S. history.
These retailers are flagrantly abusing the public trust by stealing millions of dollars from the federal food stamp program that is intended to provide low-income households with their needed basic provisions of food and nutrition, Ferrer said.He said the stores mostly in Opa-locka Hialeah Flea Market would ring up food, but the customer rarely left with anything.
They would leave with cash, and the owner would pocket a cut.
Ferrer said the scheme involved thousands of SNAP Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program recipients.Commercial for Flea Market: In total, 15 people were arrested Tuesday and Wednesday, when police raided the flea market.
Seven of the 22 people indicted are still at large, Ferrer said.Flea market vendor Felix Lanza told Miami Herald news partner CBS4 that he had no idea what was going on: Thank God, we don t do that.
Jack Heacock, director of the Florida Division of Public Assistance Fraud, said the arrests were only the beginning.
Those people who received the money will likely be sanctioned, he said.The defendants, all of whom were authorized to accept food stamps, face charges of wire fraud, conspiracy to commit wire fraud and food stamp/EBT fraud, according to the indictments.
