Trevor Noah and The Daily Show had a field day with the feud between Donald Trump and Ted Cruz in one of the funniest segments of 2016 thus far.Birtherism has come back to haunt the Tea Party in a big way as their favored candidate is now dealing with the fact that unlike President Obama, he really wasn t born in the United States.
Donald Trump has been happy to point that out as Ted Cruz begins to gain in the polls.
And this is comedy gold as far as Noah is concerned.
The son of an American mother and a foreign father who graduated from Harvard Law School and dreamed of being president, even though let s face it, people he wasn t born in America.
That s right, we re talking about Ted Cruz the Canadian-born Texas senator.
This even took Noah by surprise because he didn t know that this shit could happen to Republicans, as well.
Like I thought Republicans were the ones who do this, not the ones who get it done to them.
This for me is like hearing that someone roofied Bill Cosby.
Noah pointed out the way Trump worked the scandal into conversations and how he is particularly fond of using Twitter to launch attacks.
But Noah did not let this be a one-sided scandal.
In what could be fodder for Ted Cruz to use in a counterattack, Noah reminded the audience that Donald Trump wants to bang his daughter, which is true because he said he saw it on TV.Indeed, Noah did a segment last year chronicling all of the instances in which Trump has creepily talked about his daughter over the years.
