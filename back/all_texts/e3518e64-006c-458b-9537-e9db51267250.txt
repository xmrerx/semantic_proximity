The internet went wild mocking Melania Trump this week.
That is because of the fact that a large portion of the speech she gave at the Republican National Convention contained an entire section that was stolen from Michelle Obama s speech that she gave at the Democratic National Convention in 2008.As worthy as that speech was of mockery, Trump s speech was the one that was truly worthy of condemnation.
Who better to do that than Bill Maher?During a monologe on Real Time, Maher lambasted the newly officiated GOP presidential candidate s speech.
Did you see Donald Trump s speech?
If that had been any darker it would have been shot by the police, Maher said.Maher went on to say that: He used the word violence a dozen times, the word murder a half-dozen times and that was just the part about Ted Cruz.
I tell you, that was a rough speech.
Maher mocked the brutal imagery that Trump used during his speech.
We are a shining city on a hill where we will make our last stand against the zombies.
And ISIS and illegal immigrants are coming to kill us all.
The use of appeals to fear in order to move people to justify violent actions are nothing new at the RNC.
However, this year the speeches were particularly disturbing because they were more overt .with their bloodlust this year.
They should serve as a reminder of just how dangerous Republicans are.
It is more important than ever to oust the GOP from power at every level of government.
Trump s speech proved that.You can watch the monolog below in full.Featured image via video screen capture
