washington ( reuters ) - democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton on friday will propose a $ 10 billion investment in partnerships to encourage the growth of the u.s. manufacturing sector as part of a national push to discourage outsourcing in the industry .
the proposal would work with a broader campaign to encourage companies to build and expand their u.s. manufacturing operations .
clinton is slated to roll out the proposal on friday in syracuse , new york , ahead of the state ’ s nominating contest on april 19 .
new york has long been a hub of the manufacturing industry , but suffered significant declines in the sector in recent years .
from 2000-2008 , upstate new york alone lost nearly 105,000 manufacturing jobs , according to the state government .
clinton maintains a lead in the state , which she represented in the u.s. senate , over rival bernie sanders , a u.s .
senator from vermont and a new york native .
sanders was born and raised in new york city ’ s borough of brooklyn .
the clinton campaign is headquartered there .
the campaign said the proposal ’ s multi-billion dollar price tag would largely be covered by clinton ’ s proposed “ clawback ” tax , which would rescind tax relief for companies that outsource jobs or facilities abroad .
