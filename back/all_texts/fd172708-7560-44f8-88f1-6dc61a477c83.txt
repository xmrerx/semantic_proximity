As we unfortunately learned during the presidential campaign, Donald Trump s biggest fans love to tell themselves HUGE lies, and then they pass those lies back and forth to each other and actually believe them, no matter how insane those lies happen to be.The biggest one to hit since Election Day is the complete and utter lie that Trump won the popular vote in addition to his electoral college win.

It is now clear that she won it by a margin larger than two candidates who went on to win the presidency.David Leonhardt, a columnist for The New York Times, noted on Friday that with a 1.7-percentage-point popular vote lead over Donald Trump,Clinton will have a larger margin of victory than Richard Nixon had over Hubert Humphrey in 1968 or John F. Kennedy had over Nixon in 1960.
(Her edge is also larger than Al Gore s popular vote victory over George W. Bush in 2000, though he too was stymied by an electoral college loss.
)In raw numbers, that amounts to an edge of roughly 1.8 million votes as of Saturday.The election is decided by the electoral college, not the popular vote, so Trump will be sworn in to the presidency.
But it s telling that even in victory, Trump s supporters must lie to themselves and each other with these completely made up stories.
It shows that, despite the claim that the left is in a bubble on the coasts, the Trump supporters are the ones who have sealed themselves off from the real world where 2 is always bigger than 1.Featured image via Flickr
