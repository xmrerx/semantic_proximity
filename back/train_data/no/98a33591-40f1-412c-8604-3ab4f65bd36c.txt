( reuters ) - a group of 19 retired u.s. generals and admirals on thursday backed democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton ’ s position on the u.s. military prison in guantanamo and torture and called for an end to the “ dangerous rhetoric ” from her republican opponents .
“ the republican candidates have turned this into a game to see who can seem toughest .
yet , how we combat our enemies and defeat isis is not a game , and these proposals would only make us weaker , ” the retired officers said in a statement , using an acronym for islamic state , the militant group active in syria , iraq and elsewhere .
republican candidates have opposed an obama administration plan to close the guantanamo bay prison in cuba .
republican front-runner and real estate mogul donald trump said this month he would bring back waterboarding , widely condemned as a form of torture , and would be open to even tougher measures in the fight against islamic state .
clinton was secretary of state during president barack obama ’ s first term , when he banned the use of torture .
she has supported the closing of the guantanamo prison for terrorism suspects , which obama says has become a recruiting tool for militant groups fighting the united states and its allies around the globe .
the retired officers said expanding the use of guantanamo “ is dangerous and has real negative consequences for our national security. ” expanding the use of torture , they said , would compromise global u.s. leadership and put american troops and civilians at risk .
“ we applaud hillary clinton ’ s leadership on these issues and call on the immediate end to the dangerous rhetoric coming from the right , ” the retired officers said .
