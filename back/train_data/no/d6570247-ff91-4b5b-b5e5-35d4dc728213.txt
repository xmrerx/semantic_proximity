paris ( reuters ) - lebanese prime minister saad al-hariri will meet ministers from major powers in paris on friday to discuss ways of stabilizing his country a month after his shock resignation plunged it into political turmoil , three diplomats said .
the arab and european diplomats said hariri would take part in the meeting of the international lebanon support group , a body that includes the five members of the u.n. security council - britain , china , france , russia and the united states .
hariri resigned as prime minister in early november while he was in saudi arabia , prompting a political crisis in lebanon and thrusting it back into a regional tussle between riyadh and its main regional foe , iran .
hariri has now returned to beirut and indicated that he might withdraw his resignation , which was never accepted by the president .
lebanese officials say saudi arabia had coerced hariri , a long-time ally of the kingdom , into resigning and held him there against his will until an intervention by france led to his return to lebanon .
saudi arabia denies this .
a european diplomat said the aim of the meeting would be to put pressure on the saudis and iranians .
he added that the meeting would be an opportunity to reinforce that the lebanese must stick by the state policy of disassociation , or keeping out of regional conflicts .
before hariri sets off , lebanon s cabinet is this week set to meet for the first time since the political crisis erupted .
the date of the cabinet meeting has not yet been confirmed but it is expected to address hariri s resignation .
a lebanese mp who met hariri on monday said discussions among politicians were moving positively and would result in a unanimous stance by the cabinet soon .
the comments from mp wael abu faour were published by hariri s office on monday .
the lebanon support group , launched in 2013 , also includes the european union , the arab league and the united nations .
