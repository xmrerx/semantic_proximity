The top Democrat in the Senate, Chuck Schumer (NY), claimed Sunday that President Trump is in trouble, a stern warning that came a day after the commander-in-tweet claimed President Obama wiretapped him.Citing President Obama s denial that he ordered a wiretap of Trump, Schumer said, Either way the president s in trouble.
If he falsely spread this kind of misinformation, that is so wrong.
It s beneath the dignity of the presidency.
It is something that really hurts people s view of government, he said.Yeah, because making the embarrassing, race-baiter-for-hire Al Sharpton a regular visitor at the White House is somehow not beneath the dignity of the presidency?
You mean like taking selfies during the funeral of one of the greatest civil rights leaders in the world?
Or traveling to Cuba to hang out at a baseball game with Raul Castro, who along with his brother are some of the most brutal dictators in the world?Were Watergate reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein shamed for making government look bad when they uncovered the wire-tapping done by President Nixon?
He deserved it?
Really Chuck?
Because he was running against Hillary Clinton or because he was simply on the wrong team?
If he were a Democrat, would have have deserved it?
On the other hand, if it s true, it s even worse for the president.
Because that means that a federal judge, independently elected, has found probable cause that the president, or people on his staff, have probable cause to have broken the law or to have interacted with a foreign agent, New York s senior senator claimed.
