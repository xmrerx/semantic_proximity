The amount of corruption we have seen in Donald Trump s rise and presidency has been alarming, and it s not going to stop anytime soon.Even after suspiciously firing his FBI Director during an explosive investigation and having several high profile personal lawsuits, scandals and conflicts of interest, the Republican Party still has yet to hold Trump accountable for his faults.
Whenever the GOP has had a chance to distance itself from Trump and do the right thing, spineless Republicans have failed to stand up and put their country first.In a Friday column in The New York Times, columnist Paul Krugman brilliantly pointed out the Republican Party s failing during Trump s presidency.
Krugman states that today s GOP has become more about tax cuts for the rich than anything else, and conservatives will defend it at all costs.
Arguing that Republicans no longer care about their country or its Constitution, Krugman wrote: This structure rewards, indeed insists on, absolute fealty.
What this means is that nearly all Republicans in today s Congress are apparatchiks, political creatures with no higher principle beyond party loyalty.
We ve certainly seen this play out in the way that Speaker of the House Paul Ryan and other prominent Republicans refuse to hold erratic Trump accountable even as his scandals and behavior put the country at risk.
But even if Trump were to be impeached, Krugman warns, the threat to the Republic will be far from over.
Krugman states that Trump s idiocy may have actually helped the country stay away from more sinister Republican values: In a perverse way, we should count ourselves lucky that Trump is as terrible as he is.
The point is that given the character of the Republican Party, we d be well on the way to autocracy if the man in the White House had even slightly more self-control.
Trump may have done himself in; but it can still happen here.
