geneva ( reuters ) - yemen s stocks of fuel and vaccines will run out in a month unless a saudi-led military coalition allows aid into the blockaded port of hodeidah and sanaa airport , unicef s representative in the country said on friday .
meritxell relano , speaking by phone to reporters in geneva , said fuel prices had risen 60 percent and there were urgent concerns about a diphtheria outbreak , as well as food shortages because of the port closure .
the situation that was already catastrophic is just getting worse , she said .
the impact of this is unimaginable in terms of health and diseases .
after two years of civil war , yemen has 7 million people on the brink of famine and has had 900,000 suspected cholera cases in the past six months .
the number of new cases has fallen consistently for the past eight weeks , according to data from the world health organization .
but progress against cholera , which has killed 2,196 people , could be reversed by the blockade , who spokeswoman fadela chaib told a regular u.n. briefing in geneva .
if the closure is not stopped in the coming days , we may see that the progress is stopped , chaib said .
we can see even more cases and more deaths as a result of not being able to get access to people .
the closure of hodeidah port prevented a ship setting sail from djibouti with 250 tonnes of who medical supplies on wednesday .
trauma kits in particular are running short .
if the hostilities continue and the ports remain closed , we will not be able to perform life-saving surgeries or provide basic healthcare , chaib said .
