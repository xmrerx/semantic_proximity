Of course, we all know that Obama is not a man of integrity or character.
There has to be something in it for him.
Did FBI Director James Comey cut a deal with Barack?
Why is every other Democrat calling for Comey s head?
It s unprecedented for Democrats to break ranks on something this important.
Stay tuned President Barack Obama does not believe FBI Director James Comey is attempting to influence this year s presidential vote, Press Secretary Josh Earnest said Monday.
The President doesn t believe that he s secretly strategizing to benefit one candidate or one political party, Earnest said.
He s in a tough spot, and he s the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts, including individuals who served in senior Department of Justice positions in administrations led by presidents in both parties.
The White House had no role in Comey s decision to inform Congress he was investigating new emails related to Hillary Clinton s private server, Earnest added.Earnest said he would neither defend nor criticize the decision.
He s aiming to preserve the integrity of the review into whether additional emails discovered on a laptop belonging to Anthony Weiner are relevant to an investigation into Clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state.Earnest said that norms about making information public should be followed.Amid outcry about Comey s decision, Earnest called the FBI director a man of integrity and good character.
