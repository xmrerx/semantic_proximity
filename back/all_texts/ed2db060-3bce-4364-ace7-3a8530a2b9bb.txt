President Obama used the platform of his weekly address from the White House to address the 15th anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks.
In his speech, the President sought to remind Americans of their best qualities as we saw in the response to the horrific attack.In his weekly radio and Internet address, Obama said that while so much has changed in the years since 9/11 it s important to remember what has stayed the same.
The core values that define us as Americans.
The resilience that sustains us, he said on the eve of the 15th anniversary of one of the nation s darkest days.He said the terrorists goal is to frighten Americans into changing how they live, but Americans will never give in to fear.
We re still the America of heroes who ran into harm s way, of ordinary folks who took down the hijackers, of families who turned their pain into hope, Obama said.The idea that America has to eye all Muslims with suspicion since 9/11 has unfortunately gone from a fringe belief to a central concern of the conservative movement.
Current Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has argued that Muslims should be barred from entry to the United States, and has even suggested that they be tracked somehow.
He and other Republicans also claim that Muslims aren t helping America in the war against terrorism, but they have laid down their lives right alongside Christian patriots in the last decade and a half.President Obama s message is one of inclusion not exclusion, arguing that the American instinct was seen in its purest form after the attack, when so many were united in a common cause.The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001 killed almost 3,000 people in New York City, at the Pentagon, and in Pennsylvania.
The assault was executed by the al Qaeda terrorist network and ordered by leader Osama bin Laden.
