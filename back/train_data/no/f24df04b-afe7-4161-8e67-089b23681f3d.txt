chicago ( reuters ) - chicago will continue to shrink its structural budget deficit in 2017 and 2018 , but faces new pension funding pressures starting in 2020 , according to a financial analysis released by the city on monday .
the nation ’ s third-largest city projects it will end fiscal 2017 on dec. 31 with a $ 137.6 million gap in its $ 3.73 billion operating budget , down from $ 232.6 million in fiscal 2016 .
in fiscal 2018 , the deficit is expected to fall by 17 percent to $ 114.2 million .
the city ’ s budget gaps have been declining since hitting a high of $ 654.7 million in fiscal 2011 .
“ this decrease is a direct result of sustainable and balanced revenue growth coupled with lasting savings and reforms made in the past six budgets , ” the city ’ s analysis said .
chicago has taken big steps in recent years to shore up its four employee retirement systems by hiking property taxes for its police and fire fighter funds , levying a new tax on water and sewer usage for its municipal workers ’ fund , and increasing a telephone surcharge for its laborers ’ fund .
the city is gradually increasing contributions to the systems until it meets requirements for actuarially funding public safety worker pensions in 2020 and for the other two systems in 2022 .
as a result , chicago ’ s pension payments will jump from $ 1.18 billion in fiscal 2018 to a projected $ 1.7 billion in fiscal 2020 , topping $ 2 billion in fiscal 2022 when all four systems will be on an actuarially funded path , according to the analysis .
at the same time , the city is weaning itself off of one-time revenue fixes , such as so-called scoop and toss restructurings of outstanding bonds to push off debt payments .
chicago ’ s base budget forecast indicates gaps of $ 212.7 million in fiscal 2019 and $ 330.3 million in 2020 , although the projections do not completely account for escalating pension payments .
“ the city previously secured ongoing and sustainable funding sources to match these growing contributions , and the funding sources for these increased contributions will be determined through our annual budget process , ” the analysis said .
the city ’ s total unfunded pension liability , which climbed to $ 35.76 billion in fiscal 2016 from $ 33.8 billion in fiscal 2015 , has been a concern of credit rating agencies that currently rate chicago at the low investment grade to junk levels .
