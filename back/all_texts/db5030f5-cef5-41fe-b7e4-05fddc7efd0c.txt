He went there.
We all knew he d go there, but on Monday Donald Trump deigned it appropriate to attack Meryl Streep after she made some rather pointed remarks about accepting others in her speech at the Golden Globes.
Without naming Trump by name, she managed to twist the knife deep in The Donald s abdomen with very little effort.
There was one performance this year that stunned me.
It sank its hooks in my heart, Streep said, referencing Trump s attacks on a disabled New York Times reporter last year.
Not because it was good, there was nothing good about it, but it was effective and it did its job.
It was that moment when the person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitated a disabled reporter, she continued.
Someone he outranked in privilege, power and the capacity to fight back.
It kind of broke my heart when I saw it and I still can t get it out of my head because it wasn t in a movie, it was real life, Streep said.
This instinct to humiliate when it s modeled by someone in the public by someone powerful, it filters down into everyone s life because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same.
Calling on the press to hold power to account, Streep very correctly pointed out that When the powerful use their position to bully others, we all lose.
Naturally, this was too much for Trump to handle.
In an interview with the New York Times Monday morning, Trump denied mocking anyone at all.
I was never mocking anyone, Mr. Trump said.
I was calling into question a reporter who had gotten nervous because he had changed his story.
Trump, of course, was referencing a 15-year-article written by Serge F. Kovaleski that he had attempted to use to prove that Muslims were celebrating in the streets.In reality, Kovaleski correctly reported that police, swept up in the paranoia directly following 9/11, had detained a number of people who had allegedly celebrated.
Ultimately, there was one account of people celebrating in the streets at the time and it was five young Israeli men, who were certainly not Muslims.
People keep saying I intended to mock the reporter s disability, as if Meryl Streep and others could read my mind, and I did no such thing, he told the Times.
And remember, Meryl Streep introduced Hillary Clinton at her convention, and a lot of these people supported Hillary.
He then took to Twitter to attack Streep as one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood and a Hillary flunky who lost big.
Meryl Streep, one of the most over-rated actresses in Hollywood, doesn't know me but attacked last night at the Golden Globes.
She is a .. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017Hillary flunky who lost big.
For the 100th time, I never "mocked" a disabled reporter (would never do that) but simply showed him .
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017"groveling" when he totally changed a 16 year old story that he had written in order to make me look bad.
Just more very dishonest media!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 9, 2017Just for reference, this is Donald Trump not mocking anyone :Naturally, Twitter erupted in fury both at Trump s revisionist claim that he had not mocked anyone and his attack on a woman who simply said that the guy sitting at the head of the table shouldn t be a dick to the dinner guests:Trump reacting to anything, basically pic.twitter.com/U8pxgNb0yM Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) January 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump Why didn't you just say "I appreciate Meryl's thoughts and I will strive to be a great president"?

Alyssa Hertzig (@alyssahertzig) January 9, 2017Donald Trump our President in less than a week is the sort of person to whom facts don t matter.
He s the type of guy who will mock someone on video and lie to you about it as the video plays.
His presidency is going to be an unpresidented (to use his word) disaster, and there is no chance our nation will not suffer for his arrogance and stupidity.But, hey, at least we get to learn Russian!
