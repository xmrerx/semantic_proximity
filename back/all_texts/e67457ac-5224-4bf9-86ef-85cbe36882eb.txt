Donald Trump told his supporters to engage in gun violence during a campaign stop on Tuesday.Discussing the possibility that Hillary Clinton would be elected President and have the ability to choose Supreme Court Justices, Trump said: If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks.
Though the second amendment folks, maybe there is Rob Flaherty, part of the rapid response operation for the Clinton campaign asked,: Did Donald Trump just call for someone to shoot Hillary Clinton?
The comments come as Trump has been hyping the conspiracy theory that the general election will be rigged by Clinton and the government.
Many view those comments as an acknowledgement from Trump that nearly every single poll taken over the last few weeks shows him losing badly, both nationally and in key swing states like Pennsylvania and Ohio.Trump has repeatedly embraced conspiracy theories and fringe personalities since running for President, including the council of dirty trickster Roger Stone (who has accused the Clinton and Bush families of murder) and 9/11 truther Alex Jones.A few months ago, Trump bragged that he could shoot someone in the middle of the street and still be supported.The call for gun violence echoes that of Tea Party Senate candidate Sharron Angle, who proposed 2nd Amendment remedies as the cure for liberalism in her 2010 race in Nevada.
Angle was beaten in that election by Senator Harry Reid.The National Rifle Association has endorsed Trump, and is running a multi-million dollar ad campaign in favor of his presidential bid.
By contrast, multiple groups involved in gun violence prevention have backed Hillary Clinton, who has vowed to fight the gun lobby if elected president.
