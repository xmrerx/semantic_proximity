brigitte gabriel was born in the marjeyoun district of lebanon to a maronite christian couple , a first and only child after over twenty years of marriage .
she recalls that during the lebanese civil war , islamic militants launched an assault on a lebanese military base near her family s house and destroyed her home .
gabriel , who was ten years old at the time , was injured by shrapnel in the attack .
she says that she and her parents were forced to live underground in all that remained , an 8-by-10-foot ( 2.4 by 3.0 m ) bomb shelter for seven years , with only a small kerosene heater , no sanitary systems , no electricity or running water , and little food .
she says she had to crawl in a roadside ditch to a spring for water to evade muslim snipers.according to gabriel , at one point in the spring of 1978 , a bomb explosion caused her and her parents to become trapped in the shelter for two days.they were eventually rescued by three christian militia fighters.brigitte gabriel is now an american citizen , author , founder of act and a conservative lecturer .
gabriel attended a benghazi accountability coalition forum that was supposed to be about benghazi and how our government should be held responsible for their actions that led to the deaths of four americans , but things took a dramatic turn when a saba ahmed , a muslim law student in an america university stood up to defend the majority of followers of islam .
she told the panel , we portray islam and all muslims as bad , but there are 1.8 billion followers of islam .
we have 8 million plus muslim americans in this country and i don t see them represented here .
gabriel answered her question from a historical perspective and knocked it out of the park !
she gave an answer that ahmed , who it turns out , is a islamic activist who was also very active in democratic politics at the time this event took place.watch :
