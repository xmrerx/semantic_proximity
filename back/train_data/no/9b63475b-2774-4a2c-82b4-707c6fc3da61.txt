@ nancypelosi screws up the oath of office while lecturing reporters about the seriousness of her job .
pic.twitter.com/hlgcxsqk4m josh caplan ( @ joshdcaplan ) july 30 , 2017 pelosi : as you know , today we ll be debating what s called the minibus , minibus .
not an omnibus , everything , minibus .
and it , on the subject of security , as you know , all of us , anyone who serves in government or civically involved takes an oath of office to protect and defend .
support and defend the constitution of the united states .
our first responsibility is to protect the american people and our constitution .
