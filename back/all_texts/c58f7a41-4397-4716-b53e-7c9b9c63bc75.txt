CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt praised on Tuesday U.S President Donald Trump’s criticism of Western media for what he said was their limited coverage of some militant attacks around the world, a statement from the Foreign Ministry said.
“The Foreign Ministry hailed the U.S. administration stance in this regard, referring to Egypt’s repeated calls upon the international community to adopt a comprehensive, coordinated and non-selective strategy to combat terrorism at all levels; security, political, cultural, media and others,” the statement said.
