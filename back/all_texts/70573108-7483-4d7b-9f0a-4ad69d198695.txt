She never does things the way the rest of us do.
She s always got an angle she s always got a way around doing things the way the everyday people she claims she represents do them.
How can any female say that lying, cheating and conniving Hillary is a role model for woman with a straight face?
Crooked Hillary Clinton wore an ear piece in last night s Commander in Chief Forum hosted by NBC and MSNBC.
This was the first event where both Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton were invited to attend together.
Each candidate received a short period with host Matt Lauer.
It was expected that both candidates would provide unaided answers to the questions asked but it appears Hillary did not.Donald Trump tweeted after the event his disdain for candidate Clinton using the ear piece which provided her a boost in answering questions.
Trump tweeted We can t let Hillary get away with wearing an ear piece during tonight s Veteran Forum .https://twitter.com/P0TUSTrump/status/773724216247984129Trump s not the only one who noticed:My article is the top fat link on Drudge.

President Obama was accused of doing the same thing in the debates in 2012 with candidate Romney and some have warned that this may happen again a few weeks ago.
The picture of the wireless earpiece above is similar to one Obama may have used during those debates.
As noted by thetruthdivision.com if you go back and watch the second and third debates in 2012, examine Obama s mannerism and head movements while he was watching Mitt Romney speak.Via: The Truth Division h/t GP
