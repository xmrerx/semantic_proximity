Late Night host Seth Meyers regularly has a high old time making fun of the incompetence of Donald Trump and his administration during his A Closer Look monologues.
On Thursday night, the subject was Trump s complete position change on the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
During the campaign, Trump had repeatedly called NAFTA a disaster, but all it took was a couple of phone calls from Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to get Trump to decide that the trade deal wasn t so bad after all.Meyers made fun of the whole thing by returning to his jokes prior to Trump s election, saying many of them are now reality, starting with: If we elect Trump we re going to end up fighting with Canada!
Ha!
Thanks to Trump s earlier threats to rip up NAFTA, Canada s softwood lumber exports became a hot topic.
This was a golden opportunity for Meyers, who insisted there would be no jokes about male anatomy, but then he proceeded to make them anyway, saying: I m just saying that Donald Trump does not want to be slapped with soft-Canadian wood so he s clamping down on it.
Meyers then went all in on the idea that Canada is deliberately axing prices of soft lumber a process he referred to as stumpage.
He continued: This is all very confusing for Trump because stumpage is his nickname for Donald Jr. As for the overall defeat of Trump s NAFTA termination promise?
That was the best joke of all, when Meyers ended with a total zinger: Something tells me this isn t the first time Trump has had to pull out because of soft wood.
HaHa, probably not.
Then again, that s why he and all of those other old GOP men insist that health insurance always includes Viagra coverage.Watch the mockery below:Featured image via video screen capture
