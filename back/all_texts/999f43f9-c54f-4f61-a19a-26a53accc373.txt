The majority of the country doesn t want Donald Trump as our president.
A-list celebrities and even marching bands don t want to perform at his inauguration.
And now, his former campaign manager and newest counselor Kellyanne Conway is finding out that private schools in the D.C. area don t want her kids either.Conway said on Wednesday that she is more amused than worried over the fact that none of the top notch schools in Washington want to accept her children.
I would not characterize myself as worried so much as amused by the silence and sighs on the other end of the phone when friends and allies have made preliminary inquiries on my behalf, Conway told the New York Post.Conway then pointed out that many of these schools tout diversity in their handbooks.
For some, there is comfort in sameness, she noted.
No wonder Trump likes her so much.
If I were an admissions counselor I d shy away from this too, but I digress.Nobody with any sense wants to be associated with Trump or his transition team in any way, shape, or form.
Conway is known as a talented spin doctor who now spends her days trying to explain why the horrible things that come out of Trump s mouth (or Twitter page) couldn t possibly be as abhorrent as they seem on the surface.Conway said she has been shocked by the flood of people who have offered to help her and her family with their move to D.C., but top schools apparently aren t so eager.
According to the Post, a source close to Conway said that she is desperate and is asking everyone with connections to D.C. schools for help.
Whether or nor real estate agents in Washington will want to work with her remains to be seen, as when asked about the matter she simply replied: First things first.
