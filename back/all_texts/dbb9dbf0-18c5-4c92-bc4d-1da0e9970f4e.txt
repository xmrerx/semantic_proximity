A couple of artists purchased the bus that Donald Trump used while campaigning in Iowa.
The artists have turned the bus into a spectacle of political satire.
They have made many changes to the bus, including changing Trump s campaign slogan from, Make America Great Again to Make Fruit Punch Great Again.
One of the funniest things about the bus wasn t even added by the artists.
The bus was initially rented from a party bus rental company, so it features a stripper pole.
The artists left it in, as they saw it as a perfect metaphor for Trump and his campaign.
The bus used to be used as a party bus and the Trump campaign leased it from them, but they never removed the stripper pole.
So we re kind of using that as kind of a metaphor for Trump.
Like all good satire, the bus is only changed slightly.
The artists added elements that fictionalize reality, in order to better examine it.
The small changes lead people to come look at the bus, with them not initially realizing what the bus actually is.
People come over and they re all excited and they don t even read that it says Make Fruit Punch Great Again, said Mary Mihelic, an artist who is part of the anti-Trump bus project according to the The Guardian.
And they re just totally taking pictures and then you ll hear someone say, Honey, it s a gag!
It s a gag!
And we just crack up.
The artists explain their intentions behind the installation in a video that is embedded below.
They claim that their work is meant to be non-partisan.
That being said, they say that they really, really do not want Trump to be the next president of The United States.You can watch a video about the mobile installation, below.
