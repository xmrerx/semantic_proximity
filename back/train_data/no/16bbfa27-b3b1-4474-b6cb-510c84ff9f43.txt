vienna ( reuters ) - tuesday s blast at austria s baumgarten gas hub , which killed one person and disrupted european gas flows , was most likely caused by a loose seal on a filter cap , operator gas connect austria ( gca ) said .
the hub in eastern austria is a major regional transfer node , taking gas from as far away as russia and pumping it towards neighbors including italy - its biggest recipient - as well as germany , hungary , slovenia and croatia .
the investigating authorities believe that the incident was caused by the seal on the cap of the filter separator , gca , a unit of energy company omv , said on its website .
the cap had come loose and was propelled with great force against another part , causing damage to this part as well .
the gas which subsequently escaped was then ignited , leading to a gas fire at two points of origin .
