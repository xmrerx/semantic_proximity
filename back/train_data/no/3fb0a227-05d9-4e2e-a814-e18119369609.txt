rome ( reuters ) - italian prime minister paolo gentiloni said on sunday he would propose to parliament transferring some of the country s troops stationed in iraq to niger to fight people smuggling and terrorism .
gentiloni said italy s 1,400-strong military presence in iraq could now be reduced after victories against islamic militants and instead deployed in the sahel region of west africa .
we have to continue to work , concentrating our attention and energies on the threat of people trafficking and terrorism in the sahel , he said aboard the italian ship etna used in the european union s sophia operation to counter people smuggling in the mediterranean .
for this reason , part of our forces in iraq will be deployed to niger in coming months - this is the proposal the government will make to parliament , gentiloni said .
he did not specify how many people would be sent to niger .
newspaper il fatto quotidiano wrote on sunday that the contingent would be at least 470 as part of a commitment made to french president emmanuel macron .
macron has thrown his weight behind a french-backed west african force known as the g5 sahel , which includes the armies of mali , mauritania , niger , burkina faso and chad , which was set up in october to tackle islamist militants .
to give the force a boost , macron held a paris summit on dec. 13 attended by the leaders of the five participating countries , germany and italy as well as saudi and emirati ministers .
the italian parliament is expected to be formally dissolved by the end of this year ahead of march elections .
but it will continue to meet for ordinary administration and could approve gentiloni s request for the transfer of military personnel .
