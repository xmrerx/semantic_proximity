it s about time !
the white house has been leaking like a sieve .
new white house communications director anthony scaramucci flatly said sunday that he as going to fire all future leakers on his watch : we re as strong as our weakest leak a smug john dickerson asked scaramucci why president donald trump had tweeted a day earlier about his ability to grant pardons .
scaramucci said the leaks of that conversation and other leaks were unprofessional , injurious to the government , and possibly felonious .
he s done absolutely nothing wrong .
there s no need for him to pardon anybody , scaramucci said .
but he just doesn t like the fact that he has a two-minute conversation in the oval office or in his study , and then people are running out and leaking that .
what happens to leakers on your watch ?
dickerson asked .
they re going to get fired , scaramucci said.scaramucci said he would hold a staff meeting on monday and make it clear that anyone who wants to stay on will not leak private conversations to the press .
we re as strong as our weakest leak , he said .
so if you guys want to keep leaking , why don t you guys all get together and make a decision as a team that you re going to stop leaking .
but if you re going to keep leaking , i m going to fire everybody .
