Donald Trump s wife was the headline speaker on the first night of the Republican National Convention.
It was supposed to be her big moment.
She was supposed to be convincing everyone that she was first lady material.
But that all went straight down the toilet when she got busted for stealing an entire paragraph of her speech straight from Michelle Obama s 2008 speech to the Democratic National Committee.Here is the suspicious section of Melania s speech:My parents impressed on me the value of that you work hard for what you want in life.
That your word is your bond and you do what you say and keep your promise.
That you treat people with respect.
Show the values and morals in in the daily life.
That is the lesson that we continue to pass on to our son.We need to pass those lessons on to the many generations to follow.
[Cheering] Because we want our children in these nations to know that the only limit to your achievement is the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.And here are the words from Michelle Obama s speech in 2008:And Barack and I were raised with so many of the same values: that you work hard for what you want in life; that your word is your bond and you do what you say you re going to do; that you treat people with dignity and respect, even if you don t know them, and even if you don t agree with them.And Barack and I set out to build lives guided by these values, and pass them on to the next generation.
Because we want our children and all children in this nation to know that the only limit to the height of your achievements is the reach of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.You can listen to the plagiarized portion of Melania s speech here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lxBTstcktnM]Plagiarism is never acceptable,and if this is the level of incompetence with which Trump s campaign is being run, just imagine how he and his administration would run the country.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
