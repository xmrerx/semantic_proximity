Trump, channeling Marie Antoinette, decided to share how he spent the moments leading up to committing an act of war against Syria: He was in Mar-a-Lago s dining room eating the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake.
True to form, Trump couldn t help but brag about the quality of dessert he was eating while relaying his war story to Fox s Maria Bartiromo who got an exclusive sit down with Trump to talk about his impulsive decision to take the country to the brink of war.Trump, who advocates cutting food programs for disadvantaged school children, thought America would want to know how great the Mar-a-Lago cakes are.
I was sitting at the table, we had finished eating, we were now having dessert.
And we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you ve ever had.
Words failing him, Trump outstretched his hands and gave an approximate size.
Since he s a big boy and was behaving well at dinner, Trump got an extra bigly slice of chocolate cake.
He was also quick to note that the President of China loved the chocolate cake.
It s now been 30 seconds since he was asked to describe his order to attack Syria.
He hadn t mentioned the country once.In fact, when Trump gets around to describing the country he just attacked he calls it Iraq.
Maria quickly clarifies that he means Syria.At least he got the flavor of cake right, if not the country, right?Trump says he told President Xi about US missile strikes in Syria over the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake pic.twitter.com/CTKtXBl9nI Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) April 12, 2017Featured image via Twitter
