the elitist media is exposing its bias and dislike for republican candidate donald trump .
jonah golberg and rick lowry just can t help themselves and have been going after trump since day one .
lowry brought the attacks to a new low last night when he threw his journalistic integrity away by personally attacking trump .
gosh , you d think these pundits would be more professional and have thicker skin than this .
trump is leading and it s simply because he s not a main stream candidate with canned answers pandering to anyone and everyone .
trump told the truth when he said carly has a horrible track record in business .
trump is still a strong candidate according to we the people and that s all that matters in the end .
