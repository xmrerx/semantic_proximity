wow !
the list just keeps getting longer and longer !
we can all find something to be offended by but should we ban all those things ?
i doubt anyone really gives any consideration to the history of the flour de lis as it is used in many different ways .
our history is just that so let it be and move forward already ! the fleur de lis , a french symbol used by royal families dating back to the 13th century , and emblazoned on the new orleans saints helmet , is now being called a symbol of slavery , drawing comparisons to the recent uproar against the confederate battle flag .
as an african i find it painful , and i think people whose ancestors were enslaved here may feel it even harder than i do as an african , said slave historian dr. ibrahima seck to wwltv.he connects the usage of the fleur de lis , to code noir , or black code , which was adopted in louisiana in 1724 , and used to govern the state s slave population.seck said a slave caught running away , would be taken before a court and the sentence would be being branded on one shoulder and with the fleur de lis , and then they would crop their ears .
seck isn t alone .
tulane history professor terence fitzmorris said , it was a brutal way of scarring someone and also identifying someone as a particular troublemaker .
the symbol is also used currently in the coat of arms for the king of spain .
