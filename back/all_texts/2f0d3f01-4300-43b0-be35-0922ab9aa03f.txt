Judge Jeanine commented this morning on the FBI Director s testimony yesterday and in true Judge Jeanine style she didn t hold back!
Why is he so comfortable with leaking?
The answers were hogwash!
Judge Jeanine is spot on in her assessment of Comey:James Comey comes across as someone who is so wily and so calculating He gets to the point that he says, I m going to start leaking this stuff now.
What is is about his time his background as a prosecutor.
And, what I would like to know is, is he the leaker?Is he the guy who was so comfortable.
And the answer is why did he didn t leak it himself, and the seagulls and the beach, is hogwash The fact that he is so comfortable, that he leaks this to a liberal professer, tells me he was a predator.He was looking to take Donald down.
What he wanted to do is take the president down.
He is an operator.
He is part of the liberal elite.
