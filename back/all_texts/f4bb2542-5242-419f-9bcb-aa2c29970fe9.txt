The left is officially ISIS ISIS terrorists have destroyed ancient sites that have been preserved for hundreds and hundred of years.
Well, the left isn t too far behind them some jackwagon took a sledgehammer to a 225-year old monument to Christpher Columbus Unreal!The Columbus statue is in Baltimore Shame on these thugs!Baltimore Brew has this to say about the memorial:Baltimore s 225-year-old monument to Christopher Columbus, said to be the oldest in the country and the world dedicated to the explorer that is still standing, has been severely vandalized.In case you re wondering, this is happening in other places in America.
We reported on two Catholic Saint statues that were vandalized and the Peace Monument in Atlanta that was also vandalized.
Are you getting the picture now?
It s not about the Confederacy but about hating anything America stands for.
Our kids have been well taught by liberal academia so they only know that Imperialist America stole everything from everyone Yada, Yada, Yada,,,THIS IS A TURNING POINT Some jackwagon narrates the video: Christopher Columbus symbolizes the initial invasion of European capitalism into the Western Hemisphere.
Columbus initiated a centuries-old wave of terrorism, murder, genocide, rape, slavery, ecological degradation and capitalist exploitation of labor in the Americas.
That Columbian wave of destruction continues on the backs of Indigenous, African-American and brown people.
Racist monuments to slave owners and murderers have always bothered me.
Baltimore s poverty is concentrated in African-American households, and these statues are just an extra slap in the face.
They were built in the 20th century in response to a movement for African Americans human dignity.
What kind of a culture goes to such lengths to build such hate-filled monuments?
What kind of a culture clings to those monuments in 2017?
