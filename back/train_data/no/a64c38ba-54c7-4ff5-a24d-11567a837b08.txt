nicosia ( reuters ) - two boats crowded with 305 syrian refugees arrived in cyprus overnight , police said on sunday , one of the largest group landings of migrants to the island since the outbreak of the syrian war in 2011 .
the vessels were tracked sailing to the north-west of the island and were thought to have set off from the turkish coastal city of mersin .
for their safety they were towed to harbor , a police spokesman said .
one of the vessels had been taking in water , the spokesman added .
cyprus is the closest european union member state to syria , yet many fleeing conflict have largely avoided the island because it has no direct easy access to the rest of the continent .
the single largest group arrival since the syrian conflict started was 345 people who were rescued in september 2014 .
police said they were questioning a 36 year old syrian man believed to have been steering one of the vessels .
the others would be taken to a reception center west of the capital , nicosia .
the syrians , who included many minors , appeared in good health .
a woman and her infant were taken to hospital for precautionary reasons , the spokesman added .
