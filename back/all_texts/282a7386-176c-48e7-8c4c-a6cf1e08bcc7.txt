Does anyone else find it ironic that black multi-millionaire athletes are protesting oppression in America after 8 years of our first Black President?How much courage does it take for these multi-millionaire athletes to stand in protest against the flag our US military members defend with their lives every day?
Members of our Armed Forces are making between $17,892 and $34,696 in basic pay, depending upon time served in the military and rank.
But yeah we can see why you multi-millionaire punks who are treated like royalty wherever you go, are all feeling so oppressed that you need to disrespect our flag and the brave men and woman who stand on the field next to you, while you spit on their sacrifices as a way to promote Obama s Black Lives Matter legacy NFL player-activists continued to take a knee Sunday during the national anthem to protest alleged oppression of blacks in America.On Sunday in Seattle, Dolphins running back Arian Foster, wide receiver Kenny Stills, safety Michael Thomas, and linebacker Jelani Jenkins took a knee as everyone else rose to honor America.
They are taking a knee for injustice in America, according to civil-rights activist Shaun King.But what is the end game?
How will we know when the injustice has subsided to the point so they can stand again?Perhaps when the murder rate in Chicago falls.
It s currently on a record pace (512 so far this year) with most of the victims African-American.
Or maybe when the black teen unemployment employment rate of 31 percent, six times higher than the national average, improves.Maybe that is what the NFL activists are waiting on, for these two oppressive situations to be fixed.Watch here:We will see.
Don t hold your breath.
This seems like a one-note song it s clearly an extension of the Black Lives Matter movement, and it s about police killing a few unarmed black suspects.
