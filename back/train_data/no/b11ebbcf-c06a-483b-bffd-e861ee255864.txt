how many of these punks treating police officers with disrespect will be the first to call them when they need help ? a minnesota sandwich shop worker should have thought twice before refusing to serve a police officer his lunch.the problem started thursday when edina police officer marcus limbeck went to a the bloomington jimmy john s restaurant and was confronted in the parking lot by an angry delivery driver who told him they would not serve him because the police ticket too many of the company s drivers , fox 9 reported.officer limbeck emailed some other officers to tell them of his experience with the unruly driver , according to fox 9.edina patrol officer , marcus limbeck told his fellow officers in an e-mail the delivery driver yelled at him in the parking lot , you coming down here to give us tickets now ?
inside , the same driver told him , you re not getting a sandwich here .
you ve given almost everybody here a ticket .
go get your sandwich someplace else .
the officer says the other workers were just laughing and snickering .
customers were in disbelief that they actually refused to serve the officer .
but the story has a happy ending for the cops , if not for the employee .
the comments were so egregious we terminated the employee immediatel , the franchise owner dan vansteenburg told fox 9 .
we have a lot of respect for law enforcement .
we are a law-abiding sandwich shop , but we are on the road and we deliver sandwiches .
vansteenburg also said he s like to treat all edina officers to free sandwiches or make a special donation to make up for it.according to fox 9 edina does write more tickets than any town in minnesota but it also have one of the state s lowest accident fatality rates.via : bizpac review
