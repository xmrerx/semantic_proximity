the reason the baltimore mayor gives for the huge settlement to the gray family is just insane !
just listen to her state that this settlement could prevent a future riot .
who is she trying to fool here ?
is she getting a kick back from this settlement ?
a much better use for the $ 6.4 million would be to help the businesses who lost everything in the riots because the police were told to stand down and do nothing while the city burned .
