At this point, it s fair to ask, What is Donald Trump s deal?
From allegedly paying Russian prostitutes to drain the swamp all over a bed because Obama once slept in it to stealing a photo from our last legitimate President s inauguration and attempting to pass it off as one of his own, to erasing as much of Obama s agenda as he could from the White House website, to immediately going for Obamacare s throat, it almost feels like The Donald s only purpose is to erase the President s legacy and douse it in Russian lady pee.
Now, it seems, he even stole a cake design from Obama.Duff Goldman, aka the Ace of Cakes made a very nice cake for the inaugural celebration.
According to Eater, it weighed between 40 and 50 pounds, stood about four feet tall, and featured red velvet, lemon poppy seed, pumpkin chocolate chip and pineapple coconut flavors.
Goldman designed the cake to honor all five branches of the military by displaying each of their seals prominently on the side of the cake basically, it s patriotic as f*ck.
Here is a photo of Trump, Pence, and one of the few immigrants they like admiring the cake:WASHINGTON, DC JANUARY 20: President Donald Trump, his wife First Lady Melania Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and Karen Pence clap before cutting the cake during A Salute To Our Armed Services Inaugural Ball at the National Building Museum on January 20, 2017 in Washington, DC.
President Donald Trump was sworn in as the 45th President of the United States today.

Trump just stole the design.
The cake on the left is the one I made for President Obama s inauguration 4 years ago, Goldman wrote on Twitter Friday.
The one on the right is Trumps.
I didn t make it.

Yes, that s right Trump plagiarizes a cake.
Naturally, even the folks on Twitter were kind of surprised that Trump would steal a cake design and much mockery ensued:@SunchBunny @Duff_Goldman Or urine.

Bex-a-boo (@RemembrancerBex) January 21, 2017@GamingLawyerJ @RemembrancerBex @Duff_Goldman the real question is if it's like all things Obama to Trump soaked in pee.
LittleOrphan Li0ness (@Li0ness_LoL) January 21, 2017@Duff_Goldman what haven't they copied or plagiarized?
jeez.
Sahil Lavingia (@shl) January 21, 2017@Duff_Goldman wow, they even copied the placement of each star ?
Riley (@heyrilo) January 21, 2017@NewaHailu @Duff_Goldman Like somewhere there's a creepy altar to Obama in Trump's house where he touches himself.

@Duff_Goldman Looks like Melania baked the cake Ian McCellan (@IanMcCellan) January 21, 2017@Duff_Goldman for fuck's sake, these people.
First plagiarized speeches, now plagiarized cakes.
Lexistential (@lexistential) January 21, 2017@Duff_Goldman They stole your design after Melania failed to come through.
Fortunately someone took a photo of her cake before it was binned pic.twitter.com/fFJYzUChcL Tan Joll (@Cukeyishere) January 21, 2017At this point, Trump s seeming desire to both be and destroy Obama is looking, well, pretty fucking crazy.
But, hey if this trend continues, maybe we ll see Donaldcare (an exact replica of the Affordable Care Act with an idiot s name attached) appear as Trump s replacement.
It s not like he has a plan of his own.Featured image via screengrab
