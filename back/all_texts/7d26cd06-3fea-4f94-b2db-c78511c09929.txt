Perhaps a few random flash mobs protesting Target s decision to put the feelings of .01% of our population before the safety of our women and children are in order?Video showing a woman protesting the bathroom policy at Target has gone viral.
A video posted on YouTube shows the woman, who says she s a mother of 12, carrying a Bible through the store and yelling, America, when are you going to wake up?
It s time to take a stand and have a voice.
She calls the store s bathroom policy a wicked practice and says she wouldn t spend a penny there.You can see other people with her in the video, which lasts less than two minutes, and then shows them walking out.https://youtu.be/TCIYsXhR1D0Target has said that in its stores, transgender people are free to use whichever restroom they feel comfortable with.
