The double standard here is unbelievable!
We just reported on a high school student in big trouble for saying Build the Wall in her yearbook quote.
That s pretty harmless but the school took back the yearbooks .Fast forward and a high school student wrote out their thoughts on President Trump in the yearbook I would like to behead him.
I do not like him.
See the huge difference here?MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) Just under a month after a Big Lake trap team s photo was banned from the high school yearbook, another high school yearbook photo is making news.For its 2017 yearbook, Brainerd High School dedicated a page to President Donald Trump.
Editors asked students their thoughts on the president, and shared the quotes next to their picture.One sophomore said, I would like to behead him.
I do not like him.
The photo went viral, sparking controversy on Twitter.
Now, that student is telling her side of the story.
I was so confused, because at first, I didn t ever remember saying that, 15-year-old Camryn said.Camryn who asked WCCO not to reveal her last name says she had no idea a conversation with a classmate last September would lead to nationwide attention.
She says the classmate never said she was working for the yearbook when she asked about then-candidate Donald Trump.
I did not say, I want to behead him.
I did not say, I am going to behead him.
I just said, Well I m sure we all wouldn t mind him being beheaded, something along those lines, Camryn said.
But there was never the direct quote, I do not like him.
I would like to behead him.
That conversation exploded on social media 8 months later, with the help of at least one celebrity.
Former Joanie Loves Chachi actor Scott Baio shared the photo, tagging the president, the FBI, Sean Hannity and Kellyanne Conway.Read more: CBS
