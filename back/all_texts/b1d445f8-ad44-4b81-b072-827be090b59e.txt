During an appearance on MSNBC s Morning Joe on Thursday, comedian D.L Hughley explained how it is impossible for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump to just be a little racist.
Hughley plugged his new book, Black Man, White House: An Oral History of the Obama Years, during the segment.
Hughley did not hold back during the interview, where the he told the show s host Joe Scarborough his opinion of Trump.
Hughley flat out told Scarborough that he thinks the presidential candidate is a racist: I think he s a racist.
You can t equivocate.
If I m in a car, and somebody I m with commits a crime, I can t make a reasonable argument that I didn t know.
Hughley continued, saying: And I think you can t be a little bit pregnant, and I don t think you can be a little bit racist.
That is the absolute truth.
Of course, there are different ways that people can be racist.
Seeing as the United States is a racist society, everyone grows up with racism shaping their perspective of the world, causing unconscious biases to emerge in themselves.
Those biases are easy for racists like Trump to exploit for their own political gain.
That might partly explain why Trump supporters will swear that they do not at all support racism, yet back a candidate who is blatantly using racism to further his agenda.Well, except for the various leaders in the white supremacist organizations who back the candidate.
They know that Trump is a racist and feel he is the best one to spread hatred and intolerance across the nation.
Across the nation, there have examples of the racist rhetoric that Trump uses influencing children who bully other children.You can watch the full segment below in full.Featured image via video screenshot
