@realDonaldTrump : - The failing @nytimes, which has made every wrong prediction about me including my big election win (apologized), is totally inept!
[0638 EDT] - The Trump base is far bigger & stronger than ever before (despite some phony Fake News polling).
Look at rallies in Penn, Iowa, Ohio....... [0658 EDT] - ...and West Virginia.
The fact is the Fake News Russian collusion story, record Stock Market, border security, military strength, jobs..... [0704 EDT] - ... Supreme Court pick, economic enthusiasm, deregulation & so much more have driven the Trump base even closer together.
Will never change!
[0709 EDT] - Hard to believe that with 24/7 #Fake News on CNN, ABC, NBC, CBS, NYTIMES & WAPO, the Trump base is getting stronger!
[0718 EDT] - Working hard from New Jersey while White House goes through long planned renovation.
Going to New York next week for more meetings.
[0732 EDT] - Interesting to watch Senator Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut talking about hoax Russian collusion when he was a phony Vietnam con artist!
[0747 EDT] - Never in U.S.history has anyone lied or defrauded voters like Senator Richard Blumenthal.
He told stories about his Vietnam battles and.... [0752 EDT] - ...conquests, how brave he was, and it was all a lie.
He cried like a baby and begged for forgiveness like a child.
Now he judges collusion?
[0801 EDT] - On #PurpleHeartDayI thank all the brave men and women who have sacrificed in battle for this GREAT NATION!
#USA [1403 EDT] - The Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Councilâ€™s 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N. Korea!
[1615 EDT] - How much longer will the failing nytimes, with its big losses and massive unfunded liability (and non-existent sources), remain in business?
[1639 EDT] - I think Senator Blumenthal should take a nice long vacation in Vietnam, where he lied about his service, so he can at least say he was there [1648 EDT] -- Source link: (bit.ly/2jBh4LU) (bit.ly/2jpEXYR)
