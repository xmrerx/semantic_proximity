washington ( reuters ) - republican ted cruz , a key conservative in the u.s. senate , on wednesday said tax reform should slash the corporate income tax rate to 15-20 percent from the current 35 percent rate , substantially below the 20-25 percent range being targeted by the trump administration and republicans in congress .
in a speech at a tax forum , cruz also opened the door to expanding the deficit to pay for tax cuts and said congress should pass a 2018 budget resolution with a 20-30 year window , arguing that doing so would better ensure that tax reform leads to long-lasting economic growth .
