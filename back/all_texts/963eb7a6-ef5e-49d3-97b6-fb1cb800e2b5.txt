Since the beginning of Donald Trump s campaign for president, his cornerstone plan has been to build a wall, a great, big, YUGE wall, spanning the entirety of the United States and Mexico border.
He s got his fans so excited to be racist that they just can t wait to be the utter isolationists they ve always wanted the country to be.Well, it looks as though Trump just disproved the effectiveness of walls as he was able to easily climb over one on his way to a campaign stop in San Francisco, California.
He needed to do so because of all the protesters who had arrived.
And because things got very heated, with violent exchanges between the pro and anti-Trump crowds, the real estate mogul had to find an alternative way into the Hyatt Regency where his event was taking place.Of course, he noticed the very tangible hypocrisy in the whole ordeal, but he made a joke of it in very a Trumpian fashion.
He told his crowd: That was not the easiest entrance I ve ever made.
It felt like I was crossing the border, actually.
Which is both offensive because it s NOTHING like crossing the border, as many have died seeking better lives for themselves and their families, and it was true only in the sense that a border wall is a joke of an idea.
Clearly, as Trump has just proven himself, one can find a way over, or even under walls.
The centerpiece of his campaign was just flushed down the toilet by the reality star himself.Maybe Trump will now start talking actual policy plans.
Ha!
Who am I kidding?
He has no plans, he just wants to be King of America, because he clearly thinks he deserves it, despite not having any of the proper experience whatsoever..@realDonaldTrump forced to climb over wall to attend his own event in San Francisco.
