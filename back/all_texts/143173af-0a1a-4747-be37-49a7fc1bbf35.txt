Teflon Don The media just can t make anything stick to Trump, because he just doesn t care Donald Trump endorsed waterboarding at a rally at a convention center in Ohio on Monday night, saying it is nothing compared to what ISIS does.
They chop off our young people s heads and put them on a stick, Trump said.
They build these iron cages, and they ll put 20 people in them and they drop them in the ocean for 15 minutes and pull them up 15 minutes later.
Would I approve waterboarding?
You bet your ass I would, Trump said.
And I would approve more than that.
Don t kid yourself, folks.
It works, okay?
It works.
Only a stupid person would say it doesn t work.
It works, Trump said.
Only a stupid person would say it doesn t work.
Believe me, it works.
And you know what?
If it doesn t work, they deserve it anyway, for what they re doing.
It works.
