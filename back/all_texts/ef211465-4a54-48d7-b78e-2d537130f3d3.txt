Donald Trump s buffonery, lies, and unhinged antics are not playing well on the world stage.
The latest embarrassment to Americans from Trump comes via his weirdly timed campaign rally, held this weekend in Florida.
During the rally, Trump attacked the media as fake like he always does, and, of course made up lots of ludicrous and bizarre lies.One such lie was designed to defend the Muslim ban, and he used a made-up terror attack in Sweden to do so.
Trump told his crowd of brainwashed fans: When you look at what s happening in Germany, when you look at what s happening last night in Sweden Sweden!
Who would believe this?
Sweden!
They took in large numbers, they re having problems like they never thought possible.
Trump s lie did not go unnoticed by former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt.
Bildt took to Twitter to mock Trump s delusional statement, saying: Sweden?
Terror attack?
What has he been smoking?
Questions abound.
Here is the tweet:Sweden?
Terror attack?
What has he been smoking?
Questions abound.

Whether he is high or not is a mystery; all we do know is that any normal person watching the train wreck that is Trump s first month in office knows that something isn t right upstairs with this guy.
Bildt wasn t finished with Trump with just that one tweet, though.
He went on to tweet a mocking photo of a muppet Swedish Chef who Bildt says is sought for the attack, complete with butcher knives.Donald Trump has only been in office for one month, and already his behavior is making America a laughingstock.
Hell, his very candidacy did that, to say nothing of his presidency.
He s an absolute disgrace, and dangerously unhinged.
Trump must be removed.
