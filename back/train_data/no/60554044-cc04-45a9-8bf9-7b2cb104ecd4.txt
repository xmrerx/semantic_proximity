jakarta ( reuters ) - indonesian president joko widodo has nominated the chief of staff of the air force to be the new head of the armed forces ( tni ) , to replace a controversial general who is due to retire in april .
air chief marshal hadi tjahjanto has close ties to the president and was previously in charge of an air base in the city of solo , on the island of java , when widodo was its mayor .
since then , tjahjanto has been promoted a number of times including to inspector general of the defense ministry and the president s military secretary .
marshal hadi tjahjanto is considered capable and qualified to become tni commander , presidential spokesman johan budi told reporters on monday after confirming the nomination .
the proposal had been sent to the parliament , which needs to approve it , he said .
abdul kharis almasyhari , chairman of a parliamentary commission with oversight of defense and security , said the commission would do a fit and proper assessment of the nomination , which hopefully could be completed by a dec. 14 recess .
the outgoing armed forces chef , general gatot nurmantyo , who will step down at the end of his term in april , has often courted controversy over what analysts see as his political ambitions .
he has been accused of whipping up nationalist sentiment by promoting the notion that indonesia is besieged by proxy wars waged by foreign states looking to undermine it .
in october , widodo said the armed forces should stay out of politics and ensure their loyalty was only to the state and the government - a statement many believed referred to nurmantyo s actions .
there has been speculation that nurmantyo would seek to run for vice president or even president in 2019 .
nurmantyo has not confirmed any political ambitions .
he told a briefing in october the military was neutral in practical politics .
