berlin ( reuters ) - a german court sentenced a 27-year-old german supporter of islamic state to three years and three months in prison on monday for plotting to lure police or soldiers into a trap and kill them with a home-made bomb .
the ruling came with german authorities on high alert ahead of tuesday s anniversary of an attack last year in which a failed tunisian asylum-seeker plowed a truck into crowds at an outdoor christmas market and killed 12 people .
prosecutors said the suspect , identified only as sascha l. , had carried out two successful tests of a home-made explosive device in his hometown in january .
an inquiry found two videos of the accused pledging allegiance to islamic state s leader .
however , the court ruled on monday that there was no evidence that the man had a personal connection with the islamist militia or that he was financially supported by the militia , german broadcaster ndr reported .
ndr said the court granted him leniency since he cooperated with authorities after his arrest and confessed his plans .
german magazine der spiegel had reported that the man was part of the far-right scene in the past before converting to salafism , an ultra-conservative islamist creed .
the man , who was arrested in february , admitted planning an attack .
chemicals that could be used to make explosive devices were found during a search of his home in the town of northeim in central germany .
three men charged as accomplices of the convicted man also appeared before the court .
two were convicted , with one sentenced to three years probation and the other to 100 hours of community service .
the third person was acquitted .
last week , german police raided nine locations in berlin and the eastern state of saxony anhalt in an investigation of four people suspected of planning an islamist-motivated attack .
