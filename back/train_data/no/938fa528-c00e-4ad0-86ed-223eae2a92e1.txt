khartoum ( reuters ) - at least three people were killed and more than 20 wounded when sudanese troops clashed at a south darfur refugee camp with displaced people protesting against a visit by president omar al-bashir , the united nations mission said on friday .
the united nations said clashes erupted when troops dispersed protesters as bashir visited the shatia area , where the government has been accused of ethnic cleansing , in his first trip there since the conflict in darfur war broke out in 2003 .
bashir traveled to darfur to show progress before a u.s. decision in october on lifting sanctions in return for sudan meeting conditions , including resolving conflicts and improving humanitarian efforts on the ground .
at least three displaced people were killed and 26 more wounded when troops cleared protesters at the kalma camp , the joint u.n. , african union peacekeeping mission , known as unamid , said in a statement .
i call upon everyone involved in this situation to restore calm as soon as possible .
a peaceful resolution of differences is the only way forward for the darfuri people , said unamid joint special representative , jeremiah mamabolo .
sudan s government in south darfur later said in a statement that two had died in clashes between displaced people at the camp opposed to bashir s visit and those who supported him .
it said some had opened fire on security forces .
conflict in darfur began in 2003 when mainly non-arab tribes took up arms against sudan s arab-led government .
fighting between the army and rebels in the southern kordofan and blue nile regions also broke out again in 2011 , when south sudan declared independence .
short term truces have been announced last year .
