fox news harris faulkner blows up the whole russia collusion theory with one smart question that we re sure the media will ignore ! on sunday , fox news anchor harris faulkner asked the best question to those who believe both , that there was collusion and that jared kushner had or reached out for a secret back channel with russia after the election : if it s true , wouldn t that signify that there was not collusion ?
why would you need a back channel with the kremlin if , in fact , you already had several established ?
faulkner s comments are approx .
at the 24:45 point : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ip2av70piwcthe media is so busy trying to point the finger at trump or his administration that they can t see logic .
it s like a feeding frenzy when those feeding end up eating themselves .
this won t end well for democrats because americans see the truth .
the truth is that obama spied on americans and the fbi is culpable.as we listen 24/7 to the fake news and fake outrage about russia spying and stealing our election , the news clip below gets to the real scandal that no one is reporting on : james rosen : pelosi confessed ignorance of this week s disclosure that the national security agency for at least five years under the obama administration systematically violated americans fourth amendment rights civil liberties groups said the disclosures should factor into lawmakers decision at year s end about whether to reauthorize the nsa collection program that witnessed the abuses the sheer scale of the 4th amendment violations is staggering , as was the sternness of the rebuke of the obama administration by the fisa court , which ordinarily approves 99.9 % of the government s request.as of a few minutes ago , this story had not been covered by the washington post , the new york times or any of the three broadcast networks.comey s fbi broke its own rules
