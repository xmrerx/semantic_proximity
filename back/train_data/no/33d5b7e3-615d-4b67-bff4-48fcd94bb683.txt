kabul ( reuters ) - american warplanes in afghanistan are dropping bombs in numbers not seen since the height of the u.s. troop surge in 2010 , after president donald trump announced a new strategy in august to ease attack curbs and widen the range of militant targets .
in september , for example , the u.s. air force dropped 751 bombs , an increase of nearly 50 percent from the august figure of 503 , to reach its highest single-month total in seven years , military data showed .
the increase can be attributed to the president s strategy to more proactively target extremist groups that threaten the stability and security of the afghan people , the air force said in a monthly report .
six more f-16 fighter bombers have been deployed to bagram air field north of the afghan capital of kabul , and additional massive b-52 bombers have been assigned to strike afghanistan from bases in the persian gulf , it added .
the air force numbers exclude strikes by the u.s. army , which maintains armed helicopters and other aircraft in afghanistan .
trump s south asia strategy included promises to expand authority for u.s. forces to target militants in afghanistan .
these killers need to know they have nowhere to hide ; that no place is beyond the reach of american might and americans arms , trump said in his august speech unveiling the strategy .
retribution will be fast and powerful .
former president barack obama s plans to drawdown the u.s. mission in afghanistan often limited u.s. troops to attacking the taliban only in certain circumstances , such as self-defense .
this month , defense secretary james mattis confirmed to congress that those restrictions would be lifted under trump s plan .
