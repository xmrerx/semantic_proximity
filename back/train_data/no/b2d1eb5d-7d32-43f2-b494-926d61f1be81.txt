you got ta hand it to her whether you love or hate trump fox news andrea tantaros is right on the money with her assessment of the national review s unabated hate for trump national review s rich lowry gleefully bashed trump on outnumbered for coming in second in iowa .
tantaros let him have it.rich lowry : he went to iowa and he lost !
and he was beaten fair and square by ted cruz .
and if this thing would have gone one more day rubio probably would have clipped him .
it s because he skipped the fox debate , he insulted one of the anchors andrea tantaros : this is what i don t understand .
the party has shifted into a nationalist mode and the voters are angry and they ve been discounted and insulted by your publication .
it s really , really rude tell me this logic .
this is the logic i m hearing from you .
third place is a win .
second place is a loss and first place is irrelevant ? via : gateway pundit
