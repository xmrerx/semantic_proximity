jerusalem ( reuters ) - a top israeli diplomat was rebuked by prime minister benjamin netanyahu on thursday for suggesting that american jews have a poor commitment to service in the u.s. military .
asked in an english-language television interview about criticism of israeli policies by some u.s. jews , deputy foreign minister tzipi hotovely questioned whether people that never send their children to fight for their country could understand the complexity of the middle east .
most of the jews don t have children serving as soldiers , going to the marines , going to afghanistan or to iraq , she said on i24 tv news on wednesday .
they don t feel how it feels to be attacked by rockets , and i think part of it is to actually experience what israel is dealing with on a daily basis , said hotovely , a member of netanyahu s right-wing likud party .
while israel has often quarreled with american jews over their right to advise it from afar , hotovely s remarks went further by appearing to insinuate they are not fully committed to their native country , a notion u.s. jewish organizations have long fought against in their battle against anti-semitism .
in a statement , netanyahu , who also serves as israel s foreign minister , denounced hotovely s comments as hurtful .
there is no place for such a harangue and her remarks do not reflect the state of israel s position , the statement said .
according to a 2009 survey published by the congressionally-mandated military leadership diversity commission , an estimated 1.09 percent of the members of the u.s. armed forces are jewish .
the pew research center estimated in 2013 that jews make up about 2 percent of the u.s. adult population .
the website of the national museum of american jewish military history in washington lists more than 50 jewish service members killed in iraq and afghanistan since 2001 .
