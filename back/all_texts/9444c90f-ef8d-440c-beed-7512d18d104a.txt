Is anyone the least bit surprised that the Obama administration hasn t contacted the Navajo Tribal Leaders since the tragic spill of toxic water by the EPA?
Here s a quote from the Navajo Nation President: I keep saying when are we going to hear from the White House?
Not a word, Begaye said, according to Native News.
When somebody wins the Super Bowl or an NBA Championship, they get a call, right?
And when something like this happens and people are suffering, nothing.
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Arizona Gov.
Doug Ducey Friday visited the Navajo Nation reservation s capital Window Rock to celebrate the Native Americans whose indecipherable language helped keep messages secret from enemies during World War II.The event though was met by a protest regarding the federal government s response to a toxic spill into rivers considered a lifeline for reservation and halted use of water for residential and agricultural use.According to Native News, McCain and Ducey met with Navajo Nation President Russell Begaye and Vice President Jonathan Nez to discuss the creation of a Navajo Code Talkers Museum.But the recent spill of millions of gallons of contaminated wastewater into the Animas and San Juan Rivers by a contractor doing work for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ended up being the focus for the tribal leaders.
