WASHINGTON (Reuters) - WikiLeaks founder and editor-in-chief Julian Assange said on Wednesday his organization planned to release “significant” information linked to the campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton before the Nov. 8 election.
Asked if the data could be a game-changer in the election, the Australian told Fox News in an interview conducted by satellite: “I think it’s significant.
You know, it depends on how it catches fire in the public and in the media.” Assange has been living in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London for five years to avoid extradition to Sweden, where he faces sexual assault accusations.
He denies the allegations.
WikiLeaks released files in July of what it said were audio recordings pulled from the emails of the Democratic National Committee that were obtained by hacking its servers.
That release, during the Democratic National Convention where Clinton was officially named the party’s presidential nominee, was the second batch in a series that deeply rattled the party and prompted the committee’s chairwoman, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, to step down.
“I don’t want to give the game away, but it’s a variety of documents, from different types of institutions that are associated with the election campaign, some quite unexpected angles, some quite interesting, some even entertaining,” Assange said when asked how the next revelations would compare with those in July WikiLeaks publishes leaked material, mostly from governments.
In 2010, the organization published classified U.S. military and diplomatic documents in one of the largest information leaks in U.S. history.
