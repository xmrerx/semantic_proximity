Earlier in January, 31-year-old Michael Cox was found guilty of sexually abusing a five-year-old girl.After the jury read the verdict, attorneys for the prosecution and defense approached the bench for a sidebar with the judge.As the attorneys were making their way back across the courtroom, Cox suddenly attacked Deputy District Attorney Scot Key in a violent rage, shoving him to the ground, before leaping on top of him.As the courtroom erupted in chaos, Transport Officer KaeDea Smith burst onto the scene.Video of the incident shows the female officer shooting like a bolt of lightning through the double doors leading into the courtroom.Within seconds she has the rampaging pedophile pinned to the floor.Thankfully, Cox did not have a gun on him during his courtroom rampage.Here s video of the attack, courtesy of KOB.This is poetic justice at its finest.
Since Cox is clearly used to victimizing helpless little girls who can t defend themselves, let alone others, it s fitting to see his rampage brought to an end by this heroic and incredibly badass female officer.Unlike many of the cops we hear about today, Officer Smith put the safety of others before her own, rushing in to protect the attorneys, judge, jury and others.Instead of firing her police-issued weapon into a crowded courtroom, she used non-lethal force to subdue the threat.During an interview with KRQE, Officer Smith told reporters she was just doing her job.
I was able to get a hold of the defendant and use the least amount of force possible to go ahead and detain him to get him under control.
While the law does require police officers to use the least amount of force necessary to get a suspect to comply with orders, it s not often in today s news cycle that we hear of a cop actually doing what the law requires.The violent rampage was caught on camera in Otero County, New Mexico s 12th Judicial District courtroom, on January 20.The best part of this is knowing that someday, when Cox s 5-year-old victim is old enough to understand what happened in that courtroom, she ll get to watch the man that molested her get taken down by someone who was a little girl once, too.Featured image from video screen capture from KOB
