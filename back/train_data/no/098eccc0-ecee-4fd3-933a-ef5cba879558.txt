ambassador john bolton was on lou dobbs tonight to comment on the susan rice news .
it s being reported that she called for the unmasking of names for likely political reasons .
if that s the case then she can be charged with fraud she should lawyer up asap .
reports are showing that the unmasking and spying increased as it came closer to trump s inauguration .
that could be the clue that this was stricly political .
who can forget her lies on 5 different morning shows after benghazi .
she s clearly someone who has zero credibility and who should be investigated for using intelligence for political purposes .
throw her in the slammer or give her immunity and make her talk ? john bolton this is stunning news .
and you can t , even somebody as senior as the national security advisor , can t just decide they d like to unmask names to find out whose name is involved in a particular intercept if she said that even somebody as senior as her but her real motivation was political she was committing a kind of fraud on the intelligence gathering system and if she participated in that kind of fraud to help the political misuse of that intelligence she s got serious legal problems here .
.
@ ambjohnbolton says susan rice defrauded the intelligence system : she s got real legal problems here .
