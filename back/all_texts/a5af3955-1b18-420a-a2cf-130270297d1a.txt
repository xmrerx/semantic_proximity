WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday that the government shutdown threatened by President Donald Trump is unnecessary and not wanted by lawmakers in Congress.
“I don’t think anyone is interested in having a shutdown.
I don’t think it is in our interests to do so,” Ryan told a news conference in Oregon.
