Proving that they really don t want anything to do with improving relations with local law enforcement.
This hateful and divisive movement is about reparations and getting special privileges.
The Oakland Police Department (OPD) extended an invitation to followers of the Black Lives Matter movement to participate in a barbecue to start a constructive dialogue between the two groups.
However, the police were met with flat-out rejection by a spokesperson who referred to law enforcement as pigs.
A BBQ is definitely not going to stop this blockade, Karissa Lewis, a self-described radical black farmer from East Oakland, told local Fox affiliate KTVU.
And as a radical-black farmer from East Oakland, I eat pigs, I don t eat with them, she said.According to KTVU, Lewis used the mic-check call and response technique, which was popularized at many of the Occupy protests, in order to rally support for her response from fellow protesters, who also rejected the offer.
KTVU notes that many of the activists, at least at this one protest, seemed to be in agreement with her about the offer.
