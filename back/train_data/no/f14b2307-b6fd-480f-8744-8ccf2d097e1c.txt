harare ( reuters ) - zimbabwe will upgrade its main airport at a cost of $ 153 million in an effort to attract more visitors , state media reported on thursday , as authorities renamed the airport in honor of 93-year-old president robert mugabe .
harare international airport will from thursday be known as robert mugabe international airport and is expected to undergo an upgrade so that it can handle 6.5 million passengers a year , more than double its current capacity .
state-owned herald newspaper reported that china export and import bank will provide a $ 153 million loan that will , among other things , be used to expand the runway to allow multiple planes to land at the same time .
accepting the honor , mugabe said renaming the airport was a great gesture to him and his family .
in the last few months , mugabe s vocal ruling zanu-pf youth wing has been pushing the government to honor mugabe by giving public institutions his name .
the government has said from next year the veteran ruler s feb. 21 birthday will be known as robert mugabe national youth day , a public holiday .
on aug 9. the cash-strapped government announced plans to build a $ 1 billion university named after mugabe , a move that was criticized by the opposition as a waste of resources .
mugabe is the only leader that zimbabwe has known since independence from britain in 1980 and despite his advanced age , he remains the most influential political figure in the country .
