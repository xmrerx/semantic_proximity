trump supporters became triggered after budweiser s super bowl ad that told the story of co-founder adolphus busch s journey from germany to the united states as a legal immigrant .
after finding out that immigrants are responsible for their favorite wife-beatin fuel , the right flew into a frenzy and began yet another in a long string of successful ( for the targeted companies ) string of boycotts.very quickly , # boycottbudwiser was trending as trump s uneducated followers unleashed their ( there ? )
rage against the company : # boycottbudwiser budwiser owned by brazilian company .
nothing 'usa ' about them .
moth-balled the clydesdales .

# boycottbudweiser # boycottbudwiser no2losers ( @ c20e75aaf88d4af ) february 6 , 2017 # boycottbudwiser you shoulda stuck with the clydesdale 's .that ad was a `` real stinker '' mary gustafson ( @ cathlametgirl ) february 6 , 2017worst commercial 's ever .
# super bowl # boycottbudwiser daisy ( @ ollielove44 ) february 6 , 2017now , you might have noticed something a little off with the boycott specifically with the spelling .
this , of course , is an indicator of the intelligence level of the average conservative , but it also functions as a source of endless entertainment for those of us who need a good laugh .
naturally , the internet piled on , mocking the right for somehow failing so hard that their stupidity is trending on twitter : i 'm guessing this is the guy who started # boycottbudwiser pic.twitter.com/fxha1h3h75 vanessa ( @ foxnfeather ) february 6 , 2017 # boycottbudwiser ? ? ?
really ? ? ?
please be * wiser * and learn to spell colleen mcnellis ( @ c0l_train ) february 6 , 2017this is why # devos should not be secretary of education .
# boycottbudwiser # stupid pic.twitter.com/2gnktxkuvf alex f. suarez ( @ goldbraingds ) february 6 , 2017i see betsy devos taught the `` special snowflakes '' on the right how to spell # boycottbudwiser .
education is important , even to spell a beer .
mike ( @ fallenangel722 ) february 6 , 2017i do n't get # boycottbudwiser ( misspelled ) -i thought this ad showcased the american dream.i have a prob w/illegal immigration , not immigrants trisha douglas ( @ trishakdouglas ) february 6 , 2017devos is already affecting our education lmao ? ?
trump supporters ca n't even spell budweiser # boycottbudwiser pic.twitter.com/43bjlohu5j chris smith ( @ lilyachttty ) february 6 , 2017besides spelling , # boycottbudwiser is protest of what ?
white , legal immigration ?
the guy even spoke english , unlike my german ancestors .
lisa falkenberg ( @ chronfalkenberg ) february 6 , 2017guys , let 's totally # boycottbudwiser okay ?
meanwhile , budweiser is double-loling at the ignorance .
mr. will wong ( @ mrwillw ) february 6 , 2017hey , supporters of the pumpkin , how about y'all learn to spell first before going around boycotting everything # boycottbudwiser sai sailaja seshadri ( @ saisailu97 ) february 6 , 2017it might be a good idea for trump supporters to # boycottbudwiser after they stop trying to boycott public schools progressive spring ( @ progressspring ) february 6 , 2017ultimately , any conservative boycott is doomed to fail , even against budwiser , budweiser , or any other beer company .
after all , their idea of a starbucks boycott was to buy lots of coffee and tell the barista their name is trump .
budwiser s erm , budwiser s commercial was nothing aside from a history lesson about the company , but the right s reaction proves that they aren t just concerned with keeping our country safe .
they are boycotting a company for a commercial that supports legal immigration the same thing they say is their concern.read more : featured image via screengrab
