patriotism is alive and well at this florida school ! coopergate school s facebook page has a statement on what two young patriots did : this is what respect looks like at coppergate .
two of our safety patrols , nate and isaac , quietly went to the courtyard and completed their flag duty in a driving rainstorm.not only did they bring the flag down , they also stood in the wind and rain and calmly completed the 13 folds .
then nate protected the flag as he walked with honor and respect to retire it for the day .
we are so proud of nate and isaac for their responsibility , respect , devotion to duty , and love of country.here s the story : two florida elementary school students are being praised for their show of respect for the american flag despite the pouring rain.isaac davis and nate helmath , both 11 years old , are safety patrols at coppergate elementary school in middleburg and are in charge of lowering old glory at dismissal time.however , last week , a torrential rainstorm passed over the school , making flag duty a wetter-than-usual experience .
still , driving rains could not stop isaac and nate from doing their duty.the two brought the flag down and completed the 13 folds while standing in the pouring rain.via : fox news
