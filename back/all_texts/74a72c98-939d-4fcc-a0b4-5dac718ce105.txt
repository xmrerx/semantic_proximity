The Washington Post dropped a bombshell intelligence revelation on us all on Friday: Russia wanted Donald Trump to be president, and they spent the entire election cycle doing all they could to get him elected.
Now, no matter which candidate the Kremlin wanted in office, every American, regardless of political leanings, should be very alarmed that a hostile foreign power had its hands in our democratic process.
However, one GOP Senator, John Cornyn (R-TX) seems to think that since it was his candidate that Vladimir Putin and his thugs successfully got into office, this story is much ado about nothing.
Cornyn tweeted:All this "news" of Russian hacking: it has been going on for years.
Serious, but hardly news JohnCornyn (@JohnCornyn) December 10, 2016No, Senator Cornyn, this is DEFINITELY news.
It just so happens that it is news that you didn t want the American people to know.
Essentially, your guy got into office with the help of Putin and the Kremlin, and you guys seem to be just fine with that for whatever reason.
You should NOT be fine with it, as Russia is no friend to the United States of America.
We all know this.
However, your boy Trump is in love with Putin, so suddenly the most anti-Russia Republicans are A-OK with the Kremlin meddling in our elections.
The ends justify the means, right?You guys need to wake the hell up.
We literally are about to have Putin running America, and you don t think that s news?
If not, it s time for you, sir, to find a new job.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
