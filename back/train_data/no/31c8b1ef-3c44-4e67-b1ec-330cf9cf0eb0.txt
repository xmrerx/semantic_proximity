jerusalem ( reuters ) - jewish ultra-orthodox demonstrators protesting the arrest of a prospective army conscript from their community clashed with police in jerusalem on sunday and eight men were detained , police said .
police used a water canon and mounted officers dispersed the protest that briefly turned violent near jerusalem s military recruiting office which lies on the edge of one of the city s ultra-orthodox neighborhoods .
although most ultra-orthodox seminary students gain exemption from military service on religious grounds , they must obtain their exemption through a conscription procedure .
police said the protest was prompted by the man s arrest after he refused to turn up for recruitment .
last week israel s supreme court ruled that parts of the conscription law that exempt seminary students were unconstitutional and gave the government a year to resolve the matter .
most jewish israelis , men and women , are called up for military service when they turn 18 .
police spokeswoman luba samri said protesters blocked streets and threw stones at police officers .
video footage showed officers kicking , punching and pushing some demonstrators and a few were dragged across a street .
