WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin on Sunday said President Donald Trump wants to avoid nuclear war with North Korea and will do everything we can to avoid conflict.
I can assure you the president s number one priority is the safety of the American people and our allies, Mnuchin said on ABC News.
The president doesn t want to be in a nuclear war, and we will do everything we can to make sure that doesn t occur.
Trump has dialed up the rhetoric against North Korea over the weekend, warning the country s foreign minister that he and leader Kim Jong Un won t be around much longer, as Pyongyang staged a major anti-U.S. rally.
