What is with the GOP accusing protesters of being paid to protest their events?
Do they think it s impossible that so many people are actually upset?
Maybe they re taking lessons from Donald Trump on that issue.Last week, Jason Chaffetz found himself on the wrong side of people who are angry that he attacked Hillary so aggressively, but won t even raise the question of investigating Trump for much worse transgressions.
He told Salt Lake City-based Deseret News that he knew people were paid to try and bully and intimidate him at his town hall.All that kind of an accusation does is galvanize those who are protesting, and these people found a unique way to respond: They re sending him invoices for their appearances at his town hall.
The invoice is circulating online and charges Chaffetz $100 per hour for paid protest, and two additional $50 charges for being callously dismissed by representative, and being labeled out-of-state radical.

Democrats are in disbelief that they have nothing but flailing and screaming to defend this.
I ll never satisfy their desire to bring down [President] Donald Trump.
Considering how he vowed to continue investigating Hillary Clinton even after she lost the election because of some emails, it s pretty clear that he considers it his job to bring down Democrats, not investigate possible government abuses, security breaches, etc.Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images
