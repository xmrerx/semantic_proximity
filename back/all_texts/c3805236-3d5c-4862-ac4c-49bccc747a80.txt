AROUND 70 per cent of female refugees in northern France have been the victims of rape, domestic violence or sexual abuse, the French charity Gynecology Without Borders (GSF) reports.The horror statistics were revealed yesterday by the group which used to operate at the now-demolished Jungle camp in Calais.It said many women suffered daily attacks.Richard Matis, the charity s vice president, said: Refugee camps worldwide are plagued by violence, that is a fact.
But women are usually found to be more at risk of rape and other forms of sexual assault.
The charity, which now treats female migrants stuck in the sprawling Grande-Synthe tent camp in neighbouring Dunkirk, added the women were raped and beaten on a daily basis, and had become immune to sexual violence and abuse.Mr Matis added: Some women were repeatedly raped during the perilous journey to Europe.
Others are trapped in abusive marriages.
And some women are pimped out by their husbands and forced into so-called survival sex with people smugglers so that their families can continue traveling across Europe.
