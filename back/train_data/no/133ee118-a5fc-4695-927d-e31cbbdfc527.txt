london ( reuters ) - indian businessman vijay mallya , who india wants to extradite from britain on fraud charges , faces further accusations of money-laundering with some funds allegedly going to his force india formula one motor racing team , a london court heard on tuesday .
the flamboyant indian liquor and aviation tycoon , 61 , was first arrested by british police on behalf of the indian authorities in april .
he was rearrested on tuesday after india laid new charges against him .
india is seeking mallya s extradition over loans to him tied to his defunct kingfisher airlines after the businessman , co-owner of the force india team , moved to britain in march last year .
banks want to recover about $ 1.4 billion that the indian authorities say kingfisher owes .
launching new extradition proceedings at london s westminster magistrates court , mark summers , the lawyer representing the indian government , said the original allegations related to fraudulently obtaining and misusing funds .
the new charges concerned the distribution of those funds , summers said .
the government alleges for example some of the funds have ended up with the force india formula one team , he said .
mallya , wearing a blue jacket and open-necked white shirt , denies any wrongdoing and said he did not consent to being extradited .
he was released on police bail and declined to comment after the short hearing .
the next hearing in his case will take place on nov. 20 with a full eight-day extradition hearing due to start on dec. 4 .
the judge will then make a decision based on whether there is a prima facie case against mallya and whether the alleged crimes would be offences in britain as well as india .
that ruling can be challenged in a higher court before being passed to the home secretary ( interior minister ) for approval .
the minister s decision can also be appealed to the courts .
