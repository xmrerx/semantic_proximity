aden ( reuters ) - an air raid by the saudi-led military coalition put yemeni airport in the houthi-controlled capital sanaa out of service on tuesday , jeopardizing relief shipments to a country on the brink of famine , the state news agency saba reported .
the saudi-led coalition fighting yemen s houthi movement said last week it had closed all air , land and seaports in yemen to stem what it said was the flow of arms to the houthis from iran .
air raids destroyed radio navigation station for aircraft , civil aviation authorities told saba , which is controlled by the houthis .
air traffic in sanaa s airport is currently restricted to flights carrying humanitarian aid sent by the united nations and other international organizations .
the houthis control most of the north , including sanaa and its international airport , while the saudi-led coalition dominates the airspace .
any reopening would need an agreement between the two sides , which blame each other for yemen s humanitarian disaster .
the top u.n. aid official in yemen called on the saudi-led coalition on tuesday to open all yemen s sea ports urgently , saying it risked damaging the fight against cholera and hunger , with 7 million already in famine-like conditions .
millions of lives were at risk because of the blockade , u.n. humanitarian coordinator for yemen , jamie mcgoldrick , said to reporters in geneva by telephone from amman .
he said .
the saudi-led coalition was not immediately available for comment .
