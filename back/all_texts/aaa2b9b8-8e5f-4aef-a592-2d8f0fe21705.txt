How sweet is this?
Chris Matthews had to admit that there s no case in the witch hunt on Trump.
Chris Matthews talks about how the theory came apart : The assumption of the critics of the president, of his pursuers, you might say, is that somewhere along the line in the last year is the president had something to do with colluding with the Russians to affect the election in some way.
And yet what came apart this morning was that theory Flynn wasn t central to the Russian investigation, and secondly, that kills the idea that Flynn might have been in a position to testify against Trump.
And if that s not the case, where s the there-there?
How great is today when all of the media big headed pundits have to admit that this entire drama-filled scam is a lie!
