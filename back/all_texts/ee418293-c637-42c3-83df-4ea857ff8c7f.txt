In perhaps the clearest example of the small, but egregious way Donald Trump lies about even the little things, he got caught screwing up less than 2 seconds after announcing that he doesn t make mistakes.
It unfolded like a scene from a comedy, Trump, angry at his plummeting poll numbers and numerous scandals, complained that the press were obsessed with looking for flaws in his White House.
Rather than admit he s only human, Trump doubled down on his absurd contention that he s never wrong.
One mistake and it s no good.
But we just can t make mistakes, right?
So we don t make mistakes.
Ready for the punchline?Trump next passes the conversation over to Ken.
Go ahead, Ken.
That wasn t Ken.
That s Chuck Canterbury, the head of the National Fraternal Order of Police.Oops.While flatly stating that you never make mistakes is a ridiculous thing to lie about, it only serves to highlight the general level of dishonesty that is rampant in Trump s White House.
He s so incapable of admitting he s wrong that Trump goes to great lengths to never apologize for anything he s ever said no matter how false.
Trump never apologized for linking Ted Cruz s dad to the JFK assassination.
His apology for six years of promoting birtherism turned out to be a sorry, not sorry publicity stunt.
He can t even admit his unfounded claim that Obama wiretapped his phones was a complete fabrication.But here s the really scary part.
A lie as obvious as I never make mistakes brings us to an unsettling truism: If a person will lie about the little things, what will he do to cover up the big ones?Featured image via YouTube
