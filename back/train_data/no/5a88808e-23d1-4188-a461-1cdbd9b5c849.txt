over 50 people are dead , and more than 500 are wounded , after a gunman opened fire on a crowd of concertgoers from the 32nd floor of mandalay bay on the south end of the las vegas strip late last night .
and true to form , we re already hearing conservatives use it to push their moar gunz and blue lives matter agendas while crying that anyone begging congress to do something real to save lives is politicizing a tragedy .
but the true political agenda comes from those who won t acknowledge that commonsense gun legislation would save lives and think that protesting racial injustice is the same thing as protesting against police officers themselves , the military , and the country .
the leader of miami s chapter of the fraternal order of police , lt. javier ortiz , tweeted the following : two groups of people , one in seattle , one in vegas , chose to take action last night in their own way .
we support the # police pic.twitter.com/2s8wkpwvxl miami fop 20 ( @ miamifop20 ) october 2 , 2017when the miami new times asked him to clarify , he said : while nfl players express a false perception of police officers by inciting hate and division by disrespecting the u.s. flag , the reality is law enforcement risks their lives every day for america .
we don t know the motive behind stephen paddock s decision to break open the window of a room at mandalay bay and then fire multiple clips of rounds into the crowd attending the route 91 harvest music festival below .
as of now , this doesn t appear to have had anything to do with hatred of police officers and we can t say it did until paddock s motive is discovered.it s true that mass shootings and really , any crime would be worse if it weren t for the law enforcement officers who risk their lives to stop them , but lt. ortiz s remarks are dangerously irresponsible because they could trigger a retaliation from the people who worship the flag and think police brutality against african-americans isn t a thing.and ortiz isn t the only one who s slamming the nfl because of las vegas .
others are doing something similar : las vegas happened cuz of the nfl players .
