A Catholic priest has been caught on camera snorting cocaine on church grounds, in a room covered in Nazi memorabilia.As the BBC reports:Fr Stephen Crossan is reported to have snorted coke through a 10 note during a night of drinking in July 2015 in Banbridge, County Down.He was in a room containing Nazi memorabilia, and seemed to say I shouldn t as he snorted, the Sun on Sunday reported.He has taken leave from the priesthood.A spokesperson for the PSNI said: Police are aware of the article in a Sunday newspaper and are making inquiries.
The Church has confirmed that the footage took place in the Priest s parochial house, on the grounds of St Patrick s Church, Banbridge, in July of last year.This Priest forms part of the same Catholic Church which in Northern Ireland and the U.S., attempts to exert a moral authority over men, women and children.
The same church which is fighting to prevent the equal marriage rights of same-sex couples.
The same church which is fighting the reproductive rights of women and men, through opposition to abortion and contraception.
The same church which is trapping people in loveless or violent marriages, by fighting the right of (predominantly) women to divorce.
The same church which covered up rampant sexual abuse of children by their priests, rather than expose themselves to public accountability.However, this same cocktail of toxic beliefs has infected the Republican Party of the United States through the Christian Conservative movement.
Despite the clear and incontrovertible evidence that religiosity is not the same as morality, this party and it s Quiverfull followers still attempt to assert a moral authority of secular liberals.Unfortunately for the Father Crossan, the Duggars and other Christian Conservative leaders your moral hypocrisy has a way of making itself known to the world.Featured Image via Screengrab
