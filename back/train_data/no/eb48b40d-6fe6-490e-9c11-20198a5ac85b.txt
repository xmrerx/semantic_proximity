cnn went on to trash the amazing james o keefe saying : o keefe , who uses undercover stings to trap his targets , has a reputation for shady tactics ( says the network who was caught red-handed giving donna brazile debate questions to pass along to hillary prior to the cnn hosted debate ) and exaggerated statements.some of his so-called expos s have relied on misleading editing techniques .
( how many times in the past month have we watched cnn cut the mic of a guest whose political views they disagreed with , and then called it a technical issue ? )
and an incident in 2010 landed him in legal trouble.https : //twitter.com/pamela_moore13/status/834548654589542401after he was arrested at senator mary landrieu s office , o keefe pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for entering federal property under false pretenses .
he was sentenced to three years of probation , plus community service and a fine .
wow !
is cnn referring to the guy who single-handedly ( with a little help from his good friend hannah giles , who posed as o keefe s prostitute ) took down acorn , one of the most corrupt leftist organizations in america ?
and the same guy who exposed the truth about how hillary s camp and democrat operatives , who were actually responsible for inciting violence at trump rallies ?
and oh yeah the same guy who got democrat operatives to admit on tape that they ve been committing voter fraud for several years ?
does cnn really believe anyone cares that james o keefe was charged with a misdemeanor ! ?
gasp ! here is cnn trying to get out ahead of what they know is going to be a public relations nightmare with a lame attempt at discrediting james o keefe : https : //twitter.com/pamela_moore13/status/834537309991231488given his track record , many consider o keefe discredited , and not a serious journalist.o keefe s track record is impeccable and the impact his undercover videos have had can not even be measured .
he has gifted americans with his spectacular undercover work for years now , and we hope he continues to expose the left and those associated with the anti-american left for a very long time.armed with donations , ( here s the link to the project veritas donor site , if you re interested in contributing to the good work of an amazing team at project veritas ) hidden cameras and his youtube account , o keefe has repeatedly tried to embarrass big news organizations in the past .
most of his other subjects have been liberal groups .
money cnnhere s a little teaser tweet that james o keefe put out earlier today , putting cnn on notice and letting americans know about his bombshell video tomorrow .
stay tuned we ll be posting the video the moment it s released !

here are some reactions to o keefe s announcement : i can only imagine how many folks at @ cnn are losing sleep tonight !
especially those that got chummy with @ donnabrazile # cnnleaks # maga pic.twitter.com/98ahx78xl1 pinball wizard ( @ comermd ) february 23 , 2017do n't worry @ cnn if you have nothing to hide then 100 's of hours of leaked footage should be a cake walk right # cnnleaks # maga pic.twitter.com/05wasjasmz leah usa made ( @ leahr77 ) february 23 , 2017https : //twitter.com/ten_gop/status/834556596780797952this twitter user has an interesting point .
twitter ceo @ jack tends to either misspell top trending conservative news # hashtags or bury them in trending hashtags .
we ll see what happens after the release of the video : something tells me twitter will not allow # cnnleaks to trend tomorrow when the big @ jamesokeefeiii drop happens .
just a wild guess .
