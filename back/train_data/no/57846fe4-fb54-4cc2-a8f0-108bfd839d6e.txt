beirut ( reuters ) - saudi arabia said on friday a saudi citizen had been kidnapped in lebanon , a country with which it is in a diplomatic crisis .
saudi arabia , kuwait , the united arab emirates and bahrain have advised their citizens against traveling to lebanon and urged those already there to leave , as tensions rise in what is seen as a new front line in the regional rivalry between saudi arabia and iran .
top lebanese government officials have said they believe saudi arabia is holding saad al-hariri who resigned as lebanese prime minister from there last weekend .
riyadh says hariri is a free man and he decided to resign because iran-allied hezbollah was calling the shots in his government .
the saudi embassy in beirut announced the kidnap of one of its citizens , but gave no details of the person s identity of the circumstances of the abduction .
the embassy is in contact with the highest ranking lebanese security authorities about securing the unconditional release of a kidnapped saudi citizen as soon as possible , it said in a statement quoted by the saudi state news agency spa .
lebanese interior minister nohad machnouk said on the lebanese state news agency the safety of saudi residents and visitors was a priority for the lebanese authorities .
he added that security services are on high alert to prevent any attempt of exploiting the current political situation from anyone and for whatever reason .
tampering with the security and stability of lebanon is a red line .
