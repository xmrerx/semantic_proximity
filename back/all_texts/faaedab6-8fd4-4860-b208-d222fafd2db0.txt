WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday urged a quick return to civilian rule in Zimbabwe after its army took charge earlier this week, and called events there a concern.
Zimbabwe has an opportunity to set itself on a new path, one that must include democratic elections and respect for human rights, Tillerson told the foreign ministers from the African continent ahead of a meeting in Washington.
