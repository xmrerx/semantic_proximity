john kerry decided to reveal how he truly feels about the danger of terrorism in other words , he feels there is no danger .
in bangladesh on monday , secretary of state john kerry discussed the threat of terrorism at home and abroad but ended up blaming the press for covering terrorism .
if the press just didn t report on terrorism then maybe it would go away ?
yes , this guy is officially off his rocker ! part of his proposal to fight this threat had to do with the media and how it covers terrorism .
according to fox news and a transcript of the press conference provided by the state department , kerry said the media could do us a service by not covering terrorism quite as much .
remember this : no country is immune from terrorism , he said .
it s easy to terrorize .
government and law enforcement have to be correct 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , 365 days a year .
but if you decide one day you re going to be a terrorist and you re willing to kill yourself , you can go out and kill some people .
you can make some noise.perhaps the media would do us all a service if they didn t cover it quite as much .
people wouldn t know what s going on .
the fact is we have to stand together , and the united states is standing with bangladesh in this fight .
