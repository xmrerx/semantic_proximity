here s just one video from last night that will tell you all you need to know : we have seen demonstrations and i think you already talked about that around the country .
young people at berkeley protesting against this unconstitutional order .
and i heard it say earlier that we need to get involved on the local and state level .
but what concerns me is that the strain that has been placed on local government , particularly local law enforcement dealing with an order that is unjust and proper .
and so as we encourage our young people to get involved i thought it was a beautiful site as we encourage people to get involved , what direction and instructions and how can we have a more organized effort so that they can be a major tool in moving our agenda forward ?
anyone who feels that they can answer this question ?
thank you .
