well , as a catholic the act of the pope of my church accepting a gruesome hammer and sickle with christ affixed to the front was wholly offensive pope francis has said he wasn t offended by the communist crucifix given to him by bolivian president evo morales during his south american pilgrimage.morales surprised the pontiff with the unusual gift , a crucifix attached to a hammer and sickle , when francis arrived in la paz on wednesday.the crucifix was a replica of one designed by a jesuit priest , the reverend lu s espinal , who was tortured and killed by bolivian paramilitary squads in 1980 .
francis prayed at the site of espinal s assassination upon his arrival in bolivia.the modified crucifix immediately raised eyebrows , with some questioning whether morales , whose socialist and anti-church rhetoric is well-known , was trying to score a political point with a questionable , and possibly sacrilegious , melding of faith and ideology.francis , an argentine jesuit , said espinal was well-known among his fellow jesuits as a proponent of the marxist strain of liberation theology .
the vatican opposed it , fearing that marxists were using liberation theology s preferential option for the poor as a call for armed revolution against oppressive rightwing regimes that were in power in much of latin america in the 1970s and 1980s.during a news conference en route home to rome on sunday , francis said he interpreted morales gift through the prism of espinal s marxist bent and viewed it as protest art.after taking into consideration the time in which he lived , francis said : i understand this work .
for me it wasn t an offense .
francis added that he brought the crucifix home with him.via : the guardian
