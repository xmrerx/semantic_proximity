quetta , pakistan ( reuters ) - pakistani police on wednesday found 15 bullet-ridden bodies of kidnap victims near the border with iran , a favored route for human traffickers taking workers illegally to europe .
the bodies were found abandoned in a mountainous region of buleda , in baluchistan province , 600 km ( 370 miles ) south of the provincial capital of quetta , district commissioner bashir ahmad bangalzai told reuters .
he said documents and other belongings found on the bodies suggested that they were en route to iran illegally .
human smuggling is big business in pakistan and other poor south asian countries .
there have been instances of workers being killed in border areas , or sometimes dying during road or sea travel .
it was not clear what prompted the killings , said bangalzai .
he said all 15 came from pakistan s eastern province of punjab .
we re getting in contact with their families , he said .
a police official said all 15 were reported to have been kidnapped on tuesday .
no one has claimed responsibility .
violence-plagued baluchistan , which also borders afghanistan , has long been home to separatist groups seeking a greater share of regional resources and islamist militants linked to al qaeda , the taliban and islamic state .
the violence has raised concerns about security for projects in the $ 57 billion china pakistan economic corridor , a planned transport and energy link from western china to pakistan s southern deep-water port of gwadar .
