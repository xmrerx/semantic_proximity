A mother is outraged after her autistic daughter came home in tears because another parent told her that her mom doesn t want to cure her autism.If you are a parent with a heart and a brain, you re going to be just as pissed off as this little girl s mom.According to a Facebook post provided by A Science Enthusiast, a parent actually had the audacity to tell a little girl that her mother doesn t want to cure her of her autism, and then gave the child a brochure advertising a natural cure company.So, the little girl s mom took to Facebook to give the anonymous parent a deserved severe tongue-lashing.
To the PARENT who today told my daughter with autism that is can be CURED- through specific diet, avoiding chemicals (IDIOT) and essential oils.
FUCK YOU.
My brilliant science minded, but incredibly naive child who embraces her individuality, came home extremely upset and confused as to why I m not trying to cure her.
THIS BITCH gave my kid a brochure for a direct sales company that sells natural and organic foods and spices and told her give it to your mom if she s interested in learning more about a cure.
The mother destroyed the brochure, but The Science Enthusiast did provide an image from the company website.After reading about Wildtree, it s clear that they do not claim to be able to cure autism or any other disorders.
Wildtree is simply a company that offers organic meals to people who have dietary restrictions due to medical conditions or to those who just want to eat more healthy.
So it appears the parent who spouted this nonsense about a cure for autism either misread what the company is about or is truly just an idiot.But that doesn t make this mom any less angry about what this other parent did.
My kid now wonders if I m PURPOSELY keeping her sick.
I want to beat the shit out of this psycho.
My arthritis be damned.

But there are treatments available such as therapies and behavioral interventions that have proven to be a great help to autistic adults and children.Featured image via Pinterest
