what moratorium ?
these guys in congress are getting around the moratorium and spending like drunken sailors er pigs stop the madness ! congress has appropriated over $ 4 billion earmarks this year despite a ban on pork barrel spending , citizens against government waste ( cagw ) announced on wednesday.the group unveiled the 23rd edition of its pig book at the phoenix park hotel near capitol hill , revealing millions in earmarks for fish passage , embryo adoption awareness , and abstinence education .
the 2015 pig book continues to prove that any earmark is a bad earmark , cagw president tom schatz said .
at a time when members of congress from both sides of the aisle and both sides of the capitol continue to call for a restoration of earmarks , taxpayers should deliver a loud and clear message that it is time for earmarks to be permanently banned .
