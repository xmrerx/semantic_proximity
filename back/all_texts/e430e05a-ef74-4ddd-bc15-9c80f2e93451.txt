Christian parents who homeschool their children have the right to keep them stupid and ignorant according to a new ruling by Texas conservative-dominated Supreme Court.Laura and Michael McIntyre have been refusing to educate their kids because they believe they ll be raptured soon and literally argued that they have the right to do so under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution.Just think about that for a minute.
A Christian couple is arguing that they should be allowed to not educate their kids because they think Jesus is coming back any day now to take them all to heaven.And the Texas Supreme Court actually agreed with them.According to the Associated Press;Friday s 6-3 decision on technical grounds was a win for Laura and Michael McIntyre, who once educated their nine children in the family s El Paso motorcycle dealership.The couple argued that school district officials violated their 14th Amendment rights by attempting to verify that its children were learning.The district was investigating relatives complaints the McIntyre children weren t being educated because they were waiting for Jesus Christ s second coming.It all started in 2004 when the religion-obsessed parents took their kids out of their private school to educate them at home.
But instead of learning math, history, and science the kids were learning all about Jesus and how they ll be raptured.Michael s brother testified that the nine children were never being taught anything that had to do with the school curriculum and that he overheard one of the children informing a cousin that they don t have to learn because the End Times are allegedly near.In their first court appearance, the judge basically laughed at the McIntyres defense and ruled in 2014 that: No parents have ever prevailed in any reported case on a theory that they have an absolute constitutional right to educate their children in the home, completely free of any state supervision, regulation, or requirements.
They do not have an absolute constitutional right to home school.
But six dimwits on the Texas Supreme Court allowed the McIntyres to be the first parents to prevail on such a theory, thus giving conservative Christian parents across the state the ability to indoctrinate their kids with religion as their daily education instead of learning the subjects necessary for them to have a future and a brain that knows how to think critically.
All they have to do now is yank their own kids out of school and claim they have a constitutional right to keep their kids stupid.The Texas Supreme Court basically just ruled in favor of what amounts to child abuse and neglect and the people of Texas should be embarrassed.Featured Image: Wikimedia
