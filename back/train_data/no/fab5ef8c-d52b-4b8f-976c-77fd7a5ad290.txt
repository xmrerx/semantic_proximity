the report exposed in an email shared by wikileaks shows the results of a review that was completed in 2011 , by jennifer reynoso , a new york lawyer .
the report states that the clinton foundation is missing several policies/procedures that are required by law ( e.g. , record retention policy ) .
the report goes on to give the following recommendation : in addition to pointing out that employees of the clinton foundation are underpaid as compared to comparable positions in other companies , the email also states that the overall morale of the company is low and the staff would like to see more structure .
staff morale is low and staff is hungry for more structureironically , the staff complained about a policy not being made available for an employee to blow the whistle on potential wrongdoings within the non-profit .
given bill clinton s history as a sexual predator and his role in the clinton foundation , it shouldn t come as a surprise that there isn t a strong sexual harassment policy in place .
