Real Americans aren t buying this bs line from the media because we all watched the First Couple in action.
They care and we know it that s all that matters!Fox News reported:The White House announced Thursday that President Donald Trump pledged to donate $1 million in personal funds to Harvey relief efforts.Trump visited Corpus Christi, Texas, and Austin on Tuesday for briefings on Harvey s devastation.
He praised first responders, telling everyone who has been affected by the storm that we are here with you today, we are with you tomorrow and we will be with you every single day after to restore, recover and rebuild.
