moscow ( reuters ) - russian president vladimir putin and his u.s. counterpart donald trump may discuss a syria settlement at an asian economic summit in vietnam next week , the ria news agency reported on saturday .
relations between moscow and washington have soured further since putin and trump first met at a g20 summit in hamburg in july when they discussed allegations of russian meddling in the u.s. election , but agreed to focus on better ties ..
tensions have risen over the conflict in syria , after russia vetoed a united nations plan to continue an ongoing investigation into chemical weapons .. a syria settlement is being discussed for the agenda of a possible meeting between the two presidents , kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov was quoted as saying by ria , adding it was in their common interest to have enough time to discuss the issue .
somehow or another it requires cooperation , peskov said .
trump told fox news this week that it was possible he would meet putin during his asia trip .
