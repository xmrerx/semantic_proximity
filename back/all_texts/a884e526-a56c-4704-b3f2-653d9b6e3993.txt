PARIS (Reuters) - The independence speech made by Catalonia s leader was a trick , Spanish Foreign Minister Alfonso Dastis said on Wednesday, although he said there was room for negotiations within the frame of Spain s constitution.
Carles Puigdemont s speech to the Catalan parliament on Tuesday was a trick to say one thing and do the opposite, Dastis told French radio station Europe 1.
Puigdemont leader balked at making a formal declaration of independence from Spain on Tuesday, calling for talks with Madrid over the region s future in a gesture that eased fears of immediate unrest in the heart of the euro zone.
Asked about the possibility of organize another referendum in Catalonia, Dastis said that Spain s constitution does not allow it.
We cannot accept that a portion of the Catalans decide for the whole of Spain, he said.
