chick-fil-a is in the news again and it s more of the same push for political correctness and the rights of the left to not be offended by just about everything .
the lgbt crowd seems to be offended by everything under the sun and chick-fil-a s views against gay marriage are especially upsetting to this special group.the fast food chain s reputation as a supporter of traditional marriage has drawn another series of boycott threats , this time from the denver city council .
the council is currently debating whether or not to sign a contract with the restaurant for a spot at denver international airport.from the denver post : councilman paul lopez called opposition to the chain at dia really , truly a moral issue on the city .
his position comes despite ardent assurances from the concessionaires who have operated other dia restaurants that strict nondiscrimination policies will include protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity.robin kniech , the council s first openly gay member , said she was most worried about a local franchise generating corporate profits used to fund and fuel discrimination .
she was first to raise chick-fil-a leaders politics during a tuesday committee hearing.the normally routine process of approving an airport concession deal has taken a rare political turn .
the business development committee on tuesday stalled the seven-year deal with a new franchisee of the popular chain for two weeks.should the committee reject the lease , an individual member if one is willing could introduce the concession deal in the full council .
ten of the 13 members attended tuesday s meeting , and none rose to defend chick-fil-a , although some didn t weigh in .
we can do better than this brand in denver at our airport , in my estimation , new member jolon clark said .
