vice president joe biden s hotel tab for his recent one-night stay in mexico city cost taxpayers more than $ 500,000.biden , who attended an annual economic summit with mexican leaders , stayed at the luxury intercontinental presidente hotel .
biden led a delegation attending the summit that included commerce secretary penny pritzker , energy secretary ernest moniz , and interior secretary sally jewell.the trip called for 260 hotel rooms and meeting spaces , according to a state department contract .
the total hotel tab was $ 538,528.65.the government said the trip costs were justified due to security concerns and last-minute planning .
in addition to supporting a large delegation within a short time frame , last minute and frequent changes of itineraries for supporting personnel often result in significant changes in how posts work with the vendors , the state department said .
with the exception of a few trips , contracts are not permitted to be signed until the department of state ( post ) has written confirmation from all supporting agencies , which enables collection of funds from said agencies in the event of cancellation .
these unique senior high-level usg [ u.s. government ] vip travel requirements result in only a single or a very limited number of responsible sources with no other supplies or services capable of satisfying agency requirement , they added.biden spent only one night in mexico city , according to the white house schedule .
he departed washington on wednesday , feb. 24 , and was in mexico on thursday to attend meetings for the summit .
