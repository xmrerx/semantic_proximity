Donald Trump has called himself a patriot many times, yet according to recent investigations he didn t donate a penny to 9/11 charities, despite claiming otherwise.
That definitely doesn t seem very patriotic.Mr.
Billionaire Trump promised to donate $10,000 to a major 9/11 charity, yet the money was never received.
To a billionaire, $10,000 is pocket change, so why didn t he actually give it to the charities?
Is he really that greedy?
Leave it to Trump to make a scene, order more fame and attention, only to have made the whole thing up.NY Daily News says:City Controller Scott Stringer conducted a review of hundreds of pages of previously sealed records of the two main 9/11 charities at the request of the Daily News, and found that Trump and his charity hadn t donated a dime in the months after 9/11.It s not unlike Trump to want more public attention and create whatever lie necessary for that attention; however, even for a pig like him, this is a bit too far.Not until April of 2016 while running for president did Donald Trump actually donate money to a 9/11 related cause.
During his first visit to the September 11th Museum Memorial he made another grand scene while donating $100,000 dollars to the museum.
This time the money was actually received, but we can safely bet it s only because of how much attention is on him.This goes to show Donald Trump is only charitable when it suits him.
And it s not even really charity he s buying publicity, not donating money, in his view.
He s always been a lying, scandalous pig, yet now could quite possibly the next president of our country.
Let s make sure that doesn t happen come November.Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images
