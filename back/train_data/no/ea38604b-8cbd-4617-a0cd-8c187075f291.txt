london ( reuters ) - britain s ambassador to myanmar was forced to interrupt foreign secretary boris johnson earlier this year as he tried to recite a nostalgic colonial poem by rudyard kipling in public during a visit to the country s most famous buddhist site .
johnson , who helped lead the leave campaign in the 2016 brexit referendum , is caught on camera starting to recite kipling s poem , mandalay , after striking a bell at the shwedagon pagoda in yangon .
the temple bells they say , johnson says in television footage by channel 4 .
come you back , you british soldier .
as johnson continues with his recitation of the poem which celebrates a soldier s love affair with a local woman during britain s colonial rule of what was then known as burma , the ambassador tenses .
you re on mic .
probably not a good idea , british ambassador andrew patrick said .
what , the road to mandalay ?
johnson asked .
no .
not appropriate , the ambassador said .
johnson replied good stuff and then started to take photographs of the scene with his telephone camera .
a spokeswoman for the foreign office declined to comment .
prime minister theresa may s appointment of johnson , who in the run-up to britain s referendum on eu membership compared the goals of the european union to those of adolf hitler and napoleon , caused consternation in european capitals .
in recent weeks , johnson has attempted to set out his vision of britain outside the european union .
