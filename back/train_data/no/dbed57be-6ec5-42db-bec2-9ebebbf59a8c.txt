islamabad ( reuters ) - pakistan s former prime minister nawaz sharif attended an anti-corruption trial on friday ordered by the country s supreme court when it removed him from office earlier this year .
sharif , 67 , arrived at the court with his daughter , maryam , who is also on trial over the family s wealth and financial dealings .
the family has called the case a political conspiracy but opposition leaders who pushed it before the courts have hailed it as accountability for the rich and powerful .
the charges in the national accountability bureau ( nab ) court are linked to london properties the family owns that were revealed in the 2016 panama papers leaks involving offshore companies owned by prominent international figures .
allies of sharif , who has served as prime minister twice and was toppled in a military coup in 1999 , have called the proceedings a political vendetta and hinted at intervention by elements of the powerful army .
the supreme court disqualified sharif from office in july over unreported sources of annual income of about $ 10,000 , a salary the former premier denies ever receiving .
the high court also ordered the nab to investigate and conduct a trial into the sharif family s wider finances , including the london properties .
sharif maintains control of the ruling pakistan muslim league-nawaz party , which elected close ally shahid khaqi abbasi as prime minister after sharif was disqualified .
