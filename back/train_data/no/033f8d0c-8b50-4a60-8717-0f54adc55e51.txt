no word yet on when every female london resident will be asked to wear a hijab in public , so as not to offend the exploding muslim population sadiq khan , london s first muslim mayor , announced monday that body shaming advertisements will no longer be allowed in london s public transport .
as the father of two teenage girls , i am extremely concerned about this kind of advertising which can demean people , particularly women , and make them ashamed of their bodies .
it is high time it came to an end , khan said.no one 's confidence or body image should be undermined by ads on our transport system .
i 've strengthened @ tfl policy https : //t.co/aj7qydqw0t mayor of london ( @ mayoroflondon ) june 13 , 2016here are just a few twitter ( not g-rated ) responses that the mayor got to his tweet above : the mayor added , nobody should feel pressurised , while they travel on the tube or bus , into unrealistic expectations surrounding their bodies and i want to send a clear message to the advertising industry about this .
khan was not clear in what would determine which ads would be banned , as it doesn t include all images of people in underwear or swimming clothes .
most underwear and bikini models though can be assumed to have non-average bodies .
