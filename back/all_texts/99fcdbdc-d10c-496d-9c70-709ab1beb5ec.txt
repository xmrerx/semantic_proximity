FEMALE MUSLIM PROFESSOR SAYS RAPE IS AN ACCEPTABLE FORM OF HUMILIATION: The female prisoners of wars are those whom you own.
In order to humiliate them, they become the property of the army commander, or of a Muslim, and he can have sex with them just like he has sex with his wives.
MUSLIM IMAM BLAMES THE VICTIM: Warning women against adding fuel to the fire , the Imam of a Salafist Cologne mosque has said the victims of the New Year s Eve attacks in that city were themselves responsible for their sex assault, by dressing inappropriately and wearing perfume.Speaking to major Russian channel REN TV, Imam Sami Abu-Yusuf s remarks came during a 12 minute segment bringing Russians up to date with the latest developments in the migrant invasion of Europe.
Sandwiched between eyewitness-footage of migrant rampages in Cologne, women being sexually assaulted by apparently Arab gangs, and a segment on a surge of interest in self defence courses in Germany the Imam told the interviewer: we need to react properly, and not to add fuel to the fire .Explaining in the view of Salafist Islam why hundreds of women found themselves groped, sexually assaulted and in some cases raped by gangs of migrant men in cities across Germany the Imam said: the events of New Year s Eve were the girls own fault, because they were half naked and wearing perfume.
It is not surprising the men wanted to attack them.
[Dressing like that] is like adding fuel to the fire .The tone of the report was telling, expressing no surprise that Muslim mass migration would result in violence and gang-rape.
The narrator of the report told viewers that after the events of New Year s Eve it was becoming difficult to tell who s country Germany was, one belonging to Muslims or to Germans.
Also expressed was the opinion that the sex attacks were no more than a dress rehearsal for something much bigger to come.
