it s over for hillary it s officially over for the democrat party obama built this ! the nomination was barely sealed up at the democratic national convention before bernie sanders , who had campaigned against hillary clinton for the party s nod , went back to being an independent.sanders , who considers himself , officially , an independent in congress because his views lean further left than the democratic party s platform , caucuses with democrats .
but until declaring an intention to run for the presidency in 2015 , he had rarely , if ever , identified as a member of the democratic party ( he s been in politics since 1979 ) .and now , despite pleading with his base to support hillary , even though they re concerned that she s too moderate , sanders will return to vermont and to his seat in the senate , and he ll do it with no official party affiliation.bernie sanders tells @ bpolitics breakfast w/reporters he 'll return to the senate as an independent , not a dem : ' i was elected as an ind . '
susan page ( @ susanpage ) july 26 , 2016debbie wasserman schultz , who was forced to resign as chairwoman of the dnc after leaked emails revealed she d tried to keep sanders from challenging clinton for the party s nomination , might even be vindicated sort of.sanders has struggled all along with whether to call himself a democrat , even ducking the question of his party affiliation , raised by local vermont media , just days after he declared .
he later tried to reinforce that he was , indeed , a democrat .
but sanders certainly wasn t a party player and that s exactly the concern wasserman schultz voiced in the wikileaks document dump.via : heatstreet
