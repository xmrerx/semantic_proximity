Like Megyn Kelly, who lost her supporters when she became obsessed with destroying Donald Trump, it s time for Shepard Smith to go.
Let s face it, he would be much better suited for the small audiences of liberal viewers on CNN or MNSBC.It s time to go Shep and today s rant is a perfect example of why:Clip: @ShepNewsTeam sticks up for CNN's Jim @Acosta & went further pic.twitter.com/iITXqAzXXF johnny dollar (@johnnydollar01) February 16, 2017Remember the time Shepard Smith cut off his guest s mic when they attempted to tie Black Lives Matter to the kidnapping and torture of the young special needs white man by 4 young black thugs?It s not the first time Hillary supporter Shepard Smith went off on an anti-Trump tangent.
Watch him go off on Trump here and tell him what he needs to do to win the election.
Great advice Shep.
I guess it s pretty clear Trump didn t need your advice.
