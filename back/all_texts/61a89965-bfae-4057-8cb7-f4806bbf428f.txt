Sen. John McCain is weighing in on Russia s meddling in the U.S. election, and he has made his stance abundantly clear.
In an interview with New York Magazine that was published online this Saturday, McCain said that Russian interference in our presidential election is even worse than a physical attack and risks undermining the foundation of democracy.
The severity of this issue, the gravity of it, is so consequential because if you succeed in corrupting an election, then you ve destroyed the foundation of democracy, McCain said.
So I view it with the utmost seriousness.
I view it more seriously than a physical attack.
I view it more seriously than Orlando, or San Bernardino.
As tragic as that was, the far-reaching consequences of an election hack are certainly far in excess of a single terrorist attack.
The senator also has some serious questions about Trump s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, who has now resigned as a result of his compromising conversations with Russia.
The Flynn fiasco, he said, is just another sign of dysfunction within Trump s administration.
When did Flynn know about anything to do with Russian interference?
he asked.
Why was there a gap of X number of days between the president being told and no action taken?
What is the extent of the relationship between Flynn and the Russians?
McCain also addressed the Russian dossier, which revealed Trump s shady ties to Russia along with insight into his personal perversions.
According to the document, Russia is using Trump s sexual indiscretions to blackmail him.
The Arizona senator said that this would not be out of character for Russia because it s what they do.
I didn t know what to make of it, but everyone knows the Russians do use women and sex when people go to Russia, he said.
It s an old KGB honeypot.
