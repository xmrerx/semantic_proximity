House Democrats did something extraordinary today: they broke parliamentary procedure on the House floor and literally shamed Republicans after they blocked an important LGBT amendment from passing.Now this should come as no surprise.
Republicans have always been hostile towards LGBT rights, and Democrats have been fighting them on the issue for decades.
So what changed this time?Well, for starters, the amendment originally was slated to pass, with 218 members voting YEA, with more than 30 Republicans crossing the aisle to join every Democrat.
The bill would have barred federal contractors from obtaining government work if they were found to discriminate against anyone in the LGBT community.
This is something that has enjoyed broad bipartisan support for years.And it looked as though it was going to pass, and the issue could be a thing of the past.But then the TV voting monitor posted on C-SPAN showed that some of the votes from the Republicans were rescinded.
The amendment narrowly failed 212-213.
Republicans successfully convinced some of their colleagues to take the pandering cowards way out and turn their backs on those in the LGBT community, thus giving the green light for federal discrimination.Democrats, rightfully so, didn t like that.
After thunderous boos from every Democratic member, they decided to publicly shame the Republican cowards by literally chanting shame while pointing their fingers at them from across the aisle.When the chair said There will be order, Democratic Rep. Gwen Moore shouted back, No there will not be.
Democrats then set out a witch hunt to figure out who changed their votes.
They were:Their offices haven t commented, so there is no telling as to why they changed their vote, who convinced them, and their reasoning for doing so.
But if keeping to their history of being bigots, that s all the reason they need to be bigots.Watch House Democrats put Republicans in their place: Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
