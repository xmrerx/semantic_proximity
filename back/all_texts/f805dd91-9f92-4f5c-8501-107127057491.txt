Amateur president Donald Trump isn t concerned in the least about the rising costs associated with his regular trips to his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida, White House press secretary Sean Spicer said during a press briefing on Wednesday.A reporter asked if Trump has any concerns about the pushback from Florida residents and taxpayers about the costs of his trips there.
No, he feels great, Spicer replied.Spicer tried to defend Trump by saying that his boss stayed in Washington, D.C., last weekend and said that the alleged president plans to remain in town this weekend as well, according to MSN.Trump has spent at least five weekends at Mar-a-Lago since his inauguration only nine weeks ago.
The former reality show star repeatedly criticized former President Barack Obama for going on golf outings and/or taking vacations.
However, if Trump continues taking weekend vacations at his current pace, he is set to outspend President Obama s entire eight years of vacation costs in just under one year.
Spicer, however, explained recently that it s alright for Trump to go on golf trips but not Obama because the current occupant of the White House conducts meetings while he s golfing.Business owners near Mar-a-Lago are going broke because of Trump s frequent visits.
The cost of Trump s visits to the area is costing the state a ton of money.
That means, like the wall, the taxpayers are footing the bill.Travel and security costs associated with the trips to his resort is through the roof.
On top of that, this is a burden for the Secret Service.In 2015, Trump said that if elected, he would, rarely leave the White House because there s so much work to be done.
I would not be a president who took vacations.
I would not be a president that takes time off.
Yeah, we re going to go with he was lying Photo by Mario Tama/Getty Images.
