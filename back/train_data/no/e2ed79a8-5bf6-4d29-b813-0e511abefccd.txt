it was all an accident .
it s good to king the obama administration continues to ignore the law and do pretty much whatever the hell it wants.from the hill : the government erroneously doled out about 2,000 expanded immigrant work permit authorizations under president obama s controversial executive actions , even after a federal judge blocked the move , the justice department says .
the government sincerely regrets these circumstances and is taking immediate steps to remedy these erroneous three-year terms , the department of justice wrote in a court advisory filed late thursday in the southern district of texas.the advisory comes after district court judge andrew hanen halted the implementation of the executive actions , which defer deportations for immigrants living in the u.s. illegally and provide them with expanded access to work permits , until the courts could decide whether the policies are constitutional.while the old policies authorize a two-year renewal of work permits under the deferred action for childhood arrivals program , the new program would allow for a three-year renewal.the doj added in the advisory that the department of homeland security is converting the three-year renewals into two-year terms and that dhs secretary jeh johnson has asked the agency s inspector general to investigate.oh good they re investigating , i m sure they ll be fair and honest , right ?
if we can t trust them to follow a judge s ruling then why should we trust them about any immigration policy they might seek in the future ?
this is just pathetic .
and of course it s released on friday afternoon , knowing that the complicit moron media will barely report it.via : the right scoop
