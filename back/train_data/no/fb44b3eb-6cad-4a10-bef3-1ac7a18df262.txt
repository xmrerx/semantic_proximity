( reuters ) - peruvian villagers suing miner glencore will argue in london s high court next week that the company should be held liable over their allegations they were abused by peruvian police , the law firm representing them said on tuesday .
the allegations , to be presented in a 10-day hearing that starts on monday , illustrates potential legal risks for mining companies that sign pacts with peruvian police for the provision of security services at their operations .
the lawsuit by 22 peruvians said that xstrata , acquired by glencore in 2013 , failed to take reasonable steps to prevent abuses by police in deadly protests at the tintaya copper mine in 2012 , said london law firm leigh day .
xstrata paid , fed and provided lodging for police and knew or should have known that peru s police tend to use excessive force , leigh day said .
glencore said xstrata was not responsible for actions taken by the peruvian national police ( pnp ) in policing the protests and noted that the lawsuit does not allege that xstrata or the mine s private security force harmed anyone .
xstrata appealed to the pnp to respect the human rights of protesters before and during the protest , glencore said in a statement .
like many mining companies in peru , xstrata had signed an agreement with peru s national police for the provision of security services at tintaya , which stopped operating in 2013 .
the agreements , which usually include payment for police , have long been criticized by activists who say it creates a police force loyal to companies instead of the broader public .
defenders of the agreements say that they allow companies to pay for their policing needs in poor , remote regions where they tend to operate alongside villages that lack basic services .
leigh day law firm said that a peruvian villager believed to have been shot by police in the 2012 unrest will attend the hearing .
the case will be determined under peruvian law , the firm said .
