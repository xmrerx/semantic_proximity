the guy has an incredible resume on wiki : michael s. rogers ( born october 31 , 1959 ) is a united states navy admiral who serves as director of the national security agency ( nsa ) , commander of the u.s. cyber command ( uscybercom ) and chief of the central security service ( css ) since april 3 , 2014 .
prior to that , rogers served as the commander of the tenth fleet and commander of the u.s. fleet cyber command.rogers is a native of chicago , illinois .
he graduated from new trier high school in 1977 .
he is a graduate of auburn university ( 1981 ) and the naval war college.rogers received his commission through the naval reserve officers training corps ( nrotc ) program and has served in the united states navy since graduating from auburn university in 1981 .
he started his career as a surface warfare officer working in naval gunfire support operations off grenada , beirut , and maritime surveillance operations off el salvador .
in 1986 , he was selected for transfer from unrestricted line officer to restricted line officer and re-designation as a cryptology officer.during the 2003 u.s. invasion of iraq , rogers joined the military s joint staff , which works for the joint chiefs of staff , where he specialized in computer network attacks .
from 2007 onward he served as director of intelligence for the military s pacific command .
in 2009 , he became director of intelligence for the joint chiefs of staff , and was subsequently named commander of u.s. fleet cyber command and commander of the u.s. 10th fleet , with responsibility for all of the navy s cyberwarfare efforts .
as such , rogers was the first restricted line officer to serve as a numbered fleet commander and the first information warfare community ( iwc ) officer to achieve the rank of vice admiral.in january 2014 , the obama administration announced rogers nomination as director of the national security agency and the commander of the us offensive cyberoperations unit in the department of defense .
rogers succeeded general keith b. alexander , who served as the nsa director for nine years , and became the first iwc officer to achieve the rank of admiral .
although the nsa directorship does not require senate approval , rogers had to be confirmed by the senate to head united states cyber command , [ 11 ] for which the senate unanimously confirmed him.in his first public remarks as nsa director , rogers stated that he believed that nsa whistleblower edward snowden was probably not working for a foreign intelligence agency , despite frequent speculation and assertion by the nsa s allies to the contrary .
rogers added : he clearly believes in what he s doing .
i question that ; i don t agree with it .
i fundamentally disagree with what he did .
i believe it was wrong ; i believe it was illegal .
the washington post reported on 19 november 2016 that defense secretary ashton b. carter and director of national intelligence ( dni ) james r. clapper jr. had recommended to president obama that rogers be terminated as director of the national security agency .
carter reportedly recommended he be terminated due to poor performance , whereas clapper considered it wise that the position be held by a civilian .
both clapper and carter had put rogers on notice for poor performance in internal security and for a poor leadership style .
his termination was reportedly delayed due to stalled changes to the bureaucratic structure of the intelligence community .
later , rogers reportedly met with then president-elect donald trump without notifying his supervisors in what is an unprecedented action for a military officer .
trump was reportedly considering replacing clapper with rogers as dni , however that position went to former senator dan coats , with rogers remaining nsa director .
