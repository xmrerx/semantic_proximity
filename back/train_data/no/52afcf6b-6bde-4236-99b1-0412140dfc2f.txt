cairo ( reuters ) - five militants and two soldiers were killed on wednesday in clashes that followed a failed attack on a security checkpoint in egypt s strife-torn north sinai province , a military spokesman said .
troops were seeking some of the militants who fled the scene during the clashes , the spokesman said in a statement .
one of the militants , wearing an explosive vest , attempted to raid one of the security checkpoints and due to the vigilance of the security forces the terrorist was killed while the rest of the militants were dealt with , he said .
islamic state claimed responsibility for the attack , with its news agency amaq saying one of its militants had set off a suicide vest at a security checkpoint .
an islamist insurgency in north sinai has gathered pace since mid-2013 when the military ousted islamist president mohamed mursi after mass protests against his rule and the group leading it pledged allegiance to islamic state a year later .
hundreds of soldiers and police have been killed since and in recent months the attacks extended to coptic christians , who make up 10 percent of egypt s 90 million population .
