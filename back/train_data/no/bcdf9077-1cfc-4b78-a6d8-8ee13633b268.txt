vladivostok , russia ( reuters ) - north korea on thursday pledged to take powerful counter measures to respond to u.s. pressure or any new sanctions against it over its missile program , accusing washington of wanting war .
pyongyang s pledge , made in a statement by its delegation to an economic forum in russia s far east , came after the united states said it wanted the u.n. security council to impose an oil embargo on north korea , ban the country s exports of textiles and the hiring of north korean laborers abroad , and subject leader kim jong un to an asset freeze and travel ban , according to a draft resolution seen by reuters on wednesday .
we will respond to the barbaric plotting around sanctions and pressure by the united states with powerful counter measures of our own , the statement read .
the same statement also accused south korea and japan of using the russian forum to play dirty politics , saying the event was meant to be about discussing economic cooperation in the region and not about criticizing its missile program .
russian president vladimir putin told the same forum on thursday he thought the north korea crisis would not escalate into a large-scale conflict involving nuclear weapons , predicting that common sense would prevail .
