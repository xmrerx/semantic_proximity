Conservative talk show host Mark Levin shredded Joe Scarborough and the media in defense of President Trump as he pointed out that respect is a two-way street.Levin, author of the book Rediscovering Americanism: And the Tyranny of Progressivism, said a man s man like Trump can only take so much before he s gonna stand up, as he spoke with Fox News Sean Hannity on the controversy over the president s tweets about MSNBC s Morning Joe and its co-host Mika Brzezinski You attack a man repeatedly who s a proud man, who s an accomplished man, who is a man s man.
You attack him personally.
You attack him for his looks.
You attack him for his genitalia.
And at some point, a man s gonna stand up, Levin said on Hannity Thursday.
You want him to act presidential?
Then you have respect for the office of the president, he added.While Levin understood the outrage, he admitted his only objection to the tweet was because it jacked up the ratings for MSNBC.Levin thinks the meltdown by the left reveals a deeper issue: You know, it s nice to know where the liberals finally draw the line on this tweet by this president, Levin told Hannity, pointing out that liberals were not bothered by former President Clinton, who was accused of rape and molesting and sexually attacking women in the Oval Office, nor were they bothered by Ted Kennedy.

So the bottom line is, MSNBC has a problem.
From morning until night, it s the same damn show with different people, different dresses, different suits.
It s the same thing.
Levin then suggested that President Trump should keep tweeting Via: BPR
