EDINBURGH (Reuters) - The security incident at the Scottish parliament is over, a spokesman for the parliament said on Tuesday.
The MSP block is now open and members and their staff can return to their offices, the spokesman said.
The devolved parliament in Edinburgh was evacuated earlier after a package containing what was thought to be white powder was investigated by police.
