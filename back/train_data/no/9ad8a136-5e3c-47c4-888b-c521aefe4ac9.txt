bangkok ( reuters ) - thailand aims to get its air safety rating upgraded by the u.s. federal aviation administration ( faa ) by march , the country s transport minister said on wednesday , after the faa downgraded the rating in december 2015 .
thailand s department of civil aviation ( dca ) was downgraded to category 2 from 1 because it fell short of the faa s standards .
we aim to be restored back to category 1 by march , transport minister arkom termpittayapaisith told reporters .
arkom s comment came three months after the united nations international civil aviation organization ( icao ) removed a red flag against thailand over safety concerns in october .
he said thailand will speed up its inspection of pilot qualifications and aim to have more aviation personnel and qualified pilots to be considered for the safety ratings upgrade .
bangkok is a regional airline hub and thailand targeted a record 33 million to 34 million tourist arrivals this year .
