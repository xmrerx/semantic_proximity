I think it s a problem anybody who disrespects this country and the flag.
If they don t like the country they don t like our flag get the hell out.
Mike DitkaOutspoken Hall of Famer Mike Ditka became the latest high-profile name to weigh in on San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick s national anthem protest Friday when he ripped the signal-caller s actions.In an interview on Shan & RJ on 105.3 The Fan in Dallas (h/t CBS DFW), the ESPN analyst said of Kaepernick s actions:I think it s a problem anybody who disrespects this country and the flag.
If they don t like the country they don t like our flag get the hell out.I have no respect for Colin Kaepernick he probably has no respect for me, that s his choice.
My choice is, I like this country, I respect our flag, and I don t see all the atrocities going on in this country that people say are going on.Additionally, Ditka painted an optimistic picture regarding the United States during his radio appearance: I see opportunities if people want to look for opportunity.
Now if they don t want to look for them, then you can find problems with anything, but this is the land of opportunity because you can be anything you want to be if you work.
If you don t work that s a different problem.
