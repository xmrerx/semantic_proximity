It s no doubt Hillary Clinton has made gun violence a cornerstone in this election.
For the first time, the issue of gun violence and mass shootings are at the forefront of national presidential politics.So it should only make sense that the GOP s candidate and the NRA s newest puppet Donald Trump would try to hijack that attention and sweep it under the rug.After the NRA gleefully endorsed the presidential blowhard, Trump promised to eliminate gun free zones (while speaking at a gun free gathering) while slamming Hillary Clinton as heartless for wanting to restrict people s access to guns.Clinton didn t take to kindly to former (and brushed off the latter).
Speaking at a conference organized by the Trayvon Martin Foundation, Clinton said:This is someone running to be president of the United States of America a country facing a gun violence epidemic and he s talking about more guns in our schools, he s talking about more hatred and division in our streets.
That s no way to keep us safe.The conference, organized by Trayvon Martin s mother Sybrina Fulton, aimed to bring together mothers who lost children to gun violence.
Over 200 individuals showed up for the conference, including Fulton and Queen Thompson Brown, whose son was killed in Miami.
Queen, not budging to the sensationalized claims of gun grabbing, told reporters that their mission is not to take away guns, but to promote common sense gun laws.
Clinton continued:We have a moral obligation to protect our children no matter what zip code they live in.
If you want to imagine what Trump s America will look like, picture more kids at risk of violence and bigotry, picture more anger and fear.Saying she would not be silenced or bullied, Clinton pledged to stand up to the gun lobby, specifically the NRA.So the American people are faced with two options: one that cow tows to the NRA (even though he supported a ban on assault weapons) and one that has never waivered in her support of victims of gun violence.
We have one candidate that promises gun free zones while preaching in a gun free zone, and another that sits down with mothers and fathers who have lost their children.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images
