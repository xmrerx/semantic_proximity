quetta , pakistan ( reuters ) - gunmen in southwestern pakistan killed four members of a shi ite muslim hazara family , including a 12-year-old boy , on sunday , in the latest sectarian attack on the minority community , a senior police official said .
two men on a motorcycle opened fire on a family of eight while they at a filling station some 30 kilometres ( 19 miles ) north of quetta , the capital of pakistan s baluchistan province .
aside from those killed , two others were wounded .
two female members of the family were unscathed , having remained in their vehicle .
this was a sectarian attack , senior police officer tanveer shah told reuters , adding that no group has claimed responsibility for the shooting .
hazaras are frequently targeted by taliban and islamic state militants , and other sunni muslim militant groups in both pakistan and afghanistan .
many hazaras fled to pakistan during decades of conflict in neighboring afghanistan , and nearly half a million now live in and around quetta .
in 2013 , three separate bombings killed over 200 people in hazara neighborhoods , raising international awareness of the plight of the community .
more than 20 hazaras have been killed in similar shootings in baluchistan in the past two years , police say .
the ongoing violence in the province has fueled concern about security for projects in the $ 57-billion china pakistan economic corridor , a transport and energy link planned to run from western china to pakistan s southern deep-water port of gwadar .
