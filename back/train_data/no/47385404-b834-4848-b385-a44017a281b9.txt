according to the new york post : president obama is very particular about his shower head .
one thing that we were very aware of is the new president wanted a special shower head , stephen rochon , the white house chief usher told cnn on sunday , recalling when the obamas moved into 1600 pennsylvania ave. and so we had to scramble to make sure we had the perfect rain shower head for president obama .
president-elect trump has said he won t be giving the famous address a makeover.trump will move into the white house jan. 20 , inauguration day.we re so lucky to have trump in the oval office to clean up the mess from the past 8 years !
he s going to slash and burn in his first 100 days in office .
honestly , who else is counting the minutes until trump is inaugurated ?
we re ready !
