How is it that a major technical facility with over 20,000 employees had to rely on a valet parking attendant carrying a concealed gun to stop a woman from being stabbed to death?

Where were the security guards?
Are they even allowed to be armed?Police are investigating after a woman was stabbed at the General Motors Technical Center in Warren, Mayor Jim Fouts confirmed to FOX 2.Fouts tells us a woman walked into the 8-story building at the center of the campus and asked to speak with a female employee.
