baghdad ( reuters ) - islamic state militants set fire to three oil wells near hawija , west of the oil city of kirkuk , one of two areas of iraq still under their control , military and oil officials said on monday .
iraqi security forces were using bulldozers to control the fires started by the militants in the early hours of saturday to slow the advance of u.s.-backed iraqi forces and shi ite militia groups toward hawija town , military officials said .
the allas oilfield , 35 km ( 20 miles ) south of hawija , was one of the main sources of revenue for islamic state , which in 2014 declared a caliphate in parts of syria and iraq .
terrorists are trying to use the rising smoke to avert air strikes while retreating from the area toward hawija , said army colonel mohammed al-jabouri .
military officials said the fire had been brought under control at one of the wells , while the other two were still burning .
they said it would take about three days to put out the fires .
oil officials from the state-run north oil company said it was still too risky to send its crews in to assess damage at the wells as militants may have left bombs and landmines .
iraq launched an offensive on sept. 21 to dislodge islamic state from hawija .
islamic state , the ultra-hardline sunni muslim group , has lost control of all the oilfields it once controlled in the north of iraq .
