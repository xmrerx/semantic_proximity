nairobi ( reuters ) - kenya s election commission on friday postponed plans to hold delayed elections in some constituencies in western kenya where voting has not taken place yet , saying persistent insecurity made it too dangerous for staff .

voting was due to take place on saturday after polls failed to open on thursday due to protests by opposition supporters .
