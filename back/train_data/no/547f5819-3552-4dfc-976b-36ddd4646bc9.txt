frankfurt ( reuters ) - germany s thyssenkrupp , has offered assistance to argentinian authorities in an investigation into the disappearance of a submarine last month , a spokesman said on friday .
the ara san juan was delivered in 1985 and built by a unit of thyssen ag , which merged with krupp to form thyssenkrupp in 1999 .
we have offered our support for the technical investigation into this tragedy and are in contact with the argentinian navy in this respect , the spokesman said .
he said maintenance of the submarine was not conducted by thyssenkrupp .
the submarine went missing on nov. 15 with 44 crew members aboard in south atlantic waters .
the navy said on nov. 27 that water that entered the submarine s snorkel caused its battery to short circuit before it went missing .
the tragedy underscored what some critics have described as the parlous state of argentina s military , which has faced dwindling funding for years .
german magazine wirtschaftswoche earlier reported that a delegation of the argentinian navy had traveled to kiel in northern germany to discuss questions about the submarine with thyssenkrupp .
it did not identify its sources .
argentinian president mauricio macri has called for a serious and deep investigation into the incident .
