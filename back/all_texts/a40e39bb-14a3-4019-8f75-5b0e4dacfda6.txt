OUAGADOUGOU, Burkina Faso (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday sought to make a clean break from his predecessors saying that he came from a generation that would not tell Africans what to do and would focus his efforts on bridging ties between Africa and Europe.
I am from a generation that doesn t come to tell Africans what to do, Macron said during a speech to university students in the Burkinabe capital Ouagadougou.
I am from a generation for whom Nelson Mandela s victory is one of the best political memories.
Macron is on a three-day visit to West Africa that includes an EU-Africa summit in Ivory Coast s capital Abidjan.
I will not stand by those who say the African continent is one of crises and misery.
I will be alongside those who believe that Africa is neither a lost continent or one that needs to be saved.
