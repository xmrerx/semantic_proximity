What a great photo of President Trump joined by the President of Egypt and Saudi King Salman to inaugurate The Global Center for Combating Extremist Ideology.Essentially the center appears to be a Saudi data hub for monitoring multiple media and social media platforms, detecting extremist sentiments and countering the concerning rhetoric with positive social media messaging.
In the U.S. we have the NSA cyber command monitoring system.
Hoping this will help in the war on ISIS and other terrorists.
