no word yet about the mayor developing a plan to help christians who refuse to bake wedding cakes for gays based on their religious beliefs for some muslims , it can be hard to buy a house , and mayor ed murray plans to do something about it.on monday , murray s housing committee released its recommendations for ways the city can increase housing in the city .
most ideas were what you d expect , including increasing the city s housing levy and implementing new rules and regulations to foster development of market-rate and lower-income housing.one suggestion would help followers of sharia law buy houses .
that s virtually impossible now because sharia law prohibits payment of interest on loans .
the 28-member committee recommended the city convene lenders and community leaders to explore options for increasing access to sharia-compliant loan products.based on what he called rough anecdotal evidence , bukhari estimated a couple hundred people aren t borrowing money for houses due to their religion .
he said this includes even high-wage earners , such as the more than 1,000 muslims who work for microsoft ( nasdaq : mfst ) and more than 500 amazon.com ( nasdaq : amzn ) employees.they could easily qualify for home loans but opt not to apply simply because they don t want to pay interest , bukhari said.murray will send legislation based on the committee s ideas to the city council for consideration .
during a press conference , he said he wants to help muslims .
we will work to develop new tools for muslims who are prevented from using conventional mortgage products due to their religious beliefs , murray said.more and more lenders are offering sharia-compliant financing , according to a usa today report .
the sector has grown to more than $ 1.6 trillion in assets worldwide over the past three decades , and analysts see potential for continued growth as the number of muslims in the united states and europe grows.it s unclear how many muslims in seattle would benefit from murray s plan .
the washington state chapter of the council on american-islamic relations ( cair ) estimates more than 30,000 muslims live in the greater seattle area , and chapter executive director arsalan bukhari on tuesday said it s fairly common for some not to seek loans .
