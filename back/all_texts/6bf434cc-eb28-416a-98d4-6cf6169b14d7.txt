The Patriots actually busted them with this tweet responding to CNN from the New England Patriots Twitter account, which stated: These photos lack context.
Facts: In 2015, over 40 football staff were on the stairs.
In 2017, they were seated on the South Lawn.

The picture they used this time was one of George W. Bush with the Patriots.
Comparable photos: The last time the #Patriots won two Super Bowls in three years, 36 players visited the White House.
Today, we had 34. pic.twitter.com/Aslvf1RaXU New England Patriots (@Patriots) April 20, 2017Twitter user Tennessee GOP showed CNN another picture of the New England Patriots that was taken with the entire group who traveled to the White House to be honored by President Trump.
Tennessee GOP then told CNN to delete your account labeling CNN s latest scam #PhotoGatehttps://twitter.com/TEN_GOP/status/854865906165587968CNN for future reference, when the President of the United States is one of the closest friends of the New England Patriots owner, it s probably not a good idea to try to embarrass him by suggesting the Patriots didn t want to be there.
