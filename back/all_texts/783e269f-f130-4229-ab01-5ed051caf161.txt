Despite the pleading from large companies and citizens, Trump pulled out of the Paris agreement last week.But, not all hope is lost.
There is a light in the muck of it all that goes by the name of Hawaii.On Tuesday, June 6, Gov.
David Ige signed SB 599 and HB 1578 that support the commitments and goals of the Paris agreement.SB 599 expands strategies and mechanisms to reduce greenhouse gas emissions statewide in alignment with the principles and goals adopted in the Paris agreement , according to Hawaii s press release.HB 1578 establishes the Carbon Farming Task Force within the Office of Planning to identify agricultural and aquacultural practices to improve soil health and promote carbon sequestration the capture and long-term storage of atmospheric carbon dioxide to mitigate climate change.

Ige says tides are getting higher, biodiversity is shrinking, coral is bleaching and coastlines are eroding.What a shocking reality for Hawaii.
Do you see that, Trump?
The world is suffering and something must be done about it.Oh wait, you don t care.
Somehow the Paris agreement will cut jobs.
Sounds more like you care more about investments in harmful practices to the planet than anything else.
I don t understand why people are afraid to move forward with protecting the Earth.Thankfully, Hawaii is the first state out of the U.S.
Climate Alliance to sign laws aligning with the Paris agreement.
Other members of this group committed to upholding the Paris agreement despite Trump s withdrawal from it are:Now we just need to get the other states on board.
It would be amazing if, in spite of Trump, all 50 states joined the U.S.
Climate Alliance.
Because come on people, we need to take care of our planet and be held accountable!Featured image via Darryl Oumi/Getty Images
