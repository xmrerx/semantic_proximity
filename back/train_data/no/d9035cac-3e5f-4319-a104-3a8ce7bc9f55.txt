washington ( reuters ) - u.s. president barack obama shortened the prison sentences for 98 convicts serving time for drug-related offenses in his latest round of commutations , including for 42 people serving life sentences , the white house said on thursday .
obama has granted 688 commutations this year , for a total so far of 872 during his presidency , which ends on jan. 20 .
“ these are individuals - many of whom made mistakes at a young age - who have diligently worked to rehabilitate themselves while incarcerated , ” white house counsel neil eggleston said in a statement .
the commutations are part of obama ’ s push to reform the criminal justice system to reduce the number of people serving long sentences for non-violent drug offenses .
obama and a bipartisan group of lawmakers in the u.s. congress had tried to work on legislation to reduce mandatory minimum sentences , but those efforts stalled ahead of the nov. 8 presidential election .
