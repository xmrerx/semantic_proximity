LONDON (Reuters) - Fourteen people had to be airlifted from a British seaside tower after a mobile observation capsule became stuck, rescue services reported.
The Jurassic skyline tower in the southern resort of Weymouth offers 360-degree views of the surrounding area.
Video footage shows the trapped visitors being winched to safety by rescuers dangling from a helicopter above the 53-metre tower.
Dorset and Wiltshire Fire and Rescue Service was alerted on Tuesday afternoon after engineers failed to free the stuck capsule.
The tower s operator said on twitter that the gondola had become stuck due to a mechanical issue.
