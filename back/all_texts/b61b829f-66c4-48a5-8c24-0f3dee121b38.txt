Unless the Democrats can figure out a way to effectively steal the vote from millions, we predict Trump will win in a landslide election.
Despite what the media would like Americans to believe, Hillary will be lucky to have Chelsea vote for her in November NEW YORK CITY, New York Meet the Trumpocrats, or so the sizable collection of lifelong Democrats breaking with their party because of their disgust with nominee for president Hillary Rodham Clinton and supporting instead Republican nominee Donald J. Trump call themselves.Christian Rickers, the Virginia-based executive director of the Trumpocrats PAC a Super PAC designed to help his like-minded lifelong Democrats abandon the sinking Democratic ship due to Hillary Clinton s nomination and join the Trump movement walked Breitbart News through why he is leading the effort among Democrats who support Trump for president.Rickers argument centers on trade policy, and Trump s ardent opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) that Clinton supported publicly more than 40 times but now claims she opposes.
He points back to Bill Clinton s backing of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) from his time as president, and Rickers says Democrats everywhere should be terrified of how much further Hillary Clinton would go if she s elected president.Rickers said in a phone interview:Rickers said in a phone interview:I m a lifelong Democrat, really since I was a little kid, and I still am a Democrat.
But the Clintons for instance, where I am from, my hometown, when I was a kid we had 15 manufacturing plants and we now have one.
Nobody does anything there anymore, and that s the same thing happening in a lot of small towns across the country really.
The Clintons are really the cause of this, the cause of manufacturing going overseas with NAFTA and the trade deals and all of that.
Donald Trump, he says a lot of crazy sh*t, but the one thing that he does say, that he really does want to do something about that and that he wants to protect our people with better trade policies and new trade policies.On the Trumpocrats PAC website is a video of David Muscat Saunders, another lifelong Democrat, talking with Fox News.
