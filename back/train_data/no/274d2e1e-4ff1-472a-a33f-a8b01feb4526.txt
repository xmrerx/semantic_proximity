last friday , new jersey governor chris christie decided that endorsing gop presidential front-runner donald trump was a good idea .
since then political pundits have all been asking , what was he thinking ?
well , on tuesday night when trump was giving his super tuesday victory speech , christie seemed to come to the realization that he made a big mistake and that sudden awareness came as he stood behind the billionaire on stage .
the governor s facial expressions as he listened to his candidate spew his usual nonsense created a twitter storm , talks of a hostage situation and an epic hashtag : # freechrischristie.christie introduced trump after the votes were tallied and he was declared victorious in six states .
the nj governor welcomed the next president of the united states onto the stage , stood behind him and promptly upstaged the gop front-runner : pop quiz : new york billionaire takes new jersey governor hostage .
what do you do .
what do you do ?

# supertuesdaypic.twitter.com/ssdncxgxbe the daily show ( @ thedailyshow ) march 2 , 2016christie did look like he was donald trump s hostage and we don t feel bad for him at all .
the governor knew what he was getting himself into , he has said what a liar and horrible president trump would be on multiple occasions .
the only reason he even endorsed him is because he loves the media attention just as much as the billionaire loudmouth does .
now , he gets to live with the consequences of endorsing a racist , egotistical fool.on a side note , trump is going to be soooo pissed that christie stole the show .
i wouldn t be surprised if we didn t see the two of them on stage together again.watch a mash-up of his faces below : https : //www.facebook.com/vox/videos/488810047973269/ featured image via twitter
