luxembourg ( reuters ) - bridge is not a sport , the european union s top court ruled on thursday , thwarting a gambit by a british players to avoid sales tax on the grounds that sitting around playing cards is not a physical activity .
the english bridge union asked to have the same exemption from value added tax as sports associations for tournaments of duplicate bridge .
an eu directive lets governments waive vat on some services closely linked to sport or physical education .
however , the european court of justice found that despite the contention that competitive bridge promotes physical and mental health , the definition of sport for purposes of the tax directive must include a not negligible physical element .
the ecj , however , left a possible opening for british bridge fiends to exploit .
cultural activities can also apply for vat exemptions , they said , if their practice , history and traditions are part of the social and cultural heritage of the country .
