havana ( reuters ) - cuba is postponing municipal elections by a month to nov. 26 because of the devastation wrought on the caribbean island by hurricane irma , its council of state said in an electoral notice published in the ruling granma party newspaper on tuesday .
the elections were coming at an already difficult time for cuba as an economic reform program appears stalled , aid from key ally venezuela shrinks , and the trump administration threatens .
then irma swept across the island from east to west , tearing off roofs , damaging the power grid and crops , ripping up trees and bringing a violent storm surge to many coastal towns .
the council of state said it was delaying the municipal vote , originally slated for oct. 22 , so cubans could focus their efforts on the recovery .
it was not clear if this would result in the delay of provincial and national elections , which are set to culminate in the transfer of power next year from raul castro to a new president .
castro , younger brother and successor to fidel castro , who died in november , will nonetheless retain a grip on power as head of the communist party , the only legal party in cuba .
