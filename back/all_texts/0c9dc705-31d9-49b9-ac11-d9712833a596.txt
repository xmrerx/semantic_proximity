The horror that is Donald Trump s rise to the top of the GOP presidential race continues, and now his former nemesis turned ardent supporter Ben Carson went on Fox and Friends on Monday morning to warn the Republican Party that they better nominate Trump or else.It s no secret that the Republican establishment can t stand Trump, but is, like the rest of us, at a loss as to what to do to stop him.
The guy is like Teflon his supporters are so brainwashed that they don t care how many lies he tells or how many people he insults.
They just want Trump in the White House.
Carson said to the hosts: I can tell you this.
If there are shenanigans, if it s not straightforward, all of those millions of people that Donald Trump has brought into the arena are not going to stay there.And the Republicans are going to lose.
And it s going to be not only the presidency, but it s going to be the Senate, and it could even be the House.
It s going to be absolute destruction.
The thing is, though, the GOP is done either way if Trump gets the nomination.
The majority of Americans are not bottom feeding racists, misogynists, and homophobes like Trump supporters are.
They are the lowest of the low, and everyone knows it.
Make America Great Again is nothing more than code for Make America White Again.
Most people, regardless of political persuasion, know how dangerous Donald Trump and his horrible rhetoric are.
He and his supporters are reminiscent of the rise of Adolf Hitler, and we all know how that turned out.Carson went on to opine: And if they re more concerned about America, they will not blow up a straightforward process.
They will let the will of the people prevail.
I guarantee you, Mr. Carson, the will of the majority of Americans is NOT a Donald Trump presidency.Watch the video below, as posted by Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture
