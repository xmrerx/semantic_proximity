yaounde ( reuters ) - suspected boko haram militants killed at least 10 villagers in northern cameroon on sunday night in what army and local officials said was revenge for attacks by cameroon s army .
cameroon s semi-arid far north region has been a target of boko haram suicide bombings and raids for eight years as the islamist insurgency spilled over the border from nigeria , killing 20,000 and uprooting nearly 3 million in the lake chad region .
cameroon forces have tried to beat back insurgents but have struggled to stop unpredictable attacks that have been the hallmark of boko haram s bid to carve out an islamic state .
a senior army source said the attackers came to the village of gouderi at 11 p.m. on sunday and killed 11 people .
two local officials told reuters by phone that about 10 had been killed .
it looks like revenge because the army killed boko haram members in this village and forced others to retreat to nigeria , the army source said .
