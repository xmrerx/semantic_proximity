washington ( reuters ) - president donald trump ’ s administration has informed congress of its plan to pursue the $ 5 billion sale to bahrain of 19 lockheed martin f-16 aircraft and related equipment , which was held up last year by concerns about human rights , a congressional source said on wednesday .
the state department originally notified congress of the sale last september during president barack obama ’ s administration .
it was pulled back because of concerns that bahrain had not made promised improvements to its human rights record .
the trump administration has separated the human rights issues from the transfer , the source said .
members of congress were not immediately available to comment on whether they would object to the sale over human rights concerns this time .
the $ 4.867 billion sale includes the aircraft , 23 engines , radars and other avionics , air-to-air and air-to-ground ordnance and related equipment .
the latest notice sent to congress provides for 40 days of additional congressional review , then a formal notice to congress as required by the arms export control act , after which the licenses for the sale would be approved .
lockheed martin declined comment .
