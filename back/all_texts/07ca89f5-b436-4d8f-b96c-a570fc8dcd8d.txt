Donald Trump s presidential campaign is collapsing, thanks to his poor performance in the presidential debates, a campaign message with limited appeal, and the misogynistic assault comments he made about TV host Nancy O Dell that were released last Friday.Now it seems that groups aligned with Hillary Clinton plan to take advantage of Trump s problems, along with the huge exodus of Republicans who rescinded their support for him over the weekend.Until now, Priorities USA has spent the 2016 election cycle entirely focused on the top of the ticket getting Clinton elected.
The fact that they may use their resources to also promote Democratic candidates in down-ballot races suggests how increasingly confident they are in a Clinton victory.According to a source familiar with the plans, Priorities USA is currently producing television ads to potentially air in Senate contests in North Carolina, Nevada, New Hampshire and Pennsylvania all competitive races that are also battleground states for the presidential race.Hillary Clinton is relying on Democratic members of Congress to help her enact an agenda and defend President Obama s gains, should she be elected to the office.
A so-called wave election would go a long way to ensuring that situation be put in place.The last time conditions were similar was in 2008 when President Obama was first elected to the White House.
Two years before, Democrats won a ton of seats in the House and Senate which gave them majorities in both bodies.
As a result, Democrats were able to get the economic stimulus passed, along with the Affordable Care Act (both without the help of Republicans, who had decided to completely block the Obama agenda, no matter what).Since then Republicans have put in place more so-called gerrymandered seats, which are congressional seats whose districts are designed to consistently favor one party over another.
Republicans have done this in so many states, it is wildly believed that they have insulated themselves from being dislodged.
But not everyone agrees that this majority status lives on forever.Featured image via Flickr
