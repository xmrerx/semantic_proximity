moscow ( reuters ) - russian president vladimir putin , seeking a new term in office in a march election , said on thursday he would run as an independent candidate while hoping for support from more than one political party .
putin , 65 , told an annual news conference that russia s political system must be competitive , but the opposition lacked a strong candidate to challenge him because his opponents , while creating a lot of noise , had very little to offer the nation .
