America Rising (@BornPatriotUSA) July 30, 2016Despite this conservative temper tantrum, most people defended Malia because she was simply acting like a normal 18-year-old girl.
And her defenders epically mocked the conservative outrage.

She went to a concert with friends and had some fun dancing and listening to music.
Conservatives act like that makes her a bad person with no morals, which makes them like the parents from the movie Footloose.
