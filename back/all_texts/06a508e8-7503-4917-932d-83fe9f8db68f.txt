COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - An estimated 370,000 Rohingya Muslim refugees have fled to Bangladesh from violence in Myanmar since late August, a spokeswoman for the U.N. refugee agency, Vivian Tan, said on Tuesday.
The government of Buddhist-majority Myanmar says its security forces are fighting Rohingya militants behind a surge of violence that began on Aug. 25.
Many of the refugees say Myanmar authorities are intent on pushing Rohingya out of the country.
