assimilate or go home in the latest move to deny citizenship to anyone who chooses not to assimilate with swiss culture , authorities have rejected the naturalization application of two muslim girls who refused to take required swimming lessons at school because boys would be present in the pool.the girls , ages 12 and 14 , who live in the northern city of basel , had applied for swiss citizenship several months ago , but their request was denied , swiss media reported tuesday.the girls , whose names were not disclosed , said their religion prevents them from participating in compulsory swimming lessons with males in the pool at the same time .
their naturalization application was rejected because the sisters did not comply with the school curriculum , basel authorities said .
whoever doesn t fulfill these conditions violates the law and therefore can not be naturalized , stefan wehrle , president of the naturalization committee , told tv station srf on tuesday.the case shows how those who don t follow swiss rules and customs won t become citizens , even if they have lived in the country for a long time , are fluent in one of the national languages german , french or italian and are gainfully employed.in april , members of an immigrant family in the basel area were denied citizenship because they wore sweatpants around town and did not greet passersby a sure sign that they were not sufficiently assimilated , the naturalization board claimed.another recent case sparked widespread outrage in switzerland when two muslim brothers refused to shake hands with their female teacher , also citing religious restrictions .
shaking hands with a teacher is a common practice in swiss schools.after that incident was widely publicized , authorities suspended the naturalization request from the boys father , an imam at the basel mosque.the swimming case involving the two girls is the first to deny naturalization applications for not complying with a school program , setting precedence for future cases , wehrle said.this is not the first time switzerland s muslim community has stirred controversy over swimming lessons .
in 2012 , a family was fined $ 1,500 for forbidding their daughters to participate in swimming classes.the matter eventually ended up in the supreme court , which ruled that no dispensations from swimming lessons should be made on religious grounds.in switzerland , unlike in the united states and many other countries , integration into society is more important for naturalization than knowledge of national history or politics .
candidates for citizenship must prove that they are well assimilated in their communities and respect local customs and traditions .
