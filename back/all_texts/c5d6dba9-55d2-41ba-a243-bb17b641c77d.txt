Ted Cruz is one of the few GOP candidates who in unafraid to speak out against government subsidies for energy.
Unfortunately, many of the farmers in Iowa are receiving subsidies (money back from the government taxpayers) and are not very interested in supporting politicians who want to prevent those subsidies from coming in the mail.Watch Ted Cruz convert a farmer who s been eating from the Democrat trough, into a voter.
He does a brilliant job of explaining to this angry farmer in simple terms, how government is the problem and not the solution.
Cruz explains that the government should not be in the business of using taxpayer dollars to pick the winners and losers in the energy business.
He goes on to explain that by removing government restrictions and allowing the free market to work, the farmer will actually be better off in the end.https://youtu.be/I6cUDscjrNg
