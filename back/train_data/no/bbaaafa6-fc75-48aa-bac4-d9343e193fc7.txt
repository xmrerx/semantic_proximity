anyone who has been to grade school is fully aware that andrew jackson died before a certain bloody conflict in which southerners fought their countrymen ( former countrymen if you consider the confederacy to be legitimate like many trump supporters do ) over the right to own other human beings , but donald trump has his own alternative facts about swashbuckler jackson.trump says he learned during a recent visit to tennessee that they love andrew jackson down there , questioning whether jackson , who owned 150 men , women , and children when he died in 1845 , could have stopped the civil war , which began in 1861 , if he had been a little bit later .
i mean had andrew jackson been a little bit later you wouldn t have had the civil war .
he was a very tough person , but he had a big heart , trump told the washington post s salena zito .
he was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the civil war , he said , there s no reason for this . '
yes , according to trump , slave owner andrew jackson was angry about a war that began long after his death and totally would have acted against his own self-interest ( slavery was the source of all of his money ) to stop it if he hadn t been so dead .
but he was mad .
then trump wondered why the civil war happened in the first place a question appropriate coming from someone who thinks a hardcore slave owner would have stopped it : people don t ask that question , but why was there the civil war ?
why could that one not have been worked out ?
fortunately , crooked hillary s daughter stepped up to provide him with the answer in a manner trump may understand : under 140 characters:1 word answer : slavery .
longer : when andrew jackson died in 1845 ( 16 yrs before the civil war began ) , he owned 150 men , women and children .
https : //t.co/icg6pug2jz chelsea clinton ( @ chelseaclinton ) may 1 , 2017naturally , a trump supporter made a snide remark that chelsea clinton discovered google something trump obviously did not do .breaking : chelsea clinton discovered google https : //t.co/dpoi1dpnis colin carr ( @ colinthehogs ) may 1 , 2017 and promptly got stomped : hi colin i 've been to hermitage , andrew jackson 's home in tennessee .
worth visiting .
does n't shy away from jackson 's slave-owning history .
https : //t.co/l8wzkqifjz chelsea clinton ( @ chelseaclinton ) may 1 , 2017trump also visited jackson s home but apparently failed to learn that no president has done more to expand slavery in the united states than he did .
appropriately , the donald told zito that his campaign was a lot like that of jackson , who also called for severe penalties for the circulation of incendiary publications .
trump , who is exploring suing journalists for stories he does not like , just says fake news because he s nowhere near as intelligent as the slave-owning former president he thinks would have stopped the civil war.naturally , twitter loved watching trump get dragged by the former first daughter : @ chelseaclinton @ independentlye if you think andrew jackson was mad about the civil war , you should have heard his thoughts on vietnam .
not good !
ben hooper ( @ benhooperwrites ) may 1 , 2017 @ chelseaclinton guess he missed all his history classes .
unbelievable .
beth woodworth ( @ bwoodwor ) may 1 , 2017 @ chelseaclinton @ marcdrummond i learned about this in high school .
in norway .
how is the us president this ignorant of his own country s history ?
mortenrandhendriksen ( @ mor10 ) may 1 , 2017 @ chelseaclinton but trump would have prevented civil war by giving each slave 3/5 of a pepsi drain the trumps ( @ drainthetrumps ) may 1 , 2017 @ chelseaclinton can trump for the love of god pick up a damn history book !
google anything ! ? ! ?
saba ( @ sabasmw ) may 1 , 2017 @ chelseaclinton @ realdonaldtrump did you sleep through american history ?

laurie johnson ( @ lauriejohnson12 ) may 1 , 2017 @ chelseaclinton gee , maybe if someone spoke to him for 10 minutes about slavery ?
# ignorance # willfulignorance # notnormal # resist mer ( @ 72greysweater ) may 1 , 2017 @ chelseaclinton @ girlmopar ask any native american about andrew jackson s big heart .
# trailoftears damon musha ( @ damon_musha ) may 1 , 2017donald trump is a complete embarrassment , and it is baffling that our country contains so many stupid people that a minority of them were able to put him in office with the help of the electoral college a system set up to protect jackson s favorite thing , slavery.listen to trump s remarks below : here 's the audio on that trump answer : `` why was there the civil war ?
why could that one not have been worked out ? ''
