WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the House of Representatives’ tax-writing committee on Wednesday predicted there will be strong support for repealing the Obamacare individual healthcare mandate when House-Senate negotiators hash out differences in their tax reform plans.
“We’re very supportive of getting rid of that tax.
We’re encouraged by the Senate’s action; we’re hopeful they pass it.
And I think in conference committee you’ll see strong support,” Representative Kevin Brady, a Republican, said in an interview with Fox News.
The House version of the tax bill, which will be voted on this week, does not repeal the mandate.
