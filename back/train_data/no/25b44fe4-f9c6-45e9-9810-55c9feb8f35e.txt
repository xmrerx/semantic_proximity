brace yourself , people .
senator charles schumer once had a donut and coffee with vladimir putin during an official 2003 state visit to a russian gas station chain that opened in new york .
sure , schumer wasn t running for president and this was a public meeting .
he also did not perjure himself like attorney general jeff sessions but according to donald trump , the lies he and his administration have told the american people and the crimes they have committed right in front of us mean nothing because schumer was once photographed doing his job when vladimir putin happened to be a part of it.oh , yes , and he should be investigated , for asking questions about trump and friends clearly treasonous actions .
we should start an immediate investigation into @ senschumer and his ties to russia and putin , trump tweeted friday .
a total hypocrite !

fortunately , most americans are not brainwashed , and many of them showed up to share their thoughts with our middle-schooler-in-chief .
@ realdonaldtrump how was your visit to moscow ?

@ realdonaldtrump what about a posthumous investigation of reagan while we 're at it !
pic.twitter.com/d5bkq25j3i adam blickstein ( @ adamblickstein ) march 3 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump the fact that you tweet this from drudge shows how gullible you are .
that was taken in '03 during a public official visit .
chet powell ( @ chetpowell ) march 3 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump @ senschumer so , donutgate ?

# trumprussia merider ( @ roadchickie ) march 3 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump @ senschumer this is a photo of them meeting publicly .
cody johnston ( @ drmistercody ) march 3 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump @ senschumer eating in public is n't the same as a covert meeting during your campaign and lying about it under oath !
# treaon ryan chase ( @ radioryanchase ) march 3 , 2017later , trump demanded an investigation into nancy pelosi because she was once photographed with russian ambassador kislyak in 2010 .
pelosi apparently mistakenly said that she didn t meet this russian ambassador on friday .
she is seen in the photo sitting across the table from the current ambassador.i hereby demand a second investigation , after schumer , of pelosi for her close ties to russia , and lying about it .
https : //t.co/qcdljff3wn donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) march 3 , 2017pelosi later clarified that she , unlike trump s people , has never met with the current ambassador privately .
naturally , people were there again to remind trump that he s an idiot , particularly because it took him three tries to spell one word correctly : in the middle of three attempts to correctly spell `` hereby '' in an attack tweet , trump tweeted about the importance of education .
irony .

roland scahill ( @ rolandscahill ) march 3 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump how many times are you going to try to get this tweet right ?
why do n't you try presidenting instead of angry tweeting ?
laura packard ( @ lpackard ) march 3 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump @ politico she was n't sneaking them in the back door of trump tower and lying about it .
big difference donnie !
scarlet pimpernel ( @ scarletpimper17 ) march 3 , 2017sorry , mr. trump , the american people are not all morons , nor will they fall for whatever you hope to gain from donutgate .
a public visit that lasted about 10 minutes is not in any way like multiple secret meetings and perjury.featured image via getty images ( mark wilson ) /screengrab
