As you know, Donald Trump put aside his disdain for intelligence, intelligence briefings, and basically anything associated with the i-word (after all, he does love the poorly educated) to attend a briefing on Vladimir Putin s hack of our election on Friday.
Though the meeting was intended to drive the point home that 1.)
Russia did indeed hack our election, 2.)
the hack was meant to get Donald Trump elected, and Wikileaks was definitely used to disseminate the hacked documents, The Donald somehow managed to leave the meeting more sure than ever that he is right.Friday night, he went straight to his favorite pastime: victim blaming.
Gross negligence by the Democratic National Committee allowed hacking to take place, Trump said.
The Republican National Committee had strong defense!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017In reality, as was made public some time ago, the Republican National C ommitteewas also hacked, but Putin chose not to release the information because he was trying to install his big orange puppet in the White House.
But Trump, like nearly every Republican ever, has never been known to let facts get in the way of his beliefs.Apparently, having not gotten it all out yet, Trump woke up and tweeted another barrage of stupidity before you even had your morning cup of coffee.
Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results, he wrote in his morning dose of stupidity.
Voting machines not touched!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017Actually, there is strong evidence that the hacking affected the election results, though no one at any point has claimed that voting machines were altered in any way something he would have known before that meeting if he cared at all about fact checking before he unleashes on Twitter.
Had he listened in his meeting, he would know that the report did not actually look into whether the hack impacted the election results:We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election.
The US Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze US political processes or US public opinion.But what this all comes down to is ego, according to Trump.
He doesn t mean his, of course, but he feels that Democrats fragile little egos were crushed because the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!
Only reason the hacking of the poorly defended DNC is discussed is that the loss by the Dems was so big that they are totally embarrassed!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017Of course, Trump actually lost the popular vote by nearly three million and he managed one of the most humiliating wins even by the standards of the Electoral College, a system that was put in place solely to benefit slave owners by making rural voters ballots count more than many other Americans .
In fact, only 12 elections since 1789 have seen winners with fewer delegate votes than Trump received.
If anyone s ego is causing anyone to lash out like a madman, one only needs to look at Trump s Twitter feed to see whom that is.Naturally, he got thrashed by the denizens of Twitter:@realDonaldTrump You lost by over 3 million popular votes.
You won the election but slow down on the "big" win.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump You won electoral votes, but lost the popular vote by the biggest margin ever.
America knows a loser when it sees one: you.

Noah Kalina (@noahkalina) January 7, 2017 @realDonaldTrump GOP was also hacked.
Relevant question: Extent of your knowledge regarding Russia, Putin's efforts to win election for you.
Jeffrey Guterman (@JeffreyGuterman) January 7, 2017.
@realDonaldTrump You literally lost by 3 million votes even though the Russians hacked and interfered on your behalf.
Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump This may be hard to understand, but we would like our future elections to not have a sprinkling of Russian involvement.
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump Their embarrassment over losing to the likes of you doesn't mitigate or negate the attack on our nation s election process.
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump You might want to delete this tweet.
It s sort of designed for ridicule.
Like the largest softball in all of human history.
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump This is a false equivalence.Yes, they are embarrassed to lose to a bigot.Yes, Putin undermined our election process.
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) January 7, 2017@flanagan_aj @keatonc33 @steveclarkuk @realDonaldTrump it was the 44th-largest electoral win, so even by that standard it wasn't "huge".
Jeff Fecke (@jkfecke) January 7, 2017The report Trump ignored states that the 2016 election interference dwarfs anything Russia has done in the past:Russian efforts to influence the 2016 US presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity, and scope of effort compared to previous operations.Ultimately, no matter what Trump says, these are the facts:We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the US presidential election.
Russia s goals were to undermine public faith in the US democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency.
We further assess Putin and the Russian Government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump.
We have high confidence in these judgments.We also assess Putin and the Russian Government aspired to help President-elect Trump s election chances when possible by discrediting Secretary Clinton and publicly contrasting her unfavorably to him.
All three agencies agree with this judgment.
CIA and FBI have high confidence in this judgment; NSA has moderate confidence.Moscow s approach evolved over the course of the campaign based on Russia s understanding of the electoral prospects of the two main candidates.
When it appeared to Moscow that Secretary Clinton was likely to win the election, the Russian influence campaign began to focus more on undermining her future presidency.Trump has once again proven himself to be an imbecile who isn t qualified to run a banana stand let alone the country.
He s right about one thing, though: Democrats are totally embarrassed not because of a bigly loss, but because our country somehow kinda-sorta elected someone who stands for everything it does not.Featured image via Getty Images (Mark Wilson)/screengrab
