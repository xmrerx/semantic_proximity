WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Military intelligence programs account for $16.8 billion of the Pentagonâ€™s overall $583 billion budget request for fiscal 2017, the U.S. Defense Department said on Tuesday.
The sum includes funds in the base budget and a separate war funding budget.
A Pentagon spokeswoman said no additional details on military intelligence programs would be released since they remained classified for national security reasons.
