It s probably not a good time for Hillary to remind voters of her and Bill s coordinated war on women Donald Trump on Saturday threatened to bring a woman that Bill Clinton had an extramarital affair with when he debates Hillary Clinton.Trump tweeted this response to Mark Cuban sitting in the front row, in an attempt to rattle him during the debates:If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 24, 2016Paul Nehlen, Speaker Paul Ryan s opponent in the WI primary race, offered Trump a brilliant suggestion:Great idea.
Ask Ms.
Flowers to wear this shirt pic.twitter.com/5SNRTXGpaY Paul Nehlen (@pnehlen) September 24, 2016Bill Clinton testified under oath in 1998 that he had a sexual affair with Flowers.Trump was responding to billionaire Mark Cuban, a Hillary Clinton supporter who frequently slams Trump.
Cuban on Thursday said he accepted an invitation from Clinton to sit in the front row at Monday s presidential debate.Trump s public reference to Bill Clinton s extramarital affairs will likely roil the presidential race just two days before the first debate.Trump said earlier this week that he did not plan to bring up the Clintons marriage at the debate.
I don t think I m looking to do that Bill.
I don t know what I m going to do that exactly, Trump said during an interview on The O Reilly Factor.
It depends on what level she hits you with, if she s fair, if it s unfair, but certainly I m not looking to do that.
