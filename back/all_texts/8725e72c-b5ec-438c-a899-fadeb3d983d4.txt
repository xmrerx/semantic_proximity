WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump raised $100 million in October from “small-dollar” donors, his campaign announced on Wednesday.
His campaign announced that the total was garnered from 1.6 million small-dollar donations, a term traditionally used to describe contributions of less than $250.
Trump has faced a significant fundraising deficit compared with his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
In the first 19 days of October, Trump raised about $30 million, compared with Clinton’s $53 million.
