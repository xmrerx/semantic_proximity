bosaso , somalia ( reuters ) - islamist al shabaab militants attacked a checkpoint in somalia s semi-autonomous puntland region , killing at least seven people in the early hours of monday , police said .
the fighters then ambushed officers rushing in to help colleagues on the outskirts of the city of bosaso , an officer at the scene told reuters .
al shabaab said it took the checkpoint then left , though the police said they fought off the assault .
al shabaab has launched a string of attacks on somalia s capital mogadishu and other areas controlled by the federal government in a bid to oust the western-backed authorities and impose the group s interpretation of islamic law .
attacks are relatively rare in puntland , which has its own government and security forces patrolling its territory on the northeastern tip of the horn of africa , jutting out into the gulf of aden and the arabian sea .
at about 1 a.m. , many well-armed al shabaab fighters attacked us from all directions in an attempt to capture the checkpoint , police captain abdifatah mohamed said .
three police and four civilians died and at least 13 others were wounded in the clashes , he said over the phone from the checkpoint .
abdiasis abu musab , al shabaab s military operation spokesman , said its fighters killed seven soldiers and wounded 11 others .
we captured the bosaso checkpoint and left this morning .
we also ambushed a police reinforcement , he said .
puntland is also home to a splinter group of al shabaab that has sworn allegiance to islamic state .
security sources say a small contingent of foreign fighters is based there .
