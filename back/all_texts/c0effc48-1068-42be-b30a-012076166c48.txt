President Donald Trump has made one thing clear, he cares about ratings more than anything else in the world.
This week the Washington Post reported that when asked if he was planning firing Sean Spicer, the White House press secretary Trump said, I m not firing Sean Spicer.
That guy gets great ratings.
Everyone tunes in.
The President went on to compare the daily White House briefing to a soap opera and noted that Spicer gets better ratings than the soaps that are on today.
Trump s love of television is so well known that aides use it as a way to reach him and foreign leaders are even starting to do the same.
They are finding ways to show up on the shows they think the president is most likely to watch.Stephen Colbert took advantage of the comments connecting Spicer to soap operas to create one of his own.
