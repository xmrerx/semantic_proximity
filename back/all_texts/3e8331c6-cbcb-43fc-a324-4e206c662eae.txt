SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korean President Moon Jae-in said North Korea s launch of an intermediate ballistic missile that flew over the northern Japanese island of Hokkaido amounted to violent conduct to a neighbouring country, his office said on Wednesday.
Moon agreed with Japanese Prime Minister Abe in a telephone call on Wednesday that pressure must be raised to the maximum on the North to leave Pyongyang with no choice but to come to dialogue, the presidential Blue House said in a statement.
