NEW YORK (Reuters) - Some 11.9 million Americans watched Thursday’s unusually restrained Republican presidential debate on CNN, the network said on Friday, a sharp drop from the 16.9 million who tuned in last week when the Republican contenders faced off on a much rowdier evening.

Since then, however, audiences have dropped off, with only the raucous March 3 Republican encounter coming close to the interest seen last year.
Democratic TV debates have fared less well with the public and have struggled to attract audiences of more than 10 million since January.
