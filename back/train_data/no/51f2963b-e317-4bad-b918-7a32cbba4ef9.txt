valletta ( reuters ) - three men accused of killing maltese anti-corruption blogger daphne caruana galizia were committed to trial on thursday by a magistrate hearing preliminary evidence .
brothers george and alfred degiorgio and vincent muscat were arrested in early december on the strength of phone intercepts and accused of having killed caruana galizia in a carbomb as she drove out of her home on oct. 16 .
in the maltese judicial system , police have to present initial evidence to a magistrate , who decides whether there are sufficient grounds to press charges .
on the third day of the preliminary hearing , magistrate claire stafrace zammit ruled that the three should be sent to trial .
the trio have denied wrongdoing .
police told the court that george degiorgio was sitting on a boat outside valletta harbor when he sent an sms to trigger the deadly bomb , which had been planted overnight in caruana galizia s hire car .
mobile phone data showed that alfred degiorgio and muscat had repeatedly visited caruana galizia s home village bidnija in the days before the blast .
police believe they watched from a nearby vantage point as caruana galizia set out in her car and told george degiorgio via telephone to detonate the device .
her death shocked malta , the smallest nation in the european union , which has been engulfed by a wave of graft scandals , including accusations of money laundering and influence peddling in government all of which have been denied .
caruana galizia exposed many of these cases , but had never written about the three suspects , who had fallen foul of local police in the past .
the slain blogger s family say the mastermind behind the killing must still be at large .
malta s attorney general must now draw up precise charges against the degiorgios and muscat , and no trial date has been set .
