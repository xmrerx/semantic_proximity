21st century wire saysfollowing a wave of hidden camera sting operations captured by the investigative non-profit project veritas , it has now been revealed that the democratic consultant robert creamer of democracy partners , met with white house officials some 342 times over the past year .
scandal ( photo illustration 21wire s shawn helton ) the dailymail reported the following as it relates to the democratic campaign bombshell : a convicted felon caught up in a pair of stinging political expos s has visited the obama white house 342 times , according to the administration s records , including several visits to the obama family s residence and one , in october of last year , to the oval office.robert creamer was caught on one hidden-camera video discussing ways to commit large-scale voter fraud , and talking in another about paying liberal activists to start fights and otherwise disrupt donald trump rallies.democracy partners , the community organizing firm that until tuesday employed creamer , works hand-in-hand with hillary clinton s presidential campaign .
caught on film robert creamer resigns over massive democratic party controversy .
( image source : cnn ) creamer s visits to the white house also included his wife , a 9-term illinois democratic congresswoman jan schakowsky.white house visitor records show that schakowsky took 47 private meetings with obama or his senior staff , also over the past year .
the consultancy democracy partners appears to have applied schakowsky as a political buffering point , possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level .
the impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics.creamer , a convicted felon , ( in 2005 , creamer plead guilty $ 2.3 million in bank fraud and tax violations ) was promptly shoved out of the hillary clinton campaign s inner circle , following a heavily publicized sting that caught the democratic consultant discussing how to commit large-scale voter fraud , while also apparently outlining how to incite violence at campaign rallies.scott foval , the former national field director at americans united for change also discussed controversial and apparent criminal campaign methods , prompting him to be fired after the project veritas video footage went viral .
whatever your political persuasion and whether or not wikileaks may or may not be just another western intelligence asset masquerading in public , some of the emails recently released have raised some interesting questions .
notably , the dissent among the clinton campaign , the clinton foundation s perceived misconduct in haiti , an email disclosing that isis received clandestine financial and logistic support from saudi arabia and qatar , which was a story that dovetailed another possible pay-for-play scheme , in the form of an attempted qatari gift to bill clinton for $ 1 million in 2012.other wikileaks of importance , presented the collusion between the clinton campaign and media arms the associated press and the new york times , the latter of which in the last 24 hours , has provided damage control for hillary clinton s sycophantic wall street speeches that outline an amnesty-laden open borders strategy as well as a rights dissolving trade deal like the trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) .
the tpp trade deal has been covered extensively at 21wire over the past few years and is under the guise of a so-called free-trade agreement .
the international trade law for new trade treaties appears to be a way for private corporations to exempt themselves from the laws of sovereign nations , something which belies a truly free market the world over.despite the democratic candidate s timely flip flop shift over the tpp deal during the election cycle she provided a lot of vocal support for the deal while seating as the secretary of state.indeed , as released in the wikileaks batch # 12 , democratic pollster joel benenson , is quoted as stating the following , the reality is hrc is more pro trade than anti and trying to turn her into something she is not could reinforce our negative [ sic ] around authenticity .
this is an agreement that she pushed for and largely advocated for .
interestingly , one of the most impactful and potentially criminal docu-dumps to come out recently was released by the fbi this week , which according to real clear politics , outlined the following quid pro quo allegations : notes from an interview with a now-retired fbi agent suggest that the state department tried to get the fbi to declassify a benghazi-related email found on hillary clinton s private email server , in exchange for the state department allowing the fbi to place more undercover agents in certain countries .
the conversation allegedly took place while the state department was engaged in a review to prepare emails from hillary clinton s private server for public release .
the washington post added the following on the matter : the purported quid pro quo between [ brian ] mccauley and [ pat ] kennedy was first reported over the weekend by fox news and the weekly standard and confirmed monday when the fbi released dozens of interview summaries from its criminal investigation into clinton s use of a private email server while she was secretary of state .
according to fox news : undersecretary [ patrick ] kennedy s attempt to barter away american national security interests for plainly political purposes is appalling , and may rise to the level of a federal crime , rep. bob goodlatte , r-va. , wrote in a letter to attorney general loretta lynch on tuesday.in the heavily redacted files , known as 302s , an fbi official described the incident with under secretary for management patrick kennedy as a quid pro quo .
according to the files , in exchange for marking a particular email unclassified , the state department would reciprocate by letting the fbi place more agents in countries where they are presently forbidden .
if true , these fbi and state department files could reveal yet another glaring example of collusion that may have provided political protection for presidential nominee hillary clinton.both the fbi and state department deny any arrangement was made .
however , records show that kennedy attempted to reduce the number of classified emails linked to clinton s personal server.in early october , the us department of justice ( doj ) dropped all charges against an american arms dealer named marc turi , whose weapons made it into the hands of radical libya militants.according to federal court records obtained by politico : the deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on hillary clinton s private emails as secretary of state , and to expose reported central intelligence agency attempts to arm rebels fighting libyan leader moammar qadhafi .
it also worth mentioning again that over the summer we discussed how the 2016 s dnc convention was the latest in a long line of sordid political productions .
bernie sanders delegates staged a mass walkout after a series of email leaks disclosed that a clinton lawyer gave the dnc strategy advice on how to sideline the sanders campaign.expect the clinton campaign and the white house to whitewash the dnc voter fraud fallout and other fbi allegations as another scandal replaces them .
something to watch for will be the case of former joint chiefs of staff vice chairman general james cartwright , who plead guilty this week to felony charges of lying to the fbi after allegedly leaking classified material about covert operations against two iranian journalists.here s another look at one of the many dnc operatives outlining how to disrupt a trump political rally through intimidation .
more from zero hedge below why did vote-rigging robert creamer visit the white house over 200 times during the obama admin ? zero hedgeearlier today we wrote about a new project veritas undercover video that uncovered several democratic operatives openly discussing , in explicit detail , how to commit massive voter fraud .
one of the operatives was a person by the name of robert creamer who is a co-founder of a democratic consulting firm called democracy partners .
within the video , an undercover journalist details a plan to register hispanic voters illegally by having them work as contractors , to which creamer can be heard offering support saying that there are a couple of organizations that that s their big trick ( see : rigging elections for 50 years massive voter fraud exposed by project veritas part 2 ) .unfortunately , the embarrassing video caused creamer to subsequently resign from consulting the hillary campaign as he issued a statement saying that he was stepping back from my responsibilities working the [ hillary ] campaign over fears that his continued assistance would be a distraction for the campaign.zero hedge continues here read more election news at : 21st century wire 2016 files
