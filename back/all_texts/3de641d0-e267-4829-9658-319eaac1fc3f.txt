Probably the most highly coveted endorsement by either Democratic Presidential candidate would be Senator Elizabeth Warren.
Her popularity and leadership in the Senate against corporate influences and Wall Street have made her a household name since President Barack Obama asked the former Harvard Law Professor to assist with Wall Street reform following the 2008 economic recession.After Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard (D-HI) resigned from her position as Vice Chair at the DNC in order to endorse Bernie Sanders, and after progressive champion Congressman Alan Grayson (D-FL) also endorsed Sanders today, the pressure is on for Senator Elizabeth Warren to either endorse a presidential candidate or not.Supporters of both Clinton and Sanders have speculated Senator Warren s neutrality is a sign of allegiance to their favored candidate.
Warren s ideals more closely align with Senator Bernie Sanders, and the two are often seen in the Senate in tandem fighting against corporate greed.
Just this past November, they were the only senators disputing Barack Obama s nominee to head the FDA over his ties to big pharmaceutical companies.Senator Warren has remained silent on the issue of an endorsement, but has remained as vocal as ever on the issues important to progressives.
Today, an op-ed she wrote was published in the Boston Globe on how to level the playing field for working families in regards to the Family and Medical Leave Act.
Both Sanders and Clinton support 12 weeks of paid family and medical leave.Senator Warren s neutrality is most likely attributed to maintain the Democratic Party s integrity, as her endorsement would further divide a party already under pressure from the rift between Clinton and Sanders supporters.
A Sanders endorsement would likely alienate Senator Warren from the Democratic Establishment, which has embraced her notoriety, and also embitter her supporters who preferred Clinton over Sanders.A Clinton endorsement would have similar consequences, but most likely negatively influence the Sanders campaign more than it would Clinton s campaign, as the failure of the Sanders campaign to receive an endorsement from arguably the most progressive in the Senate aside from Sanders would be a major setback.
Senator Warren is also still a viable candidate for Vice President for either Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and regardless of who ultimately wins the nomination, Senator Warren will likely serve an important role if they win the presidency as she has in the Obama administration.If Senator Warren were to make an endorsement, the best time would be today or tomorrow, as Massachusetts, and her home state of Oklahoma hold their primaries on Super Tuesday tomorrow, and the longer she waits to make a decision, the less influence she would have on pushing for her choice as the nominee.
