Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump knows that his numbers with African American voters are historically terrible.
That is why he finally bit the bullet and decided to visit a Black church on Saturday.
While it seems that the congregation of that church showed grace and class and listened to Trump s message regardless of their personal feelings about him after all, he was a guest in their church people outside let Trump know just how unwelcome he was in their city as he left the church.
They had even begun arriving before Trump was anywhere near the place, with chants of This is our neighborhood!
More protesters arrive at Detroit church where Trump will be: "This is our neighborhood!"

His history of racism is lengthy and well-documented.
He is just doing what he always does pandering to whatever audience he is speaking to at any given moment.
He s just as much of a bigot as ever.
He simply knows that he cannot win without the minority vote, so, two months out from the election, he s trying to get at least some of them.Do not be fooled, folks.
This guy doesn t care about anyone but himself.Featured image via screen capture
