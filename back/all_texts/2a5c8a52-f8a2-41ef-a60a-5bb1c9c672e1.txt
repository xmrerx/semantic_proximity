BARCELONA (Reuters) - A convoy of around 30 Civil Guard police vans, unmarked vans and a truck filled with police officers left Barcelona port early on Sunday morning, a Reuters witness said, as lines of voters began forming at polling stations to vote on independence from Spain.
Thousands of police have been shipped in from all over Spain to prevent the banned referendum taking place.
