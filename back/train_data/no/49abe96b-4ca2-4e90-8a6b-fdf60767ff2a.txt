jerusalem ( reuters ) - israel has ordered the deportation of two of three turks who were briefly arrested during palestinian demonstrations last week after u.s. president donald trump recognized jerusalem as israel s capital , the interior ministry said on monday .
the three were detained on friday on suspicion of assaulting israeli police near a al-aqsa mosque in east jerusalem , which palestinians see as the capital of their own future state .
an israeli court freed them without charges on saturday .
an interior ministry spokeswoman said one of the men was scheduled for deportation later on monday and another on saturday .
she said both had entered israel on belgian passports .
israeli police had described the three as turkish tourists .
a photograph circulated on social media showed them among a group of fez-wearing men and boys outside al-aqsa .
one is seen wearing a turkish flag t-shirt and waving a palestinian flag , while two hold up pictures of turkish president tayyip erdogan .
erdogan has been vocal in opposing trump s jerusalem move , which reversed decades of u.s. policy over the status of a city whose eastern sector israel captured in the 1967 war and which is holy to jews , christians and muslims .
the interior ministry spokeswoman said she had no information on the third turk who had been arrested in the case .
