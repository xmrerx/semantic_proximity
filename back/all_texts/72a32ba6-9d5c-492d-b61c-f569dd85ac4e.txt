It looks like there is more than one good reason to not elect Paul Ryan as the next Speaker Of The House.
This is the best news we ve heard all week..The moderate wing of the GOP is concerned that if the House cannot coalesce behind Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) or someone like him as speaker, some of the more pragmatic members of the caucus will retire, the National Journal reported Monday.

They re hop ing for a Ry an-type can did ate.
But if it s not and it be comes a huge mess, why be sit ting here?
Two of the most vocal GOP critics of the conservative hardliners who have been roiling House leadership suggested to National Journal that the thought of retirement was weighing on members minds, even if they themselves weren t currently considering stepping down.
A lot has been put on hold in both ways people de cid ing to run again, or not run again, Rep. Pete King (R-NY) told National Journal, while saying he personally is not considering retiring be cause you can t give in.
Likewise, Rep. Charlie Dent (R-PA) said he was pre par ing as if I m run ning for reelec tion right now.
But we ll see what hap pens.
