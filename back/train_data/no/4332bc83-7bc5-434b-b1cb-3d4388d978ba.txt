the show went on last night even though protesters attempted to get trump dumped from hosting .
in true trump style he was able to laugh at himself and make fun of the protest against him .
he turned this into ratings gold for snl and made us all laugh out loud the faux outrage and twisting of trump s words on immigration continued outside the saturday night live studio last night : the presidential candidate hosted saturday night live this week , turning his controversial appearance into both a punchline and a reality.much like on the campaign trail , the republican frontrunner didn t hold back during his monologue , diving right into jokes about rosie o donnell , protesters angry about his hosting the show and even fielding an interruption from larry david : larry david could n't miss this opportunity .
