The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee hearing with Attorney General Jeff Sessions took place today in what turned out to be quite the drama show.
An obviously nervous and intimidated Jeff Sessions skirted around a lot of tough questions asked by Senators about Trump and Russia.
Kamala Harris (D-CA) was interrupted multiple times by Sessions and a Republican senator.
Harris, a former hard-hitting prosecutor, tore into Sessions on Twitter for being so scared to answer her simple questions.It was a simple question.
Can Sessions point to the policy, in writing, that allows him to not answer a whole host of our questions today.
Kamala Harris (@KamalaHarris) June 13, 2017It's unacceptable that Sessions the top law enforcement official in the country cannot name his legal basis for evading questions.

Did you refresh your memory with any written documents?
