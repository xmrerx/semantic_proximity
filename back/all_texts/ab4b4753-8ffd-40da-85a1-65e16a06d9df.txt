Newly released financial disclosures reveal Bill Clinton received $16.46 million in payments from a George Soros-backed for-profit education company, as Hillary Clinton s State Department funneled tens of millions of dollars to a group run by the company s chairman.With $4 billion in annual revenue, Laureate Education is America s largest for-profit college company.
From 2010 until just days before the 2015 release of Clinton Cash, Bill Clinton served as Laureate s honorary chancellor.
When the Clinton campaign team obtained a copy of the book and its Clinton-Laureate connection revelation, Bill Clinton abruptly resigned.Laureate s chairman and longtime Clinton crony, Douglas Becker, is also the chairman of a nonprofit sister organization called the International Youth Foundation (IYF).
Indeed, IYF s offices are less than a mile from Laureate s in Baltimore.
Shortly after Laureate made Bill Clinton its honorary chancellor in April 2010, Hillary Clinton made Laureate part of her State Department Global Partnership.
IYF received USAID funds before Hillary s tenure at the State Dept.
But the grants the group received exploded after Bill Clinton was put on the Laureate payroll.According to a Bloomberg analysis of the Clinton Cash revelation: In 2009, the year before Bill Clinton joined Laureate, the nonprofit received 11 grants worth $9 million from the State Department or the affiliated USAID.
In 2010, the group received 14 grants worth $15.1 million.
In 2011, 13 grants added up to $14.6 million.
The following year, those numbers jumped: IYF received 21 grants worth $25.5 million, including a direct grant from the State Department.
