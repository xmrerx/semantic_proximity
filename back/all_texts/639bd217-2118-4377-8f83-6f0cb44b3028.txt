WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump emerged from a meeting with the CEOs of Boeing and Lockheed Martin on Wednesday and said he was working to lower costs on planes sold to the government, including a new Air Force One fleet and the F-35 fighter jet.
“Trying to get the costs down, costs.
Primarily the F-35, we’re trying to get the cost down.
It’s a program that’s very very expensive,” Trump told reporters after meeting with the aerospace executives and military advisers.
