rome ( reuters ) - sicilian police on wednesday sought the arrest of nine people , including a suspected mobster , for running a libyan fuel-smuggling ring in which at least 30 million euros ( $ 35 million ) of diesel was sold in gas stations in italy and europe .
a libyan , nicknamed the boss , used small boats to steal fuel from a refinery in zawiya , a port city west of tripoli , a statement from the finance police said .
the fuel , stolen from libya s national oil corporation ( noc ) , was then transferred to a larger ship off the coast of malta and brought to italy .
police from the sicilian city of catania documented in detail 30 voyages in which more than 80 million kilos of diesel fuel was imported , the statement said .
for the first time , the catania court authorized the use of technology capable of listening in on satellite phone calls during the investigation , police said .
six of the nine have been arrested and an international arrest warrant has been issued for the other three , who are abroad .
one of the men arrested , nicola romeo , has been accused of being a member of the santapaola clan of the sicilian mafia , while the libyan , fahmi mousa saleem ben khalifa , is already in custody in libya on accusations of fuel smuggling .
another italian man headed a seemingly legitimate company used to distribute the stolen fuel in gas stations in italy , france and spain , police said .
the italian company offered its diesel to distributors for up to 60 percent less than market prices .
though the quality of the diesel , which was meant for ships engines , was of a lower standard than that used by vehicles in italy , it was sold at the same price .
