On Thursday morning, Donald Trump did the unthinkable: he canceled an interview with one of his biggest cheerleaders, Sean Hannity.
Trump had been scheduled to appear on the Fox host s show Thursday night, but a spokeswoman for the network says The Donald will not be showing up.This announcement comes in the wake of Pussygate Trump s mid-90 s admission that he loves that he can get away with grabbing women by the pussy because he s rich as well as revelations that he barged into dressing rooms to creep on models (some as young as 15 years old), his admission that he thought Paris Hilton was hot when she was 12, audio of him hitting on a 10-year-old surfacing, and his upcoming child rape case.Apparently Mr. Trump doesn t think even Sean Hannity a joke of a man who has done nothing but pitch underhand to Trump the entire election season can find kid gloves to fit this situation.Things are not looking good for Trump lately, with his poll numbers in a nosedive since everyone learned about his special handshake.
While it is gratifying to see the Republican Party and even some of Trump s formerly vocal supporters running away from him, it is frightening that it is only happening now.
The GOP is fine with Islamophobia, racism, his open courting of white supremacists, his constant attack on women because of their looks and weight, his desire to build a wall to keep brown people out of the country, Muslim concentration camps, his incessant remarks about banging his daughter, the child rape allegations, and his love of well-done steaks.
At one point it seemed like Trump was right when he said he could shoot someone and not lose a single supporter.Apparently, groping was the line.Featured image via Getty Images/Joe Raedle
