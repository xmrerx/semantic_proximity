The relationship between the United States and China is an extremely delicate one.
They are the world s second-largest power, right behind ourselves.
Therefore, it is important not to offend them or to antagonize their leadership.
However, that is just what our soon to be Tweeter-in-Chief is spending his Sunday evening doing.After the insanity of taking a phone call from the Taiwanese President something no American president or president-elect has done since 1979 Trump decided to take to Twitter to criticize China over their rebuking of the call in violation of the One China policy most developed world powers have adhered to for decades.
Trump ranted:This is likely in response to the fact that China has decided to level a formal complaint regarding Trump s behavior with the United States government.
Of course, unable to be challenged or criticized for any reason, Trump is lashing out via Twitter in his usual reckless and unfiltered way.
Once again, Trump proves that his temperament doesn t even allow him to run a Twitter account responsibly, much less a nation, and yet here we are.
