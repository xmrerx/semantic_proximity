DANANG, Vietnam (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump landed in Vietnam on Friday for a summit of Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) nations, the fourth leg of his 12-day Asia trip.
The White House has said Trump will set out a U.S. vision for a free and open Indo-Pacific region in a speech in the beach resort of Danang.
Trump arrived from China, where he praised Chinese leader Xi Jinping as highly respected and Chinese media had declared the visit had set a new blueprint for handling U.S.-China relations and differences.
