washington ( reuters ) - a compromise republican tax bill released late friday does not eliminate a $ 7,500 electric vehicle tax credit as republicans in the u.s. house of representatives had previously proposed .
the measure follows the lead of the senate version approved last month that did not eliminate the credit .
killing the credit could have hurt automakers like general motors co ( gm.n ) , volkswagen ag ( vowg_p.de ) , tesla inc ( tsla.o ) and nissan motor co ( 7201.t ) .
consumers under current law are eligible for a $ 7,500 tax credit to defray the cost of plug-in electric vehicles .
the electric vehicle tax credit starts to phase out after a manufacturer sells 200,000 plug-in vehicles .
after an automaker hits that point , the $ 7,500 tax credit is still available for at least three more months before phasing out .
consumers are currently allowed to take the credit on vehicles until the manufacturer hits 200,000 plug-in vehicles sold .
electric vehicles have expensive batteries that make them pricier than gasoline-powered vehicles .
the electric drive transportation association said in a statement late friday it was pleased the credit would remain in law .
“ the credit supports innovation and job creation while helping drivers access advanced vehicle technology , ” the group said .
more than 50 automakers and other companies and groups released a letter earlier this week urging congress to retain the credit , including ford motor co ( f.n ) , bmw ag ( bmwg.de ) , gm , uber technologies inc. former president barack obama repeatedly proposed hiking the tax credit for electric vehicles to $ 10,000 and converting it to a point-of-sale rebate , but congress did not approve the measure .
automakers face mandates from california and a dozen other states to produce a rising number of zero-emission vehicles and have said the credits are essential to meeting requirements .
