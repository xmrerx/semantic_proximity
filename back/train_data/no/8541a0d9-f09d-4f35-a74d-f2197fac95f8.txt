we re thinking trump shouldn t give the ratings to megyn kelly .
here is our suggestion in a tweet to donald : @ realdonaldtrump if you agree to interview w/ @ megynkelly give huge ratings to someone you do n't offend like @ seanhannity or @ oreillyfactor 100 % fed up !
( @ 100percfedup ) august 10 , 2015donald trump and the fox news channel are in talks about trump possibly appearing on fox on monday night , according to a source with knowledge of the talks.trump has been lambasting fox for days , ever since he was challenged in last week s gop debate.it is highly unlikely trump would appear at 9 p.m. with host megyn kelly , the source said , and that s probably an understatement .
trump has repeatedly and personally insulted kelly in recent days .
it amazes me that other networks seem to treat me so much better than @ foxnews .
i brought them the biggest ratings in history , & i get zip !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) august 9 , 2015but talks are underway about a trump interview with another prime time host , like sean hannity , the source said , adding that nothing had been confirmed as of monday morning.in the meantime , fox has dramatically ratcheted down its coverage of trump .
it hasn t covered trump s criticisms of kelly and the two other debate moderators , chris wallace and bret baier.via : free republic
