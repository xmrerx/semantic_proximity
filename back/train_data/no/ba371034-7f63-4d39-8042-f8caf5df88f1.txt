washington ( reuters ) - president barack obama , taking on republican presidential candidates for stirring up anxiety among americans , told leaders at washington ’ s national prayer breakfast on thursday that faith could conquer fear brought on by war , technology , and economic troubles .
“ it is a primal emotion , fear , one that we all experience .
and it can be contagious , spreading through societies , and through nations , ” obama said .
“ for me , and i know for so many of you , faith is the great cure for fear .
jesus is a good cure for fear .
god gives believers the power , the love , the sound mind required to conquer any fear .
and what more important moment for that faith than right now ? ” he said .
obama ’ s remarks came a day after his first visit to a u.s. mosque , where he sought to allay fears of americans accustomed to pop-culture portrayals of muslims as terrorists and to reassure muslim american youth about their identity .
republican presidential front-runner donald trump has called for a temporary ban on muslims entering the united states .
obama , a christian , said his faith had helped him deal with the challenges of being president and was bolstering him as his children grew up and prepared for adulthood .
“ it helps me deal with the common , everyday fears that we all share .
the main one i ’ m feeling right now is that our children grow up too fast .
they ’ re leaving ! ” he said to laughter .
the president said he had drawn on his faith when comforting the parents of children killed by gun violence , a subtle reference to his failed effort to sharpen u.s. gun control laws .
he said that people of faith had helped take in syrian refugees , a subtle jab at republicans who oppose allowing them into the country .
