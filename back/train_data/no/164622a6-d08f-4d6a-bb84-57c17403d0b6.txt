after watching this video , and seeing a side of trump the media rarely shows us , it s easy to understand why all of donald s kids think he s such a great dad a cute little boy in the audience asked trump a question at his manassas , virginia rally on dec. 2 , 2015 .
trump thought it was such a great question , he asked the boy to come up on the stage and ask the question again in front of the mic .
the boy wanted to know what materials trump would use to build the wall .
it wasn t his answer trump gave the young boy that revealed the genuine love trump has for his fellow american , it was the spontaneous kiss he gave the little boy on the back of his head for asking such a great question.the exchange went like this : the young boy asks trump a question that may be hard for the audience to hear , so trump asks boy to come up on stage : trump : c mon , c mob up here .
this is such a great question.boy : what are the ( boy pauses as he realizes he s in front of thousands of supporters ) hello .
trump gives him a kiss on the back of his head , almost as if he was proud of him for asking such a great question .
what are the walls going to be made of ?
trump : that might be the best question i get today .
i ll tell you what it s going to be made of .
it s going to be made of hardened concrete and it s going to be made out of rebar and steel ( audience applauds ) .
i mean , that s what i do .
did you ever seen the walls they build now , they re this high ( gestures to indicate low wall ) and they drive trucks over them right ?
they build a ramp and they take trucks over them with drugs , and we get the drugs and they get the cash .
not good watch here at the 36 second mark for the sweet , spontaneous kiss : h/t down trend
