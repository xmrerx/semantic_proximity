brasilia ( reuters ) - brazil s top prosecutor on tuesday charged former presidents luis inacio lula da silva and dilma rousseff along with fellow workers party members with forming a criminal organization , the latest accusations in brazil s sprawling corruption scandal .
the prosecutor , rodrigo janot , alleged that eight members of the workers party , including lula and rousseff , committed a series of crimes involving state-owned oil firm petrobras such as cartel formation , corruption and money laundering .
they were the first criminal charges to be leveled against rousseff , who was impeached in 2016 for breaking budgetary laws .
the 230-page document filed with the supreme court accused lula of heading the organization .
lula s lawyer said the law was being misused to persecute the former president .
the workers party said in a statement that the charges were baseless and being used to divert attention from other investigations , including one into a former federal prosecutor , referring to a case janot announced on monday .
a representative for rousseff said the prosecutor s office had offered no evidence of the crimes and called on the supreme court to guarantee the right to defend against them .
lula , who is still brazil s most popular politician , is appealing a corruption conviction that would bar him from running for president in 2018 .
he faces four other corruption trials .
the charges stem from the operation car wash investigation that uncovered a cartel of companies paying bribes to officials to secure petrobras contracts , revelations that have spawned a host of investigations that has shaken brazil s political system and economy .
