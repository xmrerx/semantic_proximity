seoul ( reuters ) - a north korean soldier defected to the south on monday after being shot and wounded by the north korean military , south korea said .
the soldier was found on the south side of the border village of panmunjom , about 50 meters south of the military demarcation line , wounded in his shoulder and elbow , according to a south korean defense ministry official .
he defected from a north korean guard post nearby and was being treated in hospital .
the defector was urgently transferred to hospital in a helicopter of the united nations command , and there was no exchange of fire with our side , the ministry official told reuters .
since it was an area exposed to the north , we had to crawl toward there to get him out , the official added .
there was no immediate comment on the incident from north korea .
while on average more than 1,000 north koreans defect to south korea every year , most travel via china and it is unusual for a north korean to cross the land border dividing the two koreas , which have been in a technical state of war since their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce , not a peace treaty .
the last such crossing was in june .
the south korean ministry official said the soldier s condition and military rank remained to be verified .
the defection comes amid tension between the two koreas , and between the united states and the north .
north korea has this year been boosting its nuclear and missile capacity with a series of tests as it faces off with u.s. president donald trump who has vowed to stop it from being able to hit the mainland united states with a nuclear weapon .
north korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear bomb test on sept. 3 , but has not launched any missiles since firing one over japan on sept. 15 , the longest such lull this year .
