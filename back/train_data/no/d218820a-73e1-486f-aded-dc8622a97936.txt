your daily dose of insanity a san francisco middle school withheld the results of a student council election because the principal was concerned about the lack of diversity among the winners of the top four spots .
eighty percent of the children who attend everett middle school in the mission district are students of color and lena van haren was alarmed no latino or black candidates were chosen for the top council spots.only white , asian and mixed-race students , who are in the minority at everett , were elected to the top four spots during the october 9 election , which prompted van haren to delay releasing the results.van haren , 36 , informed parents about the delay via email and said the community had to create a council that is truly representative of all voices at everett , the san francisco chronicle reported.she also scheduled a meeting with all the student candidates to discuss ways to make the results more representative of the student body and brought up the possibility of adding new council positions , according to ktvu.the principal said : i m very hopeful this can be a learning experience and actually be something that embodied our vision which is to help students make positive change .
we re not nullifying the election , we re not cancelling the election and we re not saying this didn t count .
