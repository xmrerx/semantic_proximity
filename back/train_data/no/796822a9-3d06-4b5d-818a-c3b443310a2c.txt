london ( reuters ) - british lawmakers on tuesday voted in favor of the government s proposed timetable for debating legislation designed to sever political , financial and legal ties with the european union .
many had complained that the eight days set out by the government for line-by-line scrutiny of the eu withdrawal bill was not long enough for such an important piece of legislation .
but lawmakers voted by 318 to 301 to support the so-called program motion , which sets out the timetable for the remaining stages of the bill s progress through parliament s lower house of commons .
