kiev ( reuters ) - the ukrainian parliament voted on thursday to withdraw a law on the creation of an anti-corruption court , paving the way for the submission of a new law more in line with demands from backers , including the international monetary fund .
slow progress establishing an independent court to deal with corruption cases has been one of the main obstacles to the disbursement of loans under a $ 17.5 billion aid-for-reforms program from the fund .
president petro poroshenko has promised to submit a draft law to set up such a court , but first parliament needed to vote to withdraw a similar bill that did not meet recommendations by a leading european rights watchdog .
the motion was backed by 235 lawmakers , slightly more than the 226 required to pass .
a government source told reuters the president would submit the new law to parliament by the end of this week .
the imf and ukraine s other foreign backers have repeatedly called for ukraine to improve efforts to root out graft .
they see an anti-corruption court as an essential tool for eliminating the power of vested interests .
mp mustafa nayyem criticized the president for the delays .
it took the presidential administration a whole year to develop this document , he said in a post on facebook .
they ( the authorities ) tried to convince the world that we have no use for it ( a court ) .
as a result of public accusations from foreign partners and the noise of street protests , they ve backed down , he said .
earlier in december , poroshenko emphasized his commitment to reform , responding to accusations that the ukrainian authorities were deliberately sabotaging the anti-corruption fight .
establishing the court , sticking to gas price commitments and implementing sustainable pension reform are the key conditions ukraine must meet to qualify for the next loan tranche of around $ 2 billion from the imf .
