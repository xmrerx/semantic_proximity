During a campaign event at Iowa s Wesleyan University, Bernie Sanders spoke to the audience about how Walmart and other large corporations benefit from a rigged economy.
Sanders begins by saying that Walmart is very appreciative of all the support they receive from taxpayers: Just to give you an example of what a rigged economy is all about.
I mentioned the Walton family the wealthiest family in the world being very appreciative that you are supporting them.
They re very happy about that.
And they asked me to send you their thanks.
Sanders continues, saying: They re only worth 60 of 70 billion dollars and they do appreciate you paying taxes to help them subsidize their workers.
This is how we re going to pay to put 13 million Americans back to work rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure.
There has been a lot of criticism of Sanders that says that he does not have a plan to pay for the programs he is proposing.
That is absolute nonsense.
Here is a comprehensive funding plan for every policy Sanders has proposed.And to the right-wingers who shout the obnoxiously classist claim that people only support Sanders because he wants to give them free stuff, that s actually the opposite of what Sanders wants.
What he wants is for corporations to stop getting free stuff from tax payers.
As Sanders points out in the speech: Three major profitable corporations not only pay nothing in federal income taxes, they actually got a rebate from the IRS.
Three major corporations made over $100 billion in profit, paid nothing in taxes, and in fact, got a rebate from the I.R.S.
Right now we have a rigged economy where there is socialism for the rich, and unregulated capitalism for the rest.Sanders concludes his speech, saying that closing these loopholes will help fund one of his most inspiring programs.
That s how were going to pay to rebuild our infrastructure and put millions of people back to work.
