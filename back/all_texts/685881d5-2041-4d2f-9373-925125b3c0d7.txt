Some people in life still haven t grasped the fact that all people should be treated equally.
Many still feel it is well within their rights to be discriminatory based upon personal beliefs.
Such is the case with Deepika Avanti who lists herself as a Holistic Therapist and Psychic Healer.
Avanti, along with being a psychic healer, is also a property owner in Boulder, Colorado who leases out her property to renters.
However, when one couple who sought to rent her property, Avanti flat-out rejected them.
Why?
Because she didn t want the uniqueness of the couple to harm her position within her community.
What makes this couple so unique?
They are a lesbian couple, and one of the women is transgender.Rachel and Tonya Smith, alongside their adorable child, are seeking legal action against Avanti with the help of Lambda Legal.
According to the legal documents: Defendant suggested that the Smith family look for housing in a larger town where the community would better accept them and intimated that she did not see them as a legitimate familial unit who could live together on her property.
Rachel Smith said: We just thought it was a little bit ridiculous, particularly given that Boulder is known for being a more liberal, open-minded area.
Honestly, if this was going to happen in Colorado, I would expect it maybe in Colorado Springs, but not so much out of Boulder, and especially not in Gold Hill.
I thought it was more accepting.
Good on these women for not backing down in the face of discrimination.
The only way some of these bigots are going to realize they are, in fact, bigots, is by throwing their bigotry back in their bigoted faces.
You d think this woman, being a psychic and all, would ve seen this lawsuit coming, but apparently she s as good of psychic as she is a landlord.
