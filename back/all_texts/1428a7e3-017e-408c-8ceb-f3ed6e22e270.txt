WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Wednesday said he was weighing options to help deal with Puerto Ricoâ€™s fiscal crisis but that any move by Congress to help the territorial island cannot cost U.S. taxpayers any money.
McConnell, whose comments follow a letter sent earlier by Senate Democrats and independents, did not commit to any legislative action.
