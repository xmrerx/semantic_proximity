Imagine if you will that you are one of the dullards who frequents Donald Trump rallies.
Imagine that Donald Trump s rhetoric is actually exciting enough for you to become energized when he hits the stage.
Now imagine that because you are of the low-information variety American voter, your favorite part of the show is the racism.You would be just like young Joseph Pryor, who was just kicked off of the US Marines delayed enlistment program, meaning he will not EVER be a United States Marine, because of the antics he pulled in connection with the assault of a black woman at a recent Trump rally in Kentucky.Louisville police added to the mess the Trump supporters got themselves into by announcing they re looking at filing criminal charges against several people.
There has been some speculation that Trump himself may be facing charges as a ringleader, but that is unconfirmed at this time.
What we do know is that a woman was treated with the utmost of disrespect, was physically and verbally assaulted and quite possibly had her civil rights violated for no reason other than the color of her skin.It s a common scene at these things.
Protesters stand as quietly as they can and are eventually discovered and removed with extreme prejudice.
Trump security personnel, local police and tens of thousands of unruly thugs in red hats solves those issues while Trump stands on stage scanning for the next people to have booted out.
It s nothing but a reality TV hook.Now this poor young man, whose racism may have just been a side-effect of being raised by idiots and who may have had hope with just a few more IQ points, will tell the story of how he sacrificed his military service for Donald Trump.
His friends will toast him with Natural Ice until the day he dies of liver failure.
He ll be buried with full honors by his World Of Warcraft buddies in a casket draped with the Gadsden Flag In an unsanmctioned cemetery slated to be paved for the new Walmart Supercenter parking lot.This guy isn t the first person to go full stupid for Donald Trump and lose big and he certainly won t be the last.Featured image from New York Daily News
