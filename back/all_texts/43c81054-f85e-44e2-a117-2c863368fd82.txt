Donald Trump is so funny!
He was speaking at a National Association of Home Builders and made these remarks about Hillary s health: She s voted for tax increases, and by the way, she s proposing a big one today in her speech, her Teleprompter speech.
Her speeches are so short though.
They don t last long.
They re like ten minutes and lets get out of here.
Go back home and go to sleep.
Three days later she gets up and does another one and goes back home and goes to sleep.
