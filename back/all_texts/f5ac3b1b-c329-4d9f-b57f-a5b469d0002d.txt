If this isn t white guilt on steroids and indoctrination, we don t know what is!
Teachers need to teach history and not use it as a way to indoctrinate kids.
Playing slave ship captain and slave is extreme and has been going on for some time at this Cerritos, California high school sickening!Whitney High School junior Timothy Reyes had his hands taped together and was a part of a slave ship reenactment when he was an 8th grader on the Cerritos campus.SO THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR AT LEAST THREE YEARS!A mother complained recently after getting an email from her son s teacher explaining the unique classroom activity, which was to be a surprise.
Staff would act as slave ship captains, the email described, and the children slaves.After lining the kids up, the note said, they d use masking tape to tie their wrists together, make them lay on the ground, and in a dark room have them watch a clip from the film Roots.
Our education system has been so destructive to young minds with all of the indoctrination into radical liberal thinking.
Nothing could be worse than having liberals take control of education.THE PHOTO ABOVE IS FROM CRAZY LIFELINE EXHIBITION:THIS IS MORE OF THE SAME RIDICULOUS I M SORRY WHITE GUILT TRIP The first Lifeline Expedition journey was the Jubilee 2000 Lifeline Walk in England.
During the course of that journey, it became evident that the major reconciliation issue between Europe and Africa, was that of the legacy of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade.In 2002, a team of 20 from the three corners of the former slavetriangle, Europe, West Africa and the Caribean, travelled through France.
For the first time the slave coffle was used, with white Europeans and Americans walking in replica yokes and chains as a symbolic sign of apology for the slave trade.In 2003, the Lifeline Expedition visited Spain and Portugal and another new feature was added: copies of the apology statement for the slave trade, issued at the last Liverpool City council meeting of 1999, were delivered to city halls.Other ports of call have include the USA, the Caribbean, and West Africa.Via: CBS Local
