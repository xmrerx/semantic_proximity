Well, no one will ever call Donald Trump the speller-in-chief, especially after this typo.Just a day after trashing the American public education system in his divisive and negative inaugural address, Trump took to Twitter once again on Saturday to pat himself on the back and suck up to his supporters.
There was just one problem: He misspelled a word that even a fourth grader can spell.Trump quickly deleted it, but it was saved in the name of posterity via screenshot.Trump then posted his corrected version.I am honored to serve you, the great American People, as your 45th President of the United States!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 21, 2017The error might be more understandable if the e and the o were next to each other on the keyboard, but they are nowhere near each other.Twitter, of course, made sure that Trump was properly humiliated.

You just deleted (destroyed) your tweet (federal record).
EMAILS EMAILS EMAILS!!!
david nuzzy nussbaum (@theNuzzy) January 21, 2017Indeed, Trump just deleted a tweet that he made as the president, which could be a violation of the Presidential Records Act.
Misspelled or not, deleting messages is something that he criticized Hillary Clinton for doing throughout his campaign.
Now he is doing it himself, only he s in an office higher than Secretary of State.Seriously, Trump is the f*cking president now, but he apparently still doesn t proofread his tweets before posting them.
That s pretty pathetic, and a bad example for our kids to boot.
And considering his attacks on our education system and Hillary Clinton, Trump is only demonstrating once again that he is a hypocrite.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images
