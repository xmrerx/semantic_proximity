The supporters of President-elect Donald Trump are very much like him they live in their own little world, completely unaware of how history and the country has progressed.
Thanks to a new poll that was recently revealed on MSNBC s The Rachel Maddow Show yesterday, we re able to see just how far removed Trump supporters are from reality.According to a recent Public Policy Polling (PPP) poll, Trump and his supports rarely have any grasp or knowledge of basic facts that are only a Google search away and they don t really care about becoming informed.
Maddow highlighted just how off Trump supporters were regarding some of the biggest issues our country has been faced with, and the findings were truly pathetic.It turns out, almost 40 percent of Trump supports truly think that President Barack Obama has caused the stock market to go down.
The truth is, the stock market has DOUBLED during Obama s time in the White House:TwitterAnother thing that Trump and his rabid fans like to whine about is the unemployment rate.
Despite numerous reports coming out about how Obama has done wonders for the unemployment rate, 67 percent of Trump lovers are saying it has increased.
The truth is that in January 2009, the unemployment rate was 7.8 percent and thanks to Obama, it is now 4.6 percent as of last month.TwitterTrump voters are also very uninformed about Trump s rival, Hillary Clinton and we can thank Trump himself for that.
Clinton s 2.7 million lead over Trump in the popular vote has been broadcast heavily and yet 40 percent of Trump fans are in complete denial and think she lost!
Even worse 60 percent think millions of illegal voters contributed to Clinton s win (another rumor that Trump is solely responsible for).TwitterThis is truly depressing, and shows just how much trouble America is in when Trump begins his term and his clueless followers are given even more reason to ignore facts.
These polls show just how gullible Trump voters are and how easily they eat up Trump s weird conspiracy theories and fear-driven rhetoric.
They ll believe just about anything he says, and now they re just as far removed from reality as he is.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images
