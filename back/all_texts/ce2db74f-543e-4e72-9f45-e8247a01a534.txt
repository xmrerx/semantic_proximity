For the past week since Trump struck one of his alleged solid gold deals to keep Carrier from moving to Mexico, we ve seen what is probably the most pathetic victory lap from a president-elect in U.S. history.
Between lying through his teeth about what the deal entailed, then unleashing multiple Twitter rants targeting Carrier s union president when he was called out on it, his behavior has not been what most would consider presidential, to say the least!Thursday night, during his segment A Closer Look, Seth Meyers took the opportunity to dig deep into the deceptive Carrier deal and discovered that hardly any of what Trump is bragging about adds up.
So Trump first claimed he would stop Carrier from moving jobs to Mexico, then claimed he was saving over 1,100 jobs and then it turned out he was saving only 730 which The Washington Post reports is just 37 percent of the total who were due to leave the state.
Meyers points out that while saving those 730 jobs is likely a big relief to the families of those workers, it isn t nearly good enough compared to what was promised and to add to that, the hypocrisy from the right regarding this so-called deal is astounding!
Despite its many flaws, there s no denying the deal was politically popular.
But for Republicans, what s so surprising about this new policy of strong-arming companies into making business decisions is that the GOP has spent eight years calling Obama a socialist for his economic policies.
Remember how they reacted to the auto bailout, which saved as many as 1.5 million jobs They accused him of coercion and hijacking capitalism.
Well, as you might have guessed, they see the Carrier deal a little differently.
