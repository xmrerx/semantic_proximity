wow !
not until people like brett hume tweeted out bashing cnn for their fake news did cnn finally retract a lie about trump.cnn has finally corrected a tuesday report after the release of former fbi director james comey s opening statement for his thursday testimony in front of the senate intelligence committee contradicted the reports sources.the cnn report said comey was expected to dispute president trump s claims that comey said he was not under investigation on multiple occasions.the report , titled comey expected to refute trump , was based on unnamed sources and said comey s conversations with the president were much more nuanced , and that trump drew the wrong conclusion.the story was complied by four cnn journalists , including gloria borger , eric lichtblau , jake tapper and brian rokus.borger reiterated the reports claims in an appearance on cnn tuesday .
comey is going to dispute the president on this point if he s asked about it by senators , and we have to assume that he will be , said borger , the network s chief political analyst .
he will say he never assured donald trump that he was not under investigation , that that would have been improper for him to do so .
comey s opening statement did , however , mention asserting that trump was not under investigation , however the statement failed to specify whether trump was not under criminal investigation , but only said there was no counter-intelligence investigation on the president.read more : the hill
