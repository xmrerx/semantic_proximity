Last night, The New York Times ran a story that s a potential bombshell for poor, put-upon Donald Trump he declared a $916 million loss on his taxes in 1995, which means he potentially didn t pay any income tax for the following 18 years.
Today, everyone is buzzing about it on all the TV shows, and Chris Christie takes the cake for most implausible spin to make Trump look good for this.While speaking to Fox host Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday, Christie called this a good story for Trump because it not only highlights all the flaws in the tax code, but it also shows Trump to be the extremely intelligent, honest, dependable, law and order candidate he claims he is.Wallace came back, absolutely stunned by that, and said: Wait, wait wait you re saying it s a good story for Donald Trump that he failed to pay any federal income taxes first of all, that he took a billion-dollar loss and that he failed to pay any federal income taxes for years.
That s a good story?
Of course it is, Christie insists.
There s nothing illegal about what Trump did.
He also has a fiduciary duty to his shareholders to pay as little tax as possible, so obviously it s okay.
Besides, we don t know that Trump didn t pay any income taxes for that long (although knowing him, he really didn t).Watch Wallace s sheer astonishment below:There s a reason that this isn t okay, even though it s legal, and it s because Trump not only brags incessantly about paying as little tax as possible, but he also said that doing so makes him smart.
Legal and smart do not mean right, and for a presidential candidate who constantly gripes about our veterans not getting cared for, and our infrastructure crumbling, he cannot go around bragging about how he s paid little to no income tax.Especially when things like veterans benefits and infrastructure have been crumbling because the little guy s been shouldering a lot of the tax burden in this country, while the wealthy and corporations get away with paying far less than their fair share.
Trump s essentially bragging that he s gotten around, and gotten away with, something the rest of us do faithfully every year, whether we like it or not.All this actually does is show Trump for the selfish, narcissistic hypocrite he is.
Chris Christie is a brown-nosed bootkisser, though, and he seems to be learning spin from the worst elements at places like Breitbart and Fox News.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
