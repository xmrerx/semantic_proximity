Donald Trump is totally going to lose his sh*t when he sees this.As we all know, Trump is insecure about the size of his hands and he has a major problem with women mocking him.So when Melissa McCarthy played Sean Spicer on Saturday Night Live last week it not only lite the Internet on fire, the skit enraged Trump because Spicer was played by a woman, which Trump believes makes Spicer look weak.
You know, because Trump doesn t consider women strong, independent, and equal to men.Well, Late Show host Stephen Colbert took Trump s gripe and ran with it on Friday night.
Evidently, he was not laughing because apparently, Trump thought a woman playing a man makes Spicer look weak, Colbert began.
First of all, I have met Melissa McCarthy and she could kick the ass of every man in that administration.
And then Colbert unveiled the greatest trolling of Trump seen yet.
If the president thinks a woman portraying Sean Spicer makes him look weak, then he s really not going to like this picture we made of a little girl pretending to be Donald Trump.
And he s especially not going to like it when you retweet it at him with the hashtag #LargerHands.
Here s the video via Twitter.Tonight!
We don t think @realDonaldTrump is going to like this very much.

Katrien (@Kat7115) February 11, 2017Of course, Trump supporters are whining and accusing Colbert of bullying their hero, conveniently ignoring that comedians poked fun at President Obama for eight years.
The only difference is that President Obama could take a joke while Trump is a joke.Featured image via screenshot
