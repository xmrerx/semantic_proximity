Dominican newspaper El Nacional had a bit of fun with our comically inept President* when they accidentally used a photo of Trump s arch-nemesis Alec Baldwin instead of our orange-skinned wannabe dictator in a recent story.The story was regarding Trump s upcoming meeting with war criminal Benjamin Netanyahu following the United States decision to block a Palestinian official from a U.N. appointment for fear it would hurt Bibi s precious little feelings.
The United States was disappointed to see a letter indicating the intention to appoint the former Palestinian Authority prime minister to lead the UN Mission in Libya, unqualified mess of a human being and U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley said.
For too long the U.N. has been unfairly biased in favor of the Palestinian Authority to the detriment of our allies in Israel.
This, of course, is sure to make Netanyahu happy prior to the meeting, where he and Trump are expected to discuss moving the U.S. embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.The paper posted what appears to be a tongue-in-cheek photo correction, claiming that they were sent the photo by the Associated Press.It is unclear if this was an honest mistake or an alt-mistake, but one thing is for certain Trump is not going to be happy when he sees this.Featured image via screengrab
