We re all now living with the horrifying reality that on January 20, 2017, Donald Trump will be the next president of the United States.
While there is nothing we can do about that, what we CAN do is make our collective displeasure with Trump and all he stands for heard loud and clear: By voting with our wallets.An anti-Trump group, Democratic Coalition Against Trump, has put out an app for both Apple and Android devices that keeps a handy running list not just of brands that belong to Trump and his family, but also of businesses that support the Trump brand, as well as those who helped this orange buffoon get elected.
The group says of the app, via Executive Director Nate Lemur: This app is a first step in our larger Boycott Trump campaign, which will feature a unified grassroots movement centered on holding companies and individuals that help Trump in any way accountable,The campaign is all about empowerment By doing so we aim to give people a safe and productive way to voice their disapproval of Trump.
We ve accepted Trump won the election but that doesn t mean we have to accept everything he stands for.
That s not all, either.
The group also has drawn up a list of organizations that will be supporting groups that Trump and his rag tag team of bigots are sure to attack during the next four years.
You can download the Apple version of the app here, and the Android version here.Also, remember to follow feeds of progressive organizations on Twitter to keep up with the latest ways to join the resistance against Trump s authoritarian plans.
America is counting on all of us to speak truth to power, and to not normalize this unthinkable reality.
If we all band together, we just might survive the next four years.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
