shanghai ( reuters ) - china s largely rubber stamp parliament has expelled disgraced senior politician sun zhengcai , once considered a contender for top leadership , state media said on saturday , paving the way for formal criminal charges to be laid against him .
the expulsion removes sun s immunity from prosecution as a member of parliament .
the announcement , carried by the official xinhua news agency , gave no other details .
sun was abruptly removed from his post as chongqing party chief in july and replaced by chen miner , who is close to president xi jinping .
later that month , he was put under investigation and in september , the party announced he would be prosecuted for corruption .
sun was accused of leaking secrets , bribery and abusing his power .
chongqing is perhaps best known outside china for its association with bo xilai , its disgraced former party boss .
he , too , was once a contender for top leadership .
he was jailed for life in 2013 after a dramatic corruption scandal .
it has not been possible to reach sun or a representative for comment since he was put under investigation .
it s unclear if he has been allowed to retain a lawyer .
