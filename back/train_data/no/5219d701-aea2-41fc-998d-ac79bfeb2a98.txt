london ( reuters ) - around half of britons believe u.s. president donald trump ’ s planned uk state visit should go ahead , even though a similar number would not like to see his controversial migrant ban implemented in britain , according to a poll on wednesday .
trump ’ s executive order to temporarily ban refugees entering the united states and limit migration from seven muslim-majority countries has drawn widespread protest in britain , and nearly 1.8 million people have signed a petition to stop his state visit , planned for later this year .
but the yougov poll found 49 percent of britons believe the state visit should go ahead and that only 36 percent want it to be canceled .
a state visit would involve lavish displays of royal pageantry and a banquet hosted by queen elizabeth .
the invitation was conveyed by prime minister theresa may when she visited washington last week , just hours before the travel ban was introduced .
britons would not like to see a similar migrant ban introduced in the uk , however , with 32 percent saying they would feel “ appalled ” by such a move and 17 percent “ disappointed ” .
only 15 percent were “ delighted ” by the prospect of similar immigration restrictions in britain , while 13 percent said they would be “ pleased ” .
the petition to stop the visit will be debated in the british parliament on feb. 20 , although such debates are usually symbolic .
may has stood by the decision to invite trump .
the poll was conducted between jan. 30-31 .
in all , 1,705 people were asked their views on the state visit and 6,926 were asked about any immigration ban in britain .
