liberals would like everyone to believe that muslims who immigrate from the middle east to the west are interested in becoming part of the communities where they live .
nothing could be further from the truth .
the attack on an innocent woman walking her dogs by a young muslim woman , who considered her dogs to be unclean , reminds us of how diametrically opposed our cultures truly are , and how things will never be the same again for these welcoming communities.a middle aged woman had to be hospitalised in vienna following a brutal beating in broad daylight by a veiled somali asylum seeker offended by her pet dogs.the victim , named only as ingrid t. , described how she was talking with neighbours at the gate of her garden , accompanied by dogs her deaf , almost-blind , three-legged collie mix sitting peacefully alongside while 10-month-old poco meandered along an alleyway towards her parents house when she saw a pretty , veiled woman approaching slowly .
i knew some people from these countries do not like dogs , so i went to poco and wanted to pull him back , the 54-year-old told krone from her hospital bed in the austrian capital.the 18-year-old somali asserted , the animals are unclean , ingrid recalled , stating that her attacker then grabbed me , spun me around and scratched me until both women fell to the floor.it took the efforts of three men to manage to pull the asylum seeker away from the austrian dog owner , who told krone the assault left her unable to feel her legs.staff at wilhelminen hospital had to operate twice on ingrid who her knee smashed in the attack required an artificial knee to be surgically implanted.the vienna native told krone she believed her ordeal came about as a result of clashing cultures , revealing that she had heard the somali s husband say : we don t want dogs they are filthy !
with her recovery expected to take a long time , and the migrant attacker lacking any type of liability insurance , ingrid s lawyer said it is unclear who will pay for damages caused , and noted this will probably be a precedent .
