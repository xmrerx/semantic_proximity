Two NYC-based artists secretly slipped some items inside the merchandising outpost of the Trump Tower s lower lobby.
Among them: A Trump-emblazoned KKK hood for fine people, sealed packages of pee-proof rubber sheets, and postcards featuring the 45th President of the United States, Vladimir Putin.Hoping these artists will be dealt with ASAP.Gothamist interviewed these so-called artists: We thought the tourists coming in to buy some stuff, especially people from other countries, should get the whole story of who the president is, because the items in the Trump store don t accurately reflect the person, one of the two artists, who asked that we not reveal his name.could the left be anymore hateful and immature?
