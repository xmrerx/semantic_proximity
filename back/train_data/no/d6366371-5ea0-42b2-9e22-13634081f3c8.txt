wow !
the university of chicago sends impressive letter to incoming freshman warning them that freedom of speech is alive and well at their college .
this letter makes it pretty clear that they will not be joining with hundreds of other colleges across america to squelch the free speech rights of anyone who disagrees with the black lives matter , progressive social justice warrior nonsense.after a student at the university of illinois chicago hyde park campus threatened to shoot up the campus and kill white devils in november 2015 , over the shooting of a young black man by police in chicago , the school made the decision to shut down the campus for a day .
colleges need to get out in front of this social justice warrior/black lives matter terror movement before it gets out of hand on college campuses this year .
in a welcome letter to freshmen , the college made clear that it does not condone safe spaces or trigger warnings : pic.twitter.com/9ep3n0zbgv the chicago maroon ( @ chicagomaroon ) august 24 , 2016here is the video showing the shut down of the university of chicago campus :
