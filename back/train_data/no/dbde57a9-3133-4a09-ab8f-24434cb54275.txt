more than 1,400 migrants disembarked in italy on friday , the first of more than 4,400 who are expected to come ashore during the day after being picked up by rescue boats this week in the southern mediterranean .
the problem is this is not a reuse but an invasion enabled by the smugglers and the european union .
italy and europe are toast ! italy , along with france and germany have agreed to draw up a code of conduct for charities operating rescue boats in the mediterranean with the aim of bringing under control the growing influx of migrants .
in the past few days alone , up to 12 thousand people have arrived in italy from africa , while more than 85 thousand have landed in the country since the beginning of this year .
