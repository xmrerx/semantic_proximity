Tucker Carlson debates the Russia conspiracy with Mustafa Tameez, former consultant for the Department of Homeland Security.
Oh boy!
It gets so heated but Tucker gets his point across to this political hack: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4xzSKcArdcThe Democrats so desperately want to take down this president that it s getting out of control.
Just listen to this former consultant and his spin on the firing of Sally Yates and the Russia investigation.
The reason they fired her isn t really the reason they say they fired her?
Huh?
It s like they can t keep up with all of the made up conspiracy theories.
Tameez claims Trump is intimidating the people investigating him Oy vey!
Tucker goes off the rails after this political hack tries to pull the same Democrat talking points I m done!
