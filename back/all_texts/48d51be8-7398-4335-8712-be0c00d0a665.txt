Stephen Colbert left his Comedy Central character behind to replace David Letterman on The Late Show, and he has been absolutely phenomenal at it.
Therefore, it was inevitable, and only fitting, that he gave an amazing tribute to recently deceased Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia.However, unlike what would have likely been expected, Colbert did not mock Scalia.
The man was universally despised by many decent human beings due his outrageous homophobia, misogyny, and other various bigotries, but, apparently, there was a good side to him that most of us never got to see.
Colbert, instead of using Scalia s death as a point of comedy with which to insult his memory, chose to humanize the man most of us are glad to see go from both the Supreme Court and the planet.Colbert recalled his one meeting with Scalia at a White House Correspondents Dinner, in which Scalia revealed that he had a dazzling sense of humor.
The Late Show host also pointed out that Scalia had an amazing friendship with his fellow, and notoriously liberal, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg.I ll never give Scalia or any other awful right-winger a pass on bigoted behavior.
However, amidst all of the hatred we are rightfully slinging Scalia s way, and at the glee we feel now that he can no longer sully the Supreme Court with his disgusting ideas, Colbert s tribute was refreshingly touching.Watch the video below:Featured image from YouTube screen capture
