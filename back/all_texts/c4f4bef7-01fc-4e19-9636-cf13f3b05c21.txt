There s no way to sample this extra 20 or 25% of new voters that are Trump supporters.
Sid Miller, Texas Agriculture Commissioner, went on FOX News on Wednesday to discuss the record breaking voter turnout for Donald Trump in the Lone Star State.Sid Miller: We have a record number of people registered to vote in Texas.
We re having record turnouts, the first day, the second day of voting.
And it s not Bernie Sanders supporters coming out to support Hillary.
It s not Barack Obama supporters coming out to support Hillary.
It s a new surge of Trump voters, many who have never registered to vote.
Many who have not voted in eight or ten elections so they re not reported in the polls I know for a fact that the polls are off because they oversample Democrats by eight sometimes up to sixteen percent oversampling Democrats.
They re oversampling women by five to eight percent.
So the Republican vote is underreported.
Plus there is no way to sample this extra twenty to twenty-five percent of new voters that are Trump voters.
They re not Republican, they re not Democrats, they re pragmatists.
They re tired of the status quo and they want change.
