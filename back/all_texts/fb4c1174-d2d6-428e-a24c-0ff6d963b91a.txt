He did not invent anything.
He didn t invent a clock.
He took the guts out of a clock radio that he bought in a store and put it in a pencil box.
This is like pouring Cheerios into a bowl and saying you invented cereal.
You know what Ron [Reagan]?
Try to take that through airport security.
-Bill MaherCan we all just agree that the idea that the Muslim Clock Boy (a term we coined) is or has been persecuted is insane?
This was nothing more than a muslim boy who wanted to see how far he could push his school by bringing a fake bomb to school.Wouldn t it be great if the left could take the same dog-on-a-bone approach to defending Christianity in this country?
Where were these loudmouth defenders of Christianity when Obamacare was forcing mandates on people that violated their religious beliefs?
Or how about the baker or florist or pizza shop who all said they would be happy to help serve gay people in their restaurant or perform a service for them, just not in the case of a gay marriage?
Who in the media (or White House) ran to the microphone to defend them?Here s the clip from the Bill Maher show:I m not a fan of Bill Maher, but I ve got to hand it to him this time he s 100% correct about the Muslim Clock Boy and how everyone from Obama to the media gets an F for epic fail on how they handled this story.
Let s just hope some teacher doesn t overlook the next Muslim kid who brings a bomb to school in a briefcase out of fear that they might be publicly flogged by the media or our pathetic Musim President.
Yes we did say MUSLIM President .
