rachel maddow is hysterical in the video below she claims that democrats didn t vote because it rained .
so does it just rain on democrats and not republicans ? maddow has a history of idiocy ! karen handel won a hard fought race in georgia s 6th district : karen handel won a hard fought congressional seat in georgia s 6th district .
the democrats poured 50 million dollars into jon ossoff s campaign making it the most expensive congressional race ever !
handel spoke and thanked president trump the crowd went nuts and chanted trump , trump , trump ! congratulations karen handel .
love the # ga06 chant !

( @ danscavino ) june 21 , 2017long faces at cnn after karen handel wins ! priceless .. liberal tears cnn is isis # ga06 # handel # ossoff pic.twitter.com/cgqdkk0tqs stock monster ( @ stockmonsterusa ) june 21 , 2017one of the biggest issues was that ossoff didn t live in the district : democrat jon ossoff said tuesday that he believes voters in georgia s sixth congressional district do not care that he does not live in the district he is running to represent , dismissing questions on his residency .
well , he did work for georgia rep. hank johnson for 5 years johnson famously said the island of guam would tip over but was reelected anyway .
details , meh ossoff s residency has been a persistent problem for him during his special election campaign to fill secretary of health and human services tom price s vacant house seat .
