PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday he was counting on U.N. Security Council members China and Russia to step up sanctions on North Korea after its latest missile test.
I once again condemn with the greatest force the missile launch yesterday and now we must increase sanctions, Macron told France 24 television.
I am counting a lot in particular on China and Russia in order to take the most difficult and effective sanctions, he added, speaking during an interview from Abidjan in Ivory Coast.
