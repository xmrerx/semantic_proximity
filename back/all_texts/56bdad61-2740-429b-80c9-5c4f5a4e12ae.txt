Scott Dworkin: A paper trail leads directly back to Mike Pence Pence knew Michael Flynn was a foreign agent MSNBC is actually ok with this lunatic spouting his BS?
A paper trail leads directly back to Mike Pence Pence knew Michael Flynn was a foreign agent @Funder on #AMJoy https://t.co/mK7L0yJI2Y Scott Dworkin (@funder) July 15, 2017All you have to do is go on his twitter page and see that he s now calling for an investigation into Trump s new communications director Anthony Scaramucci.
Dworkin might want to check into what happened to the three CNN employees who tried to attack Scaramucci.
Yes, they were fired from CNN and had to retract the article.
This brainiac is all about the money.
He s asking for donations to investigate Scaramucci!
What a grifter!Time for Trump to hit back at this Dwork !
Trump is one of the biggest mobsters in the world.
