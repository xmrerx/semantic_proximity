washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. senate overwhelmingly backed a waiver on thursday that will allow james mattis to serve as president-elect donald trump â€™ s secretary of defense , despite having retired as a marine general in 2013 .
the senate voted 81 to 17 for a one-time waiver of a provision of a law on civilian control of the u.s. military requiring a seven-year wait before active-duty military can lead the department of defense .
the waiver must still be approved by the house of representatives armed services committee and full house , and signed into law by the president , to allow mattis to serve if he is confirmed to lead the pentagon .
