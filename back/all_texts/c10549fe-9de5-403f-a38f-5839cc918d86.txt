After watching their Republican nominee insult nearly every minority living in America, conservatives know just how dangerous the non-white vote is in this election.
As minorities make up more and more of the general population, Donald Trump has put the Republican Party at an incredible disadvantage with his divisive, racist rhetoric.So when Fox News host Bill Hemmer celebrated some interesting news on Tuesday, it became more obvious than ever that the GOP considers the minority vote a major threat to the future of its party.
Fox News host Bill Hemmer actually said that he had good news in Ohio, which was that more white people were voting in the state and the black share of the vote is down.
At this point in the election, when Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton is beating Donald Trump by a landslide, Republicans are grasping at straws and desperately trying to find the silver lining in anything they possibly can.
Hemmer said to RNC Communications Director Sean Spicer: I m looking at early voting.
You have good news in Ohio, white share of the vote is up 3 points from four years ago, black share of the vote is down 7.
Spicer seemed just as giddy about this news, and also noted that the Republican Party was leading in absentee ballots.
He echoed Hemmer s excitement when he said, Our people are coming out.
You can watch this despicable exchange below, in which two white men celebrate the fact that their data shows racists having the upper hand:[ad3media campaign= 1234 ]Republicans are going to be awfully disappointed at the end of this election, and November 8th can t come soon enough.
Despite what conservatives want to believe, America isn t nearly as white as it used to be, and minority voters have great power now.
It could very well be that minority voters save white people from making the biggest mistake of their lives letting Trump get into the White House.
