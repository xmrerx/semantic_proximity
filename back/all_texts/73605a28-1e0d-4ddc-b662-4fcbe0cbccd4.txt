In what might be the last Weekly Address from our beloved President Obama, he took a little time to look back over his years in office and remind us of what we ve accomplished together over the past 8 years.Proving, yet again, what a humble man and class act that he is, he never takes credit he reminds us that we ALL did this.
We did this as a country:At a time when we turn the page on one year and look ahead to the future, I just wanted to take a minute to thank you for everything you ve done to make America stronger these past eight years.We ve turned recession into recovery.
Our businesses have created 15.6 million new jobs since early 2010 and we ve put more people back to work than all other major advanced economies combined.Poverty is falling.
Incomes are rising.
In fact, last year, folks typical household income rose by $2,800, that s the single biggest increase on record, and folks at the bottom and middle saw bigger gains than those at the top.President Obama also goes on to congratulate our kids on their hard work in school, stating that our kids high school graduation rate is at an all-time high.
Never wavering from the example he sets every single day as a man of honor, he didn t acknowledge not even once Trump s pathetic tweet this morning, or what s to come with this new administration lurking at the doors of the White House, but only mentions our achievements over the past 8 years perhaps hoping that we will all take a moment to reflect on that as well.Watch his last Weekly Address of 2016 below: Keep America moving forward.
