brussels ( reuters ) - the european union is negotiating the terms of britain s exit from the bloc in good faith and is not working on a scenario where there is no agreement on the separation , the chairman of eu leaders donald tusk said on tuesday .
britain is keen to start negotiating as quickly as possible the terms of its future relationship with the eu , including a transition period , after it leaves the bloc in march 2019 .
but the eu does not want to start such negotiating until london and brussels agree the terms of the divorce - citizen s rights , border issues in northern ireland and , crucially , how much money britain owes the eu .
we hear from london that the uk government is preparing for a no deal scenario .
i would like to say very clearly that the eu is not working on such a scenario , european council president tusk said in a speech in brussels .
we are negotiating in good faith , and we still hope that the so-called sufficient progress will be possible by december .
however , if it turns out that the talks continue at a slow pace , and that sufficient progress hasn t been reached , then together with our uk friends we will have to think about where we are heading , he said .
