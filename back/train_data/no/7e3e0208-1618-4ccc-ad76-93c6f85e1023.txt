stavropol , russia ( reuters ) - president vladimir putin may be criticized by the west for the annexation of crimea from ukraine in 2014 , but at home his public approval ratings have been boosted .
the operation to seize the peninsula , hailed by russian nationalists as the crimean spring , led to an upsurge in what is called military and patriotic education of russian youths .
in the southern region of stavropol , interest has been revived in the cossacks , a warrior class in tsarist times , and in the history of tsarist and modern wars which moscow fought in the north caucasus region .
the cossacks , who were portrayed as peaceful ploughmen in quiet times , were swift to repel attacks from nearby regions , such as chechnya and dagestan , or join moscow s military campaigns elsewhere .
tomorrow begins today , reads the motto of a cadet school in stavropol that was named after alexei yermolov , a 19th century russian general who conquered the caucasus for the russian empire .
a reuters photo essay ( reut.rs/2jp4dgu ) captures images from the general yermolov cadet school training in stavropol and in the countryside .
most cadets come from families of active russian soldiers or officers from other security forces .
about 40 percent of school leavers join the military or law enforcement agencies .
many instructors spent years in hot spots or conflict zones .
a group of teenagers from the patriot club in crimea visited the school s field camp , named russian knights , over the summer .
up to 600 boys and girls train there each summer .
this camp trains more than 1,500 teenagers a year .
physical exercises go hand-in-hand with weapons training , marksmanship tests , car driving and even parachuting .
