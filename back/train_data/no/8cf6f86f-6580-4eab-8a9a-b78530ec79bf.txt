moscow ( reuters ) - russia hopes that all syrian opposition groups will attend a moscow-backed syrian congress in southern russia on nov. 18 despite some objections , russian deputy foreign minister mikhail bogdanov said on thursday , the interfax news agency reported .
the event , called the syrian congress on national dialogue , was first mentioned by president vladimir putin last month who said he believed that militants in syria would soon be defeated .
it is due to be held in the black sea resort of sochi .
but while damascus has backed the russian plan , some opposition groups have rejected the idea , calling it an attempt to rehabilitate president bashar al-assad s government .
they have said they will stick to u.n.-brokered geneva peace talks .
asked if moscow still hoped to see opposition groups like the high negotiations committee , which has refused to come , attending , interfax cited bogdanov as saying : we hope that everyone who believes that the fate of the country , its unity , its territorial integrity and its sovereignty are important will participate .
