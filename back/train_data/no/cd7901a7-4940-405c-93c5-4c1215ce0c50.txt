he was also a father and a grandfather.officer thompson shared this meme on his facebook page in 2014 : ironically , officer thompson was killed by another veteran , micah x. johnson , an angry , racist veteran who declared war on whites and white leo s on his homeland.it is not clear if there were any other gunmen , or whether other people taken into custody by police were involved in the shooting .
police initially said two snipers positioned themselves in triangulated locations to fire on officers from elevated positions.the gunfire began just before 9 p.m. while a peaceful rally was held by black lives matter in response to recent controversial police killings of black men in louisiana and minnesota.after the shootings in downtown dallas , the gunman , identified as micah xavier johnson , 25 , holed himself up inside el centro college in the downtown area of the city , dallas police chief david brown said at a press conference.the gunman was then cornered in el centro college in downtown dallas.he told police he was not affiliated with any groups , and he said he did this alone , the chief said.here is a post from his facebook page , which has since been remove .
johnson may say he is not affiliated with any groups , but by the postings found by heavy.com on his facebook page , it is clear he holds the same black power views as the blm protesters/rioters .
we re pretty sure there is no specific id or group membership card that the blm organizers supply their followers with , but just watch the media spin his comments to distance himself for the blm rioters protesters : johnson says he s not affiliated with any groups , but what about this group , the black power political organization , who took responsibility for the killings of dallas law enforcement officers last night ?
here is the post this group placed on their page immediately following the shootings : is it possible that johnson was affiliated with this group ?
it sure seems like he fits the profile .
sources told the los angeles times that johnson has no ties to terror groups and no known criminal history .
he has lived in the dallas area and has family members living in mesquite , texas , east of dallas , the newspaper reports , citing federal law enforcement sources.a black suv was found at the scene registered to delphene johnson , who is micah johnson s mother , according to facebook posts and public records , nbc dallas-fort worth reports .

details about his service were not immediately available.johnson told police negotiators the end is coming and said he wanted to kill more officers , according to brown.police said after several hours of negotiating , with intermittent exchanges of gunfire , the suspect was killed by a bomb-wielding robot .
we tried to negotiate for several hours , negotiations broke down , we had an exchange of gunfire with the suspect , brown said .
we saw no other option but to use our bomb-robot and place a device on its extension for it to detonate where the suspect was .
other options would have exposed our officers to grave danger .
the suspect is dead a result of detonating the bomb .
the suspect did not shoot himself , despite reports , brown said .
he wanted to kill officers , and he expressed killing white people , he expressed killing white officers , brown said .
he expressed anger for black lives matter .
none of that makes sense , none of that is a legitimate reason to do harm to anyone , so the rest of it would just be speculating on what his motivations were .
we just know what he said to our negotiators .
while he was barricaded in the hotel , the suspect told police there were bombs planted all over downtown dallas , the city s police chief said at a press conference.police have not said if any bombs or suspicious items have been found .
he said we will eventually find the ieds , brown said.the shooting came a year and a month after a man angry at police opened fire on the dallas police headquarters .
he fired several shots at the building , but no one was injured .
the man , james boulware , was driving an armored van and was later chased down by police .
