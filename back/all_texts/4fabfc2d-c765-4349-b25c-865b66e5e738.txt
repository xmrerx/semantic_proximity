SANTIAGO (Reuters) - Conservative Sebastian Pinera took an early lead of more than seven percentage points in Chile s presidential election on Sunday, Chile s electoral agency Servel said.
With 9.55 percent of ballots counted, Pinera had 53.6 percent of votes while center-left Alejandro Guillier had 46.4 percent in the runoff vote.
Chileans are voting for a successor to President Michelle Bachelet in a race that will determine if the world s top copper producer stays on its center-left course or joins other Latin American nations turning to the right in recent years.
