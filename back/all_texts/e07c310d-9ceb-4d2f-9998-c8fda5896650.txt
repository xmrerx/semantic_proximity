Much like all of his other speeches, President Barack Obama s 2016 State of The Union speech was visionary, engaging and all-around amazing.
Touching on a variety of political issues such as gun violence, addiction awareness, the Syrian refugee crisis, racial injustice and education, last night s speech definitely lived up to all of the president s previous State of The Union addresses and was possibly even greater.As we ve come to live in such a digitally connected society, it should come as no surprise that the internet started to respond immediately to Obama s final SOTU broadcast.
As millions of Americans watched Obama, Twitter worked overtime to churn out a seemingly endless number of hilarious, quick-witted memes, capturing some of the most notable and comical moments of the event s guests and members of Congress.
No one was spared if you ended up on camera, you were pretty much instantly made into an internet meme.
This was especially true if you were unfortunate enough to be a Republican.From GOP presidential candidates Marco Rubio and Donald Trump to Kim Davis and Paul Ryan (who REALLY got it bad!
), these memes have made our Commander-in-Chief s last SOTU all the more memorable.
Here are our Republican-slamming favorites from last night s address:TwitterThis woman s face is something we can all relate to when it comes to Republican front runner Donald Trump TwitterSpeaker of The House Paul Ryan got slammed particularly hard!
This particular facial expression has even been described as Ryan being 10 seconds away from throwing a tantrum.
