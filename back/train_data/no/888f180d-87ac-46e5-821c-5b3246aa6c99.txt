berlin ( reuters ) - germany s liberal free democrats ( fdp ) see some common ground with the greens on areas including education and digitization , party leader christian lindner said on monday .
there are commonalities with the greens on the question of education reform , on questions of civil rights and certainly also on the question of the expansion of fiber optic networks , for which we need to provide more funding , he told journalists the day after germany s national election .
the fdp has set the stage for tough coalition talks with chancellor angela merkel s conservatives and the greens , saying they would not agree to a deal that did not promise a change in the german government s direction .
