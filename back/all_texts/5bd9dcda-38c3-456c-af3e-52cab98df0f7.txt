SEOUL (Reuters) - The North Korean soldier who was shot while defecting to South Korea on Monday suffered massive internal damage, the surgeon leading his treatment said on Wednesday.
I ve never seen such injuries outside of a textbook in more than 20 years of my career, Lee Cook-jong, the surgeon in charge of the soldier, said at a media briefing.
The soldier was being operated upon for a second time on Wednesday, the hospital treating him said.
