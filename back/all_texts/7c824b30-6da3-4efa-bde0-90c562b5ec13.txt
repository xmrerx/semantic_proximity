HANOI (Reuters) - At least 54 people died and 39 went missing as destructive floods battered northern and central Vietnam this week, the disaster prevention agency said on Friday.
Vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding due to its long coastline.
A typhoon wrecked havoc across central provinces just last month.
The floods that hit Vietnam this week starting on Monday are the worst in years, state-run Vietnam Television quoted agriculture minister Nguyen Xuan Cuong as saying.
Nineteen people from four neighboring households in Hoa Binh were buried alive early on Thursday after a landslide struck around midnight on Wednesday, but only nine bodies have been found, the disaster agency said in a report.
Some 317 homes have collapsed in floods and landslides this week, while more than 34,000 other houses have been submerged or damaged.
More than 22,000 hectares (54,300 acres) of rice have also been damaged and around 180,000 animals killed or washed away.
Floods have also affected seven of 77 provinces in Thailand, Vietnam s neighbor to the west, that country s Department of Disaster Prevention and Mitigation said on Thursday.
More than 480,000 hectares (1.2 million acres) of agricultural land Thailand have been hit, the department said.
