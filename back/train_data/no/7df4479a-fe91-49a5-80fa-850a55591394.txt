cnn s chris cuomo freaked out at president donald trump s comment during a speech in iowa that he didn t want a poor person in economic cabinet positions .
he said he couldn t believe trump supporters would applaud this comment .
chris cuomo s faux outrage is hysterical ! cuomo called the audience apparently blue collar how does he know this audience isn t full of people from all backgrounds ? cuomo commented : i guess , if you are not rich , you can t understand economics .
you can t be smart enough to make a difference if you re poor , because that s probably why you re poor , right ?
isn t that the point he s making ?
note the lingo used by the panel clearly disturbed by what trump said tribalism , populism apparently , chris cuomo failed common sense 101 wouldn t it be better to hire a cabinet full of successful people ?
president trump filled his cabinet positions with the most qualified people without regard for politics .
the cnn panel must be confused when they refer to the swamp because president trump overwhelmingly chose people for positions from outside of politics .
the swamp is the dc elite ! way to go cnn !
you re still stupid !
