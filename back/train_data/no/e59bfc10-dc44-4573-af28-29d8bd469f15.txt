london ( reuters ) - british prime minster theresa may published on friday a code of conduct for all her lawmakers and party officials to follow , the latest step in her response to growing allegations of improper conduct in parliament .
britain s parliament is the latest institution to become embroiled in a sex scandal after abuse allegations against hollywood producer harvey weinstein prompted thousands of women and men to share stories about improper behavior .
on wednesday , defense minister michael fallon resigned saying his past conduct had fallen below the required standard , costing may a trusted ally in a fragile minority government and underlining her political vulnerability to further allegations .
on friday , she set out the code of conduct on the conservative party website , detailing standards expected of elected and appointed party members , the procedure for breaches of those standards and the party s definitions of discrimination , harassment , sexual harassment and bullying .
this code sets out for the first time in one place the procedure which the party uses in dealing with complaints , along with a number of additional measures which we have introduced in light of recent allegations , may said in a letter to the speaker of parliament s lower chamber .
in the letter , may said parliament also needed to take more responsibility for protecting workers within the system , repeating her call for a common , transparent and independent grievance procedure for all at westminster .
may said she would meet other party leaders on monday to discuss a separate proposal for a non-political way to handle complaints in parliament .
