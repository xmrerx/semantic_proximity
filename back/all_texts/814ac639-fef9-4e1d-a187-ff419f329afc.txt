UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said on Friday the situation on the Korean Peninsula is critical and that a peace agreement is the “only right choice” in the nuclear dispute with North Korea.
“Peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula through dialogue and negotiations represents the only right choice that is practical and viable,” Wang told reporters at the United Nations before a ministerial meeting of the 15-member Security Council.
