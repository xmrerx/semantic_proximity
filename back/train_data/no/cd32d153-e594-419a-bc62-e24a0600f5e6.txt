which brings me to president obama .
while i m not calling him a genius , i do think he s extremely intelligent .
i also believe that his tendency to use big picture thinking while drafting policy is something most republican voters simply can t understand .
take obamacare for instance .
it s not a fix health care today law .
in fact , the law itself is made to grow and evolve over time .
my belief is that it s a springboard to true socialized medicine .
but , as it is now , it s a long-term outlook on our health care .
while many republicans want to look at the now aspect of the affordable care act , they seem unable to grasp the reality that as more americans get health insurance , giving them access to preventable care , this lowers expenses down the road for everyone .
if people can prevent very costly heart attacks , strokes or other debilitating health issues now , that s an overall savings for practically everyone from consumers to health insurers to doctors who now have more patients .
quite literally , improving the overall health of americans will improve the health of this country .
it even makes sense for our economy .
if workers are healthier , because they have access to quality health care , that means there will be fewer people calling in sick to work , showing up sick to work ( putting other employees at risk ) or relying on government programs because their health conditions ( that were preventable ) render them unable to work at all .
but to see all of that requires big picture thinking and republicans seem unable to understand anything beyond the spoon-fed bumper sticker talking points they re given by the gop and the conservative media. gim me a break ! ! ! !
