WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s son Donald Trump Jr. said on Monday he would be happy to share what he knows with the Senate Intelligence Committee if it decides to look into a meeting he had with a Russian lawyer during his father’s campaign.
“Happy to work with the committee to pass on what I know,” he said on Twitter, after a Republican member of the committee said the panel should interview him.
