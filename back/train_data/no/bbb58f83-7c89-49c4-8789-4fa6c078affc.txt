breitbart news published a story about our 100 percent fed up facebook page being hidden from the facebook news feed after we began posting several stories a day on the topic of illegal immigration .
after an investigation into our page settings by a facebook employee , he discovered a core function was missing from our settings .
the function that was missing from our page settings is what allows our page to be seen by a specific audience ( or not at all ) .
it s really quite ironic that the guy who s been doing everything in his power to make illegal alien a dirty word on facebook , would build a massive wall around his hawaiian domicile wouldn t you agree ? for years , kilauea , kauai resident gy hall has enjoyed the view of the ocean and the breeze along koolau road .
then , a few weeks ago , a crew started to build a wall which happens to belong to facebook founder mark zuckerberg .
the feeling of it is really oppressive .
it s immense , hall said .
it s really sad that somebody would come in , and buy a huge piece of land and the first thing they do is cut off this view that s been available and appreciative by the community here for years .
hall said the wall extends along koolau road , near mile marker 20 , and is about six-feet tall .
he said its projected length and completion are unclear.multiple attempts by tgi to contact shawn smith , former falk partners manager , who hall says sold some of the $ 200 million , 700-plus-acre property to the billionaire , were unsuccessful friday shosana chantara , a kilauea resident , voiced her concerns about the breeze that s being obstructed .
it s hot behind that wall .
because it s up on a berm , there s not a breath of air on this side from the ocean , chantara said .
you take a solid wall that s 10 or more feet above the road level ; the breeze can t go through .
another kilauea resident , donna macmillan , calls the wall a monstrosity .
