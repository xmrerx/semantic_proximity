Representative Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said on Wednesday that the Democrats are not serious about the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 presidential election.
We re beginning to figure out who s actually serious about the investigation because it appears like the Democrats aren t really serious about this investigation, he told reporters, according to Politico.This is the same Nunes who snuck onto the White House grounds to meet an unnamed source last week, then switched cars and ditched aides, then vanished into the night so that the next day he could make an announcement to defend alleged president Donald Trump.
Nunes, while refusing to name his source, said that he had seen evidence that Trump associates were incidentally surveilled after the election.The top Democrat on the committee, Adam Schiff, and other Democrats, are calling for Nunes to recuse himself from the Russia probe.
Nunes has refused to do so.Nunes alleges that the Democrats have not given him a witness list and added that as far as he knew they had done very little to read the documents provided by the intelligence agencies, according to Politico.
So, at the end of the day here, we re going to get to the truth, we re going to find out who s actually doing a real investigation, Nunes said.Nunes, who literally went around the very committee he chairs, to bring Trump evidence amid one of the biggest scandals to ever hit the White House, claims that Democrats aren t serious about a probe into Russia s meddling of our election.Sure, accuse the other side of what you re guilty of, Rep. Nunes.So far, only one Republican lawmaker has stepped forward to call for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation.
Hopefully, more Republicans will locate their conscience in order to disallow a hostile foreign government from underminding our election process in the future.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images.
