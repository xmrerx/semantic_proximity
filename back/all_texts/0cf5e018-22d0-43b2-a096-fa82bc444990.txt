UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Russia s U.N. ambassador, Vassily Nebenzia, said Moscow s message to the United States during a likely meeting of the parties to the Iran nuclear deal next week on the sidelines to the United Nations General Assembly was to stay in the deal.
That is not only our message, but the rest of the participants and those that are outside are trying to send this message across, Nebenzia told reporters on Friday.
