If anyone had any deluded designs that Donald Trump wasn t going to stack his staff with racists, they were sadly mistaken.
Trump has named Steve Bannon, the guy who runs the alt-right website Breitbart, as his chief strategist.
Paul Ryan went on television this morning and tried to say that the Trump Administration and the Republican Party do not condone racism and hate, but all of that just went out the window with this appointment.
Here is video of that interaction with CNN s Jake Tapper:[ad3media campaign= 1347 ]The Trump campaign released the following statement regarding Trump s appointments and of course it doesn t address the fact that Bannon is a bona fide racist: I am thrilled to have my very successful team continue with me in leading our country.
Steve and Reince are highly qualified leaders who worked well together on our campaign and led us to a historic victory.
Now I will have them both with me in the White House as we work to make America great again.
So, in other words, Trump and his team are in no way concerned about the racist hate crimes that have been cropping up around the country as a result of Trump s getting elected.
If the GOP wants the nation and world to think that they are not racists, this is definitely NOT the way to do it.
Trump himself is a racist, and Bannon is a huge racist as well.Buckle your seatbelts, folks.
There s no way this country isn t going to devolve into a pit of hate with these people running it.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images
