Now that it s been established that Mike Pence will be Donald Trump s running mate (and not errand boy Chris Christie), the Clinton campaign has already begun pouncing on the anti-woman, anti-LGBT candidate that was brave enough to step on stage with Trump.But reports appear to show Trump had his reservations about the Indiana governor.
Apparently, Trump was so regretful of picking the former Congressman that he asked his campaign aides the night before the announcement if he could back out of picking Pence.After the news leaked that Pence was indeed the choice, Trump s uncertainty was heightened after being incensed (he blamed the Pence camp).
On Thursday, after telling Fox News he had not made a final decision, sources told NBC News:[D]onald Trump was stressed over the circumstances surrounding his choice for running mate even after news of the pick leaked.
While in California, separated from family and most aides, Trump worked the phones late into the evening Thursday soliciting advice and sharing his concerns.
Sources familiar with the calls said Trump conveyed that he felt backed into a corner.
Another description suggested that Trump was talking it out, but knew that he could not and would not choose a different running mate.It hasn t even been two days and Trump already regrets his decision.
Like everything else in his campaign, Trump seems to have been winging it the whole time, settling on a guy he wasn t even so sure about.The news that Pence was the choice shouldn t have been a surprise.
For months the Trump campaign told reporters it was seeking an experienced Republican who had personal relationships on Capitol Hill.
That left Pence and former House Speaker New Gingrich as the formidable options.
But in the last several weeks the Trump campaign noted that it did not want an attack dog, which eliminated Gingrich Christie was never a true option, he was just the McDonald s boy.Of course the Trump campaign denied that he had regrets, but considering their main attraction lies 77 percent of the time, who can be so sure?With the RNC just around the corner, Trump enters the general race universally hated, with no money, no field organization, and a running mate he doesn t really like.Yet his supporters will still view him as a god.Featured image via Bryan Thomas/Getty Images
