ankara ( reuters ) - turkey issued detention warrants for the lawyers of two hunger-striking teachers on tuesday , days before they are due to appear in court , lawyers representing the academics said .
nuriye gulmen , a literature professor , and semih ozakca , a primary school teacher , have been on hunger strike for more than six months after they lost their jobs in a crackdown following a failed coup against president tayyip erdogan .
doctors say they have been surviving on liquids and supplements , but have described their condition as dangerously weak for several months .
authorities detained them in may saying they had links to the militant leftist dhkp-c group , deemed a terrorist organization by turkey .
the warrants were issued for 18 lawyers , all members of two law offices defending the teachers .
the detention of our colleagues today is an attempt in vain to leave gulmen and ozakca defenseless , a lawyer representing the pair told reuters , adding that more than 2,000 lawyers had applied to defend them due to the case s symbolic importance .
police raided lawyers offices in istanbul and ankara and detained 10 lawyers , while the search for eight others continued .
on thursday , gulmen and ozakca will appear in court for the first time since their arrest .
so far , 150,000 state employees including civil servants , academics and security personnel have been fired since last year s coup attempt , which erdogan blamed on followers of u.s.-based islamic cleric fethullah gulen .
gulen denies any involvement .
critics accuse the government of using the coup as a pretext to purge dissident voices from public institutions .
last month , the european court of human rights rejected a request by the two teachers to order ankara to release them on health grounds .
