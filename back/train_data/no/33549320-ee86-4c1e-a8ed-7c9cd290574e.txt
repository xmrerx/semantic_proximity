washington ( reuters ) - the trump administration is seeking a 17 percent cut to the budget of the government ’ s meteorological agency that monitors the climate and issues daily weather forecasts , the washington post reported on friday .
citing a four-page budget memo , the post said the proposed reductions in the budget of the national oceanic and atmospheric administration ( noaa ) would affect research and satellite programs and eliminate funding for some smaller programs .
the noaa is part of the commerce department , whose overall budget “ would be hit by an overall 18 percent reduction from its current funding level , ” it said .
the paper did not give a total figure for the proposed cuts , but said the white house office of management and budget outline for the commerce department ’ s budget for fiscal year 2018 included sharp reductions for specific parts of the noaa .
the agency ’ s satellite data division would lose $ 513 million , or 22 percent , of its current funding under the proposal , and its office of oceanic and atmospheric research would lose $ 126 million , or 26 percent , the post said .
the paper said a spokesperson for the commerce department declined to comment , and that an unnamed white house official said the process was “ evolving ” and cautioned against specific numbers .
