istanbul ( reuters ) - turkey s purchase of russian s-400 surface-to-air missiles has been completed but ankara is discussing a further deal with a european consortium to help it develop its own missile defense system , defense minister nurettin canikli said .
the decision by nato member turkey to buy the s-400s from moscow has been seen by some of its western allies as a snub to the alliance .
the deal has also raised concern because the weapons can not be integrated into nato defenses .
a senior nato commander told reuters last week that the alliance would continue to press ankara to buy weapons that could work together with nato systems , adding that so far no s-400s had been delivered to turkey .
[ nl5n1ne7di ] it is finished , the s-400 missiles have been bought .
the rest is just details now , canikli said in televised comments in the black sea town of giresun .
but turkey was not content with the s-400 deal alone , he added .
we are also making preliminary agreements with the eurosam consortium to have this technology to develop , produce and use our own sources for air defense systems , canikli said , referring to a joint franco-italian defense project .
canikli signed a letter of intent with france and italy in brussels on wednesday to strengthen cooperation in defense projects including missile defense , turkish defense ministry sources said last week .
they said that as a first step , eurosam and turkish companies will look into a system based on the samp-t missile system produced by eurosam .
