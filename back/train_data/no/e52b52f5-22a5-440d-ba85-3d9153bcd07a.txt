maiduguri , nigeria ( reuters ) - nigeria s military has repelled an attempt by suspected boko haram militants to seize the northeastern town of magumeri , a spokesman said on sunday , a day after the attack .
the assault was the latest in a series of attacks in northeast nigeria , where the conflict with the islamist insurgency has dragged into a ninth year with little sign of an end .
three soldiers were killed and six others wounded while fighting the militants in magumeri , which lies 50 km ( 30 miles ) from borno state capital maiduguri , which has been the center of the conflict , the military spokesman said .
a member of a vigilante group formed to fight boko haram put the death toll at six soldiers and three vigilantes , while a resident of magumeri told reuters by telephone that at least three civilians were also killed .
a suicide bomber killed at least 58 people on tuesday at a mosque in neighboring adamawa state , one of the deadliest attacks since president muhammadu buhari came to power in 2015 pledging to end the boko haram insurgency .
