nyt scoincidence ? president bill clinton fired fbi director william s. sessions on july 19 , 1993vince foster was found dead on july 20 , 1993was the suspicious death of vince foster and the firing of republican fbi director william s. sessions firing a coincidence ?
did president clinton need an fbi director who was willing to look the other way when it came to the alleged criminal activities of the clintons ? from newsmax december 4 , 2003 via free republic .
vince foster : what the media won t tell you major media outlets reported wednesday on the supreme court hearing of california lawyer allan favish s case that government photographs of vincent foster s death scene be released for public viewing .
the media report that no fewer than five investigations have found that foster committed suicide because he was depressed .
but despite 10 years of denial by the major media , the foster case has not closed as the supreme court hearing wednesday demonstrated .
the case won t close because of the failure of authorities to make full disclosure and to conduct a full investigation into the case , including a complete autopsy.vince foster was not only deputy white house counsel but also the personal attorney to bill and hillary clinton.on the night of foster s death , top clinton aides made a frantic effort to enter and remove documents from his west wing office .
in the days that followed , federal investigators were stymied in their investigation of foster s office and strange death.since foster s july 1993 death , the facts of his death have been obfuscated by friends of bill and hillary in the major media , but here s the undeniable truth : there weren t five investigations into foster s death , as the media report .
the park police , best known for their meter and horse patrols around washington , were put in charge of the initial death inquiry of the most important federal official to die suspiciously since president kennedy .
the park police , contradicting standard procedure , declared the death a suicide before launching their inquiry.the fbi never officially investigated the case but simply signed off on the park police probe .
the bureau had little choice .
the day before foster s death , bill clinton hurriedly fired the director of the fbi , william sessions .
sessions later charged that clinton had politicized the bureau.later , robert fiske , selected by clinton s counsel bernie nussbaum and janet reno , quickly confirmed the park police probe as a suicide.but when ken starr entered the investigation , he reopened the case .
his chief prosecutor in the case , miquel rodriguez , later quit the starr investigation , claiming that starr s staff was engaging in a cover-up of foster s death.rodriguez , a harvard-educated federal prosecutor , argued that one of the polaroid photos taken of foster at the crime scene indicated an additional wound on foster s neck never noted on the autopsy report .
favish s suit before the supreme court is seeking to release this photo , among others.no fewer than three of the paramedics on the scene indicated in reports or testimony that the crime scene was consistent with a murder scene , not a suicide.a careful fbi microscopic investigation of foster s shoes found not a trace of soil or grass stains on them , though he supposedly walked several hundred yards through wooded fort marcy park to where his body was found .
[ years later , starr s investigation found plenty of soil and grass stains .
rodriguez charged that the shoes were tampered with to produce such evidence .
] according to the fbi report on vince foster s death ( below ) blonde hairs were found on the body of vince foster , but were never investigated : foster was found with little blood around his body and despite claims that he fired the gun into his mouth , practically no blood was found on the front of his shirt.foster was found with a 1913 revolver no one in his family could claim , with two serial numbers , made from the parts of three or more guns .
none of foster s fingerprints were found on the gun.for years , detail after detail emerged questioning the official ruling.significant questions were raised about the unusual gun a .38 colt revolver made from the parts of three guns with two serial numbers found conveniently in vince s hand.the park police said one of the serial numbers indicated the gun was vintage 1913 and had no pedigree.foster family members insisted neither foster nor his father ever owned the old revolver.the ncic keeps records of all law enforcment inquiries of serial numbers.on march 23 , 2001 , the fbi responded to requests made by a man names craig brinkley : serial number 356555 , one of the numbers on the gun , was never searched , not by the fbi , the park police or by that investigation by ken starr.serial number 355055 was found on the frame of the gun .
brinkley believes that was the gun s real nnumber.that number was indeed searched by the park police , on the evening of foster s death , more exactly at 22:45 edt on july 20 , 1993.interestingly , searches were conducted on the same serial number no fewer than three times earlier that year , before foster s death , on march 3 , march 7 and april 29.was someone checking to see that this gun had a clean predigree and was untraceable ? the bullet from the gun that supposedly killed foster was never found , despite intensive searches.despite claims to the contrary , no one who knew foster , including hillary , web hubbell and his own wife , saw signs of depression.a so-called suicide note was found in an office briefcase that had been searched and found to be empty after foster s death .
the note was torn into 27 pieces .
yet an fbi examination found no trace of foster s fingerprints on the note and a top oxford handwriting expert found the note to be an obvious forgery.despite the enormity of the case , foster s autopsy lasted an astounding 45 minutes .
the coroner in the case had previously been overruled in other cases he declared suicides that were later found to be murders.all of the x-rays taken during the autopsy are missing.complete crime scene photos don t exist .
the park police said all the photos were accidentally overexposed .
a series of close-up polaroids , which favish is suing for , remain .
this is just a brief summary of the dozens of inconsistencies in the case .
two new york homicide investigators who looked into the case concluded that foster s body had been moved to the crime scene and that murder could not be ruled out.despite overwhelming evidence of a cover-up , the media won t question the official ruling.ken starr , who could find no criminal wrongdoing on the part of the clintons during his intensive probe , confirmed a ruling of suicide .
starr even hired o.j .
simpson s defense expert to prove his case.on august 23 , 2016 , the daily mail revealed that fbi agents reported interviews documenting that hillary clinton s stinging humiliation of her friend and mentor vince foster in front of white house aides triggered the suicide of vince foster were missing from where they should be filed at the national archives.on the first visit , archivist david paynter provided the box of records that he said contained the fbi reports of interviews conducted by fbi agents on foster s death .
on a second visit , archivist james mathis provided what he said were those same documents.while the box contained dozens of fbi reports concerning foster s death including interviews with the medical examiner , u.s. park police officers , and white house aides about the contents of foster s office the reports on hillary clinton s role in his death were absent.after filing a freedom of information request with the national archives , martha murphy , the archives public liaison , reported that she directed a senior archivist to conduct a more thorough review of the relevant fbi files , including those that had not been previously made public in response to foia requests .
he examined all eight boxes but found no interviews by any investigator that detail either a meeting between hillary clinton and vince foster or the effects of a meeting between hillary clinton and vince foster on vince foster s state of mind , murphy reported in an email.after firing republican fbi director william s. session , president bill clinton temporarily replaced him with floyd i. clarke and then on september 1 , 1993 he louis freeh became the fbi director .
louis freeh coincidentally hired james comey for his first job.right from the start , the freeh fbi was drenched in controversy .
the screw-ups were legion from the exposure of fraudulent fbi crime lab results to the wrongful blaming of an innocent man for the bombings at the atlanta olympics to the bloody standoff and shootout at ruby ridge.but enough about the crimes of the clinton s and the hypocrisy of the media who would have chosen to ignore the suspicious timing of president clinton s firing of his fbi director william s. sessions .
we should all just ignore the unmitigated mess james comey made of hillary s email scandal that put our national security at risk while he was serving as the director of the fbi , and instead , focus on a way to blame comey s incompetence on president trump .
