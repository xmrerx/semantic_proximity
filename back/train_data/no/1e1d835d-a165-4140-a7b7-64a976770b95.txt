the party of diversity waits for hillary to be dragged out of the primary in handcuffs kicking and screaming former gop presidential candidate george pataki is predicting that democrat hillary clinton s legal issues will force an outside candidate to jump into the 2016 white house race as a white knight .
people talk about the problems in the republican party , but i think democrats have a bigger problem , the former new york governor told host john catsimatidis on the cats roundtable on new york s am-970 on sunday .
hillary clinton is cratering , the scandals just keep coming .
she has grave legal issues that could totally prevent her from continuing her campaign , and the alternative is a self-avowed socialist who has never run anything .
pataki added that it would not surprise him to see an outsider jump into the race like vice president joe biden , california gov .
jerry brown or secretary of state john kerry .
despite his previous pronouncements that republican presidential front-runner donald trump has no chance at the gop nomination , pataki conceded that his prediction isn t borne out by reality .
he s just tapped into anger towards washington , anger towards politicians , he said .
i understand the anger , but the solution is not to get behind someone who expresses the anger but does not have the necessary solution .
i hope people coalesce around somebody who has a positive vision about how to bring americans together .
