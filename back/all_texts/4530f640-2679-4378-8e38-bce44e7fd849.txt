There is a stark difference between these two veterans.
Perry O Brien, the crybaby veteran who has organized a group against Trump is put in his place more than once during their interview with CNN s Don Lemon.
Former Navy Seal Carl Higbie brilliantly calls out and embarrasses conscientious objector Perry O Brien for attempting to label him a racist because he doesn t agree with a particular religious ideology.We re not really fans of CNN, but they actually do America a favor when they bring guests like the conscientious objector, Perry O Brien onto their show to go head to head with a brave and passionate defender of America.
This interview provides a pretty good representation of the how the Left has wussified the male vs. the strong conservative male who stands ready to defend his nation.
If I were Trump I d pick the latter to be on my team.
The reality is, when the sh*t hits the fan 99% of Americans are going to want veteran Carl Higbie on their team.
We re not going to give a damn about whether or not he s passed a sensitivity course we just want to keep our nation safe from those who would like to take away our freedoms and destroy our way of life Anti-Trump and pro-Trump veterans debate Donald Trump's record https://t.co/u52Ea97Ny8https://t.co/jpUvhlw2zn CNN Tonight (@CNNTonight) June 1, 2016
