nouakchott ( reuters ) - a mauritanian blogger condemned to death in 2014 for apostasy in a facebook post about islam will be freed because an appeals court on thursday overturned his sentence , his lawyer said .
mohamed ould cheikh ould mkhaitir has spent nearly four years in jail after a high-profile case surrounding a post in which he criticized the use of religion to justify social discrimination .
the case has highlighted tempestuous social divisions in the desert west african country , often based on ethnicity .
thousands protested in the capital nouakchott and other cities during the trial demanding mkhaitir be put to death .
mauritania has not carried out a death penalty sentence since 1987 , but last year a group of influential muslim clerics urged authorities to apply the harshest punishment .
the court reduced mkhaitir s sentence to two years in prison and a fine of 60,000 ouguiyas ( $ 170 ) .
he will be allowed to go free because of time already served in prison , his lawyer me mohamed ould moine told reuters .
this is a great victory for mauritanian justice , moine said after the appeal hearing in the northern city of nouadhibou .
the judges respected mauritanian law taking into account his regrets and repentance .
the streets of nouakchott were calm immediately after the hearing , though there was extra security in place there and in nouadhibou .
his lawyer and rights groups have expressed concerns about mkhaitir s safety following death threats to him and his friends .
