brussels ( reuters ) - the european commission will ask eu member states on wednesday to take a stand on whether the polish government is abusing democratic standards , three sources told reuters , as the bloc steps up pressure on warsaw .
poland has been in a deepening dispute with brussels and other european union states over upholding the rule of law since the nationalist-minded , eurosceptic law and justice ( pis ) party won power in late 2015 .
pis denies that it is undermining democratic standards in the largest ex-communist eu country but brussels - along with many other member states , the polish opposition and rights activists - has been sounding the alarm for months .
after german chancellor angela merkel offered rare public criticism of warsaw last week , the bloc is seen more likely to head toward an unprecedented punishment of warsaw .
three sources said the executive commission will ask all eu states on wednesday to discuss the situation in poland again at a ministerial meeting in brussels on sept. 25 .
the meeting is not expected to trigger the so-called article 7 punitive procedure yet but the discussion will measure the willingness of the other 27 eu countries to move ahead .
at the heart of the dispute is a pis reform of the judiciary in poland which puts the courts and judges under tighter government control .
