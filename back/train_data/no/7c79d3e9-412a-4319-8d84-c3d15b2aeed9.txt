could someone please explain this ?
i honestly don t think it s any accident.i stumbled onto this video via badblue , which linked to a site called hyscience .
at first i thought it was a joke .
but the video is posted on the official aarp youtube channel.in order for me to hear the not-so subliminal message on the radio playing in the background , i had to turn the volume all the way up and use headphones .
but this is what i hear : riots nationwide have prompted local governments to declare martial law .
the president is asking that citizens find safety and remain calm .
authorities are working their hardest to contain the outbreak .
it really does make one ask , what the hell ?
of all the messages that could be playing on a radio in an aarp ad , why this one ? via : the right planet
