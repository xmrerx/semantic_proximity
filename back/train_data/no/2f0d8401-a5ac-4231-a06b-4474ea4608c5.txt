monrovia ( reuters ) - one of liberia s leading political parties called for a halt in announcing the result of tuesday s presidential election , citing irregularities in the vote .
the liberty party , whose candidate charles brumskine was considered a front-runner to take over from nobel peace prize winner ellen johnson sirleaf , said it would consider taking legal action if the national elections commission ( nec ) did not act on its demands .
the nec was originally expected to release preliminary results on thursday .
the liberty party is deeply troubled by the discovery of numerous incidents of irregularities and fraud that occurred during the elections , liberty party national chairman benjamin sanvee said in a statement .
we are calling on nec to immediately halt further announcements of election results .
if nec does not cooperate with our request , we will take the appropriate legal action , he said .
he did not give specific evidence of voter fraud and it was unclear what kind of activity could have altered tuesday s vote .
an nec spokesman told reuters that it was unaware of the liberty party s complaint and did not say whether the commission believed illegal acts occurred .
on election day , materials including ballot boxes arrived late in some locations and some people struggled to find their names on voter rolls , witnesses said , but there was so far no evidence that this was linked to illicit activity .
any irregularities would taint the results of an election expected to mark the first democratic transfer of power in over seven decades in a country haunted by a civil war that ended nearly 15 years ago .
liberia , africa s oldest modern republic , was founded by freed u.s. slaves in 1847 but its last democratic power transfer dates back to 1943 .
johnson sirleaf , africa s first elected female president , won a surprise victory in 2005 following a post-war transition .
she was re-elected in 2011 but is barred from seeking another term .
