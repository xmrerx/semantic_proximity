baghdad ( reuters ) - iraqi forces are preparing a fresh attack on kurdish peshmerga fighters , the semi-autonomous kurdistan regional government ( krg ) of northern iraq said on monday .
a military spokesman in baghdad denied that iraqi forces were planning to resume an attack they began mid-october in retaliation for a september referendum on kurdish independence .
the iraqi government put the offensive on hold at the end of october but the conflict with the krg over land , oil resources and border control is still wide open .
a statement from the krg security council expressed alarm at the buildup of iraqi forces in makhmour , southwest of erbil , the capital of the kurdistan region .
baghdad demands the krg cancel the result of the referendum , which delivered an overwhelming yes for independence , and to hand over control of land borders , airports and oil facilities of the kurdistan region .
the krg has refused to cancel the referendum or to hand over the remaining oil facilities under its control , and is offering joint supervision of the land borders and airports .
