are democrat voters willing to risk what little integrity their party has left to get behind crooked hillary ?
will they be inspired to go to the polls to elect someone they know has been under criminal investigation for most of her adult life ?
congressman darrell issa ( r-ca ) , chairman of the house oversight committee , talked with breitbart news daily siriusxm host stephen k. bannon about president barack obama s willful disregard for the law as president and the fbi s decision not to charge hillary clinton for her actions involving top secret emails .
issa said : we are in a crisis because hillary clinton , if the voters do not stop her , will be the next president of the united states .
she will , in fact , on day one say , pardon me , and she ll mean it .
she ll have pardoned herself .
she will have , in fact , gone from being a criminal involved in a criminal enterprise obviously , clinton cash depicted that and somebody who flaunted the security laws , the privacy laws , the presidential and the federal records act , and gotten away with it.via : breitbart news
