After reporter and model, Leeann Tweeden accused Franken of writing a sketch where he d come at her for a kiss, but she planned to turn away to get more laughs.
After he allegedly insisted on rehearsing the moment, she said he came at me, put his hand on the back of my head, mashed his lips against mine and aggressively stuck his tongue in my mouth.
She added it left her feeling disgusted and violated.
Tweeden also shared a photo of Franken grabbing her breasts while she slept on a cargo plane following the event.
I felt violated all over again.
Embarrassed.
Belittled.
Humiliated.
It s very disappointing to hear this about Al Franken.
He was a very funny comedian at this time, he s a Senator from Minnesota, he s a great advocate for women and other, Joy Behar said.Yeah, Joy, tell us how hilarious Al Franken really is, I m sure women all over America are dying to hear about what a cut-up you think the pervert/comedian/elected (barely) lawmaker is.The conversation between The View hags took on a more serious tone for a moment, and for a brief moment, the viewers were given the opportunity to see women who cared more about other women than about politics, but it was only for a brief moment.
Shortly after rabid, leftist, co-host, Sonny Hostin read Franken s apology, she attempted to get assurance from her fellow hags that everything was okay because Franken apologized?
It took all of 1 second for not funny comedian and GROPER extraordinaire, Joy Behar to start asking, What about Trump?
Meghan McCain was quick to remind the hag hosts of The View that it s not about Trump.
Co-host Sunny Hostin was quick to turn the conversation back to Donald Trump, saying, I mean we heard the Access Hollywood tape.
