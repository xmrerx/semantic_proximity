On Friday, Donald Trump broke a 37-year old pledge with China not to recognize Taiwan as a country and called its president.
The reason?
He wants to further pad his pockets by building a new luxury hotel in Taiwan.
With just this one brief phone call, he has likely caused a diplomatic crisis, erasing all of the hard work Obama and other past presidents have done to keep China in our good graces.Friday night on CNN, Anderson Cooper spoke to former Trump campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, demanding answers after this enormous mistake that has left political observers speechless evidently, it left Kellyanne Conway speechless as well, because she had no idea what to say.Right off the bat, Cooper lets loose on Conway, telling her that America doesn t recognize Taiwan as its own nation, and doesn t support Taiwan independence.
He also referenced a tweet from Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy, who stated this is how wars start, in response to Trump s mindboggling break in protocol.
(2) What has happened in the last 48 hours is not a shift.
These are major pivots in foreign policy w/out any plan.
That s how wars start.

Conway awkwardly answers right, and then takes what seems like an endless pause before responding that she wasn t going to discuss details about the incident.Conway goes on to try and compare Trump to President Obama, but Cooper wasn t having it.Watch the full interview below:Featured image via screenshot
