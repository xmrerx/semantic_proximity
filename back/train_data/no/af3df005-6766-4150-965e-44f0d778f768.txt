berlin ( reuters ) - a senior german conservative said on monday that finance minister wolfgang schaeuble would make an ideal president of parliament , raising the possibility of a change of roles for a man long associated with unflinching austerity in the euro zone .
schaeuble has controlled germany s powerful finance ministry since 2009 but the outcome of sunday s federal elections has raised doubts over whether he can hold onto the job .
chancellor angela merkel s conservatives remain the largest bloc in the lower house bundestag and are expected to seek a coalition with the pro-business free democrats ( fdp ) and greens .
the fdp has signaled it would like the finance ministry .
if chancellor angela merkel and schaeuble agree , he would make an ideal candidate for the post of bundestag president , guenther oettinger , the european union s budget commissioner , told the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper .
schaeuble , who has refused to discuss his future after the election , is a hate figure in greece and other parts of southern europe for his insistence on tax hikes and spending cuts at a time of deep economic recession in return for euro zone bailout loans .
but schaeuble , 75 , is widely respected in germany as a responsible steward of the nation s finances and has enjoyed merkel s strong support during the euro zone debt crisis that almost tore the single currency bloc apart .
the current president of the bundestag , norbert lammert of merkel s christian democratic union ( cdu ) , is not up for reelection .
under separation of power rules the bundestag president can not simultaneously hold a ministerial post .
