Bond, James Bond Daniel Craig is out of nearly $50,000 after donating to a questionable Super PAC.
The actor who plays a character that is generally on the right side of the ruse might have been deceived out of a large sum of money.Two months ago, James Bond actor Daniel Craig gave nearly $50 thousand to a super PAC that misrepresented an affiliation to Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), and now has no idea where his money is, or where it is being spent.Craig donated $47,300 to Americans Socially United in July, a super PAC that was previously known by the names Bet on Bernie 2016, and Ready for Bernie Sanders 2016, before the Federal Election Commission deemed the committee to have no link to the Vermont senator.A report that was released Thursday by the Center for Public Integrity called in to question ASU s founder, a man named Cary Lee Peterson, and legitimacy of the organization.
The report also questions whether Daniel Craig and others may have been tricked out of their money, as Peterson has a checkered past, which has been well-documented by the Center.Peterson, whose age and addresses cannot be verified, has has routinely run afoul of creditors and the law including stiffing one of the nation s largest news companies out of a six-figure sum, the report states.Peterson also has a rap sheet, which includes a 2014 arrest in Arizona for disorderly conduct, and a 2007 conviction for extreme DUI, in addition to numerous other financial and legal troubles.A representative for Craig confirmed to Variety Thursday the Briton, who is a U.S. resident, is among a number of Sanders supporters who have unwittingly given money to the third party PAC.Via: Breitbart
