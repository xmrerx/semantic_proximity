luxembourg ( reuters ) - european commission president jean-claude juncker was only joking when he said the english language was on the way out in europe due to brexit , he said on friday .
slowly but surely english is losing importance in europe , juncker told a conference in florence in may , speaking in english before then switching to french and drawing applause from his audience .
asked on friday if french would indeed be the future language of europe , juncker said in english : it s always dangerous to make jokes about that .
i gave a speech in florence in may and i was saying as english is slowly disappearing from europe i will express myself in french .
the french were happy .
the british - i had a shitstorm coming from the other side of the channel , he told students in his native luxembourg .
juncker has had something of a love-hate relationship with britain since becoming head of the eu executive almost three years ago in the face of objections from then prime minister david cameron .
brexit has however raised some questions about the future status of english within the bloc , since once britain leaves it will not be the official language of any member state for eu purposes .
it is a native language in ireland and malta but countries can only nominate one for eu use and they chose gaelic and maltese respectively .
the eu recognises 24 official languages and three english , french and german as working languages .
in french , luxembourg-born juncker added : i think that the european union s linguistic regime gives the different languages equality , except luxembourgish .
