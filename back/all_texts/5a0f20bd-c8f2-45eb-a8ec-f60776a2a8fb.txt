The Clinton Campaign just managed to commit the biggest blunder of the presidential race yet!
Bill needs a hobby!
He s not helping Hillary on the campaign trail.
He had a finger wagging moment with some Black Lives Matter folks and now this!The media are protecting the Clinton campaign, as usual.
According to the mainstream narrative, voters are supposed to believe that Donald Trump presents a mortal danger to American foreign policy because of a penchant to say stupid and reckless things.
Yet it is the Clinton campaign that has said something so outrageous that the prime minister of a faithful ally is demanding an apology, as is the foreign minister of another, and two domestic ethnic voting blocs are up in arms.It all began a week ago yesterday, when Bill Clinton said something outrageous at a Clinton campaign rally in New Jersey:Former US President Bill Clinton said that Poland and Hungary have now decided Democracy is too much trouble, therefore they want Putin-like leadership.
The former US President was speaking about the Central European countries to offer some comparison to Republican candidate and Hillary s potential rival Donald Trump.
Just give me an authoritarian dictatorship and keep the foreigners out, sound familiar?
, Clinton said.
Hungary and Poland would not be free today without the United States and the long cold war, he insisted.
