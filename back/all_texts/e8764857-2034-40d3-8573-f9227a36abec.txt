It can easily be said that Donald Trump is a few sandwiches short of a picnic, and he just proved that fact once again with his latest tweet.Trump, since the start of his campaign, has been telling everyone that he s going to get rid of Obamacare and replace it with something better, and quite honestly if his latest tweet is what he wants liberals will likely get on board.
However, in his idiocy, he probably doesn t realize what he just said.Trump tweeted out: Of course the Australians have better healthcare than we do everybody does.
ObamaCare is dead!
But our healthcare will soon be great.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2017If Trump wants to give us what the rest of the industrialized world has, have at it!
Please do!
!Australia has a Medicare for all program for their citizens, and nations around the world have similar health systems that provide care for their nation s citizens.
They take out the middleman of for-profit insurance, and give direct, affordable care, only increasing taxes slightly, and you no longer have the added expense of insurance premiums.
AND EVERYONE IS COVERED.Now, this isn t likely what Trump meant to say, but it is what he said.The American Health Care Act, better known as Trumpcare, that passed yesterday in the House is simply a gift to the wealthy while stripping insurance and necessary benefits from those who need it most.
That s NOT what Australia has, and would be far worse than anything else in the world.Twitter quickly reminded Trump that he s a moron:@realDonaldTrump Australia is part of the rest of the civilized world that has Universal HC.We can do better.#AHCA#FridayFeeling #TheResistance pic.twitter.com/X1K7f6mAg3 Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 5, 2017@realDonaldTrump And why do you think that everybody else has better healthcare than we do?
Could it perhaps be because of universal coverage?

Yes, let's turn back the clock!

Parker Molloy (@ParkerMolloy) May 5, 2017@realDonaldTrump So you're now FOR Tax payer funded Universal Healthcare???

Kyle McMahon (@KMacMusic) May 5, 2017@realDonaldTrump Will you promise the American people right now to support an Australian-style healthcare system?
Dave Hogg ?
(@Stareagle) May 5, 2017We ll likely see Trump denying he said what he said in this tweet later today, but in the meantime, let s pretend he wants Universal coverage so we all can have a little hope back in our lives.Featured Photo by Getty Images
