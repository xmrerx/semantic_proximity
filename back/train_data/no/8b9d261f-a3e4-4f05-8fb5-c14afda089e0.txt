tokyo ( reuters ) - nato chief jens stoltenberg urged all united nation members on tuesday to fully and transparently implement sanctions against north korea , which he said has emerged as a global threat able to fire ballistic missiles as far as europe and north america .
north korea s ballistic and nuclear tests are an affront to the united nations security council , north atlantic treaty organization secretary general jens stoltenberg said in a joint announcement in tokyo , where he met japanese prime minister shinzo abe .
they pose a global threat which requires a global response , stoltenberg said .
pyongyang has undertaken an unprecedented missile testing program in recent months , as well as its biggest nuclear test yet in early september .
stoltenberg s trip to tokyo comes ahead of u.s. president donald trump s first official visit to asia , which starts in japan on sunday .
talks about north korea are expected to dominate a trip that will include a stop in beijing , where trump is expected to pressure china s leadership to act more decisively against pyongyang .
china is north korea s major ally and trading partner .
rather than dialogue it is necessary to cause north korea to change policies by raising the pressure to the maximum , abe said in a joint announcement with stoltenberg .
trump has warned north korea it would be totally destroyed if it threatened the united states with ballistic missiles and nuclear weapons .
north korea stoked tensions last week when it reiterated a threat to conduct an atmospheric nuclear test over the pacific ocean in a demonstration of its nuclear capability .
