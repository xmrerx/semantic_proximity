on the 75th anniversary of the bombing of pearl harbor in hawaii many have been remembering all those who lost their lives on that fateful day .
it was what brought the united states into wwii and the date , as fdr said , will live in infamy .
yet , as most treat december 7 , as a solemn day , newt gingrich just tweeted out what sounded like praise for what the japanese did to us that dreadful day.gingrich tweeted out : 75 years ago the japanese displayed professional brilliance and technological power launching surprises from hawaii to the philippines .
75 years ago the japanese displayed professional brilliance and technological power launching surprises from hawaii to the philippines newt gingrich ( @ newtgingrich ) december 7 , 2016 professional brilliance and technological power launching surprises ? ?
really ?
that s what gingrich thinks of when he think of the attacks on pearl harbor .
how the japanese surprised attacked us ? 2.403 americans died during the attack at pearl harbor , with 1,178 wounded.gingrich thinks that is professional brilliance ? this tweet is absolutely disrespectful to all those who lost their lives and their families .
there really couldn t be a more weird and awkward tweet to put out on the day we remember pearl harbor.and while relations with japan have since been mended , we must never think what they did that day was at all brilliant .
for goodness sake , someone please take away gingrich s twitter privileges .
he clearly is out of his mind , much like his pal donald trump.featured photo by national archive/newsmakers
