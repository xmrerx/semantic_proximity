Professional Clinton witch hunter Trey Gowdy probably expected the public grilling of FBI Director James Comey to go a lot better than it did.
On Thursday, unsatisfied with the lack of prosecution of a certain person whose name rhymes with Schmillary Schminton, Republicans decided to investigate the investigators.
For hours, Comey maintained a superhuman level of cool as he answered every ridiculous question Gowdy and pals threw at him as they struggled to find something anything they could use to rake the former Secretary of state over the coals.While discussing intent to commit a crime, Gowdy explained to Comey that the FBI director was a white collar prosecutor while he was a gutter prosecutor something that appears to be a dog-whistle term for black people and that the people Gowdy prosecuted were too stupid to know that murder is wrong.Gowdy told Comey that he is reading a specific-intent element into a gross negligence statute regarding Clinton s supposed willful lawbreaking and that s when Comey dropped the hammer: The question you gotta ask is why is it that the Department of Justice since 1917 has not used that gross negligence statute but charging it once in an espionage case.
Whether their decision was smart or not, that is the record of fairness.
So you have to decide, so I treat this person against that record, and if I do is that a fair thing to do?
Even if you re not worried about the constitutionality of it, my judgment is no reasonable prosecutor would do that.
That would be celebrity hunting.Picture if you will Comey picking up his microphone, flattening his palm, and dropping it on the floor.
That s basically what happened.
The look on Gowdy s face was priceless.
Silence filled the room and Gowdy was left with nothing but his dumbfounded expression.Watch it below.
