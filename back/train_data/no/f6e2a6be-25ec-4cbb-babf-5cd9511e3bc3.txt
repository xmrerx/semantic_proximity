so much for putting a stop to the poisonous debate in washington .
the effort to try and mend fences came to a screeching halt when during president trump s unity speech to the baseball crowd congressional staffers jeered and booed .
the staffers even exhibited vulgar gesticulations at president trump.the message of unity was lost on these clowns : washington times reported : mr. trump delivered a message of unity , but some fans in the stands weren t having any of it .
one man shouted an expletive at the video screen as mr. trump was telling the fans : we are showing the world we will not be intimidated by threats .
the episode marred what had been a night celebrating those wounded in wednesday s murderous attack on gop players practicing for the game .
when both teams went to second base the symbolic spot where rep. steve scalise was wounded in the attack at the alexandria practice field to kneel and pray , some mocked the prayer , too .
the fans appeared to be democratic staffers , having booed the announcement of several members of the gop lineup.most fans were in the correct mood , however , chanting u-s-a and giving a loud standing ovation to capitol police special agent david bailey ( pictured below ) , who along with two other special agents at the field wednesday were credited with saving the lives of dozens of lawmakers and staffers .
agent bailey threw out the first pitch .
in the wake of the attack wednesday , leaders in both parties have pleaded for civility in the political conversation .
