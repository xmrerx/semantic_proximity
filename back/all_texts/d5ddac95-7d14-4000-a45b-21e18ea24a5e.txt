There s nothing quite like hypocrisy on the grandest scale imaginable.
So large, in fact, that all you can do is sit there and laugh at how absolutely ridiculous something is.
This is what just happened on Twitter when they decided to call out media bias.Yes, you read that correctly, Fox News whined about media bias allegedly coming from other news organizations.Not only that, they hashtagged it with #BiasAlert to really add an extra layer of nauseating frosting on to the hypocrisy cake.They tweeted out:#BiasAlert: Candidates refer to NYC blast as bomb but #Trump takes brunt of media criticism https://t.co/KEYMx7ddRk pic.twitter.com/u2MkvGVoOp Fox News (@FoxNews) September 18, 2016Let s just talk about this for a moment.
In a tweet that blames other media outlets for correctly going after Trump s irresponsible reaction to a blast in New York City, they are saying that there s media bias.This tweet is the EPITOME of media bias.
It is so ridiculous, in fact, that all other tweets with media bias can now be measured against this one in the future to see how biased something actually is.
Not only do they display their own bias towards Trump, but they have the audacity to say Bias Alert.
That right there is hilarious and kinda sad.Fox News can, without a doubt, be called the media outlet for the Republican party.
They so unapologetically swing to defend all things Republican and conservative that they are blind to their own reality.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons
