People who parrot and spread Trump s claims that the media lies absolutely cannot stand it when they re asked to provide examples.
They try and deflect, just like Trump, except not all of them seem to be as skilled at twisting things around as Trump tries to be (and Trump himself becomes completely unhinged when someone in the media fact-checks him while talking to him).
One caller into a British show ranted and raved about how the media has been twisting all these leaks coming from the White House, and the host, James O Brien, kept asking him for just one example of this.The caller became increasingly agitated at that, because apparently one shouldn t have to have evidence and examples to make a claim like that.
O Brien first wanted to know how the leaks out of the White House could be real, but the news reporting the leaks was fake.
The caller said: What he s trying to say to say is the media twist the leaks.
If they ve just got one paragraph of the truth, they ll add another paragraph that s fake.
When O Brien began pressing him harder for an example, he turned all Trumpian, saying he distrusts, and even hates, the media, but never answering O Brien s questions.
The ending has quite the kicker, though, and the caller s last words are just laughable.
