this is a state that hasn t always been reliably blue .
if this important state ends up being one the gop could win in november , there is going to be a lot of panic in at the dnc nearly 46,000 pennsylvania democrats have switched to republicans since the beginning of the year.according to penn live , some experts attribute the mass exodus to donald trump.there s even a title for the movement .
it s called ditch and switch and calls for lifelong democrats to abandon the party , register republican , and help ensure trump s place in the general election.professor of public affairs at franklin and marshall college , dr. g. terry madonna , tells the paper he has a theory behind the switch .
with the increase in support in exit polls for trump among working class , blue-collar democrats , it is my belief that these are people who fall into that genre , said madonna.the numbers are similar in other states as well .
the paper says in massachusetts , as many as 20,000 democrats have gone from blue-to-red this year with trump cited as a primary reason .
and in ohio , as many as 1,000 blue collar workers have promised to switch parties and vote for trump.numbers show that some republicans are also switching to the democratic party , but nowhere near the numbers that are switching to republican .
