Trump s pick for press secretary, noted numbnut Sean Spicer, appeared on ABC s This Week to discuss, well, various things.
At one point, he was asked about whether Russia actually did try to rig our election, and he decided to deflect instead of actually give us a real opinion on it.
However, his deflection is just plain insane.
Despite the fact that Hillary lost the election, he decided to say: We re having part of a conversation.
Why aren t we talking about other influences on the election?
Why aren t we talking about Hillary Clinton getting debate questions ahead of time?
That s a pretty valid attempt to influence an election.
Well, first off, she lost, so why is Spicer even bringing this up?
Most likely because there s no excuse for Russia meddling in our election, along with the fact that Trump s closeness with Russia looks really bad.
It looks so terrible there s no way to make it look pretty without deflecting.
So, yeah, sure, Russia s bad, but Hillary s worse, and blah blah blah punish her for it!Yes, Spicer said that, too: When are we going to start talking about the other side of this?
Which is: What did Hillary Clinton do to influence the election?
Is she being punished in any way?
PLEASE.
Someone stop these people from embarrassing the whole country any further.
