dubai ( reuters ) - dubai s ruler has pardoned a british man a day after he was sentenced to three months in jail for touching another man at a bar , a legal advocacy group said on monday .
jamie harron , an electrician working in afghanistan , was convicted for public indecency after being accused of touching a german man s behind in a bar .
harron , 27 , denied the charges and said he brushed past the man by accident as he pushed through the crowded room .
the incident at the raucous rock bottom bar , popular among dubai s many wealthy and often tipsy foreign residents and tourists , was reported to police by the accuser .
by special order of the ruler of dubai , sheikh mohammed bin rashid al-maktoum , jamie harron has been freed .
the cases against him have been dismissed , and the sentence imposed by the court yesterday has been nullified , said detained in dubai , a group that assists foreigners facing legal problems in the emirate .
a dubai courts spokesman did not immediately respond to reuters request for comment .
an airlines , business and tourism hub with looser alcohol policies than most gulf arab neighbors , dubai still maintains strict laws against public indecency and homosexuality .
radha stirling , head of detained in dubai , said she hoped cases like harron s would not happen again .
of course , a fully functional legal system would not require outside intervention , and a case like jamie s would never proceed in the first place .
but we are enormously grateful to sheikh mohammed for stepping in .
