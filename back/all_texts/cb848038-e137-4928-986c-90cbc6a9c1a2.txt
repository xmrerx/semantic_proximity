Donald Trump keeps trying and failing to enact a travel ban from many predominantly Muslim countries.
California is enacting its own travel ban, but this one, unlike Trump s, will pass constitutional muster and it s to combat bigotry.The state can t tell its citizens that they can t travel to other states, but there is now a ban on state-funded and state-sponsored travel to states that discriminate against LGBTQ people.
In other words, states that hate won t get California tax dollars.The ban is a reaction to past and recent legislation that would allow people to discriminate against LGBTQ people wanting to adopt and foster children among other forms of discrimination.
The ban currently encompasses eight states.Kansas, Mississippi, North Carolina, and Tennessee were the original states banned by AB 1887, but (California Attorney General Xavier) Becerra added Alabama, Kentucky, South Dakota and Texas on Thursday, citing what he called new discriminatory legislation enacted against the LGBTQ community in those states.Alabama, South Dakota, and Texas all recently passed legislation that could prevent LGBT parents from adopting or fostering children and Kentucky passed a religious freedom bill that would allow students to exclude LGBTQ classmates from campus groups.
While the California DOJ works to protect the rights of all our people, discriminatory laws in any part of our country send all of us several steps back, Becerra said.
That s why when California said we would not tolerate discrimination against LGBTQ members of our community, we meant it.

Red states are pretty comfortable right now in the knowledge that Trump will pick anti-gay judges to uphold their bigoted agendas.While California in no way prohibits its citizens and even its employees from spending their own money in states like Texas, they don t have to encourage it.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images.
