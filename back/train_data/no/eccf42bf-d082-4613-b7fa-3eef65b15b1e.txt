tashkent ( reuters ) - uzbekistan s finance ministry has sacked 562 employees after president shavkat mirziyoyev ordered it to root out inefficiency and get rid of what he had called rats tarnishing its reputation , the state news agency uza reported on wednesday .
the purge followed criticism of the ministry by mirziyoyev last week over what he described as a poorly drafted state budget , failure to finance important projects in various provinces and embellishing economic data .
the ministry employs about 3,000 people and a further 13,000 in subordinate agencies such as the state pension fund .
according to the uza report , the sacked officials were holdovers from a previous minister , a clear reference to rustam azimov , former minister of finance and deputy prime minister sacked by mirziyoyev in june .
the report did not identify azimov by name .
mirziyoyev was elected president last december following the death in september 2016 of islam karimov , who had ruled the country since the collapse of the soviet union in 1991 .
he has reshuffled the cabinet during his first year in power and implemented some economic reforms such as the liberalisation of foreign exchange regulations .
mirziyoyev named djamshid kuchkarov finance minister last month , replacing his previous appointee botir khodjayev who took over the economy ministry instead .
