It s not often enough that we see a story about a good police officer who goes above and beyond the call of duty, which is why this story is so awesome.It s true that police officers around the country have developed a bad reputation.
There are bad apples in every department who can t keep their guns holstered, and they end up killing unarmed individuals for no reason.
The fallout has been swift.
And rightfully so.But there are good cops out there who not only do the right thing at work, they do extraordinary things off the clock as well which should be newsworthy, too.Take Damon Cole of the Fort Worth Police Department in Texas, for example.When he isn t fighting crime as a police officer, Cole takes two weeks off every year and spends it traveling the country visiting cancer-stricken children in hospitals dressed as different superhero characters.
And he does this on his own time with his own money.
I dress up as different Superheroes (Superman, Batman, Iron Man, Captain America and Baymax) and I travel the country seeing children with cancer on my own time and money, he explained on Facebook.
After winter is over I will take 2 weeks off from work and I will go through 20 states in my custom 2012 Superman Dodge Charger to all the children s hospitals.
If anyone on here knows of any children who are sick or have cancer, PM and I will go see them.
I do NOT charge anything, I do all this on my own time and money.
I will go anywhere to make a child happy.
I also go to schools or any community functions to talk to kids about being a police officer then a become a Superhero for them.
Back in October I took a week off from work and I drove to Illinois, Missouri, Indiana, New York City and Tennessee to see children with cancer.
Here are several photos of Cole in action.Cole even started a non-profit organization called Heroes and Cops Against Childhood Cancer.Here s the full post on Facebook.// < !
