Donald Trump s wife Melania, who became infamous for copying First Lady Michelle Obama s speech word for word at the Republican National Convention, recently gave yet another memorable speech this week.
This time, she s being mocked for giving a truly delusional and ironic speech in which she denounced cyberbullying a bullying tactic that her husband is practically an expert on.On Thursday, Trump deputy campaign manager David Bossie got called out by CNN s Jake Tapper over Melania s anti-cyberbullying comments, which eventually turned into an insane conversation about Trump s sexual assault allegations.
Tapper pointed out how aggressive Trump is over the internet when he said: I don t know any major public figure in America who launches more personal negative attacks against people via social media than Donald Trump.
If it s not okay for kids to do it, why is it okay for Donald Trump to do it?
Bossie defended his boss, and gave a truly idiotic defense to insist that Trump doesn t cyberbully: Mr. Trump takes on his opponents and takes on the liberal media, that s not cyberbullying.
Cyberbullying is mostly people hiding behind things.
Mr. Trump takes on those who take him on.
The interview got even more insane when Tapper grilled Bossie on Trump s misogyny and rape accusations, pointing out that a dozen women have now come forward to accuse Trump of sexually assaulting them.
Bossie completely denied facts, leaving Tapper stunned.
As Bossie tried to argue that there was no evidence that those numerous allegations were true, Tapper fired back with several facts about what Trump has been accused of over the last several weeks which made Bossie look like an absolute idiot.
The last few seconds of this interview are nothing but pure discomfort for Bossie, and it is awesome!You can watch Tapper handle the stupidity of the Trump campaign below:Featured image via video screen capture
