How does the old saying go?
The enemy of my enemy is my friend.
Which is exactly the strategy the Clinton campaign is utilizing to move forward against Donald Trump.Hillary Clinton just released a new ad throughout all her social media channels to deliver the message that not only do she and her fellow Democrats want to defeat Trump and believe he is bad news, but so does a majority of the Republican Party.As Trump likes to claim that he is a unifier, the opposite actually seems to be true.
His divisive rhetoric is toxic, and any Republican who values their career, and any conservative voter who values human decency, would be wise to distance themselves as far away as possible from the real estate mogul/reality television star.The ones who have backed Trump have likely done so as a gamble that Trump will win and they can ride his coattails into his administration.
What they don t seem to realize is, they re going to go down in history as backing the guy who called Mexican s rapists, told Muslims they shouldn t be allowed to enter the country, and calls women every name in the book.Trump cannot be allowed to step foot into the Oval Office, and many Republicans agree, as pointed out in this brilliant video put out by the Clinton campaign.
If we re going to unify, we need to do so as a nation to prevent Trump from winning.
For the good of all humanity.Here s the video:"President Trump" is a dangerous proposition.Mitt Romney, Ted Cruz, and Marco Rubio agree.https://t.co/fUkISvgaXC Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) May 4, 2016Featured Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images
