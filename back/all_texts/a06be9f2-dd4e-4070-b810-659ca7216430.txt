Fox News, Donald Trump, and the rest of the half-witted douche-canoes in the Republican Party are an embarrassment to our nation, and the president knows it.
On Wednesday, tyrannical dictator-for-life Barack Obama blasted Trump, his Republicans compatriots and frenemies, and right-wing media, for propagating numerous myths about the American economy.If you turn on the aforementioned propaganda outlet thinly veiled as a news network on any day that ends in -day, you will hear among their assortment of lies that Barack HUSSEIN Obama has killed all the jobs in the country, increased the deficit, that he has increased the number of jobless leeches on welfare by such an alarming amount that the country can not survive, and that America is bankrupt (both morally and financially).The president addressed the assortment of untruths coming from the right.
The primary story that Republicans have been telling about the economy is not supported by the facts.
It s just not, Obama said, blowing the lid off the reason Republicans say and do the crazy things they do:Obama is right Republicans voters, and especially Trump supporters, simply do not care about facts.
Unfortunately for them, the president was there to fact-check the hell out of their ridiculous attempts to malign him, issue by asinine issue.
Though he didn t mention Trump by name, explaining that the billionaire 2016 nominee can advertise himself, simply preys on the prejudices and fears of the Stupid Part of America (a tactic that is unfortunately successful).
If people are feeling insecure and they are offered a simple reason for how they can feel more secure, people are going to be tempted by it, Obama told the crowd of 2,000, adding that Trump s promises make no sense in the real world:There is nothing more awesome than watching the President destroying, one-by-one, the numerous lies regularly spouted by the Right.
