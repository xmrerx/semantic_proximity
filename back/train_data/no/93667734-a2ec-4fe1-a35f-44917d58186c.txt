minya , egypt ( reuters ) - coptic christians in the south of egypt renewed calls on local authorities for an end to discrimination , after a number of churches have been closed down in recent weeks .
two churches in two separate villages in the southern province of minya have been shut down by the authorities , a statement by the minya diocese said .
it said worshippers were harassed at both churches and pelted with rocks at one of them .
we have kept quiet for two weeks after the closure of one of the churches , but due to our silence the situation has worsened ... it is as if prayer is a crime the copts must be punished for , the statement , dated saturday , read .
a third church was closed following rumors of a pending attack , but the diocese said no attack has taken place since and the church remains closed .
the minya security directorate spokesman declined to comment .
the governor s office did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
coptic christians , who make up 10 percent of egypt s population of nearly 95 million , say they have been persecuted for years .
many feel the state does not take their plight seriously enough .
nonetheless , the copts are vocal supporters of president abdel fattah al-sisi , who has vowed to crush islamist extremism and protect christians .
he declared a three-month state of emergency in the aftermath of two church bombings in april which has since been renewed .
though islamic state has long waged a low-level war against soldiers and police in egypt s sinai peninsula , it has stepped up its assault on christian civilians in the mainland .
in an attack claimed by the group in may , gunmen ambushed a group of coptic christians traveling to a monastery in minya , killing 29 and wounding 24 .
