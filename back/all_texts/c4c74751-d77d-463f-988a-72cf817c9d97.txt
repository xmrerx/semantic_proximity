While campaigning for Hillary Clinton in New Hampshire on Monday, Elizabeth Warren just did what she does best, pulverize Donald Trump and his abusive rhetoric and actions.
She went directly for the jugular and attacked his nasty woman comment from the last presidential debate, as well as his clear disrespect for women.Warren lays it all out there and tells the crowd: Donald Trump disrespects, aggressively disrespects, more than half the human beings in this country.
He thinks because he has money that he can call women fat pigs and bimbos.
He thinks because he is a celebrity he can rate women s bodies from one to ten.
He thinks that because he has a mouth full of Tic Tacs that he can force himself on any woman within groping distance.I got news for you, Donald Trump.
Women have had it with guys like you.
And nasty women have really had it with guys like you.Get this, Donald, Nasty women, are tough.
Nasty women are smart, and nasty women vote.
And on November 8th, we nasty women are going to march our nasty feet to cast our nasty votes to get you out of our lives forever.
This received uproarious applause and was a sure sign nasty women everywhere are about to make sure Donald Trump gets nowhere near the Oval Office.Watch Warren shred Trump and ignite nasty women everywhere to get out and vote: Elizabeth Warren to Trump: We nasty women are going to march our nasty feet to cast our nasty votes to get you out of our lives forever!
