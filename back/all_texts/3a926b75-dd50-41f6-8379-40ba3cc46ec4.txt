George Soros gets ugly with the name calling that s typical of the left.
He praised the United Nations representative who called the Hungarian PM a racist and xenophobe .
Doesn t that sound familiar to anyone here in the US who s opposed to the illegal and legal immigrants flooding our Nation?
Threatening the European and American way of life is serious and not to be dismissed by name calling.
We have every right to want to preserve our traditions and culture.
Soros has been behind so much of the chaos attributed to the effort to create a new world order and it should be every American s wish to NOT let that wish come true!
