Yet another reason NOT to vote for this disaster of a Secretary of State!State Department spokesman John Kirby said in a press conference on Friday that Libya has struggled since 2011, when then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton led the charge for U.S. military intervention in the Libyan civil war.
After the intervention in 2011 I think we ve all seen that Libya has struggled since 2011, Kirby said.
He pointed to the power vacuum that dictator Muammar Gaddafi s ouster created as a source of instability, and said that since 2011, violent groups like the Islamic State have filled that vacuum.
We know that groups like ISIL try to use ungoverned spaces there, as they have in Syria, to try to propagate their own twisted form of ideology and violence, he said.Kirby said that the international community is laboring to recover the security situation in Libya.
There is a concerted effort by the international community to do what they can, to do what we must, to try to get at better security and stability there in Libya, he said.
