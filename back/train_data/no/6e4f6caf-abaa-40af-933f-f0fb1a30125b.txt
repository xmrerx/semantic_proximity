ben carson says he s still ironing out his role in the incoming administration of president-elect donald trump , but one thing s certain : he ll have a role in helping craft the replacement plan for obamacare .
i think the replacement obviously must come first and it must be something that is very appealing and easy to understand .
and then , only then , would you dismantle what s in place , the retired neurosurgeon said in an interview.asked if he intends to be involved in designing that plan , carson said , yes , of course .
watch dr. carson explain his role in helping to reshape a health care policy for americans : https : //youtu.be/tdpm7hkkjbicarson , who ran against trump in the republican presidential primary , burst onto the national scene in 2013 when he rebuked barack obama s health care law at the national prayer breakfast , while the president sat a few feet away .
he declined to say whether he was in line for a cabinet role such as secretary of health and human services , or a broader advisory role.trump ran his campaign on a pledge to replace obamacare with a simpler and less expensive plan .
but he s provided no details on what that plan would look like or how he d handle the millions of people who have obtained insurance under the law .
but the election of a republican congress ensures that he ll have the best chance since obamacare passed in 2010 to make that campaign pledge a reality .
