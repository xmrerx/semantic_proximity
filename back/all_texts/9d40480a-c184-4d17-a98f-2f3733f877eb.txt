Donald Trump s anti-Muslim rhetoric has been the focal point of his campaign, and he is showing no signs of stopping that trend at all.
Further, he has stirred it up in his ignorant supporters, and they are lapping it up.
One woman at Trump s New Hampshire rally on Thursday, though, took it to a new level when she told Trump that he should fire TSA workers on the basis of their Muslim faith.
The way she made this statement, though, was stunningly ignorant though nobody should really be surprised at the ignorance of any Trump supporter at this point.The woman stood up and first thanked Trump for his helping veterans (this lady really needs to get her information elsewhere, seriously), and then said to Trump: Get rid of all these hibi-jabis they wear at TSA.
I ve seen them myself.
Instead of correcting this lady s ignorant, offensive statement, Trump told her, we re looking at that.
So, the latest in the amazingly long line of offensive statements Donald Trump has made, he is now saying that he will fire TSA workers for being Muslim.
Nevermind the fact that it is illegal to fire people on the basis of religion, of course.
Trump has already said that he plans on engaging in religious and racial profiling, so, sadly, this is no surprise.The level of ignorance of one s supporters definitely reflects that of the candidate.Watch this stunning display below, via Right Wing Watch:Featured image via Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images
