caracas ( reuters ) - venezuelan authorities have so far released 44 opponents of the socialist government from prison over christmas , but scores more remain in prison , a rights group said on tuesday .
president nicolas maduro s administration said it is freeing about 80 jailed activists in all , but giving them alternative punishments such as community service for crimes from violence to subversion during protests in 2014 and 2017 .
opponents say those being released - and the nearly 200 others still detained - are pawns of a dictatorship that unjustly punishes protest and dissent .
the local penal forum group confirmed 44 people have been released since dec. 23 , but criticized the government for manipulating their cases for political gain .
thirteen of those released were paraded in front of television cameras at a meeting with a senior official , delcy rodriguez , who harangued them but also wished them a happy christmas .
the releases came days before venezuela s government and opposition were due to resume stuttering mediation talks in the dominican republic in early january .
