new york ( reuters ) - a 26-year-old former campaign staffer for republican presidential hopeful donald trump has accused the campaign of sex discrimination , the new york times reported on sunday .
elizabeth mae davidson , who worked as an organizer in iowa for the new york businessman , filed a complaint with the davenport , iowa , civil rights commission , claiming female staffers were paid less than male staffers , according to the report .
she claimed her requests to plan and speak at trump ’ s campaign rallies were ignored while her male peers were allowed to do so , it said .
davidson also claimed that trump had addressed her and a young female volunteer with a remark that referred to the women ’ s appearances , saying “ you guys could do a lot of damage , ” the times report said .
according to the times , trump , in an interview on sunday , denied having made the remark to the two women .
he did not address the other two allegations , the times said , and he said he did not remember davidson but had been told she had done “ a terrible job ” while working on the campaign .
davidson , who was fired on jan. 14 , and her lawyer dorothy o ’ brien did not respond to requests for comment .
hope hicks , a spokeswoman for trump , said the campaign had not been notified that a complaint had been filed .
“ these claims from a disgruntled former part-time employee are without merit , ” hicks said .
“ she is in violation of her contract and continues to disparage the campaign with falsehoods , which , in addition to doing a terrible job , is why she was terminated weeks ago. ” ( reporting by emily flitter ; editing by dan grebler ) sap is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of reuters news agency .
