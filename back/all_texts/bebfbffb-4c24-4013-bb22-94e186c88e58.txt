When a president says one of his main goals is to cure a disease that has killed millions and is one of the main causes of death in the United States, one would think that all would applaud such a noble goal.
Not so with Fox News, who found a way to try and discredit the president for saying he wants to cure cancer.
Here s what the president said last night at his final State of the Union Address: With the new moon shot America can cure cancer.
So tonight I m announcing a new national effort to get it done.
Let s make America the country that cures cancer once and for all.
On Fox and Friends, the hosts said that the president or his writers got the idea about curing cancer from the show West Wing because the words he said were apparently similar to a scene from the hit show.
Rob Lowe s character, Sam Seaborn says: We ve reached for the stars, and never have we been closer to having them in our grasp.
And so I announce to you tonight, we will cure cancer by the end of this decade.
As usual, Fox has the tendency to sensationalize a message instead of applauding the effort of the president.
If you re going to rip off somebody, rip off Aaron Sorkin, said one of the hosts, referring to West Wing s creator.Whether the words the president said are or aren t similar to a television show is irrelevant because the message itself is so much more important.
One can only imagine if the country utilized all its resources to tackle a disease that has wreaked havoc on virtually every American family.Unfortunately, for Fox, finding a way to attack the president takes priority over a wonderful message.
It s typical of their so-called right-wing journalism.Featured image via YouTube screenshot
