San Antonio Spurs coach Gregg Popovich is a total ass.
There is no other way to say it!
This jackwagon claimed on ESPN2 s The Paul Finebaum Show Monday that people have to be made to feel uncomfortable, specifically singling out white people.
It s no secret that he doesn t like President Trump and has made disparaging remarks about the president in the past.
Now he says he thinks all white people should be made to feel uncomfortable?
What a way to piss off your white fans!
Wow!WHO MADE THIS GUY THE ONE WHO DECIDES WHO S COMFORTABLE AND WHO ISN T?
Well, because it s uncomfortable, and there has to be an uncomfortable element in the discourse for anything to change.
Whether it s the LGBT movement, women s suffrage, race, it doesn t matter.
People have to be made to feel uncomfortable, and especially white people because we re comfortable.
We still have no clue of what being born white means, he stated.POPOVICH RESPONDS TO SPURS BEING UNINVITED TO THE WHITE HOUSE:Popovich on #Warriors White House visit being rescinded #Spurs #NBA pic.twitter.com/aY3KyV3uJL Jabari Young (@JabariJYoung) September 25, 2017NBA COACH IS A SOCIAL JUSTICE WARRIOR?
WHO KNEW?
If you read some of the recent literature, you ll realize there really is no such thing as whiteness, but we kind of made that up.
That s not my original thought, but it s true, Popovich said.He added, Because you were born white, you have advantages that are systemically, culturally, psychologically there.
And they have been built up and cemented for hundreds of years.
But many people can t look at it.
It s too difficult.
It can t be something that is on their plate on a daily basis.
People want to hold their position, people want the status quo, people don t want to give that up.
And until it s given up, it s not going to be fixed, the coach stated.REALLY??
