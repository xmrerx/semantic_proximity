How this is even possible?
This man is obviously the victim of an insane law that was somehow allowed to pass without even considering the consequences A Texas man is battling a court order that mandates he must pay tens of thousands in child support for a child whom he did not biologically father and whom he met only once.In 2003, a child support court in Texas ruled that Gabriel Cornejo, 45, had to pay child support to his ex-girlfriend, who had recently given birth, because she vowed there was no way he wasn t the rightful dad.Cornejo, who is currently raising three children of his own and two nephews, claimed he was not made aware of this and only found out about the child support payments last year when a deputy served him with court papers claiming that the state of Texas lists him as having another child.
He soon met the minor for the first and only time describing her as a wonderful girl but after taking a DNA test, learned she was not his after all.He soon met the minor for the first and only time describing her as a wonderful girl but after taking a DNA test, learned she was not his after all.Only Cornejo s ex-girlfriend and the state still want the $65,000 in back payments.Texas family code, chapter 161, states that even if one is not the biological father, they still owe support payments that accrued before the paternity test proved otherwise.
In Cornejo s case, that amounts to some $65,000.
