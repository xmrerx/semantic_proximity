beirut ( reuters ) - lebanon s foreign minister gebran bassil said on friday a crisis triggered by the resignation of its prime minister was part of an attempt to create chaos in the region , in an interview with russia today .
saad al-hariri quit as prime minister in a broadcast from saudi arabia two weeks ago , saying he feared assassination and criticizing the saudis regional arch-rival iran along with its lebanese ally hezbollah .
the actions of hariri , a sunni muslim leader and long-time saudi ally , plunged lebanon into a political crisis , putting the country center stage in the rivalry .
he has yet to return to beirut and is expected to leave saudi arabia this weekend for france , where he will meet with president emmanuel macron .
bassil is touring european and other capitals seeking diplomatic help to end the crisis .
we will respond and we have the full capacities to do so , but we hope it doesn t get to that , bassil said in moscow .
his comments to russia today were reported earlier on friday by lebanese broadcasters al-jadeed , al-manar and lbc without attribution .
french officials said they did not know how long hariri would stay before returning to beirut , but hoped his visit would help ease the crisis by demonstrating he was not being held in saudi arabia .
