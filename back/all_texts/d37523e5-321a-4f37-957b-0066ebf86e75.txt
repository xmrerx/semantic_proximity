Because it was a joke before it was politically incorrect?Before Al Franken became a United States Senator from Minnesota, he had a long career as a comedian (save for Stuart Saves His Family), an original writer on Saturday Night Live, and later as a political radio host on Air America.During that time, and when he was writing books like Rush Limbaugh Is a Big Fat Liar and Lies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right, Franken took some shots at his now-fellow senator John McCain s military service.
He also made one joke in a 2000 Salon.com essay just as presidential election season started picking up steam.
Here s the remark: I have tremendous respect for McCain but I don t buy the war hero thing.
Anybody can be captured.
I thought the idea was to capture them.
As far as I m concerned he sat out the war.
Before everyone suggests Franken need to apologize just like Donald Trump should, here s why this is different: Back in 2000, Franken was not a political figure.
He wasn t a sitting anything or a candidate for anything; the closest he came to political officialdom was as a revered satirist.
More importantly, he even re-told the joke to McCain s face in 2004, when the senator was on Franken s own radio show.Here s how Franken s spokesperson commented on the joke:The fact that a statement came so quickly from Franken s office demonstrates that he is well-aware it is a terrible thing to say about McCain.On the other hand, Trump is not just not apologizing, he s doubling down.
Because he knows we ll all keep writing about it.But hey we all need a good clown, even if unintentional.
It s a long presidential race.
