send target a message don t shop where women and children s emotional and physical safety and privacy are under assault , minnesota chair of the child league julie quist said.the truck is set to visit every target store in minnesota with the hope of reversing the policy.claire chretien , an organizer of the campaign , said , i don t feel safe knowing that at target a six-foot , five-inch , 250-pound man can follow me into a bathroom and store won t do anything about it .
target ceo brian cornell likened the policy to when target included african-american models in advertising in the 1960s , noting its long history of embracing diversity and inclusion .
