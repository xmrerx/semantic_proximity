johannesburg ( reuters ) - south african president jacob zuma appointed general khehla sitole as national police commissioner on wednesday , filling the position on a permanent basis for the first time in nearly three years .
south africa has been without a permanent head of police since zuma suspended riah phiyega in 2015 pending an investigation into her role in the killing of 34 platinum miners by officers during a violent strike over pay in 2012 .
south africa has one of the highest murder rates in the world , while burglary and car theft are common .
tackling violent crime is a top political priority for much of the public .
zuma has been criticized by opposition parties and civil society for previously appointing civilians rather career police officers to the top posts in the service .
sitole had grown through the ranks of the police having joined the service as a constable until his promotion as a lieutenant general in 2011 , zuma s office said in a statement .
general sitole brings a wealth of operational as well as management experience to the sa police service .
zuma appointed his third police minister in under three years in march , drawing further criticism that he has failed to build a stable team to tackle crime .
