barack obama has to be the world s biggest hypocrite .
here he is in 2005 adamantly defending our borders : we simply can not allow for people to pour in , undocumented and unchecked .
@ presssec obama 2005 : `` we simply can not allow for people to pour in , undocumented , unchecked '' .
ouch !

so in 2005 , it was against the law to enter our country illegally , but in 2016 they should not only flood into our country and overwhelm our nation , but they should also vote .
but yeah trump is a racist for trying to clean up the mess obama started .
