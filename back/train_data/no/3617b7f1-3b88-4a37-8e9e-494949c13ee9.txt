donald trump s pride and joy is the tacky , gaudy literal glass tower he lives in , known as trump tower .
it , and other trump structures around the nation and world , are the best indicators of the guy s undeniable and extreme narcissism , so making fun of them is sure to get the donald s knickers in a twist and that is just what google maps did on saturday.for quite some time during the afternoon , trump tower showed up on google maps as dump tower .
this did not go unnoticed on that bastion of internet trollery , twitter .
here are just a few choice tweets , via the hill : look at what cute little google maps did they labeled trump tower `` dump tower '' pic.twitter.com/skz39btb6o mark simone ( @ marksimoneny ) november 27 , 2016rigged !

# dumptrump # dumptower pic.twitter.com/aube7gkjq4 mcbc ( @ mcbc ) november 27 , 2016the best way to get under trump s skin is , of course , is to mock him .
during the election , everyone tried to shame him by painting him as unacceptable , by appealing to the better instincts of the electorate by pointing out his bigotry , misogyny , and other unsavory characteristics .
however , since trump and his supporters have no sense of shame , that didn t work .
however , they do have pride .
they can t stand to be disagreed with , and they especially can not stand to be mocked .
so , keep it up , google maps and everyone else .
mock and troll the hell out of trump for his entire presidency until his head explodes.featured image via spencer platt/getty images
