Donald Trump always believes he s right, no matter what, and even when speaking to a female veteran of the U.S. military he feels the need to be a bully.
It happened again Wednesday night at the candidate forum on military issues on board the USS Intrepid.Rachel Fredericks specialized in aviations operations in the Marine Corps.
She lost two friends to suicide, and she herself has post-traumatic stress disorder.
During the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America Commander-in-Chief Forum Wednesday night, Fredericks asked Trump what he was going to do to stop 20 veterans a day from killing themselves.
Actually, it s 22, Trump replied.
It s almost impossible to conceive that this is happening in our country.
But as the Huffington Post reports, Trump got it wrong and Ms. Fredericks was right.
The Department of Veterans Affairs issued a report which revised the figures and pointed out that the tragic number of veteran suicides per day is 20.Trump couldn t let someone with far more experience than him on the issue offer her statement without butting in and attempting to override her.
That behavior is part of a longstanding pattern on his behalf, a side effect of consistently surrounding himself with a series of yes men and women for decades now.It is also an indication of his leadership style, should he ever reach the presidency.
Instead of listening to those who know better, or who have more experience, Trump only seems to pay attention to the voice in his head that always makes every issue under the sun about him.Even when the issue has been the conservative movement he now leads, Trump has done the same thing.
Commenting on the recent death of anti-feminist activist Phyllis Schlafly, Trump misspelled her name in a tweet and encouraged people to buy the book she had recently written about him.In Trump s mind, he s the only one that matters.Featured image via screen capture
