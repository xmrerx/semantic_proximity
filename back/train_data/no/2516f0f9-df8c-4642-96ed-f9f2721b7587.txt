the citizens of rheinberg , germany can thank the mind-numbingly short-sighted progressives , who thought a country with open borders was a good idea in rheinberg , in the wesel district , for the first time a carnival procession has been cancelled with reference to the refugee situation .
the shrove tuesday procession in the orsoy district will not take place .
a spokesman for the city of rheinberg made reference to the new year s eve attacks in cologne : it can not be excluded that refugees would visit the procession and through , for example , excessive alcohol consumption , scenes like those in cologne would occur.in orsoy , where around 3000 people live , there is a central accommodation institution for the state of north rhine westphalia in a former hospital .
200 refugees live there ; at the start of february another 300 will come.this situation contains a potential for danger , said the city spokesman .
most refugees are not familiar with carnival processions ; in addition , many north africans live in orsoy .
according to initial information , the perpetrators in cologne were also mainly north africans .
650 criminal complaints have now been filed there .
