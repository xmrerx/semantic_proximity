21st century wire says here is a perfect example of a story where the mainstream media will treat the surface narrative without identifying the real underlying scoop the reuters report below reveals how a recent police raid of a phony back alley us embassy in the african capital city of accra , ghana , netted seizures of a number of illicit travel documents , including authentic european union schengen zone travel visas .
it turns out that this organized crime operation was being run by a turkish crime syndicate this is distrurbing when considered in conjunction with recent demands by turkey and its president tayip erdo an , to be given schengen zone free travel throughout the eu for all turkish citizens ( image source : california courier ) last year , turkey was effectively using the syrian refugee crisis to blackmail the eu into paying ankara 3 billion euros in cash as well as schengen free movement for turks in and out of the eu .
