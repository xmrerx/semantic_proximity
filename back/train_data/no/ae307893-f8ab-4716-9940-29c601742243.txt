moscow ( reuters ) - kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said on thursday that moscow regarded updated u.s. sanctions on russia extremely negatively .
the u.s. treasury s office of foreign assets control on tuesday published an amendment which bans u.s. entities from helping sanctioned russian oil companies in exploration or production for deepwater , arctic offshore , or shale projects anywhere in the world .
peskov said extending the original sanctions to cover projects globally was unacceptable for moscow .
