chobani is not traded on the stock market , but is one of the biggest advocates for importing employers to the us from muslim majority nations to twin falls , id chobani ceo hamdi ulukayachobani is owned by turkish muslim immigrant hamdi ulukaya .
chobani has filled 30 percent of its 600 positions at the world s largest yogurt plant in twin falls , idaho , with refugees resettled in america through a u.s. state department program carried out in cooperation with the united nations.ann corcoran , author of the refugee resettlement watch blog , said the potential conflict of interest is disturbing and should be questioned by twin falls residents .
twin falls is really a microcosm of what we find going on in so many of the refugee communities across the u.s. , where you have people moving in and out of government and the chamber of commerce with a vested interest in making sure a meatpacking plant or some other industry has continuous access to refugee labor , said corcoran .
only in this case we have a blatant example of conflicts of interest by an elected official who is also the head of the chamber enticing companies to come in and make use of the steady influx of cheap , overseas labor .
these are jobs that americans would be happy to fill but they are forced to compete now with someone from sudan or iraq who is used to working for a dollar a week .
the local muslim community in twin falls grew out of its mosque and built a new , much larger house of worship last year.here s chobani ceo s response to trump s moratorium on refugees from 7 countries : this is very personal for me , ulukaya wrote in internal memo to his staff that was obtained by cnn .
