sofia ( reuters ) - bulgarian authorities have detained a gang suspected of smuggling migrants from iraq , iran and syria to western europe from turkey , prosecutors said on monday .
the gang of three kurds and four bulgarians was charged with smuggling offences after they transported migrants from turkey into serbia and romania , both countries that border bulgaria .
one member of the group was still not detained , prosecutors said .
south eastern europe was a key point of transit for more than 1 million migrants from the middle east and africa who came to europe in 2015 .
many came to escape conflict in syria .
very few of them , however , stayed in bulgaria , the european union s poorest state .
instead , most prefer to journey onwards to wealthier western eu countries like germany and sweden .
the influx provoked a political crisis for the european union .
flows of migrants have diminished since then , though the bloc is yet to agree on a migration policy .
the evidence gathered indicates that the final destination of the migrants were western europe s countries , a spokesman for the prosecutors office told reuters , adding that some migrants came from countries other than iraq , iran and syria .
the migrants paid 2,000 euros ( $ 2,360.60 ) each for their transportation from turkey to the bulgarian capital sofia .
bulgaria built a fence on its border with turkey and has bolstered its border controls to prevent illegal migration .
last month bulgarian authorities smashed another gang suspected of smuggling migrants into western europe .
