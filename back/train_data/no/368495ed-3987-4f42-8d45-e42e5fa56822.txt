bras lia ( reuters ) - brazilian police raided the offices and homes of two members of congress on wednesday in the country s latest corruption probe as the government makes a last-ditch effort to vote on an overhaul of the national pension system .
dubbed operation pia , the probe centers on alleged bribery of civil servants and politicians in return for rigged bids on road work totaling 850 million reais ( $ 258 million ) in the state of tocantins in central brazil .
federal police said in a statement they were serving 16 search warrants and delivering subpoenas to eight people in connection with the probe .
dulce miranda and carlos gaguim , lawmakers from tocantins , are implicated in the investigation , police said .
gaguim denied any wrongdoing , noting the accusations against him are baseless .
miranda s representatives said she would cooperate with the investigation .
president michel temer has said the lower house of congress would vote by tuesday on his proposed pension reform , which many consider crucial to reining in brazil s surging public debt , or the debate will have to wait until next year .
