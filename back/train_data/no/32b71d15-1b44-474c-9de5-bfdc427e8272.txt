manila ( reuters ) - philippine president rodrigo duterte on sunday expressed his support for same-sex unions , after previously declaring his opposition to gay marriage , in an about-face that may displease bishops in the mainly roman catholic country .
speaking at a gathering of lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( lgbt ) people in his hometown davao city , duterte vowed to protect the rights of homosexuals and invited them to nominate a representative to work in his government .
i said i am for ( same ) sex marriage if that is the trend of the modern times , he said .
if that will add to your happiness , i am for it .
duterte previously was quoted by local media as saying he was opposed to gay unions because marriage in the philippines is only between a man and a woman .
duterte had brought up the gender issue in the past while attacking western countries that allow it , especially those who criticize his brutal war on drugs .
many countries , mostly in western europe and the americas , have already recognized same-sex unions .
australia is the latest to legalize it .
catholic bishops in the philippines , who also oppose duterte s bloody anti-narcotics campaign , have voiced concern over legalizing same-sex marriage after his top ally in congress vowed earlier this year to push for it .
why impose a morality that is no longer working and almost passed , duterte said , in an apparent reference to traditional church teaching on the issue .
so i am with you .
he asked the lgbt community to nominate a representative whom he could appoint to a government post , saying he needed the brightest to replace those he has recently fired over allegations of corruption .
you nominate somebody who is honest , hardworking .
i give you until the second week of january to nominate , he said .
