NEW YORK (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Saturday described as “horror beyond belief” the truck attack in Nice, France earlier this week that killed 84 people.
At the beginning of an event to introduce his running mate, Indiana Governor Mike Pence, Trump also expressed concern for the coup attempt in Turkey on Friday, saying he hoped “it will all work out”.
