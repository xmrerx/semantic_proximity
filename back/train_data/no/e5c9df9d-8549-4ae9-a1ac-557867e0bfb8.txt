arnold schwarzenegger , who replaced donald trump as host of celebrity apprentice , is calling it quits : in remarks friday , the former california governor cited president trump , who has repeatedly mocked the ratings of his reality tv replacement , as his reason .
even if asked [ to do it again ] i would decline , schwarzenegger told empire .
i learned a lot , i had a great time , it was a really great opportunity .
but under the circumstances i don t want to do it again .
with trump being involved in the show people have a bad taste and don t want to participate as a spectator or sponsor or in any other way support the show .
it s a very divisive period right now and i think the show got caught up in all that division .
nyt s tv reporter john koblin made the announcement on twitter : arnold schwarzenegger told nbc he 's leaving `` the celebrity apprentice . ''
