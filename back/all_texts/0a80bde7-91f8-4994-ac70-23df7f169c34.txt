(Reuters) - Zimbabwe s military action was not a takeover of the government and was meant to target criminals , the BBC reported on Wednesday, citing the country s national broadcaster.
The military read out a statement on ZBC in which it said President Robert Mugabe was safe, the BBC reported.
Zimbabwe's envoy to South Africa, Isaac Moyo, also dismissed talks of a coup, saying the government was "intact", the BBC said.
