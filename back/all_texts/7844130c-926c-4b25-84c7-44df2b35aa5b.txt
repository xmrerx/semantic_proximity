WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday said testimony by former FBI chief James Comey showed that he had not attempted to obstruct justice in conversations the two officials held.
“Yesterday showed no collusion, no obstruction,” Trump told reporters at a joint news conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis in the White House rose garden.
“He’s a leaker but we want to get back to running our great country,” Trump said of Comey.
