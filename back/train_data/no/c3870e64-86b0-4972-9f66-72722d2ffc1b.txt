as polls show clinton beating donald trump in kansas and catching up in georgia , another solid red state is showing the presumptive democratic nominee beating the republican nominee.a recent poll conducted by oh predictive insight shows hillary clinton beating donald trump in arizona by 5 points , 47-42 ( with approximately 6 percent backing a third party candidate and less than approximately 6 percent unsure ) .the poll surveyed a whopping 1,060 likely democratic , republican , independent and non-declared voters across the grand canyon state , and found that trump s trailing comes from his serious deficit with women and urban voters .
the last time a democrat carried arizona was in 1996 , when bill clinton was elected to his second term.the pollsters responded with shock at arizona s competitiveness .
mike noble , managing partner of the polling company , said of the findings : it s very surprising to think that hillary clinton may carry arizona , a state that holds the narratives of sb1070 , two nationally known anti-illegal immigration sheriffs , liberal gun laws and consistently conservative constituents .
wes gullet , another partner in the company and a former phoenix mayoral candidate , echoed noble s shock at the results : it s shocking to think that a democratic presidential candidate would carry arizona if the election were held today , considering that every statewide office in arizona is held by a republican as well as significant majorities in the arizona house and senate .
arizona should be a reliable red state .
the poll also showed 10 percent of democrats backing trump while 13 percent of republicans are backing clinton .
clinton also led trump among independents 45-38 , a seven point advantage.in 2012 , mitt romney won arizona by 9 percent .
the fact that clinton nabs independent voters and more republicans than trump does with democrats could turn arizona blue.the state that has given us sb 1070 , jan brewer , sheriff joe arpaio and a cranky john mccain may be turning blue after all .
maybe putting a racist , sexist xenophobe as the republican party s nominee wasn t such a good idea.featured image via sara d. davis/getty images
