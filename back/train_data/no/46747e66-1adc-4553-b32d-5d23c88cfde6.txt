secretary hillary clinton and donald trump have very different views on just about everything .
jimmy always wonders about whether people are really paying attention to those issues or not .
for the most part , he thinks it doesn t matter what a candidate says , it just matters which candidate says it .
to put this theory to the test , we asked diehard members of team hillary if they agreed with some stuff hillary has said .
but the quotes we asked about were not from hillary , they were actually quotes from donald trump .
so will these democrats agree with donald trump ?
