For his final White House Correspondent s Dinner, the White House release a hilarious comedy video, starring President Obama, Vice President Biden, and a cast of famous faces.
The plot of the video showed the President going on a quest to figure out what, exactly, he plans to do with his free time after leaving the White House.Watch @POTUS in "Couch Commander."

He is a natural performer, at home making fun of himself and the weird institutions and traditions of Washington, D.C.The Couch Commander video is quite similar to President Bill Clinton s offering at his last Correspondent s Dinner in 2000.
That showed President Clinton lounging around the White House looking for something to do as the election ran past him, even Hillary Clinton had abandoned him as she went to New York for her senatorial run.
Eventually Clinton ended up with the kid from the then-ubiquitous Dell commercials showing him how to use eBay and send email (it was the turn of the century and still so very new).
Sixteen years later that video is still funny:Featured image via Twitter
