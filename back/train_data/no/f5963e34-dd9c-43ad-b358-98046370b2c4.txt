president trump s deputy assistant sebastian gorka appeared on anderson cooper s 360 show , where he admonished the network for making up news about the trump administration being in crisis and that they were in bunker mentality following the news story that broke about a june 2016 meeting between donald trump jr. and a russian lawyer who promised dirt on hillary , but instead wanted to talk about russian adoptions .
gorka told cooper , it s laughable .
your chyron talked about a bunker mentality .
i actually work in the west wing , i work in the white house .
it is absolutely nothing of the kind , trump s deputy assistant continued , we are pushing the make america great again agenda , the president is a steam locomotive that can not be stopped , it s just fake news .
i m sad to see cnn fall to this .
gorka continued with his tongue-lashing of cnn s stone-faced host cooper anderson : i know you want salacious , sensational coverage for your ratings , so your corporate sponsors and owners will have more money but that s not media , that s not reportage , it s just fake news .
cooper , remained surprisingly stoic as gorka outed cnn s real agenda , which is clearly not reporting actual news , but instead , chasing ratings and ultimately money from advertisers .
when gorka appeared to be finished , cooper replied , okay , i m just going to ignore the insults because i don t think it gets us anywhere .
gorka quickly replied saying , it s not about you , its about actually having journalism back on tv .
where are the walter cronkite s of yesteryear ?
this is just about ratings and money .
it s actually quite sad .
