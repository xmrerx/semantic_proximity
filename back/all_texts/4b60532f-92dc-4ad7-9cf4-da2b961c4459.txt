Throughout this presidential race, Donald Trump has said a number of racist things that have drawn outrage from those who have a soul and merriment from those who are pure evil.
Some were wondering if Trump has just been saying these things to pander to Republican voters, but new audio reveals he s always done some pretty racist things.For instance, back in 2005 while on Howard Stern s radio program, Trump brought up the fact that he put thought into doing a season of The Apprentice that would feature black people versus white people.
Fortunately, NBC knew that idea wasn t going to fly.Trump told Stern and his co-host Robin Quivers: On The Apprentice there was a concept, okay, thrown out by some person, nine blacks against nine whites.
And it would be nine blacks against nine whites, all highly educated, very smart, strong, beautiful.
Do you like it?
Do you like it, Robin?
Quivers responded: I think you re gonna have a riot.
But Trump being Trump, said: It would be the highest-rated show on television.
Then when Stern asked: Very dark blacks, or light-skinned blacks?
Trump responded with, assortment against whites.
After Trump admitted that NBC didn t like the idea (duh) and Stern very astutely made the prediction it would cause tension, Trump declared that it wouldn t cause racial tension, saying: It would be handled very beautifully by me.
Because, as you know, I m very diplomatic Also, I think you d have 35 million people a night watching.
Adding: There s something wrong with it, but I don t know, maybe we should think about it.
It seems as if this was much more than a passing thought or idea in the production office for The Apprentice.
Trump clearly put a lot of thought into how he might be able to make this idea fly and get greenlit.So, if you had any remaining doubt that Trump might not actually be racist, this should clear things up for you.
