lady gaga , who protested in front of trump towers against trump s election and mocked melania trump for wanting to work on the prevention of bullying in schools , says it s important to have tolerance for others in the video below : comedian kathy griffin goes on expletive rant .
we re not sure how many times she tells trump to , f * ck off , but it s quite a few .
we re pretty sure her outrageous behavior based on her abject hate for donald trump would be considered bullying by teachers and parents alike .
but then again , hollywood celebrities and those on the left are experts at telling us and our children how to behave .
rules and socially acceptable behavior just don t apply to them.watch full-fledged bully kathy griffin s embarrassing anti-trump , f * ck you rant : ( warning * * * vile language * * * ) in a much less offensive tweet , adam levine had this to say about donald trump on twitter ( you know social media , where the celebrities in the anti-bully video warn kids are bullied ) .donald trump is one slip into a vat of toxic waste away from becoming an actual comic book super villain .
adam levine ( @ adamlevine ) november 8 , 2012here s cher calling trump a f * cking idiot and hitler in front of a crowd of hillary supporters .
remember , she s a role model for kids of how not to bully other people right ?
