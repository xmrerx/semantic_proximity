The media is reporting that Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are two of the most hated presidential candidates in U.S. election history.
You have Fox News saying Clinton s bad numbers will destroy her, and you have MSNBC saying Trump s negative numbers will destroy him.Whereas the fact remains that, yes, they are both viewed unfavorably by America as a whole, there is way more than meets the eye.For starters, it should be plainly said that no, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are not equally hated by the American people.In fact, in 47 different categories representing a multitude of diverse Americans, Clinton is much more loved than the current Republican nominee.According to Gallup Polling:Basically anyone who isn t a white, Christian male overwhelmingly supports Clinton over Trump, and all of these demographics have a majority positive rating for the Democratic frontrunner.The only people who have a more positive view of Trump over Clinton are: highly religious, Protestant/other Christian, Mormon, male, non-Hispanic white, married men, white males, white-non college graduate, married, men over 50 and those who have some college experience.
The only Christian group that backs Clinton are Catholics.According Gallup s analysis:At the risk of overgeneralization, we can say that the typical American who really likes Clinton and doesn t like Trump is a black, Hispanic or Asian female living outside the bounds of a traditional marriage and who is unreligious.
The typical American who really likes Trump and doesn t like Clinton is a white male who is traditionally married, religious, and a Protestant or Mormon.In today s America, a candidate will need a diverse electorate in order to win, and Trump does not have a broad coalition to make that possible, but the media will continue to talk about Clinton s unfavorable rating to discredit her candidacy.So yes, Trump and Clinton are two most hated candidates in election history, but based on what information?
Well, considering the majority of this country is mad up of either whites, Christians or men, it would seem that Clinton is equal to Trump when standard mainstream media polls are conducted.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images
