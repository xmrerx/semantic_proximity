On Sunday morning, Donald Trump took to Twitter to whine about crowd sizes and brag about his ratings because he s Donald Trump and let s face it did you really expect him to worry about little things like running the country now that he s President?
Watched protests yesterday but was under the impression that we just had an election!
Trump tweeted as most of you were having your morning coffee.
Why didn t these people vote?
Celebs hurt cause badly.

Why didn't these people vote?
Celebs hurt cause badly.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2017Yes, we did have an election and Trump lost bigly in terms of the popular vote.
He is sitting in the Oval Office solely thanks to an archaic system that was set up to protect southern states right to own black people an idea that is quite fine with his racist and horrible supporters.
Naturally, the Internet reminded him that the majority still hates him, and no amount of whining will change that:.
@realDonaldTrump they did.
That's why you lost the popular vote.
And indeed, you are a celeb that hurt their cause badly.
Sietse Bakker (@SietseBakker) January 22, 2017@realDonaldTrump They probably did.
You lost by 3 million votes.
Charles Clark (@CharlesClark) January 22, 2017@realDonaldTrump this is what the leader of the free world is doing at 7:45am on a Sunday.
Little hands, inauguration turnout and brain.
Andrew Hickey (@andrewmhickey) January 22, 2017@realDonaldTrump You lost the popular vote by 3Mil.
We showed up to protest you bc you're garbage.
Ben Berkon (@BenBerkon) January 22, 2017@realDonaldTrump FYI we did vote.
You lost the popular vote.
I'm surprised you don't remember that.
It seems to keep you up at night.
Maria Del Russo (@maria_delrusso) January 22, 2017@realDonaldTrump They DID vote.
You lost the election by over 3 million votes.
Remember?
We just don't have a democracy is all, so you won.
Scott Santens (@scottsantens) January 22, 2017Next, Trump moved on to his favorite thing in the world: ratings, bragging that 31 million people watched the Inauguration, though he failed to note that most of them were watching in horror.Wow, television ratings just out: 31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2017Unfortunately, The Donald wasn t able to get people to show up to see him, as people quickly reminded him:.
@realDonaldTrump Donald, I'm worried you're treating the United States Presidency like a television show, dear.

@realDonaldTrump got:7 mil fewer viewers than BO's 1st #Inauguration3 mil fewer votes than HRC50% fewer attendees than the #WomensMarch pic.twitter.com/52owPPsb5o Khary Penebaker (@kharyp) January 22, 2017@realDonaldTrump wait what?
This includes live streaming which has only been established in recent times.
..also maybe watching in disbelief AJ Joshi (@AJ) January 22, 2017@realDonaldTrump 30m were watching to see if you did a nazi salute or tripped down the stairs kristyan benedict (@KreaseChan) January 22, 2017Ultimately, Donald Trump says he respects peaceful protests or at least the person who took over to do damage control does.
Not-Donald calls peaceful protests a hallmark of our democracy and lauded the right of people to express their views.
Peaceful protests are a hallmark of our democracy.
Even if I don't always agree, I recognize the rights of people to express their views.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2017Trump respects others right to express their views so much that he offered to pay his rabid supporters legal fees during his campaign if they beat up black people at his rallies and he literally just attacked protesters and their right to express their views hours ago.
So, um, people noticed:.
@realDonaldTrump Oh thank God someone got to you, sweetheart.
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 22, 2017.
@realDonaldTrump But next time let's try not to take two hours to go from "Mad King Donny" to "President."
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 22, 2017@BenSRachinger So glad the President agrees that the First Amendment is good.
Phew!
Was worried for a moment.
Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) January 22, 2017@realDonaldTrump Remember when, in 2012, you called for a revolution because Obama lost the popular vote?

Can they be president?
Sean Hartofilis (@BeachPillows) January 22, 2017@realDonaldTrump GIVE THE PRESIDENT HIS PHONE BACK!!!
HE'S GOT CITIZENS TO INSULT!
Jon Bershad (@JonBershad) January 22, 2017@realDonaldTrump who hacked you Austin Gebbia (@DearMorni) January 22, 2017@realDonaldTrump Now you post this tweet after mocking the millions in the #WomensMarch Jeffrey Guterman (@JeffreyGuterman) January 22, 2017@realDonaldTrump yeah but an hour and a half ago https://t.co/Rl3nfbRZ7o Kevin Collier (@kevincollier) January 22, 2017Our country has very real problems that need to be addressed like Trump s executive order, which is step one in Republicans plan to strip healthcare from millions of hardworking Americans.
He should work on cleaning up his own mess rather than hate-tweet about American citizens and try to prove to the world that millions showed up to his sparsely-attended sh*tfest of a Sweet 16 party.
