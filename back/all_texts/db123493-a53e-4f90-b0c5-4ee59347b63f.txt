Watch Barack Obama identify himself as the leader of the Black Lives Matter terror group in video below: In a movement like Black Lives Matter, there s always gonna be folks who say things that are stupid or imprudent.
And I don t think you can hold well-meaning activists who are doing the right thing and peacefully protesting responsible for everything that is uttered at a protest site.
I would just say that everyone who s concerned about police shootings or racial bias in the criminal justice system that maintaining a truthful and serious and respectful tone is going to help mobilize American society to bring about real change.
And that is OUR ultimate objective.
Spoken like a true leader of a radical, disruptive, chaotic movement There are legitimate issues that have been raised.
And there s data and evidence to back up the concerns that are being expressed by these protesters.Was Barack referring to this data?Or maybe he was referring to this data:We d love to see Barack s data, since every legitimate data we ve seen clearly shows more Whites with a gun are killed by police than Blacks with a gun.
