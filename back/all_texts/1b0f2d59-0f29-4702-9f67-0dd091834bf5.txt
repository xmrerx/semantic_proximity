As an American of Polish descent, I am proud to see Poland taking a stand against an invasion of Muslims who seek to forever change the culture and destroy the rich history European nations have enjoyed for centuries.
While other European nations sit back and wring their hands over the rape, sodomy and molestation of their citizens, Poland is taking a strong stand by letting the Muslim migrants know, they are not welcome to invade their country.One of Poland s most popular weekly magazines has splashed a graphic depiction of the rape of Europe s women by migrants on its front cover.
The image may be one of the most politically incorrect illustrations of the migrant crisis to date.While Poland is generally much more relaxed about expressing itself than the self censoring tendencies of western and northern Europe, the cover of the latest wSieci (The Network) conservative magazine has already prompted reaction just 24 hours after release, being beamed around the continent by social media.Featuring a personification of Europa being pawed at by dark hands what the German media would perhaps euphemistically term southern or Mediterranean the headline decries the Islamic Rape of Europe .Making perfectly clear the intention of the edition, the edition features articles titled Does Europe Want to Commit Suicide?
and The Hell of Europe .
The news-stand blurb declares: In the new issue of the weekly Network, a report about what the media and Brussels elite are hiding from the citizens of the European Union .Opening the cover article, Aleksandra Rybinska writes: The people of old Europe after the events of New Year s Eve in Cologne painfully realised the problems arising from the massive influx of immigrants.
The first signs that things were going wrong, however, were there a lot earlier.
They were still ignored or were minimised in significance in the name of tolerance and political correctness .Outlining the fundamental differences between eastern Islam and western Christianity culture, architecture, music, gastronomy, dress the editorial explains these two worlds have been at war over the last 14 centuries and the world is now witnessing a colossal clash of two civilisations in the countries of old Europe .
This clash is brought by Muslims who come to Europe and carry conflict with the Western world as part of the collective consciousness , as the journalist marks the inevitability of conflict between native Europeans and their new guests.The collapse of the West in the face of this Islamic rape was not inevitable though, as Rybinska quoted British historian Arnold Toynbee: Civilisations die from suicide, not by murder .Via: Breitbart News
