beirut ( reuters ) - top lebanese druze politician walid jumblatt on friday criticized the way prime minister saad al-hariri had been treated by some saudi circles , the first time he has appeared to direct blame at riyadh over hariri s resignation this month .
jumblatt also condemned iranian dictates , an apparent response to a statement by the commander of the iranian revolutionary guards this week that disarming of the iran-backed lebanese group hezbollah was out of the question .
lebanese officials say saudi arabia put hariri under effective house arrest in riyadh and forced him to declare his resignation on nov. 4 .
saudi arabia has denied holding hariri against his will or forcing him to resign .
hariri shelved his resignation on wednesday after returning to beirut this week following an intervention by france .
his resignation had thrust lebanon to the forefront of the regional tussle between the sunni monarchy of saudi arabia and shi ite islamist iran .
as lebanese disapproved the unaccustomed way that sheikh saad was dealt with by some saudi circles , we reject this iranian diktat from mohammad ali jafari , commander of the revolutionary guards , jumblatt wrote .
he appeared to be referring to jafari s comment that disarming the iran-backed lebanese group hezbollah was out of the question .
the lebanese have enough experience and knowledge to deal with their affairs through dialogue .
we do not want dictates from across the borders that go against their interests , jumblatt said .
announcing his decision to suspend his resignation , hariri stressed lebanon must stick by its stated policy of staying out of regional conflicts , a reference to hezbollah whose regional military role is a source of deep concern in saudi arabia .
