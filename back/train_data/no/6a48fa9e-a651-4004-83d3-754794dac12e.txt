athens ( reuters ) - tayyip erdogan will travel to greece on dec. 7-8 , greek sources said on friday , in the first visit by a turkish president in decades that have seen ties at times severely strained over issues from aegean sea rights to ethnically-split cyprus .
erdogan is expected to meet his greek counterpart and prime minister alexis tsipras and discuss bilateral relations , security issues and the refugee crisis , following a 2016 eu-ankara deal aimed at reducing migrant flows to europe .
he is also expected to visit thrace in northern greece , where there is a muslim minority .
erdogan last visited fellow nat member greece in 2010 in his capacity as prime minister .
his visit next week will be the first by a turkish president to greece in 65 years .
greece and turkey , nato allies , came to the brink of war in 1996 over the ownership of uninhabited aegean islets .
relations have improved since then but they are still at odds over issues from territorial disputes to cyprus , which remains divided between greek and turkish cypriot communities living on either side of a u.n.-monitored ceasefire line .
eight turkish soldiers commandeered a helicopter and flew it to northern greece as a failed coup unfolded against erdogan between july 15 and 16 , 2016 .
turkey has repeatedly demanded greece hand them over but greece s highest court has rejected their extradition .
greek police on tuesday arrested nine turkish citizens who were later charged with terrorism-related offences .
they are accused of hoarding explosives and of links to an outlawed militant organization responsible for suicide bombings in turkey .
they have denied any wrongdoing .
