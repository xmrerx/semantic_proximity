tokyo ( reuters ) - japan s coast guard found the body of a male and parts of a wooden boat suspected to be from north korea on the coast of one of japan s outlying islands on saturday , an official said .
the coast guard made the discovery around 6:30 a.m. on saturday ( 2130 gmt on friday ) on sado island , which is off the coast of japan s northwestern prefecture of niigata , a coast guard official said , declining to give his name .
the guard also found a pack of cigarettes written in korean and other personal belongings with korean written on them near the body , the official said .
the cause of death is still unknown , the official said .
the discovery on saturday marks the second time this month that parts of a wooden boat suspected to be from north korea have washed up on the shores of sado island , the official said .
finding the body will add to the increasing unease in japan and south korea over north korea s nuclear arms program after u.s. president donald trump redesignated north korea a state sponsor of terrorism , allowing the u.s. government to levy additional sanctions .
on friday , police found eight north korean men near a boat at a seaside marina in northern japan .
the men appeared to be fishermen whose boat had trouble , rather than defectors , the police said .
last week , the coast guard rescued three north korean men on a capsized boat in the sea of japan who said they were fishermen and were later sent home aboard a north korean vessel .
a north korean soldier dramatically defected to south korea last week after being shot and wounded by his country s military as he dashed across the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two countries .
