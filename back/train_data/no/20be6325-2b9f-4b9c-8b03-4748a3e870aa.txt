donald trump just couldn t wish all americans a happy new year and leave it at that .
instead , he had to give a shout out to his enemies , haters and the very dishonest fake news media .
the former reality show star had just one job to do and he couldn t do it .
as our country rapidly grows stronger and smarter , i want to wish all of my friends , supporters , enemies , haters , and even the very dishonest fake news media , a happy and healthy new year , president angry pants tweeted .
2018 will be a great year for america !
