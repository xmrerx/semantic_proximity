A World War II veteran attended the Trump rally today at the Hilbert Circle Theater in Indianapolis.
The veteran asked Donald Trump and Bobby Knight to discuss leadership.
Here s the great response from Bobby Knight: That was very nice of you to say that.
I appreciate that.
But let me tell you another thing about Mr. Trump.
And I think we re a little bit alike in that regard.
If we re involved in something that we want to win, and particularly something that s necessary.
If there s something out there that we need to win, we re going to try and beat your ass every time we can.
