DEMOCRATS Making free and fair elections impossible in America.
Hmmm I wonder why Obama, Hillary and Bernie are fighting so hard to keep our borders open?
According to a new report from The Extract, illegal immigrants in the United States in 2012 were sent to states with lax voter identification laws and told that they would be deported if they didn t vote Democrat.From the report:Report: Illegals Told to Vote Democrat or Face DeportationDocumentarian Jo Anne Livingston has been working with her husband, Luke, to take a comprehensive look at the ongoing border crisis as experienced by the illegals themselves.
After numerous interviews, she recently reported a number of astounding revelations that only confirm some long-held suspicions among conservatives.Most notably, she indicated that witness after witness after witness asserted that they were given voter registrations prior to the 2012 election and sent to states without voter identification laws.Upon receiving the instruction, Livingston explained, they were informed that unless they show up and vote the democratic [sic] ticket, they would be arrested and deported.
Another shocking allegation revolves around proposed legislation she reportedly accessed during research for the documentary.
If passed, she noted that immigration judges would have their hands effectively tied when addressing the overwhelming problem of illegals skipping their court date.
