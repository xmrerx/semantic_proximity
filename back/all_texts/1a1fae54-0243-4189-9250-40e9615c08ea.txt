It s hard not to feel that John McCain, after 30 years in the Senate, is tired of it all.
On Tuesday, he made an admission that s sure to piss off Mitch McConnell, Donald Trump and the rest of the GOP Congress, and I m sure he doesn t care.McCain was asked whether he was one of the few to see the super-duper secret Republican Senate healthcare bill.
His answer was no, but that wasn t even the stunning part (and in a normal world, it would be a stunning admission).
It was what he said next, even if it was an off-the-cuff joke, that really highlights the state of today s Republican politics.
(No, he hasn t seen the bill and) Nor have I met any American that has, he added, according to Bloomberg.
I m sure the Russians have been able to hack in and gotten most of it.

He, and the rest of the Senate, are expected to vote next week on a bill they ve never seen.
Note that these are some of the same people who say Obamacare was rammed through Congress with no debate, when in fact, the bill was debated and amended for over a year before becoming law.
While the legislation was lengthy, every member of Congress and every American would have been able to read it before its passage.
This isn t the case with the bill put forth by the Senate, which is presumably so bad that they re afraid to let even fellow Republicans see it.McCain s also not happy with the fact that Russia is freely hacking into our government.
Even if Trump isn t somehow complicit, he certainly doesn t seem to give a rat s ass about it nor does he want to solve this national security threat.
Instead, he pretends to bury his head in the sand.
Even if that s not collusion, that s a violation of his oath of office.At least McCain, unlike most of his GOP brethren, knows that even when you refuse to see (or show) evil, evil exists.
Now it s time for him to get on board with impeaching Trump.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
