Screw Walmart (which is America s largest gun retailer), Target is busting down social barriers and spreading tolerance and acceptance nationwide!Target Corp. is now America s first retailer to allow transgender people to use the bathroom of their choice, a stark rebuttal of the discriminatory and hateful laws that were pushed in North Carolina and Mississippi.
Not only will the choice apply to their customers, but to employees as well.On their website, the retailer posted a statement titled Continuing to Stand for Inclusivity, and stood firm with the LGBT community, writing:Inclusivity is a core belief at Target.
It s something we celebrate.
We stand for equality and equity, and strive to make our guests and team members feel accepted, respected and welcomed in our stores and workplaces every day.We believe that everyone every team member, every guest, and every community deserves to be protected from discrimination, and treated equally.
Consistent with this belief, Target supports the federal Equality Act, which provides protections to LGBT individuals, and opposes action that enables discrimination.More specifically, Target states that it will welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity, and will not cow tow to the impact to our business, thus putting people over profit.Look at that, a corporation that actually respects the dignities of every customer and every employee.
While Republicans continue to be beholden to corporate entities, maybe they could learn a thing or two about what s good for business and discrimination is never good for business.Target s statement closes with a final reassurance for all those who shop or seek employment:Everyone deserves to feel like they belong.
And you ll always be accepted, respected and welcomed at Target.While the comment section of the post received mostly negative backlash from people vowing to never shop there again, Target has not wavered in their support for LGBT rights.
Again, Republicans could learn something, but chances are they will continue to put profit over people, or their own necks before doing what s right.So until then, let s continue to shop at Target and show our support!
