In the realm of the NBA, Spurs head coach Gregg Popovich has been one of Donald Trump s most vocal critics.
He continued his cluelessness in the video below.
He obviously is watching too much CNN OR MSNBC because he uses some of the same buzzwords flying around.This coach has no idea what s really going on in the White House.
He only likes to spew lies about President Trump just like every other armchair President wannabe.Does politics belong in professional sports press conferences?
We believe it doesn t. Stick to the game and what you know.
Don t spew political talking points for crying out loud.
Popovich only makes himself look like a bitter man who can t get over the election.
