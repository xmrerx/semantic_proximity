The Commercial Airplane Corporation, Boeing, announced job cuts for 2016 are likely to reduce the company s workforce by ten percent, roughly 8,000 jobs lost, according to Seattle Times.
The company cited operating and labor costs as the reason for the job cuts, but that is inexcusable given the company received $8.7 billion in government subsidies and tax breaks in 2013 for building the 777x in the state of Washington.
The company has already eliminated 9,000 jobs in the region since 2012.Boeing epitomizes how the economy is rigged to favor corporations and the wealthy.
Boeing is assisted by the government to increase production and built new operations, and in return the government does not receive any share of the profits.
In the company s efforts to increase profits, the workers and their families carry the burden.
There is no accountability or terms of conditions for companies like Boeing who receive government handouts.
