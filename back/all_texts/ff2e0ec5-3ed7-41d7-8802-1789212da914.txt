There s crazy and then there s nonsensical, conspiratorial, out of your head, paranoid with a tinfoil hat on your head, curled in the fetal position in your mom s basement crazy.
The latter would be radio talk show host Alex Jones.Not only does he believe that President Obama somehow secretly had Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia killed, a man who was 79-years-old and a known smoker and we know died of natural causes, but now he believes that the president has plans for other people as well.
You know, so Obama can finally unleash his true intentions for the nation.
After all, he still hasn t come for anyone s guns or forced us all to be Muslim yet.Jones declared in a morbid Facebook post, this is the season of treason, this is the time of betrayal and we would be fools not to ask the question.
Which clearly begs the question, who is allowing Alex Jones to have any sort of internet privileges?
He s more than lost his mind, he s replaced it with a new bag of nuts.However, he goes on: You just get used to this, Scalia found, it s natural, nothing going on here, he just died naturally.
And you re like, Whoa.
Red flag.
Then you realize, Obama is one vote away from being able to ban guns, open the borders and actually have the court engage in its agenda and now Scalia dies.
I mean, this is hard core I wonder if Clarence Thomas will die of a heart attack next week.
If this is an assassination, it signifies that they re dropping the hammer, that s the canary in the coal mine.
Wait!
There s more!
Are they going to kill Clarence Thomas?
Maybe they ll kill Ron Paul.
Maybe they ll kill Donald Trump next.
They all had heart attacks.
How many more of these are we going to sit here and put up with?
Or maybe their airplane blows up.
Someone needs to tell this guy to relax.
However, he adds: My gut tells me they killed him and all the intellectual evidence lays it out.
The only thing his gut indicates is that he s had one too many cheeseburgers.He then goes on to insist that Republicans need to block anyone Obama nominates, because if they don t liberals are going to destroy the Constitution and start a civil war.
He literally believes Obama is coming after everyone.Jones has said a lot of crazy things in his career, but this may take the cake.
