Danney Williams has been begging for Bill Clinton to acknowledge him for decades.
In the video below, he tells a heartbreaking story of living in poverty and being moved from foster care home to foster care home.
He also tells of a time when Bill Clinton secretly sent money to his mother and state troopers delivered Christmas gifts to their home.
His mother was a prostitute during the time that Bill Clinton was Governor of the state of Arkansas.
Williams says he was told he was conceived after Bill Clinton and his mother were together 13 times.
I guess this is one black life that the Clinton s didn t think mattered so much
