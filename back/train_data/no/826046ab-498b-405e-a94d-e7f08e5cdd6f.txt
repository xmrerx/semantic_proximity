recently , at one of his thank you rallies , donald trump admitted that his supporters yeah , those people who were regularly in the news for beating african-americans at rallies , attacking minorities ( often finding themselves praised by the donald ) , and generally proving that hillary clinton was being generous when she said only half of them are deplorables are violent and crazy .
while the mainstream media portrays these people as what did they say ?
oh , yes , economically anxious rather than racist , violent , deplorable , xenophobic , or any of the bazillion terms that can properly be applied to such individuals , the rest of us had no problem telling it like it is .
even trump , who regularly blasted anyone who insulted his precious little snowflakes , now seems willing to admit that they are awful people .
he s just ok with it ( until anyone who isn t him calls them what they are , of course ) .following the obvious response to the donald applying terms to his followers that previously were verboten in his eyes , trump tweeted perhaps the stupidest thing he has tweeted in a while ( and that s saying a lot ) on sunday .
if my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing , they would be scorned & called terrible names !

donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) december 18 , 2016trump , of course , seems to be referencing attempts to call him out on his cozy relationship with russia , whose leader directly commanded an effort to hack trump s political opponents to help the billionaire secure the presidency .
maybe he meant the peaceful marches in the streets that followed his historic victory ( historic in the sense that no one elected president has lost the popular vote by as much as trump ) .
in any case , he seems to feel that the many crimes committed in his name like when two men trump later called passionate individuals who love this country beat a hispanic homeless man with a pipe and urinated on him pale in comparison to the ongoing effort to expose him as a real-life manchurian candidate ( don t call those men names , though .
wouldn t want to hurt their feelings ) .
naturally , twitter jumped on this latest opportunity to curb-stomp president-elect p * ssygrabber : please @ realdonaldtrump , for your own sake , stop with this nonsense .
you 're demonstrably wrong and the proof is in the numerous hate crimes .
david g. mcafee ( @ davidgmcafee ) december 18 , 2016 @ realdonaldtrump like the ones that spray paint swastikas in the honor of your name ?
or the ones that want americans of different color out of `` your '' country tony posnanski ( @ tonyposnanski ) december 18 , 2016this is a twisted joke , because trump is well aware how violent and racist his supporters are .
