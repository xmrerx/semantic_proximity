are the people who pay to see beyonc perform and buy her music even smart enough to figure out she s waging war against many of them ?
from her lip-syncing of the national anthem at obama s inaugural celebration , to her trip to cuba with her radical husband jay z , they just can t help themselves when it comes to injecting themselves in obama s race war.former mayor rudy giuliani blasted beyonc s halftime performance at the super bowl accusing her of using her platform to attack police officers .
this is football , not hollywood , giuliani fumed monday morning on fox & friends .
at sunday night s big game , the singer used her moments in the spotlight to highlight racial tension with her dancers wearing berets similar to those worn by the black panthers.prior to the performance , some of beyonc s dancers posed for a picture with their fists raised to the sky , evoking the black power salute by two prominent athletes during the 1968 olympic games.they also snapped a similar shot while holding a sign that said justice 4 mario woods , referring to the 26-year-old man shot dead in december by san francisco police .
i thought that she used it as a platform to attack police officers , who are the people who protect her and protect us and keep us alive , giuliani said .
and what we should be doing , in the african-american community and in all communities , is build up respect for police officers and focus on the fact that when something does go wrong , ok , we ll work on that .
