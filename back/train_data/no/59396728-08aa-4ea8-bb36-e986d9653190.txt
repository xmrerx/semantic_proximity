lome ( reuters ) - security forces fired tear gas at hundreds of anti-government protesters carrying out a late night sit-in at an intersection in central lome as part of a bid to force president faure gnassingbe to step aside , witnesses said on thursday .
the opposition chief said earlier that evening that they would remain seated on the tarmac of the dekon crossroads until gnassingbe , whose family has ruled for 50 years , left power .
