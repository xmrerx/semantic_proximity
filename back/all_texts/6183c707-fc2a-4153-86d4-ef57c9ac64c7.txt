After only 16 hours, Microsoft was forced to pull the company s experimental chat bot from Twitter.Microsoft s chat bot, which the company had nicknamed Tay, was introduced to Twitter earlier this week.
The bot was designed to interact with people on social media.While internet bots are nothing new, Tay was unique because of the bot s ability to learn new things from the people it interacted with on Twitter.It didn t take the Internet long to teach Tay how to be a full-blown racist, sexist asshole.Image credit: TayTweets on Twitter, via the Los Angeles TimesAnother unique feature of Microsoft s wonder bot was that it would repeat anything a Twitter user told it to.Here s a screen capture of what that looked like, courtesy of the International Business Times: Image credit: TayTweets courtesy of International Business TimesApparently none of the geniuses at Microsoft saw any of that coming when they developed a chat bot that would learn from, and repeat after, everyone on the Internet.Before Microsoft finally removed the bot from Twitter, it had tweeted out nearly every offensive, racist, sexist comment the Internet could come up with.Tay tweeted, Hitler was right I hate the jews, and I f hate feminists and they should all die and burn in hell.
Not surprisingly, considering the people the bot was interacting with on the Internet, Tay repeatedly praised Donald Trump and his racist agenda, even tweeting at one point, We re going to build a wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it.
After removing the bot from the Internet, Microsoft issued an apology for its inappropriate and offensive tweets, saying in a statement: We are deeply sorry for the unintended offensive and hurtful tweets from Tay, which do not represent who we are or what we stand for, nor how we designed Tay.
The statement went on to say: Although we had prepared for many types of abuses of the system, we had made a critical oversight for this specific attack.
As a result, Tay tweeted wildly inappropriate and reprehensible words and images.
We take full responsibility for not seeing this possibility ahead of time.
It seems to me that anyone who has spent even a little bit of time on the Internet would have absolutely seen this possibility ahead of time.Image credit: screen capture TayTweets on Twitter via International Business Times
