Hillary Clinton breaks out the very phony Southern accent during a speech in Memphis.
This always cracks me up because I m from the South and we can spot a phony a mile away.
Pandering to her base is what Clinton does best.
Just like Obama, she plays to the crowd she s speaking to by adopting their accent or acting like she s just one of them.
This folksy style is cringe inducing for anyone with half a brain but she IS speaking to a group of Democrats soooooo SOUTH CAROLINA: Hillary Clinton sat down for a Chair Chat with the Chairman of the Democratic Party of South Carolina.
During the interview, as in many of her speeches to people who live in the South, she put on a Southern accent that is absent from her speeches to Northerners.
We made a mashup of some of the most painfully pandering moments, and ranked the intensity of her accent with cowboy boots (1 = lowest, 5 = strongest).
