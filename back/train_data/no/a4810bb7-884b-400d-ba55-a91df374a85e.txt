the ara san juan had a seven-day supply of air when it reported its last position on nov. 15 .
the crew had been ordered to return to a naval base in mar del plata after reporting water had entered the vessel through its snorkel .
more than double the number of days have passed where it would have been possible to rescue the crew , navy spokesman enrique balbi told a news conference .
we will continue the search ... there will not be people saved .
some family members criticized the government for giving up , and for its means of communicating .
luis tagliapietra , whose son was on the submarine , said some 12 families had found out the rescue mission was abandoned from the televised news conference .
he also told television channel tn the government had been too slow to say the water entering the sub caused it to short circuit , which the navy confirmed on monday .
the navy had said earlier , on nov. 23 , that international organizations detected a noise that could have been the submarine s implosion the same day contact was lost .
i want to know what happened and i do not believe in any of the official hypotheses , tagliapietra said , his voice cracking up .
i have no words for it .
some families had held out hope for a miracle and were organizing prayer groups together .
balbi said 28 ships , nine planes and 4,000 people from 18 countries were involved in the search covering 557,000 nautical miles - more including radar monitoring .
despite the magnitude of our search it has not been possible to find the submarine , he said .
