Trump isn t smart.
He s a complete buffoon with a temper that s so short it s virtually nonexistent.
But he likes to pretend he s the President of the United States, which means he thinks he s this country s sole leader.
As such, he believes he can do and say as he wishes, even if it means alienating people, countries and groups that we need.During a phone call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, Trump threw a livid fit over an agreement we reached with them under Obama to accept 1,250 refugees.
Trump accused Australia of planning to send us the next Boston bomber, and promptly hung up.
Then, instead of staying quiet or actually (gasp) doing some basic homework and admitting he made a mistake with that, he took to Twitter to double down:Do you believe it?
The Obama Administration agreed to take thousands of illegal immigrants from Australia.
Why?
I will study this dumb deal!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017First of all, 1,250 is not thousands.
Secondly, refugees are not illegal immigrants and Trump s calling them such is dangerous.
Third, how can they be illegal immigrants if they aren t even here yet, and have permission, via a diplomatic pledge and paperwork, to come here?
And fourth, he s not the deal-maker he thinks he is if he believes being a jackass to Turnbull is the way to handle this.Fortunately, here s Twitter, coming to the rescue and giving Trump a much-needed dressing down in front of the whole world:@realDonaldTrump Jesus.
They re refugees.
And Obama agreed to take them in, so they re not illegal.
Tom Coates (@tomcoates) February 2, 2017And there it is, confirmation that Trump really did insult Australia today.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/nBbcR8AZx4 Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) February 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump We have a deal to review 1,250 refugee applications.
You re deliberately deceiving people and it s really worrying.
Hank Green (@hankgreen) February 2, 2017Who haven t I pissed off yet?
Australia?!
Oh I got this.

@realDonaldTrump The Australian immigrants are Muslim refugees literally living in detention camps but nah it s not a Muslim ban.
Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) February 2, 2017I wonder if this is related, @realDonaldTrump.

@realDonaldTrump You should ve studied it before it was written in your immigration executive order.
You re confessing to incompetence.

Colleen H (@ColleenHolt20) February 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump You should build a wall on the border with Australia, that ll stop them coming over and taking our kangaroos.

@realDonaldTrump Good plan, but it s worth studying the facts *before* you tweet.
https://t.co/QdijGh5Jz9 pic.twitter.com/fPtlTZ5GV1 Chris Choi (@thischoi) February 2, 2017By the way these illegal immigrants Trump is ranting about?
They re actually refugees.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/nBbcR8AZx4 Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) February 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump if we agreed to take them, then they ARE NOT ILLEGAL.
Brandon Keating (@BrandonTalks) February 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Please!
You would only study if the book had pictures coloring sections.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) February 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump An honorable president would honor US commitments, regardless.
Mike Elgan (@MikeElgan) February 2, 2017@AmyOtto8 when Australia sends their kangaroos, they aren t sending their best kangaroos.
Comfortably Smug (@ComfortablySmug) February 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump The Prime Minister of Australia just said on national tv that you agreed to the deal he made with Obama.
Are you lying?
Michael Skolnik (@MichaelSkolnik) February 2, 2017@doctorcherokee @iamkawsar @MichaelSkolnik @realDonaldTrump He called it dumb and said he didn t read it.
erin lynn o connor (@erinoface) February 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump why write this on twitter.
I don t get it?
Are you a 15 year old or are you having a meltdown?
Aron Price (@aronpricePGA) February 2, 2017@Tooda @realDonaldTrump HA!

James Alexander (@Tasselguy) February 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump You pissed off Antarctica yet?
Make sure you enrage the whole planet before the week is over.

fucking.
stupid.
Jen Statsky (@jenstatsky) February 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump they re refugees fleeing persecution, you know, like the first settlers in America.
But don t let facts cloud ur ignorance Craig Wilson (@mediahunter) February 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Australia agreed to send thousands of troops to support US in overseas combat over many wars & years.
Study THAT.
#allies Lisa Hurring (@Hypocaffeinic) February 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump you build your wall.
We have our own barrier reef.
It s the best.
Huge.
Really huge.
The finest barrier you ve ever seen.
Mike Cannon-Brookes (@mcannonbrookes) February 2, 2017Too bad the Great Barrier Reef is nearly dead thanks to asshats like Trump who keep saying climate change is a hoax.
They re one of the reasons we weren t able to work to save the Reef.Maybe when he s done with Australia, he can go to work on Canada?
Maybe the U.K., or any one of our other close allies.
Perhaps he ll bomb Antarctica for being one of the worldwide sites for the Women s March on Jan. 21.
This man-child needs his Twitter account canceled and his phone taken away.
He s going to get us destroyed.Featured image by Michael Reynolds via Getty Images/screen capture
