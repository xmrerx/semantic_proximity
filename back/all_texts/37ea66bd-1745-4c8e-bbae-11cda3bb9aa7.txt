As you may already know, Trump recently shocked the nation when he went on Fox News and told Bill O Reilly that the United States is just as bad as Russia.
He s been roundly denounced for what is impossible to characterize as anything other than an incredibly ignorant, asinine comment including by his own party.Retired General McCaffrey may have put it better than anyone in a recent interview with NBC s Hallie Jackson, however.
You know, Hallie, I m actually incredulous that the president would make a statement like that, he said, One can argue that s the most anti-American statement ever made by the President of the United States to confuse American values with Putin, who s running a criminal oligarchy, who kills people abroad and at home, who imprisons journalists, and takes away business property, who shares it with his former KGB agents, who invades and seizes Crimea and eastern Ukraine this is an astonishing state of affairs.
It s hard to know what to think about it.

Perhaps both.Read more:Featured image via screenshot
