seoul ( reuters ) - a fire in an eight-storey fitness center in the scenic south korean city of jecheon on thursday killed at least 29 people , most of them as they were taking a sauna , officials said .
the blaze began in a car parked on the first floor and spread , one official told reuters .
the local fire station said at least 12 women and three men were known to have died .
thirteen bodies were unrecognizable .
the fire station official said most of the victims were found in the sauna , and the main cause of the death was suffocation rather than burns .
