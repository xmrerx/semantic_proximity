A group of anti-Muslim protesters descended on downtown Houston to protest the completed construction of an Islamic library inside of an already existing Muslim community center.
Less than a dozen protesters actually showed up to the protest.
The event was organized by a group called The Heart of Texas.
Apparently, no one associated with the group even bothered to show up the event.The turnout for the counter-protest was huge.
More than fifty people showed up to protest the anti-Muslim protesters.The Facebook event for Heart of Texas protest is loaded with all sorts of fear-mongering: Imagine Texas turning in a muslim [sic] ghetto full of mosques and Islamic Knowledge centers, the group writes.
It s gettin real.
One protester, Ken Reed, wore a shirt that says White Lives Matter said that: This is America.
We have the right to speak out and protest, and that s what we re doing.
We feel that Texas, our great state, and the United States is being threatened by the influx of Islam.
While the Muslim population has grown in Texas over the past decade, particularly in Houston, there isn t any good reason to view them as a threat.
Muslims account for less than 2% of Houston s total population.
That s much higher than the national average, though are still very much a tiny minority in the city.
Keep in mind that 94% of terrorist attacks in the United States between 1980 and 2005 have been committed by non-Muslims.
We re here to show the Muslim community that there are people of faith based and non-faith based philosophies standing in solidarity against racist bigots trying to intimidate them, said Ramon Mejia, an organizer of the counter protest said.It s always great to hear that there are people are willing to stand up to bigotry and intolerance.
Especially in a place that is known for having an abundance of both of those things.You can watch video footage of the protest and the counter-protest below.Featured image via video screen capture
