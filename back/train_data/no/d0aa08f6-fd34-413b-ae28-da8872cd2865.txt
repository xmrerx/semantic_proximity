( reuters ) - about six in 10 people want british prime minister theresa may to remain in her position until the brexit process is completed , an orb poll for the telegraph showed on monday .
the poll , carried out the weekend following may s speech to the conservative party s annual conference , found that 57 percent of voters agreed that the prime minister should stay on at least until brexit negotiations are completed in march 2019 .
only one in five , in a survey of more than 2,000 voters , thought that foreign secretary boris johnson would make a better replacement to may .
may s bid to reassert her dwindling authority seemed to be stymied last week when her speech was interrupted by repeated coughing fits , a prankster , and even letters of her slogan falling off the set behind her .
the speech comes just months after a june snap election saw her party lose its majority in parliament days before the opening of formal brexit talks with the european union .
however , in sharp contrast , the orb poll for the telegraph published on monday showed that just 46 percent of voters thought may was not fit to lead and 43 percent disagreed with this statement .
support for may s conservative party is currently running at 40 percent in opinion polls , the newspaper said .
ironically last week may have actually won the pm some more support .
between pranksters , leadership challenges , set failures and a nasty cough it seems that comes the public have rallied somewhat to her deference , johnny heald , spokesman for pollster orb international , told the telegraph .
