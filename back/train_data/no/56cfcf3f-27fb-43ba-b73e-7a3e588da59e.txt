luanda ( reuters ) - angola s main opposition party has appealed to the constitutional court to annul the results of last month s election , which gave a landslide victory to the ruling mpla , arguing the electoral process failed to comply with the law .
the national union for the total independence of angola ( unita ) presented the appeal , accompanied with boxes of supporting documents rolled into court offices in shopping trolleys , late on friday .
the move comes after the national electoral commission ( cne ) published definitive results on wednesday giving the people s movement for the liberation of angola ( mpla ) 61 percent of the vote and unita 27 percent .
throughout a two-week process of vote counting following the aug. 23 poll , the cne repeatedly rejected formal complaints from opposition parties that the law was not being followed .
the law was completely violated and that means the results which the cne published are invalid , ruben sicato , unita spokesman , told reporters as the appeal was filed .
unita alleges that in multiple provinces the published results were not the product of local vote counting but instead reflected numbers sent to the provinces from the cne s head office in the capital luanda .
the mpla has ruled angola continuously since independence from portugal in 1975 .
the party , which finally won a brutal 27-year civil war against unita in 2002 , continues to enjoy widespread support for securing peace and an oil-fueled economic booms in the years that followed .
but corruption , cronyism and a severe economic crisis thanks to a fall in the price of oil have weakened its support and opposition parties had expected to make larger gains .
we hope the constitutional court does its job , sicato said .
