Is Spirit Halloween really foolish enough to believe no one else will sell this costume?
Thanks to conservative news sources posting about this story, it will likely be the hottest halloween costume this year.
We sure hope bowing down to the PC Police is worth the huge revenue you re going lose you big dummies!Spirit Halloween has taken its Caitlyn Jenner costume off its website, after the Internet exploded in outrage.Right.
Making fun of celebrities is just mean.Based on Jenner s Vanity Fair cover shot from earlier this year, the Call Me Caitlyn Halloween costume sold for $74.99 and included a wig, shorts, padded bustier, and a sash emblazoned with Call Me Caitlyn.
The costume was labeled as unisex with a photo showing a big, hairy guy wearing it.Spirit Halloween hasn t publicly commented on why the costume disappeared, according to USA Today, which added it s still available at AnytimeCostumes.com and at WholesaleHalloweenCostumes.com, for only $49.95.Spirit s marketing director Lisa Barr earlier said the get-up was a celebration of Jenner.Of course it was.
Which is why the guy modeling it looked like someone s sloppy Uncle Lenny.
There s no tasteful way to celebrate Caitlyn Jenner or respect transgender people this way on the one night of the year when people use their most twisted imaginations to pretend to be villains and monsters, Vincent Villano, the spokesman for the National Center for Transgender Equality in Washington, told USA Today.Here s an easy homemade costume idea for anyone who doesn t want to spend the money for a manufactured Bruce Jenner costume:As one might imagine, GLAAD wasn t very pleased either.
When transgender women step out into the world as their authentic selves, they aren t wearing a costume, said organization spokesman Nick Adams.
Companies should think twice before seeking to profit from mocking trans women.
