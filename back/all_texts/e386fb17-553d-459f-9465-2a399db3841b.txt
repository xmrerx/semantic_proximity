Has Bill O Reilly really not learned what he says on video stays on video?Because he clearly thought he could blatantly lie during an appearance on the Today Show on Tuesday morning and get away with it.After being asked by Savannah Guthrie if he regretted defending Roger Ailes when Gretchen Carlson accused the Fox boss of sexually harassing her, O Reilly claimed that he never did such a thing, and that he only commented about Ailes as a boss.
My comments were made to Seth Meyers about what kind of a boss Roger Ailes was, not about the case.
I don t know anything about the case, OK?
Nothing.
So he was a good boss, best boss I ve ever had, and that s what I said to Seth Meyers.
That s all I ve said.
And I m not going to say anything else because I work for this company and I don t really have any insight into anything, so for once in my life I m going to keep my big mouth shut.
Here s the video via Media Matters.But as Raw Story points out, Bill O Reilly blatantly lied to Guthrie s face, because footage of O Reilly s appearance with Seth Meyers exists and clearly shows that the fibbing Fox host defended Ailes by calling Carlson s lawsuit frivolous and that he stands by Ailes 100 percent.
In this country, every famous, powerful, or wealthy person is a target.
You re a target, I m a target.
Anytime, somebody could come out and sue us, attack us, go to the press, or anything like that.
Until Amer and that s a deplorable situation Until the United States adopts the British system of civil law, whereby if you file a frivolous lawsuit and you lose, the judge has a right to make you pay all court costs.
Until we adopt that very fair proposition, we re going to have this out of control tabloid society that is tremendously destructive.
Here s the video via YouTube:Now that it has been established that Bill O Reilly is a liar, it s time for Fox News to take Andrea Tantaros lawsuit that specifically names O Reilly more seriously.Featured Image: Dangerous Minds
