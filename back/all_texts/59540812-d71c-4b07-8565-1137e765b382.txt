Thanks to alternative news sources, DiCaprio has been outed more than once for his extravagant energy- wasting lifestyle.
The lifestyles of climate change advocates like DiCaprio and Al Gore are being questioned every day by reasonable people who want to know why these self-appointed climate change czars are asking everyday citizens to adjust the way they live, while these hypocrites continue to travel by jet or on board massive private yachts with absolutely no reasonable explanation.It looks like DiCaprio is sick and tired of being called a hypocrite and has traded in the private jets in favor of doing the unimaginable traveling with the common man on a commercial flight.Leo DiCaprio is currently shoring up environmentally friendly plans for his foundation s annual gala and auction in St-Tropez, sources tell us.We hear that the star is ditching any private jets and will fly commercial to the glitzy French f te on Wednesday.
