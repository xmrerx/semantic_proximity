During a town hall event in South Carolina, which was televised live on February 18, Donald Trump yet again promised would-be-voters that if he s elected president, he s going to crack down on China.During the town hall, Trump told host Anderson Cooper that if he s elected president he will send cease and desist letters to China and Mexico, telling the two countries to stop ripping off the U.S. Yeah, maybe to China, to stop ripping us off.
I d be sending them to other countries to stop ripping us off.
I d send them to Mexico.
And when I say cease-and-desist orders, maybe it d be equivalent.
Maybe I ll do it with my mouth.
Trump s comments came in response to questions regarding a cease and desist letter sent to his campaign earlier this week, by Republican challenger Ted Cruz.Typical of Trump, instead of addressing the question, he diverted the attention of the crowd away from the issue, talking instead about how the U.S. is being ripped off by the evil foreign people his supporters love to hate.The day before the South Carolina town hall, Trump told a different audience, China has been one of the great thefts of all time, what they ve done to the United States.
We can t let China continue to get away with what they re doing to our country.
While China bashing has been a major theme of the Trump campaign since day one, there s no shortage of evidence to show what a bloviating hypocrite he is on this subject.Back in 2012, former talk-show host David Letterman hilariously humiliated the Donald by exposing his China hypocrisy on The Late Show.Just as Trump was about to go off on one of his signature anti-China rants, Letterman started reading the tags from a line of goods sold under Trump s name at Macy s Department Stores.Of course the products are made in places like China and Bangladesh, where workers are paid pennies an hour, to produce goods sold which are then sold at high end department stores in the U.S.If you re one of the many Americans who has longed to see someone just make Trump shut his mouth, then watch the video below.You won t be disappointed:Image via Wikimedia
