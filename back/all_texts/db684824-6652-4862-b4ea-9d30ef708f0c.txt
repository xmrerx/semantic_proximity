Fox host Chris Wallace pinned bigoted North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory to the wall on Sunday.In response to the Department of Justice slamming his state for violating the civil rights of transgender people, the Republican governor appeared on Fox News Sunday to whine about it instead of staying at home to keep North Carolina from getting hit with the loss of federal dollars.North Carolina currently faces the loss of nearly $1 billion in education funding and millions of dollars in transportation funding if the state continues to defend the discriminatory law known as HB2, which allows business owners to discriminate against LGBT customers and employees for alleged religious reasons.Wallace asked how McCrory would respond to the letter sent to him by the DOJ earlier this week since he has until the end of business on Monday to either refuse to comply or tell them that North Carolina will repeal the law.McCrory complained that the federal government didn t give him enough time and claimed that the Justice Department is trying to make law because gender identity is not covered by the Civil Rights Act.Pressed on whether of not he will take the federal government to court to defend the law, McCrory blamed Democrats for the law by saying that they started the bathroom laws in the first place.
But that simply isn t true.
Democrats did not legalize discrimination against transgender people.
In 17 states and over 200 cities across the nation, lawmakers pass transgender protections allowing them to use the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity.Republicans, including McCrory, claimed that anti-trans bathroom laws are necessary to protect women and children from being sexually assaulted in bathrooms by someone using transgender protections as a way to get into women s restrooms and locker rooms.
The problem is that there is not a single example of a predator doing that, unless you count the men that a conservative Christian group purposely sent into public restrooms to create a problem that doesn t really exist.In fact, Chris Wallace even managed to force Governor McCrory to admit that there is no evidence of transgender people committing crimes in bathrooms.
Why not then just let it go, Wallace asked, if there s not a case of transgender people going in and molesting little girls?
McCrory claimed that he hasn t made any such claims that such crimes would be committed, only to be called out by Wallace.
McCrory then tried to frame the issue as a privacy issue.
Again, Wallace reminded McCrory that transgender people just want to use the restroom and they aren t interested in violating a person s privacy.Wallace then addressed the boycott affecting the state s economy, bringing up that one study found that HB2 has cost North Carolina $77 million and 1,750 jobs.
Rather than accept blame for this negative economic impact, which could get worse if the federal government pulls money from the state, McCrory launched into an attack on Paypal.Here s the video via YouTube:It sounds like North Carolina s Republican governor is preparing to wage a costly court battle with the federal government on the taxpayer s dime instead of just repealing the discriminatory law that caused all the outrage in the first place.
Clearly, North Carolina residents should prepare themselves for further repercussions.
And it s all because they elected bigots to control the state.Featured image via video screen capture
