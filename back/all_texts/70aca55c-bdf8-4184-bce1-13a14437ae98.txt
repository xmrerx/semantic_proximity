Georgia Congressman John Lewis is an American civil rights icon.
He was nearly beaten to death at the infamous Bloody Sunday march in Selma, Alabama, and has since risen through the ranks of Congressional prominence.
On Friday, he sat down with NBC s Chuck Todd for an interview, and when asked if he will be able to forge a relationship with Trump as he has done with presidents past, Rep. Lewis said the one thing no one else in prominent positions of power has been brave enough to say: that Trump is not a legitimately elected president.
He told Chuck Todd:I don t see the president-elect as a legitimate president.
I think the Russians participated in helping this man get elected, and they helped destroy the candidacy of Hillary Clinton.
After Chuck Todd tried to warn Rep. Lewis off of sending that kind of message, Lewis plowed on: I think there was a conspiracy on the part of the Russians and others to help him get elected.
That s not right, that s not fair.
That s not the open, democratic process.
Representative Lewis is correct.
Trump was not duly elected, and should not be taking office.
Aside from that, he is the very demagogue our founders warned us of.
He is dangerous, likely compromised by the Russians, and an unqualified bigot to boot.
We should definitely be listening to Representative Lewis on this one.Of course, the one thing a wannabe strongman like Trump cannot stand is anyone questioning his legitimacy.
He is sure to show his true colors once again by attacking Rep. Lewis for what he said.
