a tweet by actress salma hayek clearly demonstrates how ridiculous the republican party is for supporting donald trump.during a rally in buffalo on monday , the republican front-runner didn t even notice a major slip of his tongue when he confused to the terrorist attacks on 9/11 to the convenience store known as 7-eleven .
i wrote this out , and it s very close to my heart , trump claimed .
because i was down there and i watched our police and our firemen down at 7/11 , down at the world trade center right after it came down .
and i saw the greatest people i ve ever seen in action .
yeah , it s so close to his heart that he couldn t even be bothered to get the date of the attacks right .
and he was in new york when he made the unforced error.trump would end up being crucified on social media for the screw-up , but salma hayek won the internet with her own hilarious reaction .
i am a dyslexic mexican and english is my second language , however even i do not confuse 7/11 with 9/11 , she wrote.here s the post via twitter.i am a dyslexic mexican and english is my second language , however even i do not confuse 7/11 with 9/11 .
# donaldtrump salma hayek ( @ salmahayek ) april 19 , 2016hayek has only been on twitter for just a year now but it looks like she has mastered the art of the twitter burn.this has to be a totally embarrassing moment for trump .
in fact , it s probably the most embarrassing gaffe he has made throughout his hateful campaign .
the man lives and works in new york for his entire life and yet he can t correctly state the date of the worst terrorist attack on american soil which happened in his own backyard and claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people.donald trump is a disgrace and salma hayek just put him in his place with a single tweet.featured image : gage skidmore
