the clintons found more money $ 26 million more .
they ve been using their positions in government to raise money but haven t been reporting it .
hummm , this just keeps getting worse but will they be held accountable for not reporting this money ?
that s the big question the clinton foundation reported thursday that it has received as much as $ 26.4 million in previously undisclosed payments from major corporations , universities , foreign sources and other groups.the disclosure came as the foundation faced questions over whether it fully complied with a 2008 ethics agreement to reveal its donors and whether any of its funding sources present conflicts of interest for hillary rodham clinton as she begins her presidential campaign.the money was paid as fees for speeches by bill , hillary and chelsea clinton .
foundation officials said the funds were tallied internally as revenue rather than donations , which is why they had not been included in the public listings of its contributors published as part of the 2008 agreement.according to the new information , the clintons have delivered 97 speeches to benefit the charity since 2002 .
colleges and universities sponsored more than two dozen of these speeches , along with u.s. and overseas corporations and at least one foreign government , thailand.the payments were disclosed late thursday on the organization s web site , with speech payments listed in ranges rather than specific amounts .
in total , the payments ranged between $ 12 million and $ 26.4 million.the paid appearances included speeches by former president bill clinton to the ni ger ian thisday newspaper group for at least $ 500,000 and to the beijing huaduo enterprise consulting company ltd. , an investment holding company that specializes in the natural gas market , for at least $ 250,000 .
citibank paid at least $ 250,000 for a speech by hillary rodham clinton.the disclosures underscore how much the clintons have leveraged their star power to draw more money not just for their personal enrichment but also for the benefit of their philanthropic work.read more : wapo
