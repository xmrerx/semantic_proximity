general mcinerney is on fire in this interview !
general mcinerney is calling for president trump to prepare for war with north korea and calls this trump s cuban missile crisis .
mid-interview ( the 1:50 point ) is when general mcinerney drops the songbird nickname wow ! you can tell their is no love lost between the general and mccain .
why did he call mccain songbird ?
many believe that john songbird mccain spilled his guts to get out of being tortured .
there is evidence that mccain received special medical treatment from a soviet physician and other considerations to avoid being tortured just so he could come home.no one disputes that mccain was a vietnam pow , he spent 5 years in captivity in north vietnam when he was shot down in his skyhawk dive bomber on oct. 26 , 1967 , and was taken prisoner with fractures in his right leg and both arms.despite the notoriety he received upon his return he has been the subject of damning articles , and criticism by other veterans , and for good reason .
mccain has a lot to hide , and has gone to great length to keep what happened in vietnam a secret.he voted against a bill that was otherwise unanimously passed that would have released sealed records that would have revealed what happened in vietnam , presumably because those records would have confirmed his dishonorable actions .
