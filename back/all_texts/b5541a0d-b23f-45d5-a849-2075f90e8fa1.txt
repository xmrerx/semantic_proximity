Republicans might have Congress and the White House, but they don t have the people or public opinion on their side, and it shows.
When House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) tried to attack the Affordable Care Act on Twitter today, he learned that the hard way.Here s the tweet in question: Retweet to agree #Obamacare is failing.
We need to reverse the damage that has been done.

Huh.
That s weird before Obamacare, there was less choice, no central marketplace, insurance companies could reject you for preexisting conditions or set a lifetime cap on coverage, tens of millions weren t insured at all, and insurance companies could take as much profit as they wanted instead of spending on healthcare.However, little things like facts don t get in the way of the bloviating of bullshit artists like Paul Ryan.
Luckily, twitter users instantly tore his lies apart: @SpeakerRyan When is your retweet to agree democracy is failing tweet Dave Levitan (@davelevitan) February 5, 2017@SpeakerRyan Trump is failing.
Get rid of him first.

(@WIrebelalliance) February 5, 2017@SpeakerRyan You mean damage by providing health care to those who otherwise couldn t afford it or get coverage?
Kim D (@KimDHello) February 5, 2017@SpeakerRyan you should start by reversing the damage you caused.
Not A.
Snake (@SnakeInPants) February 5, 2017@SpeakerRyan re-fund the risk corridor subsidies that you defunded despite industry leaders telling you it would cause wild rate hikes.
Not A.
Snake (@SnakeInPants) February 5, 2017@SpeakerRyan Like to agree Paul Ryan should give a plan for replacement before repealing millions of people s insurance.

The problems were caused by your obstruction.
Chris O Brien (@ChrisOB617) February 5, 2017@SpeakerRyan I need Obamacare.

(@realAlexaParker) February 5, 2017@SpeakerRyan why are you getting gold plus healthcare with no pre-existing condition options.
We all deserve your gold standard healthcare Oh Juliet (@justdreamin91) February 5, 2017@SpeakerRyan How about you and your lying partners come up with an actual plan before pretending you have a #BetterWay?
A. Lethe (@Axel_Lethe) February 5, 2017@SpeakerRyan #Obamacare is NOT failing.
Stop your stinking lies.
You are an enemy of the American people if you repeal ACA.
Barbara Drake (@barbaradrake) February 5, 2017@SpeakerRyan 1.
Repeating a lie won t make it true.
2.
Shouldn t you be concentrating on making sure Trump doesn t start WW3?
Maloofs (@MMVarney) February 5, 2017This one sums it up perhaps best of all:@SpeakerRyan pic.twitter.com/jVi92Thkt4 Oh Juliet (@justdreamin91) February 5, 2017@SpeakerRyan without replacement plan; pure recklessness.
makes you look small minded, spiteful and uncaring #ACA CMKO (@hellocindy) February 5, 2017@SpeakerRyan still all talk and no plan and most of us know it is NOT failing so stop with the lying rhetoric Kathy Pruitt (@KathyPruitt54) February 5, 2017Is the ACA perfect?
No.
After all, insurance companies are still taking 20 percent of the money that could be spent entirely on healthcare.
However, Republicans want to move in the opposite direction.
They re not out to help people at all.
That s why, instead of developing a reasonable alternative, they have spent years and millions of taxpayer dollars trying to repeal Obamacare with no replacement.
And, now that they have power, they fully intend to do so and leave the American people stranded without a fallback.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
