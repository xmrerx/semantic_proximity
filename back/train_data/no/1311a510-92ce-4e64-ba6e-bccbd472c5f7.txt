dublin ( reuters ) - ireland s foreign minister will raise dublin s concerns over the impact a trade dispute between the united states and canada s bombardier could have on northern ireland s peace process when he meets commerce secretary wilbur ross this week .
the u.s. government last week slapped a preliminary 220 percent tariff on the planemaker s cseries jets , which are partly made in northern ireland , potentially risking 4,200 jobs in the british province .
bombardier is northern ireland s largest manufacturing employer and its political leaders have warned washington that the security of the economy in britain s poorest region plays a crucial role in efforts to maintain peace .
three decades of bloodshed between catholic irish nationalists , who want the province to unite with ireland , and protestant unionists , who want to remain part of the united kingdom , left 3,600 dead before peace was reached 20 years ago .
washington played a key role in helping to strike the 1998 good friday peace agreement , and the irish foreign minister s intervention will add to pressure from belfast and london , where prime minister theresa may s minority government relies on the support of northern ireland s largest unionist party to govern .
i will be outlining to him ( ross ) the irish government s concern as to the potentially serious implications of a negative ruling for the bombardier workforce in belfast and for wider economic stability in northern ireland which is an essential support to the peace process , simon coveney said in a statement ahead of his two-day trip to washington .
