the best part of the 60 minutes interview was when trump told the dumb @ @ leslie stall this when asked if he would build the wall : what we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records , gang members , drug dealers , where a lot of these people , probably 2 million , it could be even 3 million , we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate , he said in the interview , to air on 60 minutes but we re getting them out of our country ; they re here illegally .
only then , trump said , will he figure out a plan to deal with the terrific people who are in the u.s. illegally but have otherwise clean criminal histories .
securing the border , he said , is a prerequisite for any other action on immigration one unchanged part of his immigration platform has been his plan for the construction of a wall along america s southern border with mexico , something he said he would force the mexican government to pay for by threatening to cut off the flow of money from immigrants to their families south of the border .
trump said sunday that while an actual wall will be necessary along some portions of the border , a mere fence will suffice in others .
i m very good at this ; it s called construction , he said.president-elect donald trump says the wall on the mexican border may have fence segments , tonight on # 60minutes : https : //t.co/n4zku8f3mk pic.twitter.com/bcmtxgcyfh 60 minutes ( @ 60minutes ) november 13 , 2016
