WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Senator Marco Rubio on Monday said he will vote to back President Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, despite the former Exxon Mobil Corp CEO’s “troubling” responses before lawmakers regarding Russia.
“Despite my reservations, I will support Mr. Tillerson’s nomination in committee and in the full Senate,” Rubio said in a statement posted on Facebook ahead of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee’s vote on Tillerson later on Monday.
A vote in the Republican-controlled Senate is expected shortly afterward.
