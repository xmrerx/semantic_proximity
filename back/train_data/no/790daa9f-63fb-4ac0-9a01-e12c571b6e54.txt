bucharest ( reuters ) - thousands of romanians were protesting in the capital bucharest and cities across the country on sunday against plans by the ruling social democrats to overhaul judicial legislation .
the plans , initially announced by the justice minister in august and currently in under debate in parliament , could put the judicial system under political control in one of the european union s most corrupt states .
thousands of magistrates , centrist president klaus iohannis , the european commission and diplomats have all expressed concern about the proposed legal changes .
an estimated 12,000 people were marching towards parliament in bucharest on sunday shouting we don t want to be a nation of thieves .
thousands more were protesting across the country .
the ruling social democrat party has said it aims to approve the judicial overhaul by the end of this parliamentary session .
the most contested changes include overhauling a judicial inspection unit , which oversees magistrates conduct and the way in which chief prosecutors are appointed .
earlier this year , attempts by the ruling coalition to weaken a crackdown on high-level corruption triggered romania s largest street protests in decades .
judicial and fiscal changes have dominated the social democrats agenda since coming to power following an election last december .
plans to significantly overhaul the country s taxes have put pressure on romanian assets .
the president and major investors associations have urged the government to scrap the changes which they have said will throw the economy into upheaval and strain the budget deficit .
a major trade union has started the process of calling a general strike and other unions have announced protests set for later this month .
the government postponed a meeting to discuss the fiscal changes until nov. 6 .
