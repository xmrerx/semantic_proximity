Donald Trump s speech proposing extreme vetting for immigrants through the use of an ideological test was just completely ripped to shreds by retired Navy Adm. James Stavridis.During a Tuesday morning interview on MSNBC s Morning Joe, Stavridis said Trump s address lacked specifics and was a where s the beef type of speech.
Referring to Trump s promise that he would work closely with NATO on counterterrorism, Stavridis said, I think he made a reasonable stab at hey, we ought to try to take some international action.
He kind of said, good dog, NATO.'
Trump also claimed on Monday that he deserves the credit for convincing NATO to finally take terrorism seriously since they created a new division focused on terror threats in response to his criticisms on their lack of action regarding terroristic threats.
Stavridis was quick to call bullsh*t on this ridiculous notion and continued to stomp Trump s speech into the ground.
You know, NATO has had that counter-terrorism division forever, Stavridis continued.
What really was lacking in the speech is anything about how the inter-agency of the government would work together, how we d use intelligence, how we d use cyber, private/public communication, strategic communication.
The only strategic communication I heard was, I hate Muslims.'
