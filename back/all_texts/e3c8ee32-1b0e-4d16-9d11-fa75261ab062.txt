BERLIN (Reuters) - More than half of Germans, 57 percent, want a three-way coalition between Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and Greens to govern their country, a Forsa survey for Stern magazine showed on Wednesday.
Merkel s conservatives emerged from a Sept. 24 national election as the biggest party but in need of a partner or partners to form a government.
A Jamaica coalition of the conservatives, FDP and Greens - so called because their black, yellow and green colors, which match those of the Jamaican flag - is untested at the national level but is shaping up to be the most likely option.
The Social Democrats (SPD), junior partners in Merkel s ruling coalition for the last four years, want to go into opposition after suffering their worst result since 1933.
Only 26 percent of Germans wanted a continuation of the grand coalition between conservatives and SPD, the survey of 1,003 people conducted between Sept. 28 and 29 showed.
