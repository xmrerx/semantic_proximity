beirut ( reuters ) - syria s army and its allies have encircled islamic state in the city of al-mayadin , southeast of deir al-zor , in eastern syria , a syrian military source said on sunday .
al-mayadin is one of the last strongholds of islamic state as it falls back upon the fertile area downstream of deir al-zor in the euphrates valley and launches counter attacks in the central desert after losing swathes of territory this year .
units of our armed forces with the allied forces continue their advance on a number of fronts and axes in deir al-zor and its countryside ... and encircle daesh terrorists in the city of al-mayadin , the military source said .
the army and its allies reached deir al-zor in september after a months-long offensive across the syria desert , and have in recent weeks pushed down the euphrates towards al-mayadin .
however , counter attacks by islamic state in the central desert region have put pressure on the main supply road to deir al-zor from western syria .
syrian president bashar al-assad is backed in the war by russia , iran and shi ite militias including lebanon s hezbollah , and its campaign against islamic state has mostly been on the west bank of the river .
a u.s.-led coalition is also supporting a rival campaign against the jihadists , mostly on the east bank , where it is close to recapturing raqqa , and has also advanced downstream to hold areas opposite deir al-zor .
u.s. officials have previously said that islamic state had relocated some of its diminished command and propaganda structures to al-mayadin as it was forced from territory elsewhere .
