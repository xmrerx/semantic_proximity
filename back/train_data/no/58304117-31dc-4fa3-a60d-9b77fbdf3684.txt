moscow ( reuters ) - the kremlin on thursday called a u.s. decision to withdraw the congressional press credentials of russia s rt broadcaster because of its status as a foreign agent in the united states an unfriendly step .
kremlin-backed rt on wednesday night published a letter from the executive committee of the congressional radio and television correspondents gallery saying the channel s congressional press credentials had been withdrawn due to its registration as a foreign agent in the united states .
that means rt s reporters will not be able to have as much access to congress as other foreign media .
it is a very unfriendly step .
we are deeply disappointed , kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters on a conference call on thursday .
the united states decided to designate rt as a foreign agent in retaliation for what washington described as russia s attempts to meddle in the 2016 u.s. presidential election , something moscow has repeatedly denied .
in response , russia introduced its own law allowing it to designate u.s. and other foreign media as foreign agents .
peskov said that the russian parliament might give an emotional response to the new congressional restrictions on rt .
