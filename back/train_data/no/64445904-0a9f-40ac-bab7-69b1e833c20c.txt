istanbul ( reuters ) - a turkish court released prominent journalist kadri gursel from jail pending trial late on monday , in a case that targets the opposition cumhuriyet newspaper and has been condemned by critics of president tayyip erdogan as an attack on free speech .
television footage showed gursel hugging his wife and colleagues as he emerged from jail at silivri , west of istanbul after some 330 days in custody .
this is not something to be really happy about .
there are cumhuriyet staff who have been jailed due to unjust , baseless allegations , gursel told reporters outside the jail .
prosecutors say cumhuriyet was effectively taken over by supporters of fethullah gulen , a u.s.-based cleric blamed by the government for last year s attempted coup , and that the paper was used to target erdogan and veil the actions of terrorist groups .
the newspaper and staff have denied the charges .
four more prominent staff of cumhuriyet , correspondents and executives , remained in custody after the third hearing in the case , including editor-in-chief murat sabuncu .
the rest of the 17 defendants are free pending trial .
prosecutors are seeking up to 43 years in jail for the newspaper staff , who stand accused of targeting erdogan through asymmetric war methods .
social media posts comprised the bulk of evidence in the indictment , along with allegations that staff had been in contact with users of bylock , an encrypted messaging app the government says was used by gulen s followers .
rights groups and turkey s western allies have complained of deteriorating human rights under erdogan .
in the crackdown since last july s failed coup , 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 detained or dismissed from their jobs .
around 150 media outlets have been shut down and 160 journalists jailed , the turkish journalists association says .
