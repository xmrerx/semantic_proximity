washington ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump spoke with palestinian president mahmoud abbas on tuesday amid reports the united states is planning to formally recognise jerusalem as the capital of israel , a source familiar with the call told reuters .
a senior administration official said last week that trump would likely make the announcement on wednesday , a decision that would break with decades of u.s. policy and could fuel violence in the middle east .
trump adviser and son-in-law jared kushner said the president had not yet made a final decision .
