These assholes were taken to the woodshed and they deserved it.After British diver Tom Daley failed to make the final round of the men s 10m platform, a right-wing Christian group called Christian Voice cheered on Twitter and used the occasion to claim that being gay somehow prevents athletes from being successful.Turning gay doesn t seem to have done Tom Daley any favours at #Rio2016 https://t.co/tdbT0Y5acx Christian Voice (@UKCV) August 20, 2016Well, Harry Potter author J.K. Rowling refused to let that slide and slammed them on her Twitter feed.
Can t decide which is more offensive in this tweet, the stupidity or the spite.

@jk_rowling @UKCV I m a (moderately conservative) evangelical minister, and I m horrified by that tweet.
What were they thinking?
Alistair May (@AlistairMay) August 20, 2016 @jk_rowling I m trying to think back to my Sunday school lessons that taught hate your neighbour, oh no wait, there was t one.
Karla (@KarlaGeorge) August 20, 2016That people turn gay and that it affects diving.
That s two stupids vs one spite.
A gold medal to stupidity, silver to spite.

Jessica Klingelfuss (@jessklingelfuss) August 20, 2016 @jk_rowling I think it s the fact they spend their time thinking about who other people find attractive.
Weirdos.
