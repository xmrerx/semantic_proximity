With the Republican National Convention looming, everyone is trying to find out whether the Republican Party is seriously going to adopt Donald Trump s plan to ban Muslims from entering the United States.
Republicans have, for the most part, kept their lips sealed about the matter.Appearing on CNN s State of the Union Sunday morning, Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus did not offer much clarity on the matter, despite being grilled by the show s host, Jake Tapper.Tapper pointed out that Trump s new running mate Mike Pence has expressed strong condemnation over Trump s proposal, calling the idea unconstitutional.
Help me understand what s going to happen here.
Is there going to be a total and complete ban on Muslims coming into the United States until we can figure out what the hell is going on.
Or is there not going to be one?
That s when Priebus started to play the GOP s new favorite game, dodge the question.
If you ve seen the last few weeks, the position that he s put on the table, the position papers on his website, what he s been talking about is a temporary ban on immigration from countries that harbor and train terrorists until me get a better vetting system.
Sure, Tapper countered, That proposal that you just enumerated is different than what he said in December.
And he has said that he has not backed off or changed his position.
For the rest of the interview, Priebus insists that Trump has not changed his position on banning all Muslims from entering the United States.
Yet bizarrely, Priebus also keeps insisting that Trump has decided that he no longer wants to ban all Muslims from entering the United States.You can t have both, Priebus.
Either Trump changed his position or didn t you can t have both.You can watch the interview below.Featured image from video screenshot
