paris ( reuters ) - the united states has disqualified itself from the middle east peace process due to its recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital , said palestinian president mahmoud abbas on friday .
the united states are no longer an honest mediator in the peace process , we will not accept any plan put forward by the united states , said abbas , speaking through a translator at a joint news briefing in paris with french president emmanuel macron .
abbas also condemned a threat by u.s. president donald trump to cut off financial aid to countries that voted at the united nations against the united states decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital .
on thursday , more than 120 countries defied trump and voted in favor of a united nations general assembly resolution calling for the united states to drop its recent recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital .
macron reiterated on friday that france remained committed to a two-state solution , namely one in which israel and palestine peacefully co-exist side-by-side with one another .
macron added that france would recognize a palestinian state at the right time , and not under pressure .
