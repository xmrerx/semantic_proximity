it s no secret that team trump is all in a tizzy over jill stein s recount attempts in multiple states , but eric trump may have just entered a whole new level of idiocy with what he just said and posted on twitter.he tweeted a link to a forbes article entitled , the cost of stein/clinton s wisconsin vote recount could have saved at least 5,000 children s lives , which says nothing about the legitimacy of the recount at all , and is simply a fun clickbait fallacy for the right wing to circlejerk around .
and he tweeted it with the caption , the sad truth : the cost of stein/clinton s # wisconsin vote recount could have saved at least 5,000 children s lives .
