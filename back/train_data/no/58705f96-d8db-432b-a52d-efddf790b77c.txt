while speaking about illegal immigration at a campaign rally in bloomington , il , today , trump noticed a man wearing what appears to be a homemade t-shirt that said legal immigrant for trump .
only one day after being grabbed by an audience member with ties to isis the fearless trump then did what no other candidates in this race have done .
he spontaneously called one of his supporters up to the stage.this isn t the first time that trump has asked a member of the audience to come up to the stage and give a spontaneous speech .
being able to genuinely connect with everyday americans is a yuge part of trump s appeal .
it s a characteristic that can t be faked , and so far no other candidate has been able to replicate his sincere desire to make america great again for every age , race , social class and gender .
we believe it s why he s winning.https : //youtu.be/lm6lgitkiz4
