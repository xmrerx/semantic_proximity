Donald Trump s Inaugural Address received poor reviews for it s divisive and negative tone, not to mention the countless lies and promises he won t keep.
But apparently, Fox News liked it that way.Trump portrayed America as a dystopian wasteland where inner cities are run by criminals, the military is crippled, and poverty is a plague across the land even though crime is down, the economy is strong with unemployment below five percent, and the military is the most funded in the world.Trump also suggested that President Obama was a tyrant who kept control of the government away from the people even though President Obama was duly elected by the people in 2008 and 2012 with a bigger popular vote and electoral vote margins than Trump received in 2016.Fox News, however, loved Trump s speech and Trump appreciated them kissing his ass so he tweeted about it on Saturday morning.A fantastic day and evening in Washington D.C.Thank you to @FoxNews and so many other news outlets for the GREAT reviews of the speech!

@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews The speech had such a 1930s classic feel to it.
That s just Mein opinion.

Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) January 21, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews #Trump s #Inauguration speech was the worst in U.S. history.
It was nativist and jingoistic.
