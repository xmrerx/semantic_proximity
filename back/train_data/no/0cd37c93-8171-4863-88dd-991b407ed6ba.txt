london ( reuters ) - a british ship escorted a russian vessel as it passed near uk territorial waters over christmas , britain s defense ministry said on tuesday , adding that russian naval activity near britain had increased in the holiday period .
the frigate hms st albans departed on dec. 23 to track the new russian warship admiral gorshkov as it moved through the north sea .
the royal navy vessel monitored the russian ship over christmas and will return to dock in portsmouth later on tuesday .
uk defense minister gavin williamson said in a statement after the incident that he would not hesitate in defending our waters or tolerate any form of aggression .
relations between britain and russia are strained , and uk foreign minister boris johnson said there was abundant evidence of moscow meddling in foreign elections during a trip to russia last week .
his counterpart sergei lavrov said there was no proof for johnson s claim .
while johnson said he wants to normalize relations with russia , moscow blames london for the poor state of relations between the countries .
britain s defense ministry said another ship , hms tyne , was called to escort a russian intelligence-gathering ship through the north sea and the english channel on christmas eve .
a helicopter was subsequently dispatched to monitor two other russian vessels .
