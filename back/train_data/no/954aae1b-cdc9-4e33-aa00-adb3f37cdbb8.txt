delbrueck , germany ( reuters ) - turks can safely come to germany , chancellor angela merkel said on sunday , dismissing a warning from ankara that its citizens should take care when traveling there due to what it said was an increase in anti-turkish sentiment .
tensions between berlin and ankara have been bubbling for months and turkey s warning on saturday came after germany s foreign ministry said on tuesday germans traveling to turkey risked arbitrary detention even in tourist areas .
i want to say very clearly that all turkish citizens can travel here , merkel said in the northwestern german town of delbrueck during a campaign event ahead of a sept. 24 election .
no journalists get arrested here and no journalists get put in custody .
freedom of opinion and the rule of law prevail here and we re proud of that , merkel said .
she pointed to german-turkish journalist deniz yucel , who has been detained in turkey for more than 200 days .
he is one of 12 german citizens now in turkish detention on political charges , four of them holding dual citizenship .
we think there s no justification at all for him being in prison and the same applies to at least 11 other germans , merkel said .
merkel , who infuriated the turkish government last weekend by saying she would seek an end to turkey s membership talks with the european union , is expected to win a fourth term in the upcoming election .
polls give her conservatives a double-digit percentage lead over their rival social democrats ( spd ) .
