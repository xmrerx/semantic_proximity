a stunning melania trump accompanied president trump as they arrived in paris , france for bastille day celebrations .
the first lady wore a red two-piece suit .
beautiful ! most notable was that she wore her long hair in a chic chignon .
the word chignon comes from the french phrase chignon du cou , which means nape of the neck .
wonderful ! the full welcome ceremony : president donald trump and first lady melania trump receive a royal welcome to paris by president emmanuel macronwithin an hour of touching down in france , our first lady visited a children s hospital : she spoke fluent french to the patients and staff .
melania trump famously speaks 6 languages fluently. # flotus visiting a paris hospital within about an hour of arriving in france .
