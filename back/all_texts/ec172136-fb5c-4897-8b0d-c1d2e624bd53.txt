Donald Trump betrayed Americans on Tuesday by proving to be exactly as large an environmental threat as was predicted.
Trump gloated on Twitter that he was signing authorizations to move forward both with the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines.
Signing orders to move forward with the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines in the Oval Office, Trump tweeted Tuesday afternoon.
The Washington Post reports:Dealing a blow to former President Barack Obama s legacy on climate change, President Donald Trump signed executive actions Tuesday to advance the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access oil pipelines, a move cheered by congressional Republicans and decried by environmentalists.Trump told reporters at the White House that the actions on the pipelines will be subject to the terms and conditions being negotiated by U.S. officials.Not everyone is happy about Trump s new order.
Americans know this pipeline was unfairly rerouted towards our nation and without our consent.
The existing pipeline route risks infringing on our treaty rights, contaminating our water and the water of 17 million Americans downstream, said Dave Archambault II, chairman of the Standing Rock tribe with whom thousands upon thousands of protesters have joined in opposition to a plan to route the Dakota pipeline under a lake near the tribe s reservation.
Such a move, anyone with critical thinking skills realizes, would threaten the area s water supply and sacred Native American sites.The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers agreed late last year to begin an environmental assessment and consider alternative routes, but it is unclear what will happen now that Trump has given his go-ahead.
It seems the whole of Twitter also disagrees with the move.
Angry Americans lashed out at Trump via his Twitter account:Signing orders to move forward with the construction of the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines in the Oval Office.

@realDonaldTrump Why is everyone in that room white?
You know other races and ethnicities exist right?

@realDonaldTrump "We must get lead out of the drinking water in Flint, and put chemicals in the drinking water everywhere else."

How could you, Trump?

Shame on you.

@realDonaldTrump @POTUS Let's have you and all your family move next to that pipeline and see how you feel about it.
Matthew Rodrigues (@RodriguesMatt) January 24, 2017So far, Trump has signed executive orders attacking Americans healthcare and women s rights, as well as this new one that will act as a yuge assault on our environment.
At every turn, it is becoming more and more clear that he views you and me as enemies.
We must resist Trump at every turn if our country is to survive the next four years.Featured image via Twitter
