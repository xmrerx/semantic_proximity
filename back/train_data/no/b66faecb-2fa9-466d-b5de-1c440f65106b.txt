bangkok ( reuters ) - thai authorities have arrested 16 people who were protesting against the construction of a coal-fired power plant , drawing criticism of the military government from rights activists and environmentalists .
the planned power plant in the southern province of songkhla will consist of two 1,000-megawatt units , and is part of a power development plan to 2036 , but activists object to its expected environmental and health impact on communities in the area .
the 16 protesters were arrested on monday as they traveled from thepa district , the site of the plant , to the provincial capital to present a petition to prime minister prayuth chan-ocha , who was due in the city on tuesday for a meeting .
this incident shows the true face of thailand s military dictators , who have committed a long list of abuses and repressions since the may 2014 coup , sunai phasuk , thailand researcher for u.s.-based group human rights watch , told reuters .
six protesters were injured in a scuffle with police , said anti-coal activist supat hasuwannakit .
the use of force was uncalled for , supat told reuters .
a few police officers were injured , police said , adding that the 16 had been charged with blocking traffic , assaulting authorities , and resisting arrest .
police have requested that a court detains them .
tara buakamsri , country director for greenpeace southeast asia , said in a statement the action against the protesters reflected a complete failure by the government to promote a peaceful and inclusive society .
the thepa power plant has no legitimacy to be built , the group said .
the first unit of the power plant is due to begin operating in 2021 .
its environmental health impact assessment was completed in august and is pending approval by the national environment board .
