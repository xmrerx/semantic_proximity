senator jeanne shaheen justifies leaking phone conversations of president trump !
she says that trump s tweeting is a problem and that it s a serious situation .
she s on the foreign relations committee ! msnbc s chris matthews asked shaheen what she thought of officials leaking the conversations : my experience is that when people feel like they need to leak something like that , it s because they have concerns about what s going on and i think that s one of the challenges .
when we have a president who tries to make national security policy or foreign policy through tweeting , then we have a problem , and my guess is that s why people are leaking this kind of information , because they want the public to know how serious this situation is .
what in the world is this woman talking about ?
under no circumstances is this ok !
shaheen is on the foreign relations committee !
her website says : as a member of the u.s. senate committee on foreign relations , senator shaheen is committed to helping build strong international alliances to bolster america s national security and boost our economy.how will it help international alliances if the world leaders are fearful of leaks if they call president trump ?
