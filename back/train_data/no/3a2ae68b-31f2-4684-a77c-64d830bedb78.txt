ankara ( reuters ) - turkish warplanes struck kurdish militant targets in northern iraq on tuesday , killing three militants , the military said , as part of a widening campaign against the outlawed kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) .
in a statement , the military said the air strikes targeted the zap region , the turkish name for a river which flows across the turkish-iraqi border and is known as zab in iraq .
the air strike was the second on tuesday and the third in the past two days since turkish soldiers started a military drill along the iraqi border .
the army was training tank guns and rocket launchers across the southern border on tuesday , less than a week before a kurdish independence referendum in northern iraq .
the show of force ahead of the vote reflects the scale of concern in turkey , which has the largest kurdish population in the region , that the plebiscite could embolden the outlawed kurdish pkk which has waged a three-decade insurgency in turkey s southeast since 1984 .
the turkish air force has frequently struck against pkk units in the mountains of northern iraq .
the group is designated a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and european union .
