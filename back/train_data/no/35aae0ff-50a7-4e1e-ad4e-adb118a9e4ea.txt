london ( reuters ) - the leader of britain s main opposition labour party , jeremy corbyn , and other politicians could lose their seats if proposals to cut the cost of politics go ahead , a report suggested on tuesday .
under former prime minister david cameron , the governing conservative party pledged to reduce the number of lawmakers from 650 to 600 to make cost savings after criticism of expense claims made by those working in parliament .
the independent boundary commission has made proposals to make sure most electoral districts in england , scotland , wales and northern ireland are roughly equal in the number of voters , meaning certain seats , like corbyn s , are set to be abolished .
but it is not clear whether parliament will back the plan , which is not due to take effect until 2022 .
since losing the conservatives parliamentary majority at an election in june , prime minister theresa may is dependent on the support of a small northern irish party , the democratic unionist party , which has opposed any changes in earlier votes .
labour has also said it would vote against the measures , accusing the conservatives of using the review to pursue their own political advantage .
the daily telegraph newspaper said if the changes had been in place before the june election , may s conservatives would have won a majority .
