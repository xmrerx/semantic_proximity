Not an omnibus, everything, minibus.
And it, on the subject of security, as you know, all of us, anyone who serves in government or civically involved takes an oath of office to protect and defend.
Support and defend the Constitution of the United States.
Our first responsibility is to protect the American people and our constitution.
If people are not safe, how can we proceed in any other way?
