Huckabee s not hiding his frustration with Trump s potential pick for Secretary of State.
He tells Fox and Friends he believes thinks if Trump chooses Mitt Romney, it would be a real insult to those who voted for him.
It s not about that I don t care for Mitt personally but I m still very unhappy that Mitt did everything he could to derail Donald Trump.
He didn t just go after him from a standpoint that I disagree with his policy on immigration or I disagree with his policy on taxes.
He attacked him on a personal level on his character and integrity And so it would be a real insult to all those Donald Trump voters who worked really hard.
That s what I believe he has to stop and consider.

@GovMikeHuckabee: Choosing Mitt Romney as Secretary of State would be a big insult to all those who voted for Trump pic.twitter.com/hizFmHCEvJ FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) November 23, 2016Trump supporters took to Twitter today to voice their opposition to a Secretary of State Romney.
For a while #NeverRomney was trending on Twitter until suddenly, and for no apparent reason, Twitter removed it from the trending list.
Here are a few examples, starting with our favorite conservative on Twitter, Paul Joseph Watson of InfoWars, who reminds us of the open disdain Romney had for Trump while Trump was fighting for his life against a tsunami of #NeverTrumper s and Hillary s coordinated media complex:#NeverRomney let's get this trending!

Trump s decision has not come without any conflict.
The choice for the secretary of state position has been delayed by an internal struggle between the supporters of Romney, and those suggesting the former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani.
