Sometimes you ve got to laugh especially if you re the Democratic nominee, who is currently facing down a level of unbridled hatred that rivals all previous presidential candidates with the exception of Barack Obama.
Recently, Hillary contracted pneumonia or, if you listen to our friends on the Right, she s on her deathbed and completely unfit to serve as President because reasons.
The downright comical reaction to this, coupled with the numerous right-wing anti-Hillary witch hunts like Benghazi and the manufactured controversy over her emails, is enough to give one a chuckle but it s even more fun when one of the ignoramuses who subscribe to such ridiculous notions stops by one of her rallies to tell the Democratic nominee how he really feels about her.As Hillary spoke to a crowd in Greensboro, North Carolina, a heckler screamed: F*ck Hillary.
Hillary s reaction was priceless.
As the crowd cheered for her and Hillary chants broke out, a grin formed on the face of the former Secretary of State, quickly turning into a chuckle then a full-blown laugh.
Now, I just want to have a conversation and other people can wave their arms and their signs, she said after the moment passed, going back into her speech like nothing happened as the heckler was escorted out.Interestingly, she didn t order her supporters to attack the man.
She didn t lash out, she didn t insult him.
She respected his right to display a dissenting opinion.
This is something you would never see at a Trump rally, where the 2016 nominee s basket of deplorables regularly beat protesters especially the elderly and minorities senseless for expressing themselves.Vote for the candidate who can keep her cool in November the future of our nation depends on it.Watch the incident below: Featured image via screen capture
