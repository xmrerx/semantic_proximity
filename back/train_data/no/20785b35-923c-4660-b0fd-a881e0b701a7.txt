maputo ( reuters ) - gun battles last week between police and attackers in a remote northern mozambican port killed 16 people , including two police officers , local media reported .
the attacks in the indian ocean port of mocimboa da praia , near the border with tanzania and offshore gas fields , took place last thursday and police have since regained control of the town , the official aim news agency said .
the motive for the attacks were not clear and the government has not blamed the opposition group renamo , against which it fought a civil war for almost two decades that ended in 1992 .
fighting has periodically erupted since but a ceasefire has been in place since earlier this year .
we need to know who they are , what their motives are , and where they came from , celmira da silva , the governor of the northern mozambican province of cabo delgado , told radio mozambique .
local media have reported that the attack was carried out by islamists but the government has not confirmed this .
mozambique has not been a focal point of islamist militant activity .
mozambique police were expected to hold a press briefing in the capital maputo on tuesday about the attacks .
