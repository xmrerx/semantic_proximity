it s only logical that the people who supported bernie sanders , the anti-establishment candidate would be more attracted to a successful business man who s never spent a day of his life as a politician .
making the decision to support donald trump , who said he would only run if our nation got so bad he couldn t take it any longer , to a woman who s spent her entire life scratching and clawing her way to the top , and harming anyone who got in her way of her ultimate goal seems like a no-brainer .
the $ 21 million hillary pulled down from speaking engagements on wall street over a 2 year period might have something to do with it as well .this week at the democratic national convention , much of the focus was not on nominee hillary clinton , but on bernie sanders and his enthusiastic contingent of young supporters.while some had speculated that sanders supporters would fall in line after his endorsement of clinton , it appears that this consolidation has yet to gain any momentum.bernie supporters , emboldened by the recent dnc email leak , took to the streets in philadelphia to voice their displeasure with hillary and the democrat party as a whole.with chants of hell no dnc , we won t vote for hillary and lock her up , the protesters made it clear they would not be casting their votes for hillary clinton .
but who would they be voting for instead ? campus reform went to the dnc to speak with these protestors about how they planned to vote in november , and the results will be shocking to many .
i m throwing this race to trump !
said one protester i was strong for bernie , and now i m taking a stand for trump , said another.when asked why he would be voting for donald trump , one protester noted that , as he spent time talking to trump supporters , we agree on a lot of the major issues that we re facing in this country .
we re both mad about the same things .
citing the anti-establishment nature of the sanders and trump campaigns , one protester pointed out that , for some people , bernie is the person they stuck with , but there are some anti-establishment things they want , and they ll go with trump .
