berlin ( reuters ) - german parties in exploratory talks on forming a coalition government agreed on thursday to stick to climate goals that envisage cutting co2 emissions to 40 percent of 1990 levels by 2020 , sources said .
but negotiators from chancellor angela merkel s conservatives , the greens and the pro-business free democrats ( fdp ) did not debate concrete measures such as a possible exit from coal-based energy production , the sources added .
one source added that the initial agreement still needs to be approved by party leaders at later meetings .
germany needs to implement additional measures to reach the 40 percent emissions reduction goal otherwise it will only achieve a 32 percent cut in co2 emissions .
