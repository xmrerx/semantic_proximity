tomi lahren , the conservative media pundit , and newly-minted fox news personality is the reason for blonde jokes .
lahren previously blasted black nfl athletes who choose to kneel instead of stand during the national anthem in a silent form of protest against racial inequality and police brutality .
we don t like it .
it s a disgrace to us , she shrieked while admitting that she has no idea what they are protesting .
we love our country , lahren said .
we re just going to shut off the tv , we re not going to go to games .
and they ll pay for it .
today , lahren took to her instagram account to show off her halloween costume .
lahren is dressed as a # maga superhero with an american flag for a cape and included this caption , oh la get ready to find your safe spaces !
what am i ?
well if you re a conservative , i m american af .
if you re a lib , i m offensive .
let s go .
oh la get ready to find your safe spaces !

pic.twitter.com/dygi0giyrs samantha hamlin ( @ samham73 ) october 29 , 2017while tomi s outfit might have given conservative men a full-fledged freedom boner , comments poured in to remind lahren that she s violating the u.s. flag code.the flag should never be carried flat or horizontally , but always aloft and free .
the flag should never be used as wearing apparel , bedding , or drapery .
it should never be festooned , drawn back , nor up , in folds , but always allowed to fall free.tomi was thoroughly mocked on twitter.who wore it better ?
