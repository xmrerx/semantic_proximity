WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, who last month lost her job as head of the Democratic National Committee, won a bid on Tuesday to be her partyâ€™s nominee for a seventh term in the U.S. House of Representatives, the Miami Herald reported.
The newspaper projected that Wasserman Schultz defeated Tim Canova, a law professor who is an outspoken Wall Street critic.
He is aligned with U.S.
Senator Bernie Sanders, who lost the Democratic presidential nomination to former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
