athens ( reuters ) - a russian cybercrime suspect told greek judges on friday he had nothing to do with allegations of masterminding a money-laundering operation using bitcoin .
alexander vinnik was speaking to a hearing considering his extradition to the united states .
he was arrested on a u.s. warrant in a hotel in northern greece in late july and russia has since also requested he be sent home on fraud charges .
the u.s. justice department says vinnik facilitated crimes since 2011 including computer hacking , fraud and drug trafficking by laundering at least $ 4 billion through btc-e , an exchange used to trade bitcoin and other digital currencies .
vinnik , who was escorted handcuffed through the back door of a thessaloniki court , denies any wrongdoing .
if extradited to the united states , he faces up to 55 years in prison .
he asserts that he has nothing to do with the charges against him , one of his lawyers , xanthippi moisidou , told reporters .
the judges are scheduled to announce their verdict on the u.s. request on oct. 4 .
a court date for the russian request has not yet been set .
we hope for , and we expect , a positive result , said alexandros lykourezos , another of vinnik s lawyers .
he said the prosecutor s proposal in favor of extraditing vinnik was unsubstantiated .
greece s justice minister can approve extradition to one country and block the other in the event of competing requests from two or more countries .
vinnik is one of seven russians arrested or indicted on u.s. cyber crime charges this year and moscow has sought the extradition of its nationals wanted by the u.s. before .
yevgeniy nikulin , an alleged russian hacker , was arrested in prague last year and both the united states and russia want him extradited .
russia s foreign ministry had criticized nikulin s arrest , saying it showed washington was mounting a global manhunt against russian citizens .
