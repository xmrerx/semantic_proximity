paris ( reuters ) - france criticized russia on thursday for calling into question an international inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in syria .
russia has questioned the work and future of the joint inquiry by the u.n. and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) , and said it would decide whether to support extending the mandate after investigators submit their next report .
we can not accept that the credibility and independence of these mechanisms are challenged on the grounds that their conclusions are not suitable for russia , french foreign ministry spokeswoman agnes romatet-espagne told reporters .
this undermines the international consensus that it is our responsibility to build to stop the use of these weapons in syria .
the inquiry , known as the joint investigative mechanism ( jim ) , is due to report by oct. 26 on who was responsible for an april 4 attack on the opposition-held town of khan sheikhoun that killed dozens of people .
france , britain and the united states have accused syrian president bashar al-assad s government of being behind the attack and the probe is expected to back those claims .
the united states said on wednesday it would push the united nations security council to renew within days the jim s mandate , setting the stage for a likely showdown with russia , which backs assad and denies assad has used chemical weapons .
france , under president emmanuel macron , has been pushing for closer cooperation with moscow , especially over syria , and has said dialogue with russia on enforcing a 2013 security council resolution to prevent the use of chemical weapons in syria was one of its priorities .
the jim ( already ) concluded in its august and october 2016 reports the responsibility of the syrian armed and security forces in three cases of chlorine use and islamic state in one case .
the methodology of the investigation is indisputable , romatet-espagne said .
