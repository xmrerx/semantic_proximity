How does the saying go?
Fox News isn t racist, but number one with racists?
Pretty sure that s it, and keeping true to form, they re playing directly to their number one demographic by talking about pride.
Of course, they infer that it s American pride, but when you listen to Sean Hannity speak, he tells the tale of a life that was granted to him, and not so much for others.Hannity talks about how he s worked since he was eight years old.
From being a paperboy, to working in a restaurant, to working in construction, to finally being able to pursue his dreams in broadcasting.
To be honest, the first thing I thought of while watching this promo was how nice for a white man in America to so easily be able to pursue his dreams, and then the word pride flashed up on the video.Hannity loves saying only in America.
Yes, here in America where we still have systemic racism that prevents others from pursuing those same dreams that he had.
But will he see it that way?
No, of course not.
Does he mean it that way?
Probably not, because he s too blind to his privilege.
However, going on and on about how he was granted opportunities that were granted to him primarily because he won the genetic lottery, is that really something to be proud about?
To him, apparently it is.This video might as well have read white pride at the end.Watch for yourself: And then, I have an opportunity to pursue a dream only in America.
