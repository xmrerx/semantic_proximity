new york ( reuters ) - michigan governor rick snyder has met with wall street credit rating agencies this week , telling them michigan ’ s economy is doing “ very well ” in the face of a lowered credit outlook , snyder said on thursday .
“ we had a good , healthy discussion , ” snyder told reuters after speaking at a cuny graduate school of journalism event in new york city .
“ michigan economically is doing very well. ” two weeks ago , just before michigan ’ s most recent bond offering , standard & poor ’ s ratings services lowered the outlook on michigan ’ s credit rating to stable from positive .
it cited burgeoning costs associated with a lead-tainted water crisis in the city of flint and with the cash-strapped detroit public schools ( dps ) .
those rising expenses “ will limit the state ’ s ability to build reserves over the nest two fiscal years , ” s & p analyst carol spain said on march 17 .
despite the outlook change , michigan was able to sell about $ 82 billion of general obligation bonds with a true interest cost of 1.54 percent , showing little sign that the u.s. municipal bond market wanted to punish the state with exorbitantly high interest rates .
one encouraging economic sign in michigan is the 4.8 percent unemployment rate reported in february versus the national jobless rate of 4.9 percent .
snyder said it was a good time to meet with credit rating agencies because the state is not currently in the market .
he tries to do it at least once a year .
