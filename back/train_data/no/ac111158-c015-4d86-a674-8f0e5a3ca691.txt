making america unsafe again it s the obama legacy .
during his two terms in office , obama released more prisoners than all nine presidents before him combined .
he s not just flooding our local communities and major cities with felons , he s flooding america s red states with illegal aliens and unvetted muslim immigrants from countries who hate us , all to ensure democrat party dominance .
president barack obama on wednesday cut short the sentences of 214 federal inmates , including 67 life sentences , in what the white house called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century.almost all the prisoners were serving time for nonviolent drug crimes , reflecting obama s long-stated view that the u.s. needs to remedy the consequences of decades of sentencing requirements that put tens of thousands of americans behind bars for far too long .
obama has pushed for a broader fix to criminal justice laws and has used the aggressive pace of his commutations in an effort to pressure congress and call more attention to the issue.all told , obama has commuted 562 sentences during his presidency more than the past nine presidents combined , the white house said .
almost 200 of those who have benefited were serving life sentences .
