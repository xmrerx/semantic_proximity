White House Secretary Sean Spicer decided to rewrite history on Tuesday, arguing that Adolf Hitler wasn t such a bad guy after all because he didn t use chemical weapons like Assad.
While most of us were facepalming and shouting gas chambers, Chelsea Clinton stepped forward with a classy tweet offering Spicey a little advice.
I hope @PressSec takes time to visit @HolocaustMuseum, the former first daughter tweeted this afternoon.
It s a few blocks away, she added helpfully.I hope @PressSec takes time to visit @HolocaustMuseum.
It s a few blocks away.

He was trying to convince the world that Donald Trump was right to bomb Syria but only ended up proving that he s a total idiot.When Spicer was called out on his ridiculous assertion that Hitler didn t gas millions of people in concentration camps, he grabbed a shovel and dug his hole deeper.
Passing the point of no return, the press secretary argued that Hitler didn t gas his own people, just the Jews.
And apparently, they don t count.Everybody except Trump s loyal base of anti-Semitic holocaust deniers knows that Spicer s version of history is a long, long way from the truth and it may be the worst excuse ever used to justify military action.People are justifiably outraged.
The Anne Frank Center issued a statement calling for Spicer s resignation.
Spicer s statement is the most evil slur upon a group of people we have ever heard from a White House press secretary, said Steven Goldstein, the organization s executive director.
Sean Spicer now lacks the integrity to serve and President Trump must fire him at once, he added.Spicer would be wise to take Clinton s advice and study up a little on the holocaust before the next time he decides to spout off about what a swell guy Hitler was.Featured image via Marcus Ingram/Getty Images
