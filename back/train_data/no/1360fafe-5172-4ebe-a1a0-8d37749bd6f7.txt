last november , the unc campus was full of angry students who were unhappy with trump s election on november 23rd of last year , unc protesters gathered at the iconic old well on the campus , chanting donald trump can go to hell , but we are going to the well .
the intersection , normally taken over by students to celebrate sports victories a few times a year , was soon occupied by dozens of protesters chanting lines like black lives matter , water is life , and love trumps hate .
what s gotten into our youth ?
