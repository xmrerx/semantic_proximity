WHAT S WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?
Clinton Crony Ben Rhodes tweeted out a wish for death to McConnell, Ryan and Pence:Rhodes is a former Obama administration official with the National Security Council.Republican Steve Scalise was shot last year when a crazed Democrat attacked Republicans practicing for a baseball game He was near death and had months of recovery before he could come back to D.C.
It goes without saying that the Ben Rhodes tweet was very insensitive and helps no one in any way to bridge the gap between Democrats and Republicans.
The Democrats continuously show themselves to be hateful and snarky Not a good look for anyone.Scalise responded to the Rhodes tweet with a short and sweet tweet that got the point across:You may want to reconsider your rhetoric.
