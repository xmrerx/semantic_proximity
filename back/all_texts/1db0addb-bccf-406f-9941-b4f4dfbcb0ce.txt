A man affiliated with the illegal occupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in the Oregon standoff with police was out and about driving around town in his white 2003 Ford van, when he ended up crashing his vehicle into a barb-wire fence, completely flipping the car over in the process.We re not sure if he was out looking for snacks, but The Oregon State Police posted a picture of the crash on their Twitter page on Sunday.
Now, get this not only was he being an unsafe driver on icy roads (propelling the car more than 150 ft. away from the road), but he was also driving without a license!
Fortunately, he wasn t injured (we wouldn t wish that on anyone) but safety issues aside, all the police did was cite him for operating a motor vehicle without a license.
That s it.
He wasn t arrested, as many would presume.State Police Spokesman Bill Fugate wouldn t provide more details about the incident, other than to say: Oregon only cites for No Operator s License, we do not arrest.

Perhaps one reason is that he wasn t driving a federal van from the property; it appears to be his own.Just a few days ago, another militant by the name of Kenneth Medenback left the compound for a snack run.
State police decided to arrest him for theft of two government vehicles, not the occupation itself.
And, that was the very first arrest of the occupation so far.
At this rate it s going to take forever to arrest all these guys.
So, while law enforcement doesn t appear to be taking an active stance of ending the illegal protest itself, they are still somewhat concerned with upholding some of the laws on the books.
That s some good news, at least.Featured image via Twitter.
