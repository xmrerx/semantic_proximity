WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Tuesday his comments questioning the impartiality of a Mexican-American judge had been misconstrued as a broad attack on people of Mexican heritage.
Trump said, however, that it was fair to question the judgeâ€™s impartiality in the civil suit against Trump University and whether he could receive a fair trial.
