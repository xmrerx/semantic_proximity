Senator Bernie Sanders made an appearance on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert a day following his landslide win in New Hampshire and he was riding high.
Colbert resurrected his former conservative Colbert Report character, playing devil s advocate by grilling the senator on his polices, even suggesting that he was promoting class warfare.
Colbert said that trying to take power away from the 1% was not going to be easy.
I ll tell you how I know, I am in the top 1 percent.
Colbert also warned of revolution which Sanders advocates by quoting John F. Kennedy.
He said: Those who make peaceful revolution impossible make violent revolution inevitable.
Sanders, however, rejected the idea that his revolution would go bad.
He said: What the goal of this campaign is about is to look at the Civil Rights Movement, look at the women s movement, look at the gay movement, understand that when people come together we can accomplish enormous things.
But I think what people are saying is enough is enough.
We need fundamental changes in our political system and our economic system.
Sanders is right.
Thinking outside of the box is what creates both innovation and change and Sanders sums it up perfectly: We used to have a segregated society.
African-Americans couldn t go to schools, couldn t drink at water fountains.
Millions of people stood together and said, Hey, enough is enough.
That is not what America is supposed to be about.
Americans are on board with Sanders message.
He s scored a resounding victory in New Hampshire, especially with America s youth, collecting 86% of the vote in the 18-24 age bracket.
Bernie Sanders is not only running for the presidency, but thus far he s winning.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture
