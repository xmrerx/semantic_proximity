ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan and British Prime Minister Theresa May agreed in a phone call on Monday that the international community should make intense efforts to solve the issue in Jerusalem, sources in Erdogan s office said.
The two leaders, who discussed the blocking of a U.N. Security Council resolution calling for the U.S. declaration of Jerusalem as Israel s capital to be withdrawn, also agreed that any new tensions that could endanger the peace process in the region should be avoided, the sources said.
