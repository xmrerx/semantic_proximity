It was actually refreshing to see the cops fighting back against an unruly mob of Mexican flag carrying rioters in San Diego (Watch video HERE).
It s interesting to see how little coverage the threats against Donald Trump s life are getting by the press.
Could you imagine a LEGAL American Tea Party member threatening the life of Hillary?
Do you think you d have to scour conservative news sources to find that story?
No need to answer that Hundreds of protesters gathered outside a Donald Trump rally on Friday, chanting f**k Donald Trump and holding obscene signs including one that included a death threat against Trump should he win the presidency in November.The young protester held up a sign that read: If TRUMP wins He ll be DEAD with in A week The Cartel wont have his Bullsh*t.

Most of them appeared to be Hispanic.
Will the media ever disclose how many of the people who were arrested are illegal aliens.Protester handcuffed outside Trump San Diego rally pic.twitter.com/qpMR3Jbskt Michelle Moons (@MichelleDiana) May 28, 2016At one point bottles were thrown at police, and in the course of the protests, several people were detained.
Several pi atas depicted Trump, including one whose head had been severed in the street, with the rest just a crumpled bit of papier-m ch .Via: Breitbart NewsWhat you didn t see reported by the mainstream media was the ENORMOUS crowd of supporters inside the San Diego venue where Trump was announced to thunderous applause.
It s no wonder the Left is freaking out about Trump.
He is drawing tens of thousands of supporters in the bluest of blue states and they re coming because they believe in him.
They re not coming because of the color of his skin or his promise to fundamentally destroy our nation, they re coming because they want to see America return to her greatness and they believe Trump has the ability to actually make that happen.
What America didn't see much of!
