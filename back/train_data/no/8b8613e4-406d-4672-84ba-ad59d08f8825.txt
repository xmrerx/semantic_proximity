bangkok ( reuters ) - thailand s ousted former prime minister yingluck shinawatra was handed a five-year prison sentence on wednesday after the country s highest court found her guilty of negligence in the management of a rice subsidy scheme .
yingluck was due to hear the verdict on aug. 25 , but failed to show up , surprising hundreds of supporters who had gathered at the court .
aides said she had fled thailand , fearing a harsh sentence .
last month , reuters reported that she had escaped to dubai , where her brother , former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , owns a home .
yingluck , who swept to power in a 2011 general election , introduced a rice subsidy scheme that proved wildly popular with farmers but which the military government says caused billions of dollars in losses .
her government was ousted by the military in 2014 .
