hillary may have gotten away with lying to the public for decades , but what she underestimated this time around was the enormous power of chicago thugs , valerie jarrett and barack hussein obama .
if the two of them decide they don t want you running for office , you likely won t stand a chance the tens of thousands of emails on hillary clinton s private server from when she was secretary of state could also be on a second device or server , according to news reports.the fbi now has the only confirmed private server , as part of a justice department probe to determine whether it sent of received classified information for clinton when she was the country s top diplomat from 2009 to 2013.platte river networks , which managed clinton s server and private email network after she left the state department , has indicated it transfer or migrated emails from the original server in 2013 , according to the washington examiner.however , clinton , the front-running democratic presidential candidate , has suggested that she gave the department 55,000 pages of official emails and deleted roughly 30,000 personal ones in january , which raises the possibility they were culled from a second device.neither a clinton spokesman nor an attorney for the colorado-based platte river networks returned an examiner s request for comment , the news gathering agency reported saturday.the dailymail.com on aug. 14 was among the first to report the possibility of a second server.the fbi took the server last week , after a u.s. intelligence community inspector general reportedly found two clinton emails that included sensitive information , then asked the fbi to further investigate.platte river networks has told news agencies that the server , now in new jersey , has been wiped clean .
but forensics experts still might be able to recover some information.there have been reports that some of the emails that clinton turned over included classified information .
clinton maintains that she neither sent nor received classified data , which suggests the missives might have been marked after the fact as classified or with some other top-secret classification.the emails that clinton gave to the state department were on multiple storage devices .
a clinton lawyer turned over at least one thumb drive that reportedly included copies of the emails that his client has already given to the federal government.clinton has maintained that she has done nothing wrong or illegal and says she will cooperate fully with the non-criminal investigations.via : fox news
