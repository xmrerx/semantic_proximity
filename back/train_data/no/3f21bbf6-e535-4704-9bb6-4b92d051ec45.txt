washington ( reuters ) - u.s. defense secretary jim mattis said on tuesday iran was fundamentally in compliance with its nuclear deal , as president donald trump s administration weighs whether the 2015 deal serves u.s. security interests .
trump faces an oct. 15 deadline for certifying that iran is complying with the pact , a decision that could sink an agreement strongly supported by the other powers that negotiated it , including britain , china , france , germany , russia and the european union .
i believe that they fundamentally are .
there have been certainly some areas where they were not temporarily in that regard , but overall our intelligence community believes that they have been compliant and the iaea also says so , mattis said during a house of representatives hearing , using an acronym for the international atomic energy agency .
