It s still hard to conceive that Donald Trump is the presumptive nominee of the Republican Party and, although in the past the GOP has produced bad candidates like George W. Bush capable of doing serious damage to the country, a Trump presidency could certainly finish the disastrous job Bush started.President Obama has tried to fix the damage Bush and the GOP caused America and he will be leaving with a stronger country than when he came into office.
No one knows more than President Obama what had to be done to fix the economic, social, and political damage Bush caused the American people.
No one knows more than President Obama that the most powerful and critical position in the world is no laughing matter.
That s why the president s statement about Trumps presumptive nomination came with a warning.
The President said: I think it s important for us to take seriously the statements he s made in the past.
But most importantly, and I speak to all of you in this room as reporters as well as the American public.
I just want to emphasize the degree to which we are in serious times and this is a really serious job.
Obama went on to add: This is not entertainment, this is not a reality show.
This is a contest for the presidency of the United States.
And what that means is that every candidate, every nominee needs to be subject to exacting standards and genuine scrutiny.
While many in the media and the public have found Trump s antics entertaining, the joke will be on all of us if this man, who many never believed would get this far, becomes president.
It s important that America goes out and votes this November.
We can t go back to the Bush years of war and recession.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ALku3gpLnSw]Featured image via video screenshot.
