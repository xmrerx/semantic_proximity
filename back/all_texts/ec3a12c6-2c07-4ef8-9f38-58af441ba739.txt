WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday he saw no reason for U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from investigations into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.
“If he himself is a subject of an investigation, of course he would.
But if he’s not, I don’t see any purpose or reason to doing this,” the Wisconsin Republican told reporters.
“We have seen no evidence from any of these ongoing investigations that anybody in the Trump campaign or the Trump team was involved in any of this,” he added.
