Kevin O Leary, a rich Canadian television personality, announced Wednesday he is running for leadership of Canada s opposition Conservative Party in a bid to unseat Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, the baby-faced and extremely woke leader of America s neighbor to the north.O Leary is a host of Shark Tank on ABC, a show in which entrepreneurs humiliate themselves in front of wealthy investors.
The businessman has a net worth of roughly $300 million, but in Canada that basically makes him a billionaire.
He ll be the highest-profile candidate in a field of 13 running for the party leadership position.Given his wealth and television background, O Leary has been described as Canada s Donald Trump.
He announced his run for office on Twitter, where he has previously described Trudeau as a surfer dude who is destroying Canada with debt.
It s official, I m in, O Leary tweeted from his official account.
The Conservative Party of Canada needs a candidate who can beat Justin Trudeau and bring back jobs to this country!
