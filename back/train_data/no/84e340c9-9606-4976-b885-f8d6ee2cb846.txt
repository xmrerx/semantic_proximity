moscow ( reuters ) - russian military observers had to pull out of a joint ceasefire control group due to kiev s determination to solve the crisis in the rebel-held eastern regions of the country by force , a spokesman for russian foreign ministry said on thursday .
earlier this week , the ministry said it was recalling officers serving at the joint centre for control and coordination in ukraine , accusing the ukrainian side of obstructing their work and limiting access to the front line .
ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova also said on thursday that the united states encouraged the resumption of large-scale bloodshed in eastern ukraine by washington s approval of lethal arms sales to ukrainian army .
