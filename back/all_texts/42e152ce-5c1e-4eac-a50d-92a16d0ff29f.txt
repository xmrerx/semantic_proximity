On Monday, Trump propaganda minister Kellyanne Conway crawled out of her slimepit to once again defend the indefensible this time, Trump s ridiculous and baseless allegation that President Obama tapped his wires at Trump Tower.
He s the president of the United States, he has information and intelligence that the rest of us do not, Conway told Fox News, adding that a number of credible media outlets are reporting there was politically-motivated activity all during the campaign and suggesting there s more there.
Not a single credible news source has reported that President Obama ordered Trump s wires tapped.
The report initially came from Breitbart, a white supremacist propaganda website.
People deserve to know, so why not include in the existing investigations into Russia whether or not this actually happened?
Conway says.What actually happened was Donald Trump read an article that was being passed around the White House, made the mistake of believing it, and melted down on Twitter, sticking to the story even after the conspiracy theorist upon whose claims the story relied admitted he has zero evidence to back it.Trump s allegations are so ridiculous that the FBI asked the Department of Justice Saturday to officially tell the American people Trump is full of sh*t. They have not yet done so.Watch Conway s humiliating performance below:Featured image via screengrab
