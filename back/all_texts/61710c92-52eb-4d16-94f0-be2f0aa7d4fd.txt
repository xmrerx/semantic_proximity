Our street corners are filled with people in need carrying cardboard signs and asking for food or cash.
The majority of them are legitimately struck with hard times.
In many cases it s the only source of income for their family after a job is lost.
There are also those out there who are taking advantage of the generosity of others, collecting money for no reason than it s easier to work.
Those people, of course, make it more difficult for those with genuine issues.As you ll see in this video, there s a third kind of person out there collecting money, and his name is Lloyd Baker.
Baker was arrested in October of 2012 and charged with the sexual assault of a 14-year-old girl in connection with a kidnapping.
He is currently out on bail and awaiting trial.
In the small town of West Warwick, Rhode Island, people like Lloyd Baker don t just blend in with the scenery; somebody is bound to recognize him.That s exactly what happened.
The man who shot the short clip confronted Baker, who at first denied who he was but then admitted it a short time later.
It doesn t really matter what this man s circumstances are, he doesn t deserve the charity people are affording him, especially if they don t know who he is or why he can t find work.Please be warned, the man who made the video isn t pleased with Baker.
His language is harsh.
This is definitely NOT safe for work:https://www.facebook.com/fiftyshadesofjay/videos/10207400122614085/?permPage=1He seems to want to stand his ground until the videographer starts shouting what a monster he is.
He comes to his senses fairly quickly when he realizes this man confronting him means business.Sorry, you pedophile.
Collecting loose change while you re out on bail for assaulting a 14-year-old girl is worse than wearing a New York Giants jacket in Patriots country.Featured image via screen capture/RI State Police
