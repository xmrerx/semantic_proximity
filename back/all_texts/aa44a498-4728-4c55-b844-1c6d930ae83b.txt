CAIRO (Reuters) - Islamic State has claimed responsibility for an attack in northeast Nigeria that killed eight soldiers and a civilian and injured five other people on Tuesday, a statement by the group said on Thursday.
The fighters took three four-wheel-drive vehicles and others mounted with rifles and heavy weaponry and various ammunition, the statement said.
The group did not provide evidence for its claim.
