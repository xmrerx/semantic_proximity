Glenn Beck is a paranoid lunatic, and he has just done one more thing to further cement that idea.
Beck announced on the Friday edition of his show that his staff is, on his orders, preparing to move his entire broadcasting network out of the country.
Why?
Because this idiot thinks that the America that we all know and love is on the brink of collapse, and when that collapse comes, the new government will silence him.
Beck told his equally idiotic followers: We have to pick up our pace on finding another place to broadcast.
I need to know if I can get to Jerusalem, where they won t shut this down and we can be able to broadcast into the United States.
This could end quickly.
The worst part of all of this is that this announcement came after an audience member asked what she could do to prepare her family for the coming apocalypse.
She has already relocated from California to Texas on Beck s lunatic suggestion.
She has also followed more of Beck s terrible advice, and is reading the Left Behind series to her children, which warns of coming worldwide disaster.As if all of that is not bad enough, Beck s child was present during these doomsday prepper declarations, and of course was alarmed.
Instead of comforting her and anyone else who might be rightfully disturbed by these ideas, Beck says that today s children should be warned as well because they re the giants that are going to fix this, they have to know.
He went on to warn that reading Left Behind is important because they have to know that this might be the time You have an army on earth now that says they are the army of the Antichrist, they are the army of Armageddon.
This is about as irresponsible as it gets, and Beck doesn t seem to be slowing down this crazy train anytime soon.Watch the insanity below, via Right Wing Watch:Featured image from screen capture via Right Wing Watch
