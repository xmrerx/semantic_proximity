It is no secret that the GOP brass is less than thrilled to have Donald Trump as their presumptive nominee for the 2016 presidential race.
However, at this point, there is nothing they can really do about it.
So, instead of disavowing the most unqualified and reckless candidate to ever seek the White House, they are simply condemning his more outrageously indefensible comments, yet still standing behind him and telling the nation and world that everything is A-OK between the Republican establishment and the annointed orange one.
In order to prove that everyone is wrong and they are just peachy, Republican National Committee chair Reince Priebus tweeted out that a Politico report that there were tense relations between Trump and the RNC was pure fiction, and also told the entire internet that he was on a plane with Trump at that very moment.Flying to Dallas now with @realDonaldTrump Reports of discord are pure fiction.
Great events lined up all over Texas.
Rs will win in Nov!
Reince Priebus (@Reince) June 16, 2016Well, the people of Twitter are not morons.
They gave Priebus the savage mockery he deserved, as only Twitter can.
Here are a few of the more delicious tweets that flooded the RNC chair s @replies:@Reince @realDonaldTrump Did Trump tweet this for you?

House Speaker Paul Ryan said, in response to Trump s directive that the GOPers who are condemning his nutty remarks to be quiet, that You can t make this up sometimes.
Mitch McConnell, along with others just a few days ago simply refused to speak about Trump after he made outrageously inappropriate remarks following the shooting in Orlando.So, no, Reince, nobody is buying the line of bullshit that you and other Republican leaders are fine with your current standard-bearer.
You re literally terrified, as you should be.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images
