washington ( reuters ) - president donald trump said on friday that syrian christians will be given priority when it comes to applying for refugee status in the united states .
“ if you were a muslim you could come in , but if you were a christian , it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair , everybody was persecuted in all fairness , but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the christians , ” trump said in an excerpt of an interview with the christian broadcasting network .
pew research center said last october 38,901 muslim refugees entered the united states in fiscal year 2016 from all countries - almost the same number of christian refugees , 37,521 .
trump was expected to sign an executive order on friday that would temporarily halt refugees from some muslim-majority nations , a white house official said .
