(This version of the Feb. 18 story was refiled to delete an extra word in paragraph one) MUNICH (Reuters) - James Jones, a former Supreme Allied Commander in Europe said on Saturday he is not under consideration to be U.S. President Donald Trump’s new national security adviser.
“My policy is that I never turn down a job that hasn’t been offered,” Jones, who was attending the Munich Security Conference, told Reuters.
Jones, a former U.S. Marine Corps general and President Barack Obama’s first national security adviser, was thought to be one of four people under consideration by Trump to replace Michael Flynn, who resigned over telephone calls he had with Russia’s ambassador to the United States before Trump was sworn in to office.
