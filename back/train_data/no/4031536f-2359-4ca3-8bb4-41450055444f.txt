ankara ( reuters ) - a turkish court rejected on tuesday an appeals court order to retry a lawmaker from the main opposition party , upholding his 25-year jail term , cnn turk reported .
enis berberoglu became a symbol for more than 50,000 people detained in the wake of a failed coup in july 2016 .
the chairman of his secular republican people s party ( chp ) held a 425 km ( 265 mile ) protest march from the capital ankara to istanbul when berberoglu was convicted and sentenced in june for military espionage .
the court had said berberoglu gave an opposition newspaper a video purporting to show turkey s intelligence agency trucking weapons into syria .
the penal court had been ordered to retry berberoglu last month , but it refused the order saying the upper court s decision to overturn was against procedure and law .
berberoglu was the first chp lawmaker to be jailed in a crackdown by president tayyip erdogan s government that has raised concerns among turkey s western allies and rights groups .
more than 150,000 people , including teachers , academics and lawyers , have also been suspended from their jobs .
