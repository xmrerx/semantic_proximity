Donald Trump recently came out with his proposal for a new tax plan.
Every politician comes out with his own plans and proposals, but Jimmy wondered if voters pay any attention to the specifics.

What they didn t know is that the tax plan we presented them with was not Hillary Clinton s. It was Donald Trump s.
