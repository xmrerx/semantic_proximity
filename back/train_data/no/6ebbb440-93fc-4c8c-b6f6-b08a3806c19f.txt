he s been europe s version of the outspoken ted cruz for some time now .
nigel farage , leader of the uk independence party may be the most disliked member of the european parliment .
but he plows ahead , ignorning the open sneers and insults by his fellow members of the eu parliment .
in what must count as perhaps the worst piece of public policy seen in modern europe for half a century .
when you compound it with an already failing and flawed eu common asylum policy , by saying to the whole world , please come to europe .
and we saw frankly , virtually a stampede , and we learned that 80 % of those that are coming are not syrian refugees .
in fact , what you ve done is opened the door to young , male , economic migrants , many of whom i have to say behave quite in a rather an aggressive manner , quite the opposite of what you would expect to see of any refugee .
and yet when that failure is met by objections from countries like hungary , their opinions are crushed .
this isn t a europe of peace , it s a europe of division , it s a europe of disharmony , it s a europe that s a recipe for resentment .
and yet , faced with all this failure , both of you said the same thing today .
you said , europe isn t working so let s have some more europe , more of the same failing .
well there is i think , a bright star on the horizon .
it s called the british referendum .
and given that none of you want to concede britain the ability to take back control of her own borders , a brexit now , looks more likely than at any other time .
we could use about 100 nigel farage s in our u.s. congress .https : //youtu.be/gbjp8zxduwk
