Politico Congressional reporter Rachael Bade started a Twitter war with Congressman Darrell Issa yesterday, accusing Issa of flipping her the bird when she questioned him on the topic of recently ousted former FBI director James Comey.In a tweet that has been retweeted more than 25,000 times since Tuesday, Bade claims in no uncertain terms that Congressman Issa literally gave me the middle finger when she asked for any recent news or comments on Comey s firing.
Issa eventually replied to Bade s tweet to deny the claim, stating that Bade must have seen or heard something to believe this happened, but it didn t. I just asked @DarrellIssa abt the Comey news and he flicked me off literally gave me the middle finger and kept walking.
Said nothing Rachael Bade (@rachaelmbade) May 16, 2017@rachaelmbade I respect @rachaelmbade and worked with her for years.
I know she must have seen or heard something to believe this happened, but it didn t Darrell Issa (@DarrellIssa) May 16, 2017@rachaelmbade (cont.)
On not answering @rachelmbade s question, I have nothing against her, there s just limited time to talk when we re rushing to vote!
Darrell Issa (@DarrellIssa) May 16, 2017Another Congressional correspondent, Erica Werner with the Associated Press, tweeted to say that she was present at the time that Issa was believed to have given Bade the obscene gesture, however, she was unable to see exactly what happened and only saw Issa turn to Rachael, her react.
I believe [Bade].
I was there.
Not in position to see the gesture but saw Issa turn to Rachael, her react.
I believe @rachaelmbade https://t.co/U248Af4u8t Erica Werner (@ericawerner) May 17, 2017Earlier this month, Issa cast his vote in favor of the American Health Care Act, the plan designed by the Trump administration to repeal and replace the Obama administration s Affordable Health Care Act, a move met with great dissatisfaction.
As a result, since Rachael Bade s most recent accusation against Issa, her Twitter post was flooded with replies criticizing Issa s stance on health care and calling for his resignation.
@DarrellIssa @rachaelmbade Enjoy your last term in Congress, you gaslighting, AHCA-voting pile of shit.

Does it compare to when you used to steal cars?
