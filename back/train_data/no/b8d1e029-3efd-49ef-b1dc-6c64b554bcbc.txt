barack wants the black community to blame whites and cops .
these black chicago residents aren t buying it .
they re putting the blame squarely on barack hussein obama and rahm emanuel .
he s probably the the worst president ever elected .
have the same love for these ( black ) young people as you ve got for the ones across the border .
these residents of chicago understand that obama has done nothing to help raise them out of a state of dependency .
they want jobs .
they want self-esteem .
they want to raise their families and earn a paycheck .
obama and the democrats want to keep them down .
and when the joblessness is so out of control , and the youth living in these impoverished neighborhoods get out of control , the cops are called in .
obama and eric holder have managed to turn the same cops who are coming into these neighborhoods and risking their lives into public enemy # 1 .
obama has these residents living in a perpetual hell-hole with no way out .
no wonder they re so damn angry .
someone needs to get the message out to these communities that the democrat party has no interest in helping them to break this cycle .
the black community needs jobs .
we want them , we need them and it is a matter of life and death for us .
the liberal agenda is not the black agenda , it is not the family agenda and it s not the american agenda .
