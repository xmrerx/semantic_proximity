Democratic presidential candidate Martin O Malley likely never really had a chance against Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, but he has to be admired for staying in the race for so long, despite such consistently terrible poll numbers.
However, all of that change the night of the Iowa Caucuses.
Even before all of the votes were in, ABC News tweeted that the former Maryland governor is suspending his campaign.JUST IN: Sources close to Martin O'Malley campaign tell @ABC O'Malley will suspend his campaign tonight.
@maryaliceparks ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) February 2, 2016According to Town Hall, O Malley got less than one percent of the votes at the all-important caucus.
This result is unsurprising, as nobody really thought that O Malley was a serious candidate.This is actually a good thing, because it s not like O Malley would have had a snowball s chance in hell of winning a general election against any serious GOP candidate, even if by some crazy twist of fate he had managed to beat both Bernie and Hillary in the primary to cinch the nomination.In short, Martin O Malley s candidacy was never anything more than an early election cycle distraction.
No matter what one might think of his political positions, the guy was really never going to get very far, and thanks to the stakes being so high with the people we re up against on the crazy right, it s time to focus on the folks who can actually win.You had a good run, Governor O Malley.
Thanks for doing the right thing at the right time.Featured image from Gage Skidmore/Flickr
