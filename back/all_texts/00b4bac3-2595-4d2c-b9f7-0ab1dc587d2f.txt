The attitudes of the family members defending this thug who violated an innocent woman when he broke into her home is astounding.
After eight long years of listening to a President justify why minorities should be able to break laws with no penalties, get in line in front of people who are white or have more income when it comes to college acceptance or employment opportunities, this is the result.
Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton will only perpetuate this un-American, entitelment behavior.

He died of his wounds.
I don t care if she have her gun license or any of that.
That is way beyond the law way beyond, said Johnson s cousin Nautika Harris to local media outlet WFOR.

You have to look at it from his point-of-view.
He was not supposed to die like this.
He had a future ahead of him.
Trevon had goals he was a funny guy, very big on education, loved learning.
