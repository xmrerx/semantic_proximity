Donald Trump doesn t seem the forgiving type, so it s no surprise he hasn t let Barack Obama s comments yesterday stand.
Obama said Trump was unfit to be President so what did the Republican candidate have to say in response?
He answered in the only way he knows how, by flinging mud back at the person who called him out.
Here s what he said: What s also interesting about Trump s reply is his use of Obama s criticism about Trump s knowledge of foreign policy against him.
Yesterday, Obama said Trump didn t appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues, in Europe, in the Middle East.
Instead, Trump says, Obama should look at his own record before lashing out.
That seems a particularly pertinent point the day after Obama s infamous red line was once again crossed in Syria.
The Middle East is in turmoil, and whilst it s not entirely Obama s fault, his refusal to intervene has not helped.In his reply to Obama, Trump leaves the best bit to last though.
After hitting out at Obama s record, he says: I think it just means he s concerned I m going to win It s difficult not to agree with Trump; after all, if he was such a no-hoper, why would Obama bother to speak out in the first place?Via: Spectator
