leave it to sarah palin to get a hate-boner after our resident manchurian couch potato dropped the mother of all bombs on isis .
the moab cost $ 16 million ( enough to completely take care of countless underprivileged families from whom trump is stripping social programs and healthcare ) and cost a whopping $ 300 million to develop .
while some have called trump presidential for learning that stupid people like big explosions , the reality is that he dropped 20,000 pounds of the american people s tax dollars in a hole and blew it all up to satisfy his ego and distract from his other problems ( like russia ) .on saturday , sarah palin gleefully celebrated news from afghan authorities that they had increased the number of enemy combatants killed to a whopping 94 ( that s about $ 170,000 per dead body y all ! )
and a yet-unknown number of civilians.alert : death toll from moab just skyrocketed , but news of why is even better https : //t.co/pxwje1fjmp sarah palin ( @ sarahpalinusa ) april 16 , 2017naturally , super-christian palin s decision to do the happy dance over trump s big boom extravaganza on easter weekend was not taken lightly by people who don t still believe in that rabbit guy who hides eggs : @ russboot @ sarahpalinusa do you need to go and change your panties ?

digitalmindpatrol ( @ digitlmndpatrol ) april 16 , 2017 @ sarahpalinusa i thought we stood against isis because they glorify death .
just because it s necessary doesn t make it something to celebrate .

ace rothstein ( @ billybatts1970 ) april 16 , 2017 @ sarahpalinusa you are no christian .
shame on you .
khaleesi ( @ khaleesikhaldro ) april 16 , 2017unfortunately , this attitude of finding glory in death is typical of conservatives .
hell , they feel that way for people they just don t agree with .
it s one thing to say that isis must be stopped .
it s entirely different to act like your biggest desire is to bathe in the blood of the dead.happy easter , everyone .
