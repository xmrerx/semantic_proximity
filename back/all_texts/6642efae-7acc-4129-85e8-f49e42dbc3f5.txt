Andrea Tantaros is ramping up the pressure on her former employers and colleagues to answer for their behavior and face the consequences.Earlier this month, the former Fox host declared war on the conservative network by slapping them with a sexual harassment lawsuit which names Bill O Reilly among other such as Roger Ailes and Bill Shine.According to the lawsuit, Fox News masquerades as a defender of traditional family values, but behind the scenes, it operates like a sex-fueled, Playboy Mansion-like cult, steeped in intimidation, indecency and misogyny.
Indeed, Tantaros says she was never allowed to wear pants on set and that Ailes seriously creeped her out on multiple occasions by obsessing with her legs and asking her to spin around for him so he could ogle her.
When refused to comply with his outrageous demand he retaliated by firing her from The Five and placed her on a lower rated show.Top executives attempted to pay Tantaros off if she would drop her allegations but she turned the offer down.Fox News has denied the allegations, of course, but that isn t stopping Tantaros from charging ahead.Buzzfeed reports that Tantaros is upping the ante by daring Fox News personnel to take a lie detector test and offered to take one in return so that it can be determined who is telling the truth and who is lying.It s a brilliant move on Tantaros part.
If Fox declines it can be assumed that they have something to hide, like guilt.
It would also vindicate Tantaros and give further credence to her allegations.Tantaros even released the questions she wants certain Fox News personnel to answer.For instance, a series of questions for Roger Ailes will seek to determine if he did, in fact, say inappropriate things to Tantaros in the workplace or if he ever retaliated against her for refusing his advances.Here s an image of the questions via Buzzfeed Editor Kyle Blaine.A series of question posed to Ailes replacement Bill Shine includes whether or not he knew about Tantaros complaints about Ailes and whether or not someone within the company arranged for negative comments to be spread about her on social media.Questions for Fox News Executive Vice President Dianne Brandi inquire if she had knowledge of Tantaros complaints about the hostile working environment and if Fox has paid money to more than six women to settle sexual harassment suits.And finally, questions for Irena Briganti and Bill O Reilly include whether Briganti helped Ailes retaliate against Tantaros and whether O Reilly hit on her and made inappropriate comments about her.Tantaros lawyers go on to state that an innocent person would jump at the chance for this kind of vindication and added that their client would not risk offering this proposal if she were not telling the truth.
To put it bluntly, Andrea Tantaros is taking her feud with Fox News to whole new level and these questions are damning all on their own without Fox answering any of them.For years, Fox News treated women like powerless sex objects.
Now they are finding out just how powerful women can be, especially when they are pissed off about being treated like shit.Featured image via screenshot
