WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions on Tuesday released a memo restricting Justice Department grants from going to so-called sanctuary cities that do not cooperate with federal immigration agents.
The announcement came as Sessions is beset by criticism from President Donald Trump.
Conservatives who are proponents of Sessionsâ€™ hardline immigration policies have defended him.
