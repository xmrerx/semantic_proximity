it s one of madagascar s most widespread rituals , historian mahery andrianahag told afp .
it s necessary to assure cosmic harmony it satisfies our desire to respect and honour the ancestors so that they can be blessed and one day return .
the dead are believed to reciprocate the blessings .
says one participant , i am extremely proud to go to rewrap the bones of my grandmother and all of our ancestors .
i will ask them for blessings and success in my school leavers exams .
famadihana is also an opportunity to party : the customary ritual , rather than a religious rite , can be shocking for some , but for those taking part , it is an intense celebration accompanied by music , dancing and singing , fuelled by alcoholic drinks.when the party is over , participants store the mats that the bodies are laid on under their own mattresses .
this is said to bring good luck.but some doctors warn that they can also transmit germs and infections.and , at a time when madagascar is enduring its most lethal outbreak of the plague in years , the practice of body turning has raised fears among health officials.since august , the disease has infected more than 1,100 people , with 124 deaths .
health ministry epidemiologists have long observed that plague season coincides with the period when famadihana ceremonies are held from july to october.but who cares about the plague ?
scoffs one participant , i will always practise the turning of the bones of my ancestors plague or no plague .
the plague is a lie .
meanwhile , immigrants from every corner of the third world pour into our country , often illegally , bringing along their exotic customs and diseases .
