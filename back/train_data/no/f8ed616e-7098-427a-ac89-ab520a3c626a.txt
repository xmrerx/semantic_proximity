havana ( reuters ) - u.s. president barack obama tried out his comedic chops with some spanish in a video he made with cuban humorist pánfilo ahead of a historic visit to havana .
obama , who has won praise from professional comedians for his comic timing , is due to arrive in cuba on sunday .
he shot a segment from the oval office in which he pretends to have a conversation with pánfilo in cuba .
the two sides of the call were edited together in a video playing on the havana u.s. embassy ’ s social media feeds and the youtube channel of an official cuban media outlet on saturday .
( bit.ly/1wyrvhz ) pánfilo calls washington looking for a weather forecast for tuesday ’ s exhibition game between cuba ’ s national baseball team and the tampa bay rays , a game obama will intend .
instead of getting the weather service he ends up on the phone with obama , asking if he is really speaking with the president .
“ yes , the real obama .
who ’ s this ? ” the president says .
“ i ’ m pánfilo from cuba. ” “ the real pánfilo ?
from the tv show ? ” obama asks .
pánfilo is shocked the president knows him , and obama pretends to be equally star struck .
“ no me digas .
¿qué bolá ? ” obama says in cuban slang .
( “ you don ’ t say .
what ’ s up ? ” ) pánfilo then engages the u.s. president in his trademark gentle social satire of cuban life , joking about old cars and cramped living quarters .
