( reuters ) - what has the world turned in to ?
a friend of the five argentines killed in the new york attack this week asked at a news conference on friday , alongside three other surviving members of a group of former classmates .
guillermo banchini , an architect , and friends were cycling in new york during a 30-year high school reunion trip on tuesday when a driver of a pickup truck plowed down a bike path .
how could someone think of , plan and do something like this ?
we can not get our heads around it , banchini said at the argentine consulate in new york .
let there be justice .
let this not be repeated , not here nor anywhere in the world .
eight people , including a belgian woman , a new yorker and a new jersey man , were killed and 11 injured in lower manhattan in the attack along the hudson river .
the suspect , 29-year-old uzbek immigrant sayfullo saipov , was charged with acting on behalf of islamic state , whose followers have carried out vehicle attacks in several cities , mostly in europe .
the five deceased argentines , businessmen and architects aged 48 to 49 , were all alums of a polytechnic high school in rosario , argentina s third-largest city .
another member of the group , martin ludovico marro , was injured and hospitalized in manhattan and did not attend the televised news conference .
banchini , speaking on behalf of the other argentine survivors , said the pain they were feeling would always endure , but they would move forward the way they had learned as close knit childhood friends .
in the name of those values , and a way of life , we want to make a bet - love conquers hate , he said .
