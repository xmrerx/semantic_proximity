homeland security secretary john kelly on friday said the terror threat is worse than most realize , saying some people would never leave the house if they knew the truth .
i was telling steve doocy on the way in here , if he knew what i knew about terrorism , he d never leave the house in the morning , kelly said on fox & friends .
he noted there were four major terror attacks in the last week in england , egypt , the philippines and indonesia by generally the same groups .
it s everywhere .
it s constant .
it s nonstop .
the good news for us in america is we have amazing people protecting us every day .
but it can happen here almost anytime .
