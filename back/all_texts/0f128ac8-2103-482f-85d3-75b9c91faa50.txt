Chris thrill up his leg Matthews does his best to convince Steve Cortez, a Trump surrogate that he s not part of the liberal mainstream media.
Matthew s boasts that over his decades long career as a political hack, he s criticized Al Gore s campaign and even gasp criticized Bill Clinton s elicit affair with a young intern.
In reality, he criticized Al Gore s campaign because he lost to George W. Bush and even wth the full-force of the crooked Democrat party behind him, they couldn t find a way to make the numbers work in Gore s favor during the hotly contested recount in Florida.
We re not even going to comment on the Clinton-Lewinsky scandal.
The only reason the media didn t embarrass Hillary for habitually enabling her husband to sexually assault any female who was unfortunate enough to get caught behind a closed door with her rapist husband, is because they always knew this day was coming.
