john coleman , founder , the weather channel , appeared on cnn s reliable sources with host brian stelter , after writing an open letter to ucla denying the existence of anthropogenic global warming .
this is a great takedown : coleman told stelter that cnn has taken a very strong position on global warming that it is a consensus .
well there is no consensus in science .
science isn t a vote .
science is about facts , and that he was terribly disappointed by his former network , the weather channel , because it has bought into [ climate change ] .
but so has all the media .
that s no big surprise .
coleman notes that he is not a paid shill ( as has been claimed ) of the koch brothers , concluding his letter with a link to heartland s nongovernmental international panel on climate change ( nipcc ) website .
coleman s open letter to ucla was sent to numerous local television stations in the los angeles area , as well as the los angeles times.coleman produced a special report for kusi-tv , entitled global warming : the other side .
the program suggests that global warming is a scam and presents what colemen contends is evidence of a deliberate manipulation of world temperature data by nasa and other groups .
