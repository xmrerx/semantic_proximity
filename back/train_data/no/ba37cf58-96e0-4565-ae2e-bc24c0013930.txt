# basketofdeplorables pic.twitter.com/eoihfmywxt asa j ( @ asamjulian ) october 1 , 2016now she s offended half of the democrat base with this latest video that has been uncovered.an audio recording has surfaced , revealing hillary clinton speaking critically about young voters supporting sen. bernie sanders ( i-vt ) , saying they ve bought into a false promise .
it s a false promise , clinton says in the recording , referencing sanders political revolution .
but i don t think you tell idealistic people particularly young people that they ve bought into a false promise .
the audio , which was released by the washington free beacon , comes just three weeks after clinton faced backlash for calling millions of americans supporting donald trump deplorables .
the recording , which is from a fundraising event in february , catches the democratic nominee calling sanders supporters children of the great recession that are living in their parents basement .
there is a strain of , on the one hand , the kind of populist , nationalist , xenophobic , discriminatory kind of approach that we hear too much of from the republican candidates , clinton states.watch : via : breitbart news
