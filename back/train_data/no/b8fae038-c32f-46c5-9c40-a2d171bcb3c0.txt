vienna ( reuters ) - austria s conservatives and far-right freedom party ( fpo ) could complete coalition talks as soon as friday evening and be sworn in on monday , officials from both parties said .
a deal between the center-right people s party ( ovp ) led by 31-year-old sebastian kurz and the anti-immigration freedom party would mark a major victory for a european far-right party after a flurry of elections this year .
we are putting effort into this and we would be happy if it was possible to announce an agreement to you today , but i can not promise it yet , said gernot bluemel , a close kurz ally and leader of the conservatives in vienna .
we hope that we can properly conclude ( the last issues ) over the course of today .
if you want to compare it to a skiing race , we are now doing the last turns before the finish line ...
i am in good spirits .
conservative interior minister wolfgang sobotka , whom local media and a source close to the coalition talks have named as a candidate for finance minister , told orf radio a new government will be sworn in on monday .
an fpo source confirmed the envisaged timing for an agreement and swearing-in ceremony , adding a news conference with kurz and freedom party leader heinz-christian strache was planned for 1800 vienna time ( 1700 gmt ) on friday .
the freedom party last entered government in 2000 , triggering european sanctions against austria .
such a step has not been flagged this time around , with many european countries having shifted to the political right .
kurz , whose party won just over 31 percent in october s parliamentary elections , is all but certain to become chancellor with strache whose fpo got 26 percent for third place after the social democrats as his deputy .
freedom party officials are set to fill major ministries , including the interior , foreign , defense , health and social affairs and infrastructure portfolios .
this list has been neither confirmed nor denied by party officials .
