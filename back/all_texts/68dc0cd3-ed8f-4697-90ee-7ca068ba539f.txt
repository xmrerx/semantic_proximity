Robert De Niro was supposed to appear in a non-partisan public service announcement for the get out the vote organization, Vote Your Future, but the actor had a difficult time staying on script.
Instead, he used the opportunity to go off on Trump in one of the most passionate anti-Trump videos to date.
He s so blatantly stupid, the video beings.
He s a punk.
He s a dog (please don t insult dogs, Robert), he s a pig, he s a con, a bullshit artist, a mutt (again with the dog insult) who doesn t know what he s talking about.
He doesn t do his homework, De Niro continued, doesn t care.
He s gaming society, doesn t pay his taxes.
He s an idiot.
Colin Powell said it best, he s a national disaster, he s an embarrassment to this country.'
It makes me so angry, added De Niro, that this country has gotten to this point that this fool, this bozo, has wound up where he has.
He talks how he wants to punch people in the face, a visibly angry De Niro said,Vote Your Future chose not to include the video in their campaign, since they are non-partisan.
Oddly, though, Fox News Megyn Kelly did air the segment, in fact, it was giving specifically to her.
Here it is:The video was recorded before Friday s game changing video of Donald Trump talking about groping women, but the timing coincided very well.
You can be sure that De Niro s opinion hasn t changed.Is the fact that Kelly, on Fox News, was the person to release this video a sign that Fox News is turning on the GOP candidate or is this just another shot in Kelly s war against Trump?As for De Niro, bravo, although it s not a huge risk to turn on Trump these days.
Everyone in Hollywood, from Republican politicians to evangelical Christians, are turning on Trump.
The only remaining mystery is why people still support this narcissistic, thin-skinned, racist, nationalistic, misogynistic monster.Featured image via Kevin Winter/Getty Images.
