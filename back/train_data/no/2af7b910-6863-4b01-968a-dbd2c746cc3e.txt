( reuters ) - texas governor greg abbott on friday gave $ 50 million to houston to help cover costs related to hurricane harvey , a move the mayor said will allow the city to avoid a temporary property tax hike that was up for a city council vote in october .
mayor sylvester turner , who accepted the money from the republican governor at a city hall press conference , said he will pull his proposal for a one-year tax increase to cover the city ’ s share of debris removal expenses and for insurance-related payments .
parts of houston suffered severe wind and flood damage after hurricane harvey made landfall on aug. 25 .
it was the strongest hurricane to hit texas in more than 50 years .
earlier this week , abbott rejected turner ’ s request for the state to immediately tap its $ 10 billion rainy day fund to aid its largest city .
on friday , the governor said he had the flexibility to withdraw $ 50 million from a state disaster relief fund for houston .
“ this looked like the best solution at this point , ” abbott told reporters .
he added that once the state gets a handle on total hurricane expenses , the texas legislature will consider tapping into the rainy day fund when its next regular session begins in january 2019 or sooner in a special session .
