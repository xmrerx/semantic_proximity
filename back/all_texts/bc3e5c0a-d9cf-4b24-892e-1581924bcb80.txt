Terrified concert goers fled an Ariana Grande gig after Salman Abedi, 22, detonated a bomb full of shrapnel and nails late on Monday evening.Shocking footage showed carnage brought to the streets of Manchester, with more than 120 people injured in the blast.Disgusting hate cult ISIS has claimed responsibility for the attack, and described Abedi as one of their soldiers.And a former neighbour of the suicide bomber believes he could have been a member of the terror group for quite some time.Antone Jones, who lived close to the attacker in the Fallowfield area of the city, described seeing the ISIS flag being draped from the roof of his house.He told the MEN: I never really knew him well, he always kept himself to himself.
But about two years ago there was a black flag on the roof with Arabic writing on it.
We never had any idea he was doing anything like this though.
He was quiet.
Another neighbour, from Gorton, said his manner led him to believe he was a member of ISIS.He said: He walked past me one evening.
He looked at me with his cold black eyes.
It was an expression I didn t want to see on a face.
He looked at me in a way that suggested he could take care of himself.
I said at the time I wouldn t be surprised if he was ISIS.
