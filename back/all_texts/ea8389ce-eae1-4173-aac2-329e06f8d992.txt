BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany expects to work closely together with Austria s new government, government spokesman Steffen Seibert said on Monday when asked if Berlin had reservations about the presence in the new coalition of a far-right party.
We are open to and prepared for a close and trusting relationship with the new Austrian government, Seibert told a regular news conference held some minutes after the new Vienna government, a coalition of the centre-right with the far-right Freedom Party, was sworn in.
Asked if he had concerns about cooperating with a foreign ministry or security services under the control of far-right ministers, he said: We do not comment on ministerial assignments, especially not those made by our friends and neighbours.
