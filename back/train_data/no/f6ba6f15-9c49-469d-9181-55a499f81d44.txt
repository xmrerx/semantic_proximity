erbil , iraq ( reuters ) - iraq s parliament has no right to remove kirkuk s governor from office , a senior kurdish official said on thursday , after parliament voted him out following a request by prime minister haider al-abadi .
he is an elected governor of the council of kirkuk , said hoshyar zebari , a close adviser to kurdish president massoud barzani .
that is the only body that can remove him .
