Appearing on Fox News, former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani decided to make the bold claim that the world is more dangerous than ever after citing shootings like Orlando.
He even went so far as to say: Do you ever remember the world as dangerous as this?
I don t. It s like, c mon man, you were the mayor of NYC during 9/11/01, but I get it, that happened under a Republican president, and you don t want to dare insinuate your own party is weak on terror.
Got it.Now, to be completely honest, it s not so much that Giuliani forgot he was mayor of NYC during the worst terrorist attack on American soil, but he seems to be playing completely ignorant to that fact, and is just trying to throw President Obama and Hillary Clinton under a bus.To his credit (of which he should get none) he did mention 9/11 in passing, but as if only to glaze over the fact that it was a terrorist attack on our nation, but he seems to think that what s happening now is worse than the day nearly 3,000 Americans lost their lives.His political pandering clearly knows absolutely no bounds, and should enrage us all.Watch Giuliani go on Fox News to feign complete ignorance here.Giuliani: "Do you ever remember the world as dangerous as this?
I don't."
