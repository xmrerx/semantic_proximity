In an interview with Fox Business that aired Tuesday, Donald Trump responded to news that the FBI had successfully obtained a FISA warrant to look into his former advisor Carter Page by trashing James Comey for not locking Hillary Clinton up.
Sure, Clinton did not commit any crimes and was never charged with anything, but according to Trump she is GUILTY GUILTY GUILTY.
When Jim Comey came out, he saved Hillary Clinton.
He saved her life, Trump said, apparently forgetting that a certain letter from Comey helped swing the election his way.
When he was reading those charges, she was guilty of every charge, and then he said she was essentially OK.
Nevertheless, for some reason Trump says he trusts Comey to clear him with regard to Russia.Trump also complained that he is understaffed because of obstructionist Democrats and other things that prevent him from accomplishing what he wants like the law.
In reality, the problem is that The Donald isn t actually nominating people.
Democrats have only obstructed when there was a legitimate objection, like that the person worked with Russia or is a white supremacist.Trump told Fox that he still believes he was correct when he accused President Obama of tapping his wires at Trump Tower because numerous members of his administration were and are under investigation by the FBI for their illegal activities (many involving Russia).
While it is true that Trump Tower was monitored years ago, it had more to do with the Russian money laundering operation that was happening three floors below Trump s penthouse than anything else.
Over 30 Russian mobsters were indicted as a result of the investigation.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab
