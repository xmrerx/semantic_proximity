In the wake of the horrific Orlando shooting that targeted the LGBTQ venue Pulse Nightclub, most GOP politicians have avoided any mention of the fact that this was an anti-LGBTQ hate crime.
They can t say anything about it; after all, because they share much of the same sort of intolerance as the shooter did.
However, their presumptive nominee made a MASSIVE mistake in the wake of all of this, and actually made the laughable claim that he would be a better ally to LGBTQ people than Hillary Clinton would.
That s a pretty funny claim, considering the fact that his party is full of gay hating imbeciles, and they have written anti-gay hate into their official party platform.None of that phases Trump though, and he took to his Twitter account to try to cozy up to the gays:Thank you to the LGBT community!
I will fight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 14, 2016Well, the LGBTQ community on Twitter was having none of it, and the #LGBTQhatesTrumpParty hashtag was born.
The tweets are just as fabulous as you would expect.
Here are just a few of the best ones:Make America Great Again = "A time when opportunity and dignity were reserved for some, not for all."

Trump is no friend of LGBTQ people, as no GOPer could ever be a true friend to us.
It s just more pandering and lies.
It s especially silly to suggest he d be better for LGBTQ people than Hillary considering that Democrats have full LGBTQ equality as part of their official party platform, while the GOP has nothing but hate for queer people in theirs.So, don t believe the orange monster, folks.
