tokyo ( reuters ) - a japanese teenager is suing the government of osaka , saying her public high school repeatedly forced her to dye her naturally-brown hair black or be banned from attending school , local media reported on friday .
in a lawsuit filed in osaka district court , the 18-year-old girl said her mother informed kaifukan school in habikino city upon her enrolment that she was born with brownish hair , as the school had a policy banning hair coloring , media reported .
educators , however , instructed her to color her hair black , telling her repeatedly that the dye job was insufficient and forcing her to either dye the hair black or quit school , kyodo news reported , citing the lawsuit .
the girl has not attended school since september 2016 , suffered pain and irritation from the hair dye , and is seeking damages of about 2.2 million yen ( $ 19,300 ) , said media , adding that osaka prefecture is asking the court to reject the claim .
masahiko takahashi , head of kaifukan school , said he could not comment directly on the case , but noted the school s policy prohibiting students from dyeing or bleaching hair .
he declined to say whether it was permissible to dye brown hair to black .
the girl could not be reached for comment .
in japan , where conformity is the cultural norm , many schools have strict rules about hair color , accessories , make-up and uniforms , including the length of skirts for girls .
