moscow ( reuters ) - a russian submarine fired cruise missiles at jihadi targets in syria s idlib province on friday , the russian defence ministry said , saying it had targeted islamist militants who had tried to trap a group of russian military policemen earlier in the week .
the strike , launched from the mediterranean by russia s veliky novgorod submarine , was part of a counter-offensive against a jihadi attack on government-held parts of northwest syria near hama on tuesday .
the russian defence ministry on wednesday said 29 russian military policemen had been surrounded by jihadis as a result of that attack and that russia had been forced to break them out in a special operation backed by air power .
on friday , it said in a statement it had fired kalibr cruise missiles at the same jihadis from a distance of 300 kilometers ( 186.41 miles ) striking command centers , armored vehicles and the bases of jihadis who had taken part in the original attack .
