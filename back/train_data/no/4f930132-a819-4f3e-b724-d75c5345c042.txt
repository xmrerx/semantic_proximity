beirut ( reuters ) - an israeli air strike targeted a factory south of the syrian city of homs on wednesday and the syrian army responded by firing a surface-to-air missile at the aircraft , a commander in a military alliance fighting in support of damascus said .
the commander told reuters the air strike had hit a copper factory in the industrial town of hisya , 35 km ( 21 miles ) south of homs and 112 km ( 70 miles ) north of damascus .
the commander did not give details of any casualties .
the syrian observatory for human rights , a britain-based organization that reports on the war , said the air strike had targeted a military installation .
an israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment .
israel s channel 10 said the aircraft were not hit and returned safely to base .
the israeli air force says it has struck arms convoys of the syrian military and its lebanese ally , the iran-backed hezbollah , nearly 100 times in recent years .
israeli officials have expressed alarm at iranian influence in syria , where iran-backed groups have played a critical role fighting in support of president bashar al-assad during the conflict that erupted in 2011 .
iran s military chief general mohammad baqeri warned israel against breaching syrian airspace and territory during a visit to damascus last month .
last month , five projectiles from syria set off air raid sirens in israeli towns , prompting the israeli military to say it would step up its response to stray fire from the syrian war that has repeatedly spilled over the border .
the israeli air force attacked a syrian anti-aircraft battery earlier that week that israel said had fired a missile at its planes while they were on a reconnaissance mission over neighboring lebanon .
tensions between israel and hezbollah , which last fought a major conflict in 2006 , have escalated this year .
each side has warned it would unleash devastating firepower in the event of a full-scale war .
