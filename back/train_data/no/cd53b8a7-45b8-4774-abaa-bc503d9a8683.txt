amsterdam ( reuters ) - eberhard van der laan , amsterdam s popular mayor , has died of lung cancer , the city said on friday .
van der laan informed city residents of his illness in january , saying the prognosis left little reason for optimism .
when he retreated from public life three weeks ago , thousands gathered in front of his canal-side house to applaud for several minutes in a display of support .
van der laan , 62 , was known as an effective , pragmatic and sometimes combative mayor with a sense of humor .
when an occupy tent camp arose in front of the stock market in october 2011 , van der laan was a frequent visitor , engaging protesters in discussion .
he allowed the tents to remain until a court ordered them cleared months later .
one of his most remarkable moments on an international stage was in 2013 when van der laan said he was too busy to meet vladimir putin during the russian president s visit to amsterdam , and ordered a rainbow flag flown from city hall in protest at russian policies against homosexuals .
the former lawyer served briefly as housing minister and shortly after becoming mayor in 2010 enforced a law banning squatting , sparking minor riots and banishing a long amsterdam tradition to the fringes .
van der laan is survived by his wife and five children from two marriages .
