Hillary is starting to pull out all the stops in going after Trump s bromance with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin.
In her latest attack ad, she reminds us that we don t know anything about his shady ties with Russia, and that it s time we find out what s going on there.The ad reminds us exactly why we can t trust Trump in the White House beyond his blatant, cavalier attitude towards the truth.
He very well could be intentionally undermining the U.S. by pushing Putin s foreign agenda.
What she does is paint him as a possible agent to Russia, rather than a serious American running for the highest office in the country, and she s right we need to start asking questions.Watch her destroy him below:Hillary s campaign site has an article with five questions we should be asking of Trump s ties to Russia, and this ad builds on those:Will Trump sell us out to Russia if he s elected?
Probably.
Hillary s begun digging hard into him for it, too.Photo of Donald Trump by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.
