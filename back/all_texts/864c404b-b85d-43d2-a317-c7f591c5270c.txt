The entire Republican Party spent the 2016 campaign season running on a promise to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare.
However, now that they have the House, the Senate, and the White House, they re like a dog who caught a car it s been chasing for years, and they can t agree on what to do.This entire week has been spent with party members bickering amongst themselves, and many members of the GOP House Conference in open revolt against Paul Ryan s repeal and replace bill.
In fact, the bill was so terrible and would cost so many people their health coverage, that even Donald Trump wouldn t put his name on it.
The White House has openly said not to dub the plan Trumpcare.
Well, it seems that for now, there will be no Obamacare repeal.
In fact, there won t even be a vote.
House Speaker Paul Ryan has pulled the bill because it seems it became clear Friday afternoon that they would not have the votes to get this mess of a healthcare reform bill past the House, much less past the Senate.
Of course, this comes just one day after Trump gave House Republicans an ultimatum: Either hold a vote or there will be no Obamacare repeal on his watch, period.That really should come as no surprise, given Trump s low level of patience, short attention span, and penchant for throwing tantrums.
He also reportedly said to those voting No, on the bill, I m gonna come after you.
So, who really knows what will come of the relationship between the White House and Congress after this; after all, it was already just a lukewarm marriage of convenience.Well, we ve given the GOP a chance to govern.
They have all three branches of the federal government.
And they have instead descended into utter chaos in 60 days flat, have been fielding scandal after scandal, and have gotten nothing done.
Time to give it back to the Democrats, because it s clear that the Republicans can t handle it.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images
