Trump spokeswoman and walking stump Katrina Pierson responded to how she thinks liberals reacted to Jeff Sessions claiming he will follow the Constitution on Monday with perhaps the dumbest thing that will disgrace Twitter this week, month, or maybe year.
When Democrats heard @SenatorSessions commit to enforcing the United States Constitution as AG during his confirmation hearing #MAGA, she tweeted.
Trump s favorite imbecile then includes a video of her impression of these imagined liberals, which is basically just her making stupid faces into the camera with a poorly-edited explosion and cartoonish sound effects.
All of these things are terrible individually, but put them together and hoo boy!When Democrats heard @SenatorSessions commit to enforcing the United States Constitution as AG during his confirmation hearing #MAGA pic.twitter.com/QtQ3sBMMfy Katrina Pierson (@KatrinaPierson) January 10, 2017In the end, she wound up with sh*t all over her face.Naturally, Twitter wasn t going to allow Pierson to pull such an attention-seeking, ridiculous stunt without informing her of exactly what is wrong with her as a human being (and just making fun of her, period):@KatrinaPierson @SenatorSessions Any adults around there or is everyone associated with Trump pretty much like this?

CANNOT admit he was ever wrong !
Dennis Lurvey (@GeniusPhx) January 10, 2017@the4closer attorney general is NOT a political position.
he is supposed to apply the rule of law evenly.
His past says he cannot do that.
Dennis Lurvey (@GeniusPhx) January 10, 2017@KatrinaPierson @SenatorSessions lmao like enforcing the voting rights act Sam Robinson (@SamRob41) January 10, 2017@KatrinaPierson @SenatorSessions Session's nomination is clear proof that Trump has no intention to unify country.

Mrs Dimsworthy (@MrsDimsworthy) January 10, 2017@KatrinaPierson Bath Salts no question about .
Teddy Watts(Eduardo) (@WattsTeddy) January 10, 2017@KatrinaPierson @SenatorSessions Very silly and VERY immature.
I pray you're able to assemble together some grace and dignity before D.C. Lisa Saunders (@MrsLisaSaunders) January 10, 2017In reality, liberals would be thrilled if Trump appointed someone who could be trusted to uphold the Constitution, but Sessions has a long and storied past with regard to race relations.
Not only does he oppose the Voting Rights Act, but he was once determined to be too racist to be a federal judge when Reagan tried to appoint him.
If he s too racist to be a federal judge, then he s too racist to be attorney general especially since he says himself that he was fine with the KKK until he learned they smoke marijuana (you seriously can t make this shit up).Featured image via screenshot and Twitter
