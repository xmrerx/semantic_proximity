dubai ( reuters ) - five suspected al qaeda militants were killed in drone strikes on two villages in yemen s al baida governorate on saturday , a local official and residents said .
the strikes targeted two villages where al qaeda is known to be active , a local official said , adding that a total of five were killed in the strikes in central yemen .
residents said two suspected militants were killed when a drone targeted the car they were traveling in .
three people were injured in the strikes , they said .
yemen s al qaeda branch , known as al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) , has taken advantage of a more than two-year-old civil war between the iran-aligned houthi group and president abd-rabbu mansour hadi s saudi-backed government to strengthen its position in the impoverished country .
the united states has repeatedly attacked aqap with aircraft and unmanned drones in what u.s. officials say is a campaign to wear down the group s ability to coordinate attacks abroad .
