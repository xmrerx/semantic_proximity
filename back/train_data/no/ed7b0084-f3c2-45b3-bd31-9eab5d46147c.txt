washington ( reuters ) - republican u.s .
senator lindsey graham on sunday urged the pentagon to start moving u.s. military dependents , such as spouses and children , out of south korea , saying conflict with north korea is getting close .
it s crazy to send spouses and children to south korea given the provocation of north korea , graham , a member of the senate armed services committee , said on cbs s face the nation .
so i want them ( the pentagon ) to stop sending dependents and i think it s now time to start moving american dependents out of south korea , graham said .
the united states has 28,500 troops in south korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 korean war .
on wednesday , north korea tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile ( icbm ) that can fly over 13,000 km ( 8,080 miles ) , placing washington within target range , south korea said on friday .
graham said this development showed conflict is approaching .
we re getting close to military conflict because north korea is marching toward marrying up the technology of an icbm with a nuclear weapon on top that can not only get to america , but deliver the weapon .
we re running out of time , graham told cbs .
the pentagon referred questions to the pacific command , which was not immediately available for comment .
white house national security adviser h.r .
mcmaster told fox news sunday that president donald trump is prepared to take action against north korea but is working to convince china , russia and other nations to use more economic pressure to help curb its nuclear ambitions .
the president s going to take care of it by , if we have to , doing more ourselves .
but what we want to do is convince others , it is in their interest to do more , mcmaster said .
the trump administration has repeatedly said all options are on the table in dealing with north korea s ballistic and nuclear weapons programs , including military ones , but that it still prefers a diplomatic option .
