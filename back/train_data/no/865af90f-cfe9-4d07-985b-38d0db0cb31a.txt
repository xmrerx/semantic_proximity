berlin ( reuters ) - german federal prosecutors on tuesday finalised their ban on an islamist association accused of radicalizing youngsters , saying that complaints about the ban from two members of the group had been withdrawn .
last year , the interior ministry banned the islamist group true religion , saying it had persuaded about 140 people to join militants in iraq and syria .
[ nl8n1dg28o ] following the ban , police launched dawn raids across germany on about 190 mosques , flats and offices linked to the group .
the federal prosecutor said that since the association itself had not complained about the ban and the two members complaints had been withdrawn , the prohibition ruling was final .
the case comes as germany commemorates last year s islamist-motivated attack on a berlin christmas market which killed 12 people and injured many others .
