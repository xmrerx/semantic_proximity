Did Hillary Clinton ever apologize for receiving the answers to the debate?
Trump tweeted.
Just asking!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 3, 2017Clinton has not, in fact, apologized for receiving the answers (he means questions) for a debate, but she has a good reason it didn t happen.Trump s claim comes from a fake news story in the Baltimore Gazette, a fake news source.The first presidential debate was held and Hillary Clinton was proclaimed the winner by the media.
Indeed Clinton was able to turn in a strong debate performance, but did she do so fairly?
Multiple reports and leaked information from inside the Clinton camp claim that the Clinton campaign was given the entire set of debate questions an entire week before the actual debate.Earlier last week an NBC intern was seen hand delivering a package to Clinton s campaign headquarters, according to multiple sources.
The package was not given to secretarial staff, as would normally happen, but the intern was instead ushered into the personal office of Clinton campaign manager Robert Mook.
Members of the Clinton press corps from several media organizations were in attendance at the time, and a reporter from Fox News recognized the intern, but said he was initially confused because the NBC intern was dressed like a Fed Ex employee.Even though the story is a lie, right-wing websites, Russian trolls, and everyone who hates Hillary Clinton jumped on the opportunity to accuse the former Secretary of State of cheating.He then pushed his insane allegation that President Obama put a tapp on his wires at Trump Tower..@FoxNews from multiple sources: "There was electronic surveillance of Trump, and people close to Trump.
This is unprecedented."

Turd (@Turdtastic) April 3, 2017At this point, Trump s attempts to distract from his very real Russia scandal are pathetic and we can only expect them to become more unhinged as he backs himself further into a corner.Featured image via Getty Images (Mark Wilson)/screengrab
