berlin ( reuters ) - a berlin court ruling that permits the parents and siblings of a 16-year-old syrian migrant to join him in germany will now take effect after the foreign ministry abruptly dropped an appeal of the decision , german broadcaster ard reported on friday .
ard said foreign minister sigmar gabriel , a member of the center-left social democrats ( spd ) , decided to drop an appeal filed just days ago , allow the ruling to take effect , following intense criticism by top spd leaders .
the ruling was the first to deal with the right of under-age migrants to bring their families to germany and could set a new precedent , ard reported .
the foreign ministry had no immediate comment on the issue , but gabriel told the broadcaster : we know that it is bad , of course , when minors are here without their parents .
it s a good thing that we now have clarity .
the ministry s reversal on the issue comes as gabriel s party prepares to enter talks with chancellor angela merkel s conservatives about continuing the grand coalition that has ruled germany for the past four years .
migration - and the issue of allowing migrants to bring family members to germany - could be a key topic in the coalition talks , which are due to begin on jan. 7 .
merkel had failed to reach agreement with two smaller parties .
the case in question centers on a syrian youth who arrived in germany in the summer of 2015 with an older cousin , and was granted only subsidiary protection rather than full asylum .
in 2016 , the government had decided to suspend family re-unifications for two years for migrants with subsidiary protection , which is granted to people who are not considered as being persecuted individually but in whose home country there is war , torture or other inhumane treatment .
the court said that rejecting the family reunification in this case violated child welfare protections guaranteed under the european human rights convention and the u.n .
refugee convention .
