An Ohio mother who attended a Bernie Sanders rally has been receiving death threats after a photo of her breast feeding her child went viral.Margaret Ellen Bradford of Barberton, Ohio was at the Sanders rally with her six-month-old daughter Harper.
When Harper became hungry, Bradford was standing in the middle of the crowd very close to where Bernie was speaking so she couldn t easily move to a quiet corner to feed her.
With Harper crying, Bradford decided to feed Harper in place.It wasn t until later that Bradford realized that someone had taken a photo of her, and it went viral as a result of the hashtag #BoobsforBernie.Some women were very supportive of Bradford:Good for her!
Good for Bernie Sanders!
Nothing wrong with breast feeding.
The "stigma" is backwards.

Bradford said: Honestly, I ve cried three times already from some of the hateful messages I ve received, telling me my daughter should be taken away or that I m just an uneducated lowlife hick.
There is no reason why something like this should be so unheard of in 2016, because that s what moms do.
Society, catch up with biology.
It s crazy to think that people are so uncomfortable with something so natural that they would send a young mother death threats.
So-called conservatives, especially men in this case, continue to believe they have some right to tell women what to do with their bodies on issues like contraception, abortion, and breast feeding.
They have no authority to do so.Watch the video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHvLEWjkMNM?feature=player_detailpage] Featured image via video screen capture
