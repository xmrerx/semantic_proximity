washington ( reuters ) - the securities and exchange commission on monday approved the budget for the auditing watchdog that oversees the work of leading u.s. accounting firms .
the sec staff recommended approving the budget of the public company accounting oversight board ( pcaob ) and sec commission chair mary jo white and commissioner kara stein endorsed the $ 257.7 million budget .
commissioner michael s. piwowar voted against , saying he was skeptical of the nearly 3 percent increase in the pcaob budget from a year ago .
he also said he was not persuaded that the additional burden on accounting firms and broker-dealers , which fund the pcaob through fees , was merited .
“ the commission represents the only safeguard to an otherwise unilateral ability to impose the accounting support fee on companies and broker-dealers , ” said .
the sec controls the budget and assigns members of the pcaob , which was conceived to prevent future accounting scandals like the one that brought down energy company enron in 2001 .
the sec has two vacant seats and the senate banking committee is due on tuesday to consider two nominees put forward by the white house .
commission chair mary jo white has said she intends to wait until the agency once again has its full , five-member panel before moving forward to appoint a new pcaob chief .
current pcaob chairman james doty ’ s term expired last fall .
