washington ( reuters ) - republican lawmakers introduced legislation on tuesday to counter president barack obama ’ s bid to close the guantanamo detention center , underscoring the difficulty he faces keeping a promise to close it before leaving office next year .
republican representative ed royce , the chairman of the house of representatives foreign affairs committee , introduced a measure that would force the obama administration to publicize plans for transfers from guantanamo .
currently , the administration must inform congress of plans for any transfers , but those notices are classified .
public notice of plans to move detainees would allow opponents more time to marshal opposition and potentially stop any transfers .
“ this legislation will bring much needed public scrutiny to the administration ’ s mad rush to transfer detainees out of guantanamo bay before president obama leaves office , ” royce said in a statement .
four other republicans , senators richard burr , kelly ayotte , tom cotton and marco rubio , a 2016 presidential hopeful , introduced a bill late on monday that would bar obama from returning the naval base at guantanamo to cuba without authorization from congress .
a similar bill was introduced in the house by republican representative david jolly .
“ it ’ s clear that the threats to the united states are increasing , not decreasing , and we need every available military asset .
as president obama continues to court the castro regime , i believe it is important that congress makes clear that he can not give up our base in such a strategic location , ” said burr , the chairman of the senate intelligence committee .
“ president obama ’ s aggressive push to close the detention facility at guantanamo bay is dangerous , ” burr said .
