vienna ( reuters ) - austria s social democratic ( spo ) chancellor christian kern pledged on sunday to get to the bottom of his party s connection to a smear campaign against the head of the main opposition people s party two weeks before a parliamentary election .
austrian newspapers reported on saturday that tal silberstein , a former spo adviser dismissed this summer , was behind two websites making unsubstantiated allegations against foreign minister sebastian kurz , whose people s party is leading polls ahead of the oct. 15 parliamentary election .
it matters to me that we gain full transparency on what happened .
we decided to set up an internal task force to review what happened in a thorough and transparent way , kern told journalists at a press briefing in vienna .
spo chairman georg niedermuehlbichler announced his resignation on saturday over the matter .
kern said the spo had stopped working with silberstein on aug. 17 , including all money transfers , and that it was not clear why the activities attributed to him continued and even intensified after that date .
i am referring to anti-semitic propaganda that i reject with all my heart , kern said .
reuters has been unable to reach silberstein for comment .
kern said he was also very interested in finding out who was behind leaked emails during the campaign that were aimed at harming him .
he hinted that other political parties might be involved .
the leader of the green party , ulrike lunacek , said in a statement that if kern had indications that other parties were involved he should make them public .
herbert kickl , secretary general of austria s far-right freedom party ( fpo ) , said in a statement kern had missed his chance to step down honorably and was instead trying to present himself as a victim .
