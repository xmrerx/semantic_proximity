Jeb Bush was originally the annointed one for the GOP Presidential nomination.
However, Donald Trump turned the whole race upside down, and Bush never made it out of the single digits.
As the South Carolina Primary draws to a close with yet another poor showing in what is widely seen as one of the most important primaries of the election season, supporters of other GOP candidates urge Bush to drop out.
Florida Senator Tim Scott, who is backing Marco Rubio, says of Bush s candidacy and how it affects the GOP s chances at the White House: It s hard to tell you what the Bush camp is thinking.
He served as a great governor.
I think it d be a great opportunity for him to bring his folks over to the Rubio camp.
But the reality is everyone who is running wants to do something good for America, so the question is, once you realize that s not going to happen, what do you do next?
It s hard to answer that question unless you re the candidate.
Sen. Scott wasn t the only one to call for Bush s withdrawal from the race.
His fellow struggling GOP candidate John Kasich had his campaign put out the idea that tonight it became a four-person race between Trump, Kasich, Rubio, and Cruz.
John Kasich strategist and supporter John Weaver said of the South Carolina outcome: Only four candidates have top-three finishes in any of the early states and can justify staying in.
At the same time, John Kasich has now won the so-called Governors Bracket by continuing to run strong and beat expectations.
While others were making their last stand in South Carolina, John Kasich strengthened his organization and support despite being outspent by tens of millions of dollars.
The pressure worked, as Bush has suspended his campaign.
So long, Jeb.God bless America indeed.Featured image via Soda Head
