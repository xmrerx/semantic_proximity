It clear that common sense isn t what these hens want to hear.
Common sense would tell anyone that the FBI dropped the ball with the Florida shooter.
watch as Meghan McCain is shut down after making the best argument for how the Florida shooting could have been avoided:Meghan McCain got cut off on The View Friday after telling her co-hosts that the Florida school shooter was flagged by the FBI and nothing happened.The comment came during a discussion about gun control following the deadly shooting Wednesday in Parkland, Florida, at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School after a 19-year-old man opened fire at school killing 17 people, including teachers and students before being taken into custody.Daily caller reports: The argument from NRA members and Second Amendment supporters is much like abortion.
Not a lot of trust on both sides for compromise, McCain explained.
I m like okay, we can talk about assault weapons.
That being said, I know people who own them who obviously aren t mass murderers.
They re hunters and use they them for target practice and hunting.
And it s like if you give a mouse a cookie then we are going to go to..it s a slippery slope going forward.
Much like abortion, It s so emotional on both sides, I think it s hard for people on both sides to have faith that we can meet in the middle.
With all due respect you didn t grow up in gun country, McCain explained.A short time later, McCain said no one is in support of people with mental illness having guns and that this shooter was flagged by the FBI and still nothing happened.
