berlin ( reuters ) - german chancellor angela merkel said on friday she could well imagine a european finance minister but stressed that the creation of such a position would have to be underpinned with reforms of substance .
we certainly need to strengthen the governance of the euro zone ...
i have nothing against a european finance minister .
i can well imagine that , she told a joint news conference in berlin with french prime minister edouard philippe .
but what is important to me is that we underpin the slogans - economic government and european finance minister and budget - with substance .
merkel added that although monetary policy in the euro zone was harmonized , economic cooperation was still incoherent .
