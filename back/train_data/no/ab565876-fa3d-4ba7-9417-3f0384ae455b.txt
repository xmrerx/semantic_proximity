wouldn t it be great if our first black president would make an effort to quell the angry and violent crowds in baltimore by and asking for calm ?

as long as the negro finds himself living every day in a major depression , then every city will sit on a powder keg and will explode over the slightest incident .
this is why i have constantly said that riots are socially destructive and self-defeating .
after all , the negro ends up on the losing end .
we can t win a violent revolution .
the persons who end up not being able to get milk for their children are the negros , because things where they have to live are destroyed .
dr. king : nonviolence is the most powerful weapon violence creates more social problems than it solves .
