MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday that law enforcement agencies must take tough action against persons and groups using the Internet for extremist ends.
The security of Russia s Internet must be heightened, we must fight against those using the information space to spread extremist ideas, Putin told a meeting of Russia s Security Council.
At the same time, I would like to stress that there can be no talk about restricting access of law-abiding citizens to the worldwide web, about any pervasive barriers and filters, he said.
