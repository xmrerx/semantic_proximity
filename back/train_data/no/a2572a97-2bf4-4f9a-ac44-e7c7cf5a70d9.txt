anderson cooper decided it would be a good idea to roll his eyes numerous times during his interview with kellyanne conway not smart ! the cameras caught his eye rolls classless move !
conway responded by calling his move sexist .
we have to agree because you know he wouldn t pull this move with anyone else .
conway has been just one more person the left has targeted with their slings and arrows .
it s not professional critique but nasty and very sophomoric comments about anything from the way conway dresses to her physical appearance .
it s been brutal but she s such a strong woman that she just keeps bringing great commentary .
we say bravo ! the disrespect is unbelievable !
