Outsider GOP candidate Donald Trump has vigorously denounced the outsourcing by Carrier s air-conditioning business.
His opposition has helped him get a nine-point polling advantage in the state.
But Trump s support for major reforms to the H-1B program to reduce the outsourcing of professional jobs is raising his support among upper-income professional-class voters in many other states.The Caterpillar outsourcing is all the same thing happening over and over again, said John Miano, a lawyer and software expert who has sued the federal government to reduce or stop various outsourcing programs, such as the H-1B visa.
What we see is that companies ask for more [H-1B visas] while they re laying off the same kind of [American professionals] this is going to be an election that decides whether this continues, Miano said.Early in 2016, Caterpillar asked the federal government for 71 H-1B visas needed to hire foreign white-collar college-grads.
At least 30 of the requested H-1B visas are for engineers and other skilled professionals in Mossville, which is suffering the most layoffs.At least 44 of the visas requested in 2016 are for foreign graduates who are already working at Caterpillar in the United States.
These continuation visas are automatically approved, and do not count against the much touted annual limits on H1-B visas.Another 22 of Caterpillar s visas are for new hires.Since 2012, Caterpillar has requested 768 visas for H-1B workers.
Roughly speaking, companies get one-fifth of the H-1B visas they request, suggesting the company has outsourced at least 100 U.S.-based jobs to lower-wage foreign graduates.The visa allows the H-1B workers to stay for at least three years, and some manage to stay permanently.
For example, the company has also helped get green cards the precursor to citizenship for roughly 70 foreign college graduates.
Most of these green card employees have replaced Americans software graduates.Read more: Breitbart
