Ever since the 2008 election, Republicans have been instituting law after law to keep people from voting.
They did this because they knew the right wing of the Supreme Court would support them and they ve been very successful in keeping millions of people away from the ballot.
But without the 5th conservative on the Court to tip the ruling, those days are at an end.Civil rights groups, like a shark smelling blood in the water, are moving in for the kill:On Thursday, the American Civil Liberties Union argued before the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals that people who face significant hardships should be able to vote without an ID.
As in New Hampshire, Idaho, Texas, and several other states, such voters would be able to sign a legally-binding affadavit to prove their identity.
Sean Young, the lead attorney on the case, previously argued that Wisconsin s voter ID law should be struck down entirely.
Some federal courts agreed, comparing the law a poll tax, but the U.S. Supreme Court allowed the law to stand.
Now, the ACLU is arguing that individual categories of people should be allowed to challenge the law and demand accommodations that enable them to vote.This is a page right out of the GOP s playbook.
Carve out an exception here, undermine a ruling there and the next thing you know, it s time to strike Voter ID from the law books.And, oh look!
The Democrats will most likely control both the White House and the Senate next year leaving Republicans with no way to enforce their screamingly obvious voter suppression tactics.
Truly, a sad day for Conservative America.It s going to take several years to clean up the deliberate mess Republicans have made of our elections but it s inevitable at this point.
This won t stop Republicans from coming up with new and more creative means to suppress the vote of Those People but it does mean that it will be increasingly more difficult to get away with it.Featured image via Gage Skidmore
