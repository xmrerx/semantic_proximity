There never seems to be a shortage of smug, know-it-all, self-righteous effeminate men supporting Queen Hillary.
Maybe that s why there s a certain amount of pleasure Hillary s every day Americans derive when they see a member of the mainstream media call them out on national t.v Hillary Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook said a federal judge s ruling that Clinton and her top aides should be questioned under oath about the candidate s private email server is part of the ring wing s effort to hurt her chances of becoming president he was then confronted with an inconvenient fact.Asked by CNN anchor Jake Tapper about the latest development in the months-long email scandal, Mook tried to dismiss the judge s ruling as a right-wing group s attempt to hurt Clinton s chances of becoming president.Tapper was quick to point out that Judge Emmett Sullivan, who sits on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, was appointed by Clinton s own husband, Bill Clinton.
It s the judge s decision to make, Mook responded.
My point is this was promulgated by a right-wing group.
Indeed, Sullivan was appointed to his current position in 1994 by then-President Bill Clinton.He was previously tapped in 1984 by President Ronald Reagan to serve as associate judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia.
In 1991, he was appointed by President George H.W.
Bush to serve as associate judge of the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, before being elevated to his current job.Via:The Blazeh/t Weasel Zippers
