Donald Trump is backed into a corner.
After he was caught on tape admitting to sexually assaulting women, surprise!
several women have come out saying Trump sexually assaulted them.
He s running out of defenses, so Trump turned to one of his old hits.
He s blaming the accusations on the Mexicans.
Well, one Mexican in particular: billionaire Carlos Slim.As early as Friday, Mr. Trump is planning to claim that Mr.
Slim, as a shareholder of New York Times Co. and donor to the Clinton Foundation, has an interest in helping Hillary Clinton s campaign, according to a Trump adviser.Attacking the Mexican billionaire would allow Mr. Trump to hit several targets.
He could slam the failing New York Times, which he says had to be rescued by a foreigner Mr.
Slim, the adviser said.Source: VoxUnfortunately, this is how Trump sees the world.
People are either with him or against him.
Not surprisingly for the controversial land developer, Trump has made a lot of enemies, and it appears those enemies are spread throughout the world.
That alone should disqualify him for the position that is in large part, diplomacy.Beyond that, though, this is a man who refuses to take responsibility for his own actions.
He admitted on tape the he grabs women by the pussy.
Why should it surprise anyone that he actually grabbed some?
Here s a list of all the women who (so far) have accused Trump.
Even if Trump is right that it s some sort of personal vendetta by the New York Times (he s not), reports have come out in the Daily Beast, from CBS News, from a People Magazine reporter, from the Palm Beach Post, from Rolling Stone, from BuzzFeed, from the Guardian, from Vanity Fair, from USA Today, from Jezebel, from the New Yorker and from the Washington Post.Gotta wonder how he s going to blame the Mexicans (or perhaps the Chinese) on all of these.Featured image via Ty Wright/Getty Images.
