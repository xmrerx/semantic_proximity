Black Lives Matter, the group that many believe is a hate group or domestic terror group has inspired a wave of professional athletes to join in the disrespect our flag by taking a knee during our national anthem.
Unbelievably, this cop-hating group has now found an unlikely ally in their fight against cops, Cleveland, OH law enforcement officers.
How politically correct Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco quarterback, became the poster child for cop hate when he refused to stand for our national anthem prior to the start of the NFL games.
Kaepernick used his display of disrespect for our flag to show his disrespect for our law enforcement.
Kaepernick was not resigned by SF and did not receive another offer to play in the NFL.
He is now the center of a huge controversy, as the NAACP has joined forces with BLM to demand that an NFL owner pick up the lackluster and controversial QB.The Cleveland Brown players have been known to display their over-the-top hate for law enforcement before.

Several players are now taking a knee while the rest of the fans and players stand to honor our flag and our nation.The veterans in Cleveland are tired of watching the nation and flag they fought for being disrespected by these clowns who have never sacrificed a moment of their lives for our country.
