Donald Trump is NOT going to like this one bit.Saturday Night Live delivered a Christmas episode this week, and the cold-open was an instant classic because it featured the return of Alec Baldwin as Donald Trump.Baldwin s Trump openly complained about Kellyanne Conway trying to conduct a last bit of business before the holidays.
Trump asked if there were any more cabinet positions to be filled.
And when Conway informed him that Rick Perry had accepted the Energy Department position, Trump said that he picked him because he had so much energy on Dancing With The Stars.Conway then handed Trump a really short list of performers willing to appear at his inauguration, only to be pulled away by Melania as Conway told Trump she ll be handcuffed to you for all of history.
Trump and Melania turn away, and then Russian President and Trump s new best friend Vladimir Putin arrives shirtless with a red bag down the chimney.Putin heaps lavish praise upon Trump, referring to him as the best candidate, the smartest candidate, the Manchurian candidate.
Trump had no idea what the last one meant but liked it anyway.Putin was very happy to hear that Trump trusts Russia over the CIA, and gave him an Elf On The Shelf as a gift to keep on the mantle next to his Internet router.
An oblivious Trump accepts the gift.Melania tries to warn Trump about getting friendly with foreigners who say nice things about him, but he married Melania so it apparently doesn t dawn on Trump that he s an easy mark.John Goodman then appears as Trump s pick for Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, who performs a secret handshake with his good buddy Pooty and then proceeds to ignore Trump as he and Putin discuss oil production and lifting economic sanctions.As Putin and Tillerson discuss business without Trump, Trump continues trying to impress them by bragging about knowing Kanye West.Here s the video via YouTube.Once again, SNL nails Donald Trump.
And now we wait for his temper tantrum on Twitter.Featured Image: Screenshot
