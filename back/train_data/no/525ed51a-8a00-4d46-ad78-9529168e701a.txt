bill maher began his interview with the yawn-inducing democrat senator elizabeth warren and the best hope for a presidential candidate in 2020 , by hitting her with some bad news democrats are losing .
after she came out faking enthusiasm for the liberal california audience , warren who is best known for lying on a job application to harvard and the university of pennsylvania , where she checked the native american box , starts out telling maher , people all across this country are energized .
( is she talking about antifa and basement dwellers who are collecting a paycheck from various george soros groups for occasionally rolling out of bed , grabbing a face-mask and a baseball bat from their father s garage and going out to threaten the free-speech of trump supporters ?
) maher reminded her , they may be all energized but they don t have a democratic governor , a democratic senator or a democratic parliament .
the first 5 minutes of warren s yawn-inducing interview is filled with whining about how her progressive agenda is being ignored and how capitalism needs to be addressed and taken down.maher quickly reminds her that from 1980-2015 when many of the economy-killing regulations were implemented that many democrats were responsible for passing .
he asked her , don t the democrats bear some responsibility for that ?
at about the 6 minute mark , bill maher begins to whine about trump s tax plan and reminds pocahontas that trump s fans are not with her .
warren tells maher , actually , i m gon na push back , i disagree .
maher interrupts her , his fans are not with you .
they don t like you pocahontas .
