berlin ( reuters ) - german police seized large quantities of guns and ammunition in raids on four locations in berlin linked to a 40-year-old german man with suspected islamist ties , the berlin prosecutor s office said on wednesday .
the man , a german citizen with a turkish background , had previously been convicted of weapons violations , and frequented a mosque which was under surveillance by state security , said prosecutor spokeswoman silke becker .
germany was hit by several islamist militant attacks in 2016 , including one in berlin in december in which a tunisian man shot dead a polish lorry driver and then killed 11 more people by driving the stolen truck into a christmas market .
germany s domestic intelligence agency has warned of further attacks by radicalised muslims , given growing numbers of foreign fighters returning from war zones in syria and iraq .
[ l2n1mu194 ] becker said an investigation had been under way since summer , but the raids were triggered by concerns that the suspect could harm his family rather than any specific indication of a planned terrorist attack .
it became clear that the suspect could have an islamist background and islamist connection in the broadest sense , she said .
the suspect was due to go before a judge on wednesday .
