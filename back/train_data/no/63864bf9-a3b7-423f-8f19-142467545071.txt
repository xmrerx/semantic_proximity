baghdad ( reuters ) - the iraqi government has dismissed a call from u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson for iranian-backed paramilitary units that helped baghdad defeat islamic state to end operations in iraq .
speaking after a meeting on sunday with iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi and saudi arabia s king salman , tillerson said it was time for the iraqi popular mobilisation forces and their iranian advisers to go home .
washington , which backed baghdad against islamic state , is concerned iran will use its expanded presence in iraq and in syria to expand its influence in the region .
but abadi showed unwillingness to meet tillerson s demand .
no party has the right to interfere in iraqi matters , the statement from his office read .
it did not cite the prime minister himself but a source close to him .
trained and armed by iran , the iraqi popular mobilisation forces often supported iraqi government units in the fight against the militants who were effectively defeated in july when a u.s.-backed offensive captured their stronghold mosul .
they are paid by the iraqi government and officially report to the prime minister , but some arab sunni and kurdish politicians describe these militias as a de facto branch of the iranian revolutionary guards corp. iraq s sunni neighbors , including saudi arabia , share washington s concerns over shi ite power iran s influence in iraq , where the population is also predominantly shi ite .
but the office of abadi , himself a shi ite , said the forces were under the authority of the iraqi government .
popular mobilisation are iraqi patriots , it said in the statement .
the united states trained tens of thousands of iraqi soldiers in the course of rebuilding the iraqi armed forces and has over 5,000 troops deployed in the country , providing key air and ground support to the offensive on islamic state .
