Donald Trump is known for starting fights with people on his favorite social media platform, Twitter.
The Republican presidential primary frontrunner may have started a fight that might land him in jail.Trump s latest feud is with the Marlene Ricketts, one of the owners of the Chicago Cubs.
Ricketts donated $3 million dollars to a SuperPAC, that has the intent of taking down Donald Trump.
The SuperPAC called the Our Principles PAC is being run by Katie Packer.
Packer is a former advisor to Mitt Romney.
Here s the Tweet:Ricketts responded to the Tweet, saying: It s a little surreal when Donald Trump threatens your mom but you know, the fact is whether it s my mom or my dad on his spending stuff or my sister on marriage equality or my brothers on what they do or what we do with the team, we re pretty much an open book.
We stand up for what we believe in, we support the cause we think is important, and that s what America should be.
Robert Reich wrote about the matter on his Facebook page on Friday night.
That s where he said that one of his friends thinks that Trump violated the law when he put that Tweet out.
After noting Trump s statements that he would prosecute Hillary Clinton over her private email server, Reich writes: My friend Arthur Ferguson, a former federal prosecutor, thinks Trump s statement violates the federal law criminalizing extortionate threats.
18 USC Section 875(d) reads: Whoever, with intent to extort from any person anything of value transmits any communication containing any threat to injure the property or reputation [of anyone] shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than two years, or both.'
I m doubtful that anyone would actually consider prosecuting Trump over the matter, though Republicans are working double time to try and prevent a Trump presidential nomination.
They are all looking for a way to take down his campaign, and a criminal investigation might do just the trick.
