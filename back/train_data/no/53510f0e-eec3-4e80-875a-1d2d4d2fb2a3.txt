cairo ( reuters ) - egyptian presidential hopeful ahmed shafik apologized on saturday to supporters who were arrested this week and called on authorities to resolve the situation .
police arrested three members of shafik s egyptian national movement on wednesday and charged them with spreading false information harmful to national security , two security sources told reuters .
shafik , a former prime minister and ex-air force commander who is seen as the most serious potential challenger to president abdel fattah al-sisi in an election due early next year , apologized for the trouble caused to the detainees and their families .
i call on the relevant authorities to clarify the situation quickly , for it is dangerous , shafik said on his twitter account .
president sisi , a former military chief , is seen by many egyptians as the only person able to provide stability after years of turmoil that followed the 2011 uprising that ousted veteran leader hosni mubarak .
shafik recently returned from exile in the united arab emirates to where he fled in 2012 after a narrow electoral defeat to mohamed mursi of the muslim brotherhood .
mursi was removed from office in a military takeover led by sisi in 2013 .
two weeks ago , shafik said he was still deciding whether or not to run for the presidency in 2018 .
