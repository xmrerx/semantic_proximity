LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said negotiations with the European Union on leaving the bloc needed to be focused on the long-term future relationship between the two after a limited implementation period.
We should concentrate our negotiating time and capital on what really matters: the future long-term relationship we will have with the EU after this temporary period ends, May told parliament.
