beirut ( reuters ) - the syrian military has cleared islamic state from its last pocket of territory in central syria after months of fighting , a syrian military source said on friday .
the enclave east of the syrian city of homs had lain close to the main road running between the cities of homs and aleppo near the town of al-salamiya .
the armed forces completed military operations in the eastern homs countryside , eliminating the last groups of the terrorist islamic state in the area and liberating an area of 1,800 square kilometers , the military source said .
islamic state has lost swathes of syrian territory to separate campaigns being waged by syria s army , supported by russian forces and iran-backed militias , and by the u.s.-backed syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) , which is dominated by the kurdish ypg militia .
government forces and their allies are trying to oust islamic state from its remaining syrian positions in the eastern province of deir al-zor .
last month the syrian army s advance to deir al-zor city lifted a three-year-long siege imposed by islamic state on a government-held enclave there .
on friday syrian forces reached the edge of islamic state s current main base in syria , al-mayadin , which lies around 45 km ( 28 miles ) to the south of deir al-zor city .
