paris ( reuters ) - france s suez , the top water provider in spain , has temporarily moved the legal registration of its offices in catalonia to madrid because of legal uncertainty related to catalonia s independence movement .
suez sells water to municipal and industrial customers in spain where last year it generated 2.5 billion euros of its 15.3 billion euro total revenue .
we have temporarily moved the registered office of agbar , which is the ( suez ) holding company in catalonia , to madrid in order to protect the legal certainty of investors , because what we see now in catalonia is uncertainty , chief financial officer christophe cros said on an earnings call .
he said that in 2015 suez had already moved the legal address of the holding company owning all its activities in spain from barcelona to madrid .
this was not because of politics but because the company wanted to establish a stronger presence in madrid , as catalonia makes up only about 50 percent of suez revenue in spain .
cros said business in spain in general as well as in catalonia had been good in the first nine months of the year .
our business in catalonia is to deliver water to consumers and i don t expect any change in the need in water , he said .
in 2015 , when suez finalised its full takeover of aguas de barcelona ( agbar ) , former agbar minority shareholder criteria caixa became suez second-largest shareholder and now holds 5.74 percent of its shares .
suez spanish water unit agbar - whose roots go back to 1882 - has over 12,600 staff worldwide and generated 60 percent of its revenue in spain , the rest mainly in chile .
