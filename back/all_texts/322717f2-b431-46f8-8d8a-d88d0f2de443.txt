Hilarious conservative media analyst and Youtube sensation Mark Dice took to the streets of Los Angeles in 2013 while President Obama was still occupying our White House.
He asked random people walking down the street if they would sign a petition to support violent criminals to be released from our prisons and onto our streets.
It s interesting to see how many people accept that illegal aliens in our prisons are not being treated unfairly without any evidence.
This false narrative was successfully promoted by Barack Obama, our media and the Democrats, who decided that illegal aliens should be not just be given equal treatment to American citizens, but instead, they should be given special treatment above and beyond those afforded to American citizens.Watch the video and check out the new statistics below that were just released by Zogby, showing that Hispanics in America now support President Trump more than any other demographic.
Apparently supporting illegal aliens who commit crimes in America is no longer cool under a Trump administration:Most of the people who are seen signing this petition, are Hispanic.
But that s when we had a president who shamed Americans into believing that giving special privileges to illegal aliens was expected.
Today however, is a different story In its latest survey, Zogby Analytics said that Hispanic support has hit 45 percent, two points higher than the president s generic approval.That is 55 percent higher than the total Latino vote for Trump in the election.
He won just 29 percent.
The biggest surprise in this new poll is Trump s approval among Hispanic voters, which is at 45 percent approval/51 percent disapproval.
In February the numbers were less among Hispanics at 39 percent approval/53 percent disapproval, said Zogby.Via: Washington Examiner
