Donald Trump was nervous as hell over the hearing with FBI Director James Comey earlier today, and he had every reason to be.
It s now been confirmed that Trump is in fact being investigated by the FBI, however Americans shouldn t rejoice yet.
There are still more dangers facing America.Rep.
Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking member on the House Intelligence Committee, kicked the hearing off by stating that the meddling we saw from Russia in the 2016 election the interference that helped Trump win could haunt us.
According to the top Democrat, it s highly likely that this sort of thing could happen again, maybe as soon as 2018.
Schiff said: Only by understanding what the Russians did can we inoculate ourselves from the further Russian interference we know is coming.
It was a bombshell of a statement, and the warning became even more clear three hours later, when Comey himself agreed with Schiff during the hearing.
Comey said of Russia: They ll be back.
They ll be back in 2020, they may be back in 2018, and one of the lessons they may draw from this is that they were successful because they introduced chaos and division and discord and sowed doubt about the nature of this amazing country of ours and our democratic process.It is possible they re misreading that as it worked, and so we ll come back and hit them again in 2020.
I don t know.
But we have to assume they re coming back.
While Comey couldn t give any specific details about whether or not Trump has definitely been involved with Russia, the announcement of the investigation implies that there is evidence.
If Trump is found to be connected to Russia and its interference, he will have compromised the country and put America in a severe, unprecedented amount of danger.Featured image via Drew Angerer / Getty Images
