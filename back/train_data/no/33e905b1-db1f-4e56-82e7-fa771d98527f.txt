kathmandu ( reuters ) - former nepali prime minister k.p .
oli on sunday looked set for a return to power after winning his seat in parliament and his communist uml party and maoist allies on course to win a majority .
counting is still under way following an election on thursday that capped a near-decade long transition to democracy from monarchy and a civil war in which more than 17,000 people died .
oli , 65 , has vowed to form a government that lasts its full five-year term , something no prime minister has achieved since parliamentary democracy was established in 1990 .
his campaign has called for the extension of the chinese railway network into nepal and implement of hydroelectric , airport and other infrastructure projects to create jobs .
we can expect oli to lead a stable government with the maoists as strong allies , said bipin adhikari , a constitutional expert .
once there is political stability he can implement a development agenda and attract foreign investment .
instability has spooked investors , curbed growth , spurred corruption and slowed reconstruction after a 2015 earthquake that killed 9,000 people .
nepal is a natural buffer between china and india , with the ruling nepali congress party considered pro-india and the left alliance seen closer to china .
if oli leads the new government , he will be forced to be pragmatic in maintaining a geo-political balance with both , said kunda dixit , editor of the weekly nepali times .
final election results are expected to take about a week , election officials said .
home to mount everest , nepal is one of the world s poorest countries .
