beirut ( reuters ) - islamic state took control of some syrian villages in a rebel-controlled area east of hama on monday , opening a new frontline days after the syrian military said it had cleared islamic state from a nearby area .
islamic state said in a statement it had taken control of 12 villages and carried out a big attack on the jihadist alliance tahrir al-sham .
tahrir al-sham , spearheaded by al qaeda s former affiliate the nusra front , said in its own statement that islamic state had stormed several villages and accused the syrian army of allowing it to cross government territory .
a war monitor , the syrian observatory for human rights , said islamic state had taken 15 villages from tahrir al-sham , but that the jihadist alliance then took five of them back .
on friday the syrian army said it had cleared islamic state from its last pocket of territory in a nearby part of the countryside east of hama after months of fighting .
the observatory and tahrir al-sham said those same fighters were the ones that captured the villages , appearing to have crossed government-held territory .
the observatory said some of them had crossed with groups of civilians .
although islamic state and the groups that make up tahrir al-sham , including the nusra front , subscribe to hardline jihadist ideology , they have opposed each other for years .
islamic state has not held territory abutting areas held by jihadists or other rebel groups in northwest syria , the most populous area held by the insurgency , since last year .
it has since lost swathes of ground to the syrian army , backed by russia , iran and shi ite militias , and a rival campaign by kurdish and arab groups in the north supported by the united states .
