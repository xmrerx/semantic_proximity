Most Republican lawmakers have remained silent with regard to the armed right-wing terrorist takeover of a federal building in Oregon but not Tennessee state Rep. Andy Holt.Despite that this group of Yee-Hawdists made tear-filled goodbye videos in case they died in a shootout with the Army, occupied the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge (or, as ABC said with plenty of sugarcoating, engaged in an action after a peaceful protest), and revealed that they are willing to die for their cause, all in pursuit of a political purpose through intimidation (protecting two convicted arsonists who don t want their help from prison and permanent occupation of the land) the very definition of terrorism we don t even see 1/100 of the police presence surrounding the staging area as we do at any peaceful protest against police brutality.Holt tweeted and deleted what appears to be an offer to provide material assistance to Vanilla ISIS.Holt compared the armed militia, which has promised a prolonged occupation and has vowed to kill or be killed with arsons that occurred at the same times as protests in Ferguson or Baltimore: While Holt takes a strong stance at any arson that occurs in the vicinity of an area in which African-Americans are standing up for their rights, he is perfectly willing to tolerate and even encourage an armed mob of white seditionists attempting to establish an inbred nation-state by force.The Tenth Amendment, of course, does not authorize a mob of right-wing terrorists to occupy anything, by force or not nor does it give them permission to attempt to extort the federal government.
However, as one Democrat, Chattanooga City Councilman Chris Anderson, pointed out, Holt s offer to help the Bundy terrorists may constitute Treason.While Holt may think he understands the 10th Amendment, he doesn t quite grasp Article III of the Constitution, which states:Treason against the United States, shall consist only in levying war against them, or in adhering to their enemies, giving them aid and comfort.
No person shall be convicted of treason unless on the testimony of two witnesses to the same overt act, or on confession in open court.The Congress shall have power to declare the punishment of treason, but no attainder of treason shall work corruption of blood, or forfeiture except during the life of the person attainted.In fact, U.S.C.S 2383 covers insurrection quite nicely, as well:Whoever incites, sets on foot, assists, or engages in any rebellion or insurrection against the authority of the United States or the laws thereof, or gives aid or comfort thereto, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both; and shall be incapable of holding any office under the United States.Anderson has asked the Justice Department to investigate.
Holt, of course, dismissed Anderson s concerns with the tried-and-true Yeah, well you re gay response:He says that he deleted his treasonous offer so liberal loons will quit responding but whines that More liberal loons have responded since his offer to aid and abet terrorists began to circulate.
Get off Twitter & read the Constitution, kids, he said, ironically.Perhaps Anderson is right that Holt who offered to provide material assistance to a terrorist cell that has declared war on the federal government should be investigated for treason.Featured image via screengrab/YouTube
