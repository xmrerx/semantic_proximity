Donald Trump spent his week on Twitter blasting Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough, hosts of MSNBC s Morning Joe.
Rather than focus on something important, like the fact that his party is trying to kick millions of people off of their health care and leave them to die, he would rather spout off about the host of a cable news show bleeding badly from a facelift.
I heard poorly rated @Morning_Joe speaks badly of me (don t watch anymore).
Then how come low I.Q.
Crazy Mika, along with Psycho Joe, came.. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017 to Mar-a-Lago 3 nights in a row around New Year s Eve, and insisted on joining me.
She was bleeding badly from a face-lift.
I said no!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 29, 2017He continued his attack, tweeting about Morning Joe being low-rated fake news.
Refusing to let it drop, he attacked again on Saturday, writing that Scarborough is crazy and Brzezinski is as dumb as a rock.
Watched low rated @Morning_Joe for first time in long time.
FAKE NEWS.
He called me to stop a National Enquirer article.
I said no!
Bad show Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 30, 2017Crazy Joe Scarborough and dumb as a rock Mika are not bad people, but their low rated show is dominated by their NBC bosses.
Too bad!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 1, 2017But MSNBC producer Jesse Rodriguez decided to set the record straight and remind Trump that Morning Joes is currently experiencing record high ratings.
Apparently, our tweeter-in-chief missed the memo that the show had MSNBC s highest rating ever in the time period in the key demographic last quarter.Just a reminder about the @Morning_Joe ratings https://t.co/N6GTH99siw Jesse Rodriguez (@JesseRodriguez) July 1, 2017Thanks to our viewers: Morning Joe had MSNBC s highest rating ever in the time period in the key demographic last quarter.

Maybe instead of attacking women on Twitter because he thinks are mean to him on TV, he should focus on doing his job and maybe try to not embarrass himself, the office of the presidency, and our entire country on a daily basis.
