Obama s speech on Tuesday at the Grand Theater of Havana will mark a moment that seemed unimaginable only a few years ago, before Obama and Cuban President Raul Castro moved to restore relations between the two estranged countries.Obama s advisers said they hoped Cubans would be able to watch the speech live on television, adding that Obama sought not to dictate outcomes but create the space for Cuba to change on its own.
Ultimately he will make clear that that s for the Cuban people to decide, said Ben Rhodes, Obama s deputy national security adviser.
We have great confidence in the ability of the Cuban people to do extraordinary things.
