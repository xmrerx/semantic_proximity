For months, a debate has raged: Is 2016 hopeful Marco Rubio a robot, or isn t he?
Thursday s GOP debate might prove once and for all that we were wrong about Rubio.
It s unclear what happened maybe someone upgraded his operating system or maybe, just maybe, he is a flesh-and-blood person.
But whatever he is, the Florida Senator wiped the floor with The Donald in a must-see catfight.It s unclear what got into Rubio.
Maybe someone installed Windows 10.
Maybe he got a good night s rest for once.
Perhaps one of his supporters shared their crack pipe.
We ll never know.
In any case, Rubio was on fire during a surprisingly animated catfight with the billionaire bankruptcy expert (To be clear, he didn t blow a fuse; this was meant figuratively).During a discussion regarding Trump s promised Wall (with a capital W ) that will now be 10 feet taller thanks to a brilliant f*ck you from former President of Mexico, Vicente Fox, Rubio unleashed his inner something: If he builds his wall like he built Trump Tower, he will be using illegal immigrant labor to do it.
After the two rambled simultaneously for a while, Rubio s CPU (or adrenaline) kicked into overdrive, he dropped the hammer: Here s a guy who inherited 200 million dollars.
If he hadn t inherited $200 million, you know where he d be right now?
Selling watches in Midtown.
We won t spoil the rest of it for you.
