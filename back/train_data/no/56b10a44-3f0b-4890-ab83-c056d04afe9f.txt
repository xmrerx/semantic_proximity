kampala ( reuters ) - south sudanese rebel groups fought each other this week in a strategic area near the ugandan border leaving at least three dead , rebels said .
the clashes broke out on tuesday and wednesday in kajo keji between two groups : one loyal to former army general thomas cirillo and one loyal to former vice president riek machar .
kajo keji is a key conduit for rebels moving east and west and an entry point for supplies from uganda .
south sudan s civil war , triggered by a feud between president salva kiir and his former deputy machar , has plunged parts of the world s youngest nation into famine and forced a third of the population - about four million people - to flee their homes .
as the war burns on , battles are being fought on many fronts and armed groups have splintered and begun fighting each other .
the groups that clashed this week both oppose president salva kiir s government and had previously been stationed side by side in kajo keji .
but spla-io spokesman lam paul gabriel told reuters that national salvation front forces attacked on tuesday , killing two soldiers and capturing two others .
another spla-io member said they had to withdraw troops from a battle with government troops nearby in order to fight off the attackers .
an nsf commander on the ground , john kenyi loburon , said spla-io killed one of his men .
he said his group captured a few rebels .
spla-io is former vice president machar s rebel group , while nsf is loyal to the former general cirillo .
