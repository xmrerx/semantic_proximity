For months concerns have been expressed about the ability of the Democratic Party to duplicate the voter enthusiasm expressed for President Obama in his successful 2008 and 2012 campaigns.
Getting historic turnout among young and black voters was seen as the most difficult task facing whoever becomes the Democratic nominee, whether it is Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton.But now a new poll from Democracy Corps shows that the Democratic secret turnout weapon may be embedded in the Republican Party: Donald Trump.As this chart shows, interest in the 2016 presidential campaign has soared among each of the key Democratic constituent groups minorities, millennials, and single white women: What you see in this chart, says Democratic pollster Stanley Greenberg of Democracy Corps, is big engagement since last December among not only core Democratic groups, but also the swing electorate like college[-educated] women who usually split fairly evenly between the parties.
Greenberg goes on to tell Bloomberg that the jump in support from these core Democratic-leaning groups means we re getting closer and closer to an earthquake election.
As if that wasn t sad enough news for Republicans, the poll was conducted March 17-24, before Trump made his comments this week that women would have to be punished for having abortions if, as the Republican Party desires, abortion is outlawed in America.
The line has been slammed by both the Sanders and Clinton campaigns, who point out that women should not be sent to prison or worse for making their own choices about their personal health care.Republican Party insiders are in a full panic about Trump, as poll after poll shows him losing to the Democrats now by double digits.
States that have been considered safe Republican territory like Georgia could be in play due to Trump s historically high unpopularity across multiple demographics.
A recent poll showed Trump losing to Clinton even with white voters, which was thought to be his one area of strength, at least amongst men.An earthquake, indeed.Featured image via YouTube
