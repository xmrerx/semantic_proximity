This is truly epic!
Mark Levin goes after the Democrats on their hypocrisy in the firing of Comey and the Russia/Trump investigation .He specifically goes after Chuck Schumer:Notice how he says, the media and the Democrats, one and the same Haha!Levin lists all of the items that he feels warrant a special prosecutor including the Iran deal: How about an independent special prosecutor to investigate this whole seedy Iranian deal?
Levin goes on to speak highly of the Assistant Attorney General and how the Democrats are truly hypocritical because they voted overwhelmingly for his confirmation:Every single Democrat voted for his confirmation: 94-6 The new assistant Attorney General doesn t have a political bone in his body https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUyf945m8ho The President of the United States did what Barack Obama didn t have the nerve to do!
