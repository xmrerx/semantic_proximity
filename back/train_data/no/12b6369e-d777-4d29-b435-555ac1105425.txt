guatemala city ( reuters ) - guatemala s congress on friday repealed a controversial bill it had passed only two days earlier , which critics had blasted as a setback in the fight against political corruption .
prosecutors have accused president jimmy morales and the main political parties of illegal campaign financing , so opponents were outraged when congress on wednesday passed a national emergency decree to curb penalties for the offense .
the legislation sought to make party accountants responsible for irregularities rather than party leaders .
as public outcry mounted , morales said on thursday he was prepared to veto the legislation if it was against the nation s interest .
congress responded by announcing it would withdraw the bill .
a motion to repeal the bill passed on friday afternoon with 130 votes in favor and none against in guatemala s congress , with 28 absentees .
earlier this week , the legislation had been approved by lawmakers with a vote of 105-19 in favor .
guatemalan lawmakers and anti-graft proponents have been locking horns in recent months .
u.n.-backed anti-graft body , the international commission against impunity in guatemala ( cicig ) , and attorney general thelma aldana have accused morales and political parties of using illicit financing in the 2015 election campaign and sought to impeach the president over the charge .
however , congress voted not to strip morales of his immunity from prosecution earlier this month .
in august , morales attempted to expel the head of the cicig , veteran colombian prosecutor ivan velasquez , from guatemala .
instead the president was thwarted by the country s top court and came under a barrage of international criticism .
