The morning after getting pounded for several racial outbursts he made on Friday, Donald Trump retweeted an image of a black family with the caption American Families for Trump.
The problem is, the photo of the family is not from a pro-Trump event or gathering.
The picture is actually from a news story about a black family reunion in 2015.The photo fakery was pointed out by Mark Czerniec.The episode is part of a pattern with Trump, who often retweets images created by his supporters that more often than not are either conspiracy theories, complete fakes, racist or some combination of the three.
They reflect a lot of the values the presumptive Republican presidential nominee has mainstreamed in his short political career.Trump has expressed strong belief in the conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in the United States, that climate change is a hoax created by the Chinese, and in the idea that immigrants are mostly criminals and rapists.Pushing the photo of fake black supporters comes after a day in which Trump pointed to a black man at a campaign rally in California and referred to him as my African-American.
In the same rally, Trump tripled-down on his racist assertion that the judge overseeing his Trump University case cannot be fair or impartial because he has Mexican heritage and at the same time Trump is building a wall.
In response to his racial outburst, Hillary Clinton noted, It makes no sense to me.
The judge was born in Indiana.
Yes, he s of Mexican heritage.
Donald Trump is apparently of German heritage.
What does that mean?
We are all Americans.
The most senior Republican in the country, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, also condemned Trump s racist attack on the judge but Trump has been making the allegation for months already, and Ryan endorsed Trump for the presidency.Featured image via Flickr
