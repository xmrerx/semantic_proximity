WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said it has canceled President Donald Trumpâ€™s planned appearance at the Labor Department on Wednesday in light of the shooting of senior Republican leader Steve Scalise during baseball practice earlier in the day.
Trump was supposed to unveil his plan to expand the use of apprenticeships in the U.S. labor market during the event.
