santiago ( reuters ) - chilean president michelle bachelet welcomed more than 60 syrian refugees to the country s capital of santiago on thursday , as chile joined other latin american nations in offering safe harbor to families fleeing syria s civil war .
at a ceremony at the country s airport in santiago , bachelet greeted 14 newly arrived syrian families , who will be resettled in furnished homes with social benefits , including monthly stipends , schooling , healthcare and language classes .
we know you have struggled and what we hope is that , in our country , you will find a place to rebuild your lives , bachelet said .
more than 2 million people fleeing wars or persecution have joined the ranks of the world s refugees in 2017 , according to the united nations , even as the united states and countries in europe have begun to implement ever more restrictive asylum policies .
the humanitarian crisis has prompted several south american nations , including brazil , argentina , uruguay and colombia , to begin accepting small numbers of refugees from syria .
