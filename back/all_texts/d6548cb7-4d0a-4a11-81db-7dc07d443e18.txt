HAR ADAR, West Bank (Reuters) - A Palestinian man with security clearance to work at a Jewish settlement in the occupied West Bank opened fire at a checkpoint on Tuesday, killing two Israeli security guards and a paramilitary policeman.
The assailant, who was armed with a pistol and also seriously wounded a fourth Israeli, was shot dead, police said.
The incident was unusual in that the 37-year-old man had been issued an Israeli work permit - a process that entails security vetting - unlike most of the Palestinians involved in a wave of street attacks that began two years ago.
A police spokeswoman said the gunman approached Har Adar among a group of Palestinians who work at the settlement, and aroused the suspicion of guards at the entrance checkpoint.
Challenged to halt, the Palestinian opened his shirt, drew a pistol and fired at the security staff and troopers at close range, the spokeswoman said.
Residents of the settlement told Israeli media the man worked as a cleaner.
One of them, Moish Berdichev, said he had domestic problems - his wife had left him - and speculated he may have carried out the attack knowing he would not survive.
He was a guy with a good head on his shoulders.
It s a shame.
Very sad, Berdichev told Army Radio.
The Shin Bet internal security service identified the man as Nimr Jamal and said he had severe personal and family issues, including domestic violence .
The man lived in the nearby Palestinian village of Beit Suriq, the police said.
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in public remarks to his cabinet that the man s house would be demolished and any work permits issued to his relatives would be revoked.
