what a great idea !
sheriff joe arpaio is considering a run against unpopular senator jeff flake he s got lots of support from the people of arizona after serving as maricopa county sheriff for 24 years .
he d be a straight shooting senator , if elected .
he would also be on board with the trump train unlike jeff flake.we think it s a possibility that if he runs he d win !
he is 85-years old but sharp as a tack unlike some senators we know .
would you vote for sheriff joe ?
the bottom line is there s no way i m going to go fishing .
i have no hobbies sheriff joe arpaioafter receiving president trump s first pardon , joe arpaio s plans have gone from possible prison to book-writing , speeches and potentially another run for office in arizona , with sen. jeff flake s seat one opportunity he is eyeing.the former maricopa county sheriff told the washington examiner he s upset at negative reaction to the friday pardon , and that he feels republican politicians are insufficiently supportive of the president , who he calls a great man .
i could run for mayor , i could run for legislator , i could run for senate , arpaio said monday .
one particular race , however , is likely to gain significant attention : the gop primary next year facing flake , r-ariz. , a forceful trump critic .
i m sure getting a lot of people around the state asking me to challenge flake , said arpaio , who served 24 years as sheriff before losing reelection in 2016 .
all i m saying is the door is open and we ll see what happens .
i ve got support .
i know what support i have .
