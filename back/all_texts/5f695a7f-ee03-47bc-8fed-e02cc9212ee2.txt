When you re accused of being racist, as the Trump campaign is, because they are, it s probably best to show some people of color modeling your campaign gear.
However, when all you have is a stock photo of a white model to work with, there s apparently only one thing to do photoshop.On Twitter, Eric Ming, digital director for Donna Edwards, pointed out that Trump s campaign appeared to photoshop a model to be darker than she actually is:So it appears Donald Trump s campaign photoshopped their model to be brown: pic.twitter.com/V0DghCiQAW Eric Ming (@ericming5) March 3, 2016It looks as though since the Trump campaign likely has a difficult time finding people of color to support the candidate, they ve resorted to literally making them up.Here s the original model:Generic gray shirt from jcgapparel.comNow, here is that same model on Trump s campaign website on August 9th of last year already appearing a bit darker:via donaldjtrump.comClearly not satisfied with making her only slightly darker, the Trump campaign turned her into full Trump orange as only they can.
And needless to say, they didn t even do a very good job of it.
Here she is again on September 6th of last year:donaldjtrump.comThis is clearly the same model as can be seen by her collarbone, hair, etc.This is just more evidence that the Trump campaign is full of lies and deceit.
It begs the question, why?
Why bother doing this?
Did they think no one would notice?
Did they just not care?Of course, many who support him will just say that this is clearly making a mountain out of mole hill and it s not a big deal, but it kind of is.
Trump s campaign is literally based on hearsay and optics.
He wants people to believe in him without knowing what he s all about, and he s clearly done a great job of that.
However, that s also what makes him remarkably dangerous.Featured image: jcgstore.com/flickr/photoshop HT: Fusion
