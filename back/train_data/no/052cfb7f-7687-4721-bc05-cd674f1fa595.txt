america has never seen two people living in the white house play the victim card with such frequency and with such passion .
the truth of the matter is , barack obama and his race-obsessed wife will go down as two people who did less for the black community than any president in modern-day history.the data suggest that even as whites enjoy the benefits of improved public safety from the last two decades , blacks can not do so in anything like the same way .
in 2015 , there was an overall 13 percent uptick in the murder tally compared to 2014 , all of it concentrated in cities and neighborhoods where large numbers of black people live .
murder rose by more than 50 percent in washington , d.c. , and by 63 percent in baltimore , which alone account for about 15 percent of the national increase.black victims accounted for nearly two-thirds of the year-over-year increase , which translates to 944 additional black people murdered out of just under 1,500 additional victims nationwide .
more than half of this increase ( about 811 additional murders ) came just from among blacks aged 17 to 39.whatever the cause of last year s increase in murders , blacks were the only group represented so disproportionately within it .
the number of hispanic murder victims ticked up by 8 percent , about the same as the increase in white victims.these fbi data should alarm any person of good will who thinks that all black lives matter .
they reveal a true and massive problem .
the fact that most african-american murder victims were slain by other african-americans ( as most white victims are killed by other whites ) should not lessen the appeal within the black community of a strong law and order message from political candidates .
they would , after all , be the chief beneficiaries of strong law and order policies to precisely the same extent that they are currently the chief victims of rising violent crime.popthe data suggest that even as whites enjoy the benefits of improved public safety from the last two decades , blacks can not do so in anything like the same way .

in black spray paint are fading but still legible.these are the marcy houses , 27 brick h-block buildings , each six stories high , that are home to nearly 4,300 people , many of whom are black or latino .
the rapper jay-z , who grew up in the complex , described marcy as a block away from hell , the place where news cameras never come , in a song called where i m from .
in recent years , marcy has had a group of very reliable visitors : the police , who patrol on foot and in cars as part of a controversial broken windows strategy that focuses on cracking down on small crimes to prevent bigger ones .
until three weeks ago , they had been an ever-present , highly visible presence in marcy houses.now , the police have all but disappeared , raising safety concerns among some residents while pleasing others who view the police strategy as oppressive .
