The latest racial incident associated with the Donald Trump for President campaign occurred today at a campaign rally in Georgia.
According to news reports, the Trump campaign ordered the removal of a group of black students.
They weren t being disruptive or interrupting his rally.About 30 black students who were standing silently at the top of the bleachers at Donald Trump s rally here Monday night were escorted out by Secret Service agents who said the presidential candidate had requested their removal before he began speaking.The sight of the students, who were visibly upset, being led outside by law enforcement officials created a stir at a university that was a whites-only campus until 1963.
We didn t plan to do anything, said a tearful Tahjila Davis, a 19-year-old mass media major, who was among the Valdosta State University students who was removed.
They said, This is Trump s property; it s a private event.
But I paid my tuition to be here.
The removal of black students from the formerly segregated campus comes just a little over 24 hours after Trump was widely ridiculed for refusing to denounce or reject the endorsement of former klansman and white supremacist David Duke in an interview with CNN.One student, Tahjila Davis, a 19-year-old mass media major, told USA Today: I have not experienced any racism on this campus until now.
Trump s increasingly visible racial insensitivity is creating a major problem for the Republican Party, with some party bigwigs now publicly panicking that a Trump candidacy would mean electoral catastrophe in the fall election.Despite this, Trump received an endorsement from Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama), who allegedly once referred to a black attorney as boy and has a considerable history of racial slights and insensitivity.The incident is the second controversy in one day involving Trump s security team.
At another event, a man working security possibly for the Secret Service choke slammed a press photographer who was attempting to take pictures of protesters.Featured image via Flickr
