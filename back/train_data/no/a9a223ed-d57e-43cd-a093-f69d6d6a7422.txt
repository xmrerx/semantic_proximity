the extremely exhausted hillary and her extremely boring vp pick have written a book that is currently # 5,301 on the amazon books bestseller list .
it s really quite laughable that with only a little more than one month until the general election , hillary can be found desperately hawking a book nobody wants to read at a rally in a tiny community center gymnasium in orlando with only 300 people .
that would be funny in and of itself , but hillary s desperation to sell a horrible book to a tiny and lethargic crowd ( who are likely being paid to occupy seats ) is not even the best part of the story.it turns out , the book reviews written by amazon users are a must read !
they re hilarious , revealing , and for the most part , when they are describing crooked hillary to a tee these are some of the most clever and funniest reviews you will ever see for a political book !
enjoy a special thank you to gp and @ fessenden4 for making our day ! hillary in orlando hawking her deplorable book from the stage .
best part is the amazon reviews of it : https : //t.co/cdcue3aunm hysterical !
