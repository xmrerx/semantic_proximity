GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump has been steadily ripping the Republican Party apart at the seams due to the embarrassing travesty of a campaign he s been running.
This is especially true since the surfacing of a tape of Trump and former Access Hollywood host Billy Bush having what is quite possibly the most lewd, offensive conversation two men could have about women.
As if that weren t enough, nearly a dozen women have come forward claiming Trump did to them just what he bragged about being able to do on that tape.Trump s scandals are literally doing something that no one thought possible: Turning certain reliably red states into battleground states.
According to the polling organization RealClearPolitics, Trump s lack of acceptability could actually turn TEXAS, of all places, blue.
As of Sunday, Trump is within the margin of error just three points ahead of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.
The average of all of the available polling is a 4.8 point divide.
This is likely due to the fact that there are some things that are just not partisan open misogyny, narcissism, racism, xenophobia, and all of the other characteristics that make for huge deal-breakers on the basis of basic decency, regardless of political leanings.Other red states that could be within striking distance for Hillary include Arizona, Utah and Georgia.
This would be why Trump, who is simply unable to accept losing at anything, is now talking of a rigged election.
It s an effort to make his already angry, disillusioned supporters become even more aggrieved.
This makes for a dangerous situation, and therefore it is DEFINITELY a good thing if Hillary can not only win, but run up the score around the nation and completely annihilate Trump.Featured image via Justin Sullivan via Getty Images
