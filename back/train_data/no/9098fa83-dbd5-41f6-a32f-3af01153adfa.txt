our weekly documentary film , curated by our editorial team at 21wire .
editors note : at times , this film might sanitise the cia infamous operation in southeast asia , just short of glorifying it , but the detail and over view of this piece of history is extremely education especially when you consider how similar operations are doing the exact same operation in turkey , pakistan and yemen .
from its origins with the legendary flying tigers of wwii to the final days of the vietnam war , the covert program of air america is one of the most clandestine operations in cia history .
