BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s parliament speaker Nabih Berri said on Wednesday that the government still stands after the prime minister s shock resignation, according to sources who met with him.
Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri s resignation in a weekend broadcast from Saudi Arabia in this form will not change the government s capacities, the sources cited Berri as saying.
