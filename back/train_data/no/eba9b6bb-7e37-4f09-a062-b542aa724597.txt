amsterdam/paris ( reuters ) - hurricane irma has killed at least five people and left a trail of destruction on the part-french , part-dutch caribbean island of saint martin , government officials in france and the netherlands said on thursday .
packing winds of around 175 mph ( 290 kph ) , the storm lashed several small islands in the northeast caribbean , including st martin and st barthelemy , tearing down trees , flattening homes and causing widespread damage .
french prime minister edouard philippe on thursday said four bodies had been recovered on the french side of the island , revising down an earlier death toll .
the death toll is still uncertain because clearing operations are under way , philippe told a news conference at a crisis centre in paris .
about 50 people have been injured .
there is considerable damage , philippe said , adding that local authorities in saint martin said 95 percent of the houses there had been damaged , and 60 percent were uninhabitable .
there is no electricity , no drinkable water , gasoline is unavailable .
philippe said the government would on friday declare a state of emergency , facilitating insurance compensation .
government officials in the netherlands said the hurricane had caused enormous devastation on the dutch side of the island , killing one person and injuring several others .
the dutch navy , which has two ships stationed off the coast , tweeted images gathered by helicopter showing damaged houses , hotels and boats .
sint maarten , as it is known in dutch , is an independent nation within the kingdom of the netherlands with a population of around 40,000 people , about the same as on the french side of the island .
images of the dutch side s juliana airport showed the landing strips appeared intact , although the navy said the airport was unreachable for now .
