paris ( reuters ) - malian soldiers killed by a french military strike in northern mali in october were hostages of islamist militants , not deserters turned jihadists as french authorities say , mali s president said in a newspaper interview published on sunday .
malian and french officials have given contradicting accounts of the oct. 23 strike on a camp of the ansar dine militant group , which the french army said took 15 islamists out of action .
france s defense minister has said her services had factual information showing the fighters were all jihadists , including ex-malian soldiers enrolled by islamists , contradicting comments from the malian defense ministry .
but in a interview with jeune afrique magazine , malian president ibrahim boubakar keita insisted that was not the case : they were the terrorists hostages and there should be no ambiguity about that between our french friends and us , he said .
it s regrettable , it can unfortunately happen in this type of operations .
we should admit it and not look for reasons that don t exist .
the malian government is struggling to contain tuareg and islamist violence in northern mali , some of which is spreading south .
attempts to place officials in northern towns have sometimes failed , raising questions about the government s ability to maintain stability ahead of elections .
islamist militants seized northern mali in 2012 and french forces intervened a year later .
around 4,000 french troops remain in west africa s sahel region as part of operation barkhane .
france has also been at the forefront of organizing a regional force as part of efforts to find a long-term strategy to exit the region .
