istanbul ( reuters ) - president tayyip erdogan said there was no problem with turkey s planned purchase of russian s-400 surface-to-air missile systems and talks have also been held on the s-500 system , haberturk and other newspapers reported on friday .
his foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu was quoted on monday as saying nato member turkey could seek a deal to acquire a missile defense system with another country if russia does not agree to joint production of the defense shield .
speaking to reporters as he returned on his plane from a trip to ukraine and serbia , erdogan said there would be no joint production in the first stage of s-400 purchases , but in the second stage god willing we will take joint production steps , haberturk reported .
in our talks with ( russia president vladimir ) putin we are not thinking of stopping with the s-400s .
we have had talks on the s-500s too , he added , referring to a missile system currently under development .
ankara s decision to buy the s-400s has been seen in some western capitals as a snub to nato , given tensions with moscow over ukraine and syria , while the deal raised concern because the weapons can not be integrated into the alliance s defenses .
however , nato secretary-general jens stoltenberg said this week turkey was not seeking to antagonize the u.s.-led alliance by purchasing the system and is in talks with france and italy to buy similar weapons .
