washington/havana ( reuters ) - the united states has recovered an inert hellfire air-to-ground missile that had mistakenly ended up in cuba , u.s. and cuban officials said on saturday .
the laser-guided agm 114 hellfire mistakenly arrived in cuba in june 2014 and was retrieved on saturday by u.s. officials and representatives of lockheed martin corp , the missile ’ s owner , the cuban foreign ministry said in a statement .
“ we can say , without speaking to specifics , that the inert training missile has been returned with the cooperation of the cuban government , ” state department spokesman mark toner said in a statement .
lockheed martin spokesman bill phelps declined comment .
the missile had been sent to europe for a training exercise in 2014 but somehow ended up in cuba in an embarrassing loss of military technology , the wall street journal reported last month .
“ the department is restricted under federal law and regulations from commenting on specific defense trade licensing cases and compliance matters , so we can not provide further details , ” toner said .
but he said reestablished diplomatic relations between the two countries have helped the u.s. “ engage with the cuban government on issues of mutual interest. ” cuba said the missile arrived by mistake or mishandling on a commercial flight from paris and was not listed on the cargo manifest , and that it was discovered by customs inspectors .
“ once the u.s. government officially informed the cuban government that a training missile belonging to the company lockheed martin was mistakenly sent to our country and expressed its interest in recovering it , cuba communicated the decision to hand it over and started arrangements for its return , ” the cuban statement said , without revealing when the united states made the request .
a team of u.s. government and lockheed martin experts took the missile back to the united states on saturday , cuba said .
