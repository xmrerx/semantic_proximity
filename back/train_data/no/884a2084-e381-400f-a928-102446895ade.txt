baghdad ( reuters ) - the semi-autonomous kurdistan regional government ( krg ) in northern iraq welcomed on thursday a call by iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi for talks to resolve a crisis triggered by a kurdish referendum on independence last month .
abadi spoke on tuesday , saying he considered the sept. 25 referendum , in which kurds voted overwhelmingly for independence despite baghdad s opposition , a thing of the past .
the day before , the iraqi army retook the oil-producing kirkuk area from kurdish peshmerga forces on his orders .
it will not be possible to resolve the issues through military operations , the krg cabinet said in a statement after a meeting in the kurdistan region capital erbil .
( we have ) asked the international community to help both sides start a dialogue to solve the outstanding issues based on the iraqi constitution , the statement said .
abadi had asked that the krg cancel the outcome of the referendum as a precondition for negotiations to begin .
the statement made no mention of the referendum , for which baghdad retaliated with a series of punitive measures including the recapture of kirkuk , which lies just outside krg boundaries but had been in peshmerga hands since 2014 .
