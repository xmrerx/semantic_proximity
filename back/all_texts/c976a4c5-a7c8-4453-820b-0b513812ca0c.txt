Saturday Night Live is having an absolute blast mocking Donald Trump and that didn t change this week as the popular satire show took aim at his narcissism.WWE Superstar John Cena assumed the role of Trump from Alec Baldwin this week in a short video called Through Donald s Eyes which is a first-person view of how Trump sees himself and the world around him.What followed is the delusional fantasyland that Trump lives in.Trump wakes up in the morning greeted by his maid.
He turns on the television to watch Fox News singing his praises using buzz words like victory and landslide.
He opens the newspaper, which is called The Failing New York Times and the story on the front page is about a false and biased story.Trump crumples up the newspaper and tosses it aside.
He then gets up and goes to his office where he is greeted by ass-kissers, but not before admiring himself and his extra large hands in the mirror.Then his imagined reality starts to break after he hears a Hollywood actress criticize him on television.
His aides start telling him that everyone hates him and his hands start to shrink.
Their smallness is indicated by Trump s use of his cell phone.Kellyanne Conway appears with one of Trump s redneck fans who spews adulation for his new hero.
And then Mike Pence shows up and starts talking.
Conway then jumps in again.
Kellyanne will fix it, she says.
Mommy lives for you.
And then Trump drifts off to sleep and he dreams about dancing with himself because he s the only one he really cares about.Here s the video via YouTube.Once again, Saturday Night Live nailed Trump.
The question is, did Trump tune in?
And if so, when can we expect the temper tantrum on Twitter?Featured image via video screen capture
