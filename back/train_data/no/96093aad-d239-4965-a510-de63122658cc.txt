berlin ( reuters ) - the far-right alternative for germany ( afd ) wants access to data about the ethnic backgrounds and political views of journalists who want to cover the party s national congress in december after it became the third largest party in parliament .
journalists who register to cover the conference in hanover are being asked to check a box in which they agreed to the collection , storage and use of personal data provided , such as name , medium and press pass number , as well as special data .
the form references a section in germany s data protection law , which lists such special data as including racial and ethnic background , political views , religious or philosophical convictions , union membership , health or sexual orientation .
other parties require basic information for registration of journalists but do not ask for such personal details .
the party , which rails against what it calls the islamisation of europe and fake news coverage by mainstream news outlets , declined to comment to the stuttgarter zeitung newspaper , which first reported the issue on friday .
the berlin data protection official is investigating the issue , the newspaper reported .
this is an unacceptable intrusion into the private affairs of journalists , hendrik zoerner , spokesman for the german journalists association , was quoted as telling the paper .
we call on the afd to immediately remove the required agreement .
no comment was immediately available to reuters from the party , the berlin data protection official or the journalists group .
the afd won early 13 percent of vote on sept. 24 , making it the third largest party in the bundestag , or lower house of parliament , and the first far-right group to move into the legislature in more than half a century .
german civil rights groups are mobilizing to stage a large protest in hanover at the congress on dec. 2 .
