Donald Trump s most dangerous and offensive campaign promise was, of course, his call for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States.
We all saw that plan realized in late January, as Trump rolled out the ban via a chaotic Executive Order that the courts quickly struck down.
Well, it seems that Trump has not given up just yet, and plans to sign a brand new Muslim ban this coming Monday.In preparation, Trump s white supremacist Chief Strategist Steve Bannon will go down to Mar-A-Lago for the weekend, along with others from the Department of Justice, including Attorney General Jeff Sessions, to be with Trump.
The festivities at the posh resort will include an EO launch meeting.
This comes after Trump s team decided to let Trump s ego be stroked by the good press he was getting from his address to a joint session of Congress.
However, this didn t last, thanks to the controversy surrounding Jeff Sessions and his lying to Congress about his contacts with Russians.The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has already responded, and they are definitely ready to combat Trump s bigotry in the courts.
They tweeted:We're ready.
See you in court (again), @realDonaldTrump.

Real people are being hurt and even killed due to the fact that the most powerful man in the world is insisting upon mainstreaming hate.Keep it up, ACLU and other groups.
