on saturday , msnbc s joy reid repeatedly attempted to race-bait former republican congressman j.d .
hayworth on her show am joy .
newsbusters reported that the claims that reid threw at hayworth ranged from false to misleading .
joy started out by asking if hayworth had any discomfort that an undocumented woman walked into a courtroom to file a protection order against an abusive boyfriend ( no mention of his residency status ) and was met with ice agents who arrested her ( the job of an ice agent is to arrest people who illegally cross our borders ) .
an alternative version would be : a woman who has broken our laws , and living in our country illegally , was arrested after walking into a courthouse to ask for the same protections afforded to taxpaying us citizens , after it was discovered that she is also a lawbreaker.however it wasn t until hayworth exposed reid s liberal hypocrisy by bringing up the fact that elizabeth warren is not native-american that reid flipped out and kicked the gop guest off the show .
