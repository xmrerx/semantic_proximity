helsinki/moscow ( reuters ) - finland s defense ministry said on tuesday it suspected a russian aircraft had violated finnish airspace over the baltic sea earlier in the day .
the ministry said a tupolev tu-154 , a russian passenger and transport plane , had been detected south of porvoo and that the border guard was investigating the matter .
a ministry spokesman declined to say whether finland had scrambled jets to identify the plane .
the russian defense ministry was not immediately available to comment .
finland , which is preparing to celebrate 100 years of independence on wednesday , has accused moscow of several airspace violations since the ukraine crisis began in 2014 .
last year , estonia and finland blamed russia for entering their airspace as finland was signing a defense pact with the united states .
in a separate incident , two russian warplanes flew simulated attack passes near a u.s. guided missile destroyer in the baltic sea .
finland was part of the russian empire and won independence during the 1917 russian revolution , then nearly lost it fighting the soviet union in world war two .
it is now an eu member state which does not belong to nato military alliance .
