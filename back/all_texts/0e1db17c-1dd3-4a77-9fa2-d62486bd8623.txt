21st Century Wire says What this latest result proves is that the level of institutional criminality in Washington DC is so deeply entrenched that American Congressmen are not fit to govern not even in a progressive democracy, much less a constitutional republic.How can they claim to be the world s moral leader and global police when history demonstrates that over the last 40 years the United States has been the world s number one state sponsor of terrorism ?Once again this week, the US was caught helping ISIS by providing air cover for terrorist operations on the ground in Syria.Despite all of this, Donald Trump still remains clueless as to how it all works By Matt AgoristFor the last several decades, the US government has openly funded, supported, and armed various terrorist networks throughout the world to forward an agenda of destabilization and proxy war.
It is not a secret, nor a conspiracy theory, America arms bad guys.Given the insidious history of the American empire and its creation and fostering of terrorist regimes across the globe, it should come as no surprise that the overwhelming majority of politicians would refuse to sign on to a law that requires them to Stop Arming Terrorists.
And, that is exactly what s happened.H.R.608 Stop Arming Terrorists Act was introduced by Rep. Gabbard, Tulsi [D-HI] on January 23 of this year.
The bill doesn t have any crazy strings attached and its original cosponsors are a mix of Republicans and Democrats highlighting that it transcends party lines.
For years, our government has been providing both direct and indirect support to these armed militant groups, who are working directly with or under the command of terrorist groups like Al-Qaeda and ISIS, all in their effort and fight to overthrow the Syrian government, Gabbard said in an interview earlier this year.The text of the bill is simple.
It merely states that it prohibits the use of federal agency funds to provide covered assistance to: (1) Al Qaeda, Jabhat Fateh al-Sham, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), or any individual or group that is affiliated with, associated with, cooperating with, or adherents to such groups; or (2) the government of any country that the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) determines has, within the most recent 12 months, provided covered assistance to such a group or individual.The only thing this bill does is prohibit the US government from giving money and weapons to people who want to murder Americans and who do murder innocent men, women, and children across the globe.
It is quite possibly the simplest and most rational bill ever proposed by Congress.
Given its rational and humanitarian nature, one would think that representatives would be lining up to show their support.
However, one would be wrong.After nearly 5 months since its introduction, only 13 of the 535 members of Congress have signed on as co-sponsors.
What this lack of support for the bill shows is that the federal government is addicted to funding terror and has no intention of ever stopping it.To add insult to treason and murder, Senator Rand Paul [R-KY] introduced this same legislation in the Senate.
He currently has zero cosponsors.Given the overwhelming lack of support for a bill that simply asks the government to stop giving money to people who behead children and video it, it should come as no surprise that Donald Trump signed hundreds of billions of dollars in weapons deals with other countries who also fund these people.As Americans bicker over Trump s bogus and non-existent Russian scandal, he s signing a deal worth hundreds of billions of dollars with the largest state sponsor of terror in the world ensuring decades of future wars and the continuation of the cycle of terrorism.What s more is the fact that less than one week after publicly reprimanding Qatar for terrorism, President Trump signed off on the sale of $12 billion in weapons to the country he referred to as a funder of terrorism.
This move, in Trump s own stance, makes him a de facto funder of terrorism now READ MORE ISIS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire ISIS FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV
