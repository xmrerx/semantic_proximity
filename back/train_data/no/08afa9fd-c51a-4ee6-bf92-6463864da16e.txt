kabul ( reuters ) - a suicide bomber blew himself up at a checkpoint near the main cricket stadium in the afghan capital kabul on wednesday , killing at least three people as a tournament was under way , officials said .
interior ministry spokesman najib danesh said two police and one civilian were killed and five people wounded .
local tolo news television quoted the afghan cricket board as saying all players were safe .
the blast outside kabul international cricket stadium took place during a match in afghanistan s shpageeza cricket league , a t20 franchise tournament on the lines of the indian premier league and similar 20-over tournaments .
a statement in bosnian on islamic state s amaq news agency said a suicide attack had been carried out on members of the afghan security forces in kabul , although it was not immediately clear whether the statement referred to the same incident .
the shpageeza tournament , now in its fifth season , is one of a small number of western-style sports competitions along with afghan premier league football that have grown up since a u.s.-led campaign toppled the taliban in 2001 .
a small number of foreign players are also taking part in the competition .
cricket , which spread from refugee camps in pakistan , has become one of afghanistan s most popular sports and the national team has become increasingly successful , raising the profile of the game .
