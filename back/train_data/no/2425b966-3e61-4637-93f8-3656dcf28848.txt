stockholm ( reuters ) - an employee of canadian aircraft and train maker bombardier facing bribery charges in sweden is to be released immediately from custody , his lawyer said on wednesday .
a 37-year-old russian man was arrested in march on suspicion that he and several others at the company had bribed an azerbaijani official to secure a contract worth around $ 340 million .
the stockholm district court has ordered the man - who denied the allegations - to be released immediately , his lawyer said .
our interpretation is that he will be completely acquitted , or that he is guilty only of a minor part of the accusation and , if so , has already served his time , the employee s lawyer cristina bergner told reuters .
the district court could not immediately be reached for comment .
the prosecutor had demanded a sentence of five years in prison .
the trial has concluded and sentencing is set for oct. 11 .
in their march statement , swedish prosecutors alleged bombardier had won the tender in question after competitors that had offered better prices were disqualified by azerbaijan s rail authority .
the canadian firm said in august it took the allegations very seriously as they ran counter to its values and high standards , and it supported an investigation into the facts .
