WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday that he felt “somewhat” vindicated by Republican congressman Devin Nunes’ announcement that it was possible that some of Trump’s communications had been picked up by government surveillance.
“I somewhat do,” Trump said, when asked by a reporter whether he felt vindicated by Nunes’ statement.
Trump said on Twitter on March 4 that he was “wiretapped” by his predecessor, President Barack Obama, an accusation Obama denied through a spokesman.
