Late-night TV host Jimmy Kimmel opened his program Monday with a ten-minute political rant about Sunday s mass murder in Las Vegas, saying now is the time for political debate about gun control.Dismissing as inadequate calls for prayers for the victims by President Donald Trump, House Speaker Paul Ryan, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), the Jimmy Kimmel Live host said: they should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country.
Kimmel railed against lawmakers who won t do anything about this because the NRA has their balls in a money clip, insisting that their thoughts and your prayers are insufficient.
The comic responded to those saying there was nothing that could have been done to stop Sunday s attack.
I disagree with that intensely, Kimmel said, because of course there s something we can do about it.
