lima ( reuters ) - a congresswoman in peru said embattled president pedro pablo kuczynski survived a vote in congress to oust him by promising some opposition lawmakers that he would pardon the country s jailed former authoritarian leader , alberto fujimori .
cecilia chacon , a lawmaker with the opposition party popular force , said the 10 abstentions by a faction in her party had helped defeat its bid to oust kuczynski in the wake of a graft scandal , and that some of them had mentioned the promise .
that s what they told us , chacon said in broadcast comments .
earlier on thursday , kuczynski s government denied it was negotiating a possible pardon for fujimori in exchange for votes to save him .
kuczynski pulled off a surprise victory after the motion in congress to oust him fell eight votes short of the 87 needed to pass .
fujimori is serving a 25-year prison sentence for graft and human rights crimes during his 1990-2000 government .
