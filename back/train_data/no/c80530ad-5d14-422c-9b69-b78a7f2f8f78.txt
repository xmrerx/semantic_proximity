manila ( reuters ) - the philippines congress lower house agreed on wednesday to restore the commission on human rights annual budget , which had been slashed to just $ 20 after lawmakers allied to president rodrigo duterte accused it of only investigating government abuses .
the head of the house appropriations panel , karlo nograles , said the chr has promised lawmakers to expand its role by looking into rights violations by criminals and rebel groups .
the 294-member congress will still have to confirm the restoration of chr s 678 million pesos ( $ 13 million ) budget for 2018 in the third and final reading of the appropriations bill next week , nograles said in a statement .
nograles , a close ally and relative of duterte , said the decision to restore the budget and that of two other agencies was made after a frank but cordial meeting between house speaker pantaleon alvarez and chr head chito gascon .
the duterte government is not the enemy .
we are one with the chr in the fight against all forms of human rights violation but they must start looking also at the violations committed by criminals and insurgents , he added .
duterte has faced crticism from human rights groups for his war on drugs in which more than 3,800 people have been killed in police operations in the past 15 months .
police reject allegations that they are executing suspected users and dealers .
