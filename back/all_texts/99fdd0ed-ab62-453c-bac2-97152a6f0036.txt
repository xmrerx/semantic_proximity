Tickets to the fundraiser for Hillary hosted by a law firm who was banned from GITMO after being caught giving Muslim terror suspects anti-American propaganda are a mere $2,700 per person You can t make this stuff up!In 2007 Hillary Clinton voted YES on preserving habeas corpus for Guantanamo detainees.Sen.
Specter s amendment would have stricken the provision regarding habeas review.
The underlying bill would have authorized a trial by military commission for violations of the law of war.
Here is what Senator Lindsey Graham had to say about the bill from the Senate floor:Senator Graham asked, Do we really want enemy prisoners to bring every lawsuit known to man against the people fighting the war and protecting us?
No enemy prisoner should have access to Federal courts a noncitizen, enemy combatant terrorist to bring a lawsuit against those fighting on our behalf.
No judge should have the ability to make a decision that has been historically reserved to the military.
That does not make us safer.
Senator Arlon Spector on the vote: The US Constitution states that Habeas Corpus shall not be suspended, unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it.
We do not have either rebellion or invasion, so it is a little hard for me to see, as a basic principle of constitutional law, how the Congress can suspend the writ of habeas corpus.
Even with all the evidence that pointed to the danger this bill would our nation, Hillary voted Yes while the majority of the Sentate voted against her.Today, the attorney s who defended GITMO prisoners are rewarding Hillary for her vote with a major fundraiser.Watch:
