this is the same school district that is begging the state of michigan residents to fund a $ 500 million debt they can not pay back .
if the state doesn t come to some sort of agreement to bail out the devastated , democrat run city of detroit schools yet again , by the june 30th deadline , they will run out of money and the schools could be forced to shut down .
as usual with public schools run in poor cities run by democrats , it s the kids who suffer at the hands of these self-serving criminals after 38 years of working for detroit public schools , an assistant superintendent admitted in federal court today that she cheated kids with disabilities out of school supplies by helping a crooked vendor run a kickback scheme that could send her to prison for nearly six years.with her voice quivering , clara flowers , 61 , of detroit pleaded guilty to accepting $ 324,685 in kickbacks from a vendor as a thank-you for helping him bill dps for school supplies that were intended for children with disabilities but were never delivered.flowers , the assistant superintendent of detroit public schools office of specialized student services , offered no explanation or excuses for her actions .
when asked to explain what she did , flowers , in a shaky voice , said : i received kickbacks from norman shy .
flowers said the kickbacks from shy who has also been charged in the case came in the forms of checks , prepaid gift cards and home improvements on her private residence .
their scheme , she said , lasted from 2009 through 2015.under the terms of her plea agreement , flowers sentencing range is 57-71 months in prison .
she also was ordered to make $ 324,785 in restitution to dps , and another $ 27,488 in restitution to the internal revenue service for unpaid taxes .
