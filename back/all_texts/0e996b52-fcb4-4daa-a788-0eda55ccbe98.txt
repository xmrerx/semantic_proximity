Donald Trump s administration is already proving to be a complete and utter sh*tshow, but did you know his Twitter security is just as bad as his leadership?
The Intercept reports that Donald Trump s Twitter account that s the one used by the President of the United States was until today secured with a simple Gmail account.Hacker @WauchulaGhost, Trump s @POTUS account was set to a personal gmail apparently belonging to Dan Scavino as well as one that appears to be connected to Donald Trump s website:Hey @POTUS, On a serious note.
Lets fix your Security settings.
Should I email you?
#GhostOfNoNation @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/FRdMJnZaNr WauchulaGhost (@WauchulaGhost) January 21, 2017Ghost says that @POTUS, @FLOTUS, and @VP are all vulnerable to attacks because the administration that says it will make our country more secure hasn t bothered to set up the most basic security features on the accounts.
CNN spoke to the hacker, who shared some grim details about exactly how inept the current administration is:According to WauchulaGhost, @POTUS, @FLOTUS and @VP are more vulnerable because they haven t selected a basic security feature on Twitter that requires you to provide a phone number or email address to reset your password.
The current security setting for these three accounts allows anyone to click on forgot password and type in @FLOTUS, @POTUS or @VP.
The next screen says we found the following information associated with your account and gives a partially redacted email address to which it will send a password recovery link.WauchulaGhost says being able to fill in the missing letters and guess someone s email address is the first step hackers take when trying to breach an account.
It s not hard for us to go figure out that email, he told CNNTech in a Twitter direct message.
I ve taken over 500 Islamic State accounts.
WauchulaGhost says he found the likely email associated with Melania Trump s handle within twenty minutes.
He said the email associated with Vice President Mike Pence was easy to guess once you saw the redacted version: vi***************@gmail.com, which WauchulaGhost pieced together as [email protected] It has since been changed, but the president and first lady s email addresses remain the same.
(And the VP account still doesn t have the extra layer of security.
)After news broke that Trump had his account connected to gmail, someone on his end rapidly changed email addresses but still didn t change security features, which was kind of fun for Twitter:So I'm thinking it's dstrumppresident2017(@)gmail(.)

On top of that, members of his administration have already been busted using private RNC email accounts of their own, placing our nation at risk.
On top of that, Trump still uses his own unsecured Android phone to tweet from his personal account.How can we expect Donald Trump to run the country when he can t even manage his own Twitter account?featured image via Getty Images (Chip Somodevilla)/screengrab
