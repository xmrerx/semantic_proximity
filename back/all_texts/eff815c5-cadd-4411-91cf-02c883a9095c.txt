Maxine Waters said on MSNBC that there must be a probe into the unsubstantiated dossier that surfaced last month, alleging that Trump could be subject to blackmail from the Russians.
The coverage they have on him, sex actions that s absolutely true, referring to the dossier s detailed description of claims Trump met with Russian prostitutes.
They should really read it, understand it, analyze it, determine what s fact.
If we do the investigation, then we will find the connections.
And I do think that impeachment will be necessary, Rep. Maxine Waters claims on @MSNBC that the sex allegations about Trump in the Russian dossier are true.
