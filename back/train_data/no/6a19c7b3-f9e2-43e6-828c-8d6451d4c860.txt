seoul ( reuters ) - a north korean soldier who suffered critical gunshot wounds during a defection dash over the border to south korea this week stabilized on wednesday after a second round of surgery , a doctor treating him said .
the soldier , whose rank and identity have not been disclosed , was flown by helicopter to hospital on monday after his escape to south korea in a hail of bullets fired by north korean soldiers .
wednesday s surgery was successful in terms of staunching bleeding and the soldier had stabilized much , said lee cook-jong , the surgeon in charge of his treatment .
however , he remained unconscious and was not out of the woods , as complications from a severe hip fracture and possible infection remained major concerns , lee said .
we will be able to tell you after about 10 days , lee told reporters at a briefing , when asked about the soldier s chances of surviving .
on tuesday , government and military officials said the soldier was in critical condition but doctors expected him to live .
the soldier made his escape in a border peace village on the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two koreas .
at first , he sped toward the border in a four-wheel drive vehicle but was forced to abandon it and flee on foot when one of its wheels came loose , south korean officials said earlier .
he was hit by about seven bullets before he took cover behind a south korean structure in a joint security area ( jsa ) inside the demilitarized zone .
doctors removed five bullets from him earlier and one more on wednesday .
north korea has remained silent on the issue , while no unusual activity has been detected at the border where the soldier defected , the south s unification ministry said .
there will need to be some questioning on why he defected after his treatment is over , ministry spokesman baik tae-hyun told a regular briefing .
monday was the first time since 2007 a north korean soldier had defected across the jsa .
