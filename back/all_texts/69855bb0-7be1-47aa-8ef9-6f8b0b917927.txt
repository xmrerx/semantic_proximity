It s no secret that the Bundy militia s presence at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon is unpopular.
Even those who agree with the sentiments behind the right-wing armed occupation of the federal property feel that it s best for the wannabe cowboys to skedaddle.
Despite being offered a free pass out of the area, the ammosexual clan has made it very clear that they intend to stay for years even putting out calls for snacks, tampons, and clean underwear (mommy forgot to pack for them and isn t there to do their laundry) to help them on their mission to get even more free stuff.On Monday, Harney County residents put their differences aside and, whether or not they agree with the professed sentiments of the Bundy clan, rallied behind one thing: getting the armed madmen the f*ck out of there.
While many made some excellent points about the grown men playing Army, one 15-year-old-girl s emotional plea stole the stage.
I am 15 and I m a freshman in high school, Ashlie Presley said, barely able to get her words out through the tears.
Being here with all this honestly has scared me.
And it shouldn t. She continued, fighting through the sadness of what the Bundys and their buddies have done to her town: I should not have to be scared in my own hometown.
I know that all of my friends have been scared and have come to me to know what to do and I have to be the one to tell them that it s going to be OK, that everything s going to be OK.
I shouldn t have to be scared, and none of us in Harney County should have to be scared in our hometown, she concluded.While law enforcement refuses to take action and, for some reason, criminal prosecution seems unlikely, a local judge has vowed to bill Ammon Bundy up to $70,000 per day for security costs to the county so, at least it will become more expensive for Bundy s pretend army to continue its armed occupation of a bird sanctuary.Watch this teen beg Bundy and friends to stop terrorizing everyone below:Featured image via screengrab
