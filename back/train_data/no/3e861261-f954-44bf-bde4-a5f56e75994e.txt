louisville , ky. ( reuters ) - a former kentucky lawmaker received a seven-year prison sentence on thursday for bribing an inspector to overlook violations at his coal mining companies , his attorney said .
former state representative w. keith hall , 56 , who was convicted in federal court in june 2015 of paying $ 46,000 over a five-year period to former mining inspector kelly shortridge , was also fined $ 25,000 , said his attorney , brent caldwell .
prosecutors said at hall ’ s trial in lexington that most of the funds were funneled from hall ’ s companies to a shell company the two men created in the name of shortridge ’ s wife .
shortridge reached a plea agreement and testified against hall .
he is slated to start his 24-month sentence next week .
according to court documents , sentencing guidelines for hall called for more than eight years in prison .
his attorneys argued a sentence closer to the minimum 6-1/2 years was more appropriate .
caldwell said on thursday an appeal was still possible , adding his client disagreed with the verdict .
hall , a democrat , served 14 years in the kentucky general assembly before losing a primary election in may 2014 .
his indictment came five months later .
his companies listed in the indictment included beech creek coal co , llc & hei services llc .
