The FBI had just announced that it was clearing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton in the most recent email probe, and Donald Trump responded by having an epic meltdown in front of everyone at the Freedom Hill Amphitheater in Michigan on Sunday.In speaking to the crowd, the Republican nominee whined and moaned once again that the election is rigged and made it clear that he still thinks she s guilty as ever.
Trump shouted: Right now she s being protected by a rigged system.
It s a totally rigged system.
I ve been saying it for a long time.
You can t review 650,000 emails in eight days.
You can t do it folks.
Hillary Clinton is guilty.
Hillary Clinton is guilty, she knows it, the FBI knows it, the people know it and now it s up to the American people to deliver justice at the ballot box on 8 November.
You can watch Trump throw his temper tantrum below:Donald Trump responds to FBI letter: You can t review 650,000 new emails in 8 days.

Completely missing the irony in what he would say next, Trump warned: The investigations into her crimes will go on for a long, long time.
Trump was obviously projecting onto Clinton, because he currently has thousands of lawsuits against him, not including the high-profile sexual assault cases that have recently come to light after his lewd comments on an audio tape were uncovered, or the fact that he hasn t paid his taxes in decades.
If anyone should be worried about being guilty of wrongdoing, it s definitely Trump and it s something we should keep in mind on Election Day tomorrow.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images
