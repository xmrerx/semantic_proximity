One of the perks and duties of becoming the presidential nominee for one of the major parties is that you get access to daily intelligence briefings from the current administration.
Unfortunately, a candidate like Donald Trump has never come along, and spies are worried about what he ll do with the sensitive information he will receive.
My concern with Trump will be that he inadvertently leaks, because as he speaks extemporaneously, he ll pull something out of his hat that he heard in a briefing and say it, said a former senior U.S. intelligence official who has participated in the process of briefing presidential candidates.Unlike his presumed rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who would receive the same briefing if she s the Democratic Party nominee, Trump has never sat across the table from U.S. intelligence analysts and been given updates on the latest machinations of ISIS, or efforts by foreign governments to penetrate American computer networks.
He also has selected a team of largely unknown advisers who might have trouble helping him to contextualize what he might hear and know what questions to ask.Trump has already demonstrated a habit of regurgitating whatever information comes across his desk or from his team of sycophants.
So far he s accused the father of one of his rivals of being involved in the JFK assassination thanks to a sketchy tabloid story, as well as claiming that a member of ISIS threatened him, based on a YouTube parody.The presumptive Republican nominee has not shown that he is of sound enough mind to receive sensitive information about American intelligence, but the Obama administration will be having daily meetings with him and likely the Clinton team anyway, out of sense of tradition.It is up to President Obama to determine how much data can be given to the candidates, and it is doubtful Trump will be given more than the bare minimum necessary to meet the voluntary requirements.
Considering Hillary Clinton served as his Secretary of State and was even in the situation room as the Bin Laden raid occurred, it s doubtful there are any reservations about giving her the information.Featured image via Wikimedia
