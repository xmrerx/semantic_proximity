THE BOSTON GLOBE ran a Sunday edition with a fake cover slamming Donald Trump for his desire to secure our border with Mexico.
It was kind of a look at how supposedly horrible life would be with a president who actually puts Americans first.
Fake news is happening everywhere these days but it s a big deal when a major newspaper does it.
This is yet another example of how the media is so desperate to hurt Trump.The great thing is that there s the new media that responded almost immediately with a cover of Obama.
The different in this cover is that these horrible things are REALLY happening under Obama!
Way to go!
