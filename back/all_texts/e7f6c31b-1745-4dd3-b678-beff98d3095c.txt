By now, pretty much all of America can agree that Donald Trump needs to spend more time working and less time on the golf course and it s not just the Democrats who think this.
Apparently, there is now a big push from the Republican Party to get Trump to spend less time at Mar-a-Lago.Republican Joni Ernst confessed that the GOP is having a hard time defending all the time Trump is spending away from his responsibilities at the White House.
At an Iowa town hall, Ernst admitted that the GOP as a whole believes that Trump should drastically cut down on his costly getaways: I do wish he would spend more time in Washington, DC.
That s what we have the White House for, we would love to see more of those State Department visits in Washington, DC.
I think it s smart that he does business in Washington DC, so I ve had those same concerns myself.
Ernst then dropped this bombshell, signaling that many Republicans aren t happy with how Trump is performing: I have not spoken to him about the Florida issue yet, but that is something I think that has been bothering not just me, but some other members of our caucus.
So I think that is going to be a topic of discussion that we have when we get back to Washington.
Ernst has criticized Trump before, previously stating that he has a number of flaws.
While we can t expect that the GOP will lash out at Trump for taking far more golf trips than former President Barack Obama did, this is a step in the right direction.
It seems the GOP is trying to reel Trump in and actually get him to perform his presidential duties.
They probably won t succeed, but their attempts show that Trump s honeymoon period is coming to an end as he has nothing to show for his first 100 days in office.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images
