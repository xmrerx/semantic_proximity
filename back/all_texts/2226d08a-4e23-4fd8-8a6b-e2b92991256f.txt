(Reuters) - The Alabama Republican Party said on Thursday it supported embattled U.S. Senate candidate Roy Moore after allegations of sexual misconduct roiled the race.
“Judge Moore has vehemently denied the allegations made against him.
He deserves to be presumed innocent of the accusations unless proven otherwise,” it said in a statement.
“He will continue to take his case straight to the people of Alabama.”
