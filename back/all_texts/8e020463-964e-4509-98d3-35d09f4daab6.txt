SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea has been observed moving what appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) towards its west coast, South Korea s Asia Business Daily reported on Tuesday, citing an unidentified intelligence source.
The rocket started moving on Monday, a day after North Korea s sixth nuclear test, and was spotted moving at night to avoid surveillance, the report said.
North Korea has launch facilities for its missile program on its west coast.
South Korea s defense ministry said they were unable to confirm the contents of the report.
The ministry said in parliament on Monday that North Korea was considered ready to launch more missiles, including ICBMs, at any time.
