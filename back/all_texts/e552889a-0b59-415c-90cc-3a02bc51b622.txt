It s certainly no secret that Trump struggles with vocabulary words, and his spelling isn t that great, either (who can forget covfefe?).
He frequently assumes things he s completely unaware of are extremely simple, and is caught off guard when they re not.
So it stands to reason that as the investigation continues to unfold, and the legalese flies fast and furious, he might have some trouble understanding what s going on or, even worse, rage-tweeting about it.Not to worry!
George Takei is here to help, with a brilliant tweet that s as much solid advice as it is sick burn.
Here it is below:Donald: Since it's going to come up, it's spelled "subpoena" not "supeena" and "indictment" not "inditement.
"You're welcome.

Since it s going to come up, it s spelled subpoena not supeena and indictment not inditement.
Beautiful.
Considering all the time Trump spends on Twitter, and how poorly he deals with any form of criticism, you can bet he ll be fuming if he reads it.
Keep up the trolling, Takei!You might also enjoy Featured image via Mat Hayward/Getty Images for We Day
