Supporters of Senator Bernie Sanders can now cool down with a pint of ice cream after they feel the Bern.
Ben Cohen, cofounder of Ben & Jerry s ice cream, has created a special batch of the desert In order to show his support for Sanders presidential campaign: Bernie s Yearning.Ben Cohen, one of the co-founders of Ben & Jerry s ice cream, has for months talked about making a special flavor for his home-state senator.
Earlier this month, Cohen told MSNBC that he would call the ice cream Bernie s Yearning, featuring a milk chocolate disk covering the top of plain mint ice cream.
The disc is meant to represent the huge majority of economic gains that have gone to the top 1% since the end of the recession.
Beneath it, the rest of us, reads the description on the back of the pint posted on the website.On the site promoting the ice cream, Cohen points out that this is his personal creation, and the ice cream does not have the official backing of the company (which has been a subsidiary of the conglomerate Unilever since 2000).
Cohen writes, Jerry and I have been constituents of Bernie Sanders for the last 30 years.
We ve seen him in action and we believe in him.
When we re out speaking on his behalf people always ask if there s a Ben and Jerry s flavor.
There s not.
But if I were going to come up with one, this is what it would be.
Cohen made 40 pints of Bernie s Yearning in his own kitchen, and said he would be donating 25 of those to the campaign.
He has started a contest to donate the remaining 15 pints, numbered and signed by him.Cohen has been a long-time supporter of progressive causes, and has been a backer of presidential campaigns including Dennis Kucinich, Bernie Sanders, and Barack Obama.
He also supports a campaign attempting to push a constitutional amendment to overturn the Citizens United Supreme Court decision which has allowed a flood of corporate money in elections.Featured image via Bernie s Yearning
