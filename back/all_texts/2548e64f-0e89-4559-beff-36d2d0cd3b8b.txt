Here s the REAL reason Mitt Romney came out against Trump.
If you can t beat a candidate ON THE SAME TEAM fair and square, resort to plan B right?
Ironically, if the GOP establishment fought back against Obama as hard as they re fighting against Trump, he wouldn t likely be the front-runner right now.Former Speaker of the House John Boehner has endorsed current Speaker Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI) for president, in the event that no Republican candidate achieves a majority on the first ballot at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland in July.Politico reports that Boehner, speaking at a conference in Boca Raton, Florida, said: If we don t have a nominee who can win on the first ballot, I m for none of the above.
They all had a chance to win.
None of them won.
So I m for none of the above.
I m for Paul Ryan to be our nominee.
Late Tuesday evening, as results from primary contests confirmed Donald Trump s victories in four out of five states, CNBC reported that Ryan had not ruled out accepting such a nomination.EXCLUSIVE: Paul Ryan won't categorically rule out accepting GOP nominationif a deadlocked convention turns to him https://t.co/kuxSyWEDZg CNBC Now (@CNBCnow) March 16, 2016Ryan was welcomed by conservatives as Mitt Romney s choice for running mate in 2012.
The pro-life fiscal conservative had led the charge to reform entitlements, and used his policy prowess to point out the deep flaws in Obamacare during the intense debates of 2009-10.In the aftermath of that 2012 loss, Ryan turned his attention to the task of governing rather than opposing, convinced that Republicans shared responsibility with Democrats and the president.
As a result, he showed an openness to compromise on immigration and on budget issues that resulted in the erosion of some conservative support.
