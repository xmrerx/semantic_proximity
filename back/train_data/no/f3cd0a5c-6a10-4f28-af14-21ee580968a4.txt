( reuters ) - jetblue airways corp is offering $ 99 direct flights from every florida city where it operates , the airline said on wednesday , as people hurry to leave before powerful hurricane irma hits the state .
a price cap through sept. 10 is also in place for all of jetblue s florida connecting flights , a maximum fare of $ 159 up to the last available seat , the company said .
we want those trying to leave ahead of the hurricane to focus on their safe evacuation rather than worry about the cost of flights , jetblue spokesman doug mcgraw said .
flights in the eastern caribbean through sept. 7 and in the western caribbean through sept. 8 are also under a fare ceiling .
florida remained under a state of emergency as irma , packing winds of up to 185 miles per hour ( 295 km per hour ) , tracked across the northern caribbean on a path expected to hit landfall in the united states over the weekend .
airlines have been criticized for raising prices in the wake of deadly episodes such as a 2015 amtrak derailment , but u.s. officials said last year they found no evidence of wrongdoing in that instance .
irma s arrival marks the second time in as many weeks u.s. airline operations will be disrupted by a powerful storm .
last week , category 4 hurricane harvey landed in texas and swallowed up much of houston with powerful winds and deadly flooding .
airline operations were crippled for several days as airports closed , forcing thousands of flight cancellations .
