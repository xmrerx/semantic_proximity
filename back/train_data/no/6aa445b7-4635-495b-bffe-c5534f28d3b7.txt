this happened in 2015 but is still relevant today : a group of protesters decided to go digging to destroy a confederate general s grave .
no kidding !
does anyone out there think this will do anything productive ?
it s horrible to desecrate someone s grave so these people are doing what they preach against this is hateful !
let it be ! the campaigners claim it has taken officials in memphis , tennessee , too long to exhume nathan bedford forrest who was a lieutenant general in the confederate states army .
they also want the statue of the soldier on a horse on the burial site to be removed .
the rebel cavalryman , who died in 1877 , has been buried in the city s health sciences park since 1904.the city s mayor , ac wharton , began a push to remove the body and statue in the wake of the church shooting in charleston , south carolina , but needs approval from several branches of government before he can take action .
members of the protest group , who call themselves the commission on religion and racism , removed only a small patch of grass from the park , but threatened to return with heavy machinery to tear down the wartime symbol .
isaac richmond , the group s leader , told local station wreg : if he s gone , some of this racism and race-hate might be gone .
we got a fresh shovel full , and we hope that everybody else will follow suit and dig him up .
we are going to bring the back hoe , the tractors and the men with the equipment to raise bedford forrest from the soil of memphis .
