The way Trump is packing in thousands of supporters at every rally in every state he visits, it s pretty clear his popularity way overshadows that of #CrookedHillary.
She s barely getting enough people to fill a phone booth at her rallies!
This event, at the Baptist National Convention in Kansas City turned out to be downright embarrassing for Hillary and her campaign.
In a venue meant to hold 5,000 people, Hillary only drew about 1,000.
Perhaps there just isn t a huge amount of interest with Baptist church members in Kansas City when it comes to spending time listening to a sociological liar Workers cutting the room down by a third with lower than expected turnout for #clintonkc speech.

Who needs polls that are rigged by leftist media or polling firms with an agenda.
From now on, we re going to continue to use the number of supporters who actually take time out of their busy day to see the candidates as a true indicator of who s leading in the race Front of press constituted 10 rows.
14 seats per section, 6 sections.
Less than 1,000 of the >5k setup https://t.co/C6BcyCIl9F Brian Abel (@BrianAbelTV) September 8, 2016h/t Gateway Pundit
