berlin ( reuters ) - german parliamentary legal experts , reacting to calls by some polish politicians , have ruled that warsaw has no right to demand berlin pay reparations for world war two , according to a document obtained by a german newspaper .
the experts found any claims related to german crimes had become unfeasible at latest in 1990 when a treaty was signed by east and west germany , france , the soviet union , the united kingdom , and the united states ahead of german reunification , according to frankfurter allgemeine zeitung ( faz ) .
the experts , who provide independent advice to the german parliament , said eu partner poland had , during the treaty negotiations , at least implicitly waived their right to assert them , faz cited the report as saying .
they said it was agreed back then that this treaty blocks any reparation demands against germany to the present day , faz reported .
in recent weeks , polish politicians and officials have stepped up calls for compensation , but the government has yet to officially demand any reparations .
johannes singhammer , the vice-president of the bundestag lower house and a member of the christian social union ( csu ) - the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel s christian democrats ( cdu ) , had commissioned the report .
he told faz : the polish demand for reparations , which does not stand a chance from a legal point of view , is contrary to the joint future project between germany and poland and could instead have dangerous effects .
on thursday , polish prime minister beata szydlo said that by seeking reparations , poland would be asking for justice .
we are the victims of world war two , the damages have not been repaid in any way , quite to the contrary , szydlo said .
several polish government sources told reuters that it is unlikely poland will officially ask for repayments , but it also could not be completely ruled out .
