BEIJING (Reuters) - China s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that China s position on the deployment in South Korea of the U.S. Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) anti-missile system is consistent and has not changed.
China has repeatedly opposed the deployment, but earlier on Tuesday Beijing and Seoul agreed to work swiftly to get relations back on track following a year-long standoff over THAAD.
