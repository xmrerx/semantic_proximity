While discussing Donald Trump on ABC s The View, the ladies all had very strong opinions about Donald Trump, and to be honest, none of them are good, and with good reason.They discussed his blatant racism to the tragedy that unfolded at Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida.
They also discussed Trump s horrific rhetoric surrounding the event, and how he wrongfully went after President Obama.Joy Behar then interjects with a question that should make everyone think long and hard about Trump s use of language: Do you think that because he is the recruiter-in-chief, and by his words he s getting more people to go on the side of ISIS, that he could be considered treasonous?
It was then that an audible gasp can be heard from the crowd, either from those in agreement, or those stunned that she would say such a thing.
But here s the thing she s not wrong.Trump s vile rhetoric is being used in recruitment videos by ISIS, so not only is he not cut out to be Commander-in-Chief, but his remarks are actually being used in an upsurge in violence against the very nation he wishes to lead.Treason, by definition, is the crime of betraying one s country, and by aiding ISIS with his language, he could be considered doing just that.So, Joy, very good question.Watch the ladies of The View go after Trump here:Our co-hosts react to Donald Trump s proposed immigration ban post Orlando shooting: https://t.co/WmNRJ4e4ZY The View (@TheView) June 14, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
