Find out how many are going to sign up to go to war when we keep doing this to those who protect us.
Montel WilliamsMontel Williams got emotions during his appearance on Greta Van Susteren s On The Record, when discussing U.S. Marine veteran, Amir Hekmati who has been held in an Iranian prison for more than three years.Amir Hekmati, 31, has been jailed in the most dangerous Iranian prison for more than 1,300 days.
The Iranian-American was born in Arizona but held dual citizenship when he flew to Iran to visit his dying grandmother.Hekmati was arrested and charged with spying for the United States government.
He was sentenced to death, but that sentence was reversed.
Hekmati was then convicted of a lesser charge and sentenced to 10 years in prison.Williams told Greta Van Susteren that the jailed Marine has been whipped and even made addicted to drugs just so that he could be tortured with withdrawal.Hekmati recently renounced his Iranian citizenship in an effort to be freed.
It has become very clear to me that those responsible view Iranian-Americans not as citizens or even human beings, but as bargaining chips and tools for propaganda, Hekmati said.
Considering how little value the Ministry of Intelligence places on my Iranian citizenship and passport, I, too, place little value on them and inform you, effective immediately, that I formally renounce my Iranian citizenship and passport.
Williams said that it s an abomination that Americans don t know that a U.S. Marine who served in Iraq is now imprisoned in Iran.
The State Department has not been speaking to Hekmati s family, Williams said.Williams had a request tonight for Fox News viewers.
Please, hashtag #FreeAmirNow, start blasting this tonight so that by tomorrow morning when these [Iran nuclear weapon] discussions get ready to come to an end, we don t leave another Marine behind, Williams said.Via: FOX News
