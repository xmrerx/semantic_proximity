THE CLIMATE CHANGE BS STARTS AROUND THE 16:00 MARK- GLOBALLY WE COULD SEE A RISE IN *CLIMATE CHANGE REFUGEES *Take note that Obama could add thousands and thousands more refugees to America if he s able to say that climate change is a reason for refugee status.Please, please listen to the entire part of this speech about global warming from the 16:00 mark on.
Obama s telling you we ll need to sacrifice and it s gonna be really hard.
Huh??
?He must be kidding!
Obama is REALLY pushing the climate change scam but what he did yesterday is beyond the pale.
He had a chance to be positive when speaking to Coast Guard grads but he blew it in a bizarre speech about climate change.
I am here today to say that climate change constitutes a serious threat to global security, an immediate risk to our national security, and, make no mistake, it will impact how our military defends our country, Climate change, especially rising seas, is a threat to our homeland security our economy, infrastructure, and the safety and health of the American people, Push back on this in any way you can!
Make noise somehow-social media is the quickest and best way to hammer these politicians.
The agenda of climate change is trying to pull us in the global redistribution direction.
We should not participate in this scam.
