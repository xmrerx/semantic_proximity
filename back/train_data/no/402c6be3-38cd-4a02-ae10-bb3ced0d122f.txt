copenhagen ( reuters ) - denmark s immigration minister on tuesday posted a screenshot of her ipad showing a drawing of the prophet mohammad on facebook , one of the satirical cartoons that caused outrage among muslims around the world more than a decade ago .
the facebook post comes as a reaction to a decision by the skovgaard museum in viborg , denmark , not to include the drawing in a new exhibition about blasphemy since the reformation .
it is the museum s own choice and they have their full right to do it , but i think it s a shame , said inger stojberg , minister for immigration and integration , in her facebook post .
the facebook post is accompanied by a screen shot of the minister s ipad background screen , which shows a cartoon of a bearded man with a bomb in his turban .
stojberg said in the post she uses the cartoon as her background screen because it reminds her that denmark is a country with freedom of speech , which includes the right to criticize religions .
honestly , i think we should be proud of the mohammad cartoons , stojberg said .
three danish embassies were attacked and at least 50 people were killed in rioting in 2006 in the middle east , africa and asia , after drawings of the prophet mohammed , images many muslims consider blasphemous , were published in the danish newspaper jyllands-posten .
the picture posted on monday by the minister was one of those cartoons .
