WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday the intelligence review ordered by President Barack Obama on cyber attacks involving U.S. elections will go beyond the Nov. 8 vote and will include the 2008 election.
“What the president asked for is a review to look at malicious cyber activity tied to our presidential election cycle,” White House spokesman Eric Schultz said at a news briefing.
“It will be broader than just looking at this past election.”
