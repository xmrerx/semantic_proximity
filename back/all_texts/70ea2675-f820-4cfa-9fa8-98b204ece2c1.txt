If there s one thing the Donald Trump is good at, it s lying.
However, here s the thing, he ll always get caught one way or another.Now, his lying is rubbing off on his vice presidential running mate Indiana Governor Mike Pence.
Lies so ridiculous and obvious, though, that it only took Huffington Post less than 12 hours to put together a video that is so damning it has the possibility of being the last straw for any voters still on the fence.The video literally does a point by point takedown of many, many lies that had been uttered throughout the vice presidential debate and pairs them with the truth of what the two men, Trump and Pence, have actually said.It really doesn t get more obvious than this clear depiction of the deception and constant lying to the American public that the Trump campaign has perpetuated since the very beginning.A Trump/Pence ticket isn t only bad for the United States, but for the entire world.
They are lying liars and it absolutely needs to be exposed.Watch the epic takedown here:Donald Trump has said a lot of things.
Mike Pence said he didn t say those things.
He did.
