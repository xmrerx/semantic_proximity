Donald Trump has been attacking President Obama for campaigning in support of Hillary Clinton, and he got his ass handed to him for it on Twitter.The Republican nominee attacked Obama on his Twitter account on Thursday by complaining about the use of Air Force One and said President Obama should be creating jobs and fixing Obamacare instead of campaigning for the Democratic nominee.Looking at Air Force One @ MIA.
Why is he campaigning instead of creating jobs & fixing Obamacare?
Get back to work for the American people!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 3, 2016But sitting presidents have been campaigning for their party s nominee and potential successor for decades, and seeing as how flying commercial is not practical, traveling on Air Force One is the best way for President Obama to campaign and do his job at the same time since the office goes where he goes, even on vacation.Trump and his deplorable supporters have also been claiming that taxpayers are paying the cost of President Obama using Air Force One to campaign for Hillary, but that s not true.
As it turns out, the Hillary Clinton campaign pays the cost of these trips.So Trump s complaints about President Obama are nothing more than petty swipes designed to rile up his supporters who already hate Obama, which is why Twitter users hilariously mocked the Republican nominee in response to his post.
@realDonaldTrump You mean the American people who ve made him an incredibly popular President with a high approval rating?

Presidents pay for their (and their families ) lodging, food and incidentals while on vacation.
