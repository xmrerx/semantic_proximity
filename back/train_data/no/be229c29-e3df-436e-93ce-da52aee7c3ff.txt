vic/cerdanyola del valles , spain ( reuters ) - catalonia votes on thursday for a new administration in an election many hope will resolve spain s worst crisis in decades after the region declared independence leading madrid to sack local leaders .
polls suggest neither the pro-independence nor the pro-unity camp will win a majority .
the likely outcome is a hung parliament and many weeks of wrangling to form a new regional government .
in the separatist heartland of rural catalonia , fireman josep sales says he hopes the results will endorse the result of an oct. 1 illegal referendum on independence from spain and lead to the creation of a republic .
if we get a majority , something will have to be done .
and if the politicians don t do it , the people will unite , he said , speaking from the town fire station where many of the red fire engines bear the slogan hello democracy .
if we have to bring the country to a standstill , so be it , said the 45-year-old , who plans to vote for carles puigdemont , the sacked catalan head who is campaigning for election from self-imposed exile in belgium .
the uncertainty generated by the independence drive has hurt hotel occupancy rates in the region , dented consumer sales and caused more than 3,000 businesses to move their registered headquarters from catalonia .
it has also bitterly divided catalan society between those who support independence and those who favor unity with spain .
everyone is eager for the election and to see how it turns out , because nothing is clear at the moment , said 34-year-old flamenco teacher maria gonzalez , who lives in cerdanyola del valles , an industrial suburb of barcelona .
the feeling on the streets is not comfortable , says gonzalez , the daughter of migrants from other parts of spain who moved to catalonia decades ago and who plans to vote for pro-unity party ciudadanos ( citizens ) .
there s a hidden tension .
