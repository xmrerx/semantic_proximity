John Lester: As a Naval flight officer I held the top secret sensitive compartmentalized information clearance.
And that provided me access with materials and information highly sensitive to our war fighting capabilities.
Had I communicated this information not following the prescribed protocols I would have been prosecuted and imprisoned.
Secretary Clinton, how can you expect those such as myself who are and were trusted with America s most sensitive information to have any confidence in your leadership as president when you clearly corrupted our national security.
