paris ( reuters ) - french police unearthed a second stash of explosive materials near paris on thursday after a similar find in a nearby suburb on wednesday , a justice official said as three suspects were questioned by anti-terrorism investigators .
thursday s swoop was carried out at a garage rented by one of the three detained in the wake of wednesday s raid on an apartment in villejuif , on the southern edge of the french capital , the source said .
materials used to produce tatp , an explosive often used by suicide bombers , were found at the flat after a plumber phoned police to report suspect activity there , interior minister gerard collomb said .
two people in their 30s and 40s were arrested in the immediate wake of wednesday s raid , said collomb , who added that the suspects were being questioned on suspicion of terrorist activity despite talking of a bank heist .
a third man was arrested overnight , a source said .
those under investigation spoke of wanting to blow up a bank with the tatp but they way we see it is they have links with terrorism , and this is the channel of investigation , collomb told public radio station franceinfo .
that line of inquiry was prompted by information found in telephone communications after the raid , he added .
the minister spoke before developments later in the day in which police found explosive materials at a garage in thiais , southeast of paris .
more than 230 people have been killed by islamist-inspired attackers in the past three years in france , which along with the united states and other countries are bombing islamic state bases in iraq and syria .
tatp , an unstable explosive , has been used by militants in several attacks in western europe in recent years , including manchester in may , brussels in 2016 and paris in 2015 .
