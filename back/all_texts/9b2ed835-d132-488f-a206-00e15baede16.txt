We have always adhered to the highest standards of transparency and legality LOL!
Sounds like he may be living in an alt-left world Andrew Breitbart would be so proud of James O Keefe if he were alive today.
We are in a serious #war with the Left and O Keefe is on the front lines.Robert Creamer, a central subject of two recent James O Keefe expos s broken this Monday and Tuesday, has resigned from his responsibilities working with the campaign.
James O Keefe s Project Veritas has today published a statement of resignation from Robert Creamer:Creamer denies any wrongdoing in his letter of resignation, instead insisting that the notorious right wing blogger O Keefe is mistaken:Democracy Partners regards our nation s election laws and the integrity of our democratic institutions with utmost seriousness.
And we have only ever-engaged in legal and nonviolent methods to demonstrate how Donald Trump is unfit to be President.
Period.Towards the end of his resignation, Creamer blames O Keefe s dirty tricks and claims that O Keefe uses methods that would make Richard Nixon and the Watergate burglars proud :O Keefe executed a plot that involved the use of trained operatives using false identifications, disguises and elaborate false covers to infiltrate our firm and other consulting firms, in order to steal campaign plans, and goad unsuspecting individuals into making careless statements on hidden cameras.Creamer s organization Democracy Partners repeats this analysis of the situation in a post on Facebook, going on to claim that the alt-right takeover of the Republican Party has poisoned our country.
Here s the video:Breitbart News detailed the connection in an article about the original video released exclusively by Breitbart this Monday:In one hidden camera video, filmed at Creamer s Washington, D.C. office, Creamer explains that Hillary Clinton is aware of all of his activities, directly or indirectly, and that Democracy Partners has a daily conference call with the Clinton campaign, as well as frequent calls with the White House.Creamer has been a political organizer and strategist for over four decades, according to his organization s bio, and began his organizing career in 1970 working with Chicago s Citizen Action Program (CAP), which had been organized by Saul Alinsky s Industrial Areas Foundation.
Creamer has written for the Huffington Post, and his columns were regularly sent to a Google Group associated with John Podesta during the Obama administration.Creamer is married to congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, and has previously served time in prison for check-kiting.Via: Breitbart
