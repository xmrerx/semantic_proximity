We all remember the absolutely disastrous visit Donald Trump had with German Chancellor Angela Merkel.
He infamously made her look at him like he had lost his mind when joked about her allegedly being wiretapped by the Obama Administration while he was busy trying to defend his own false claims that Obama wiretapped Trump Tower, refused to shake Merkel s hand during a photo op, and even tried to give her a bill for NATO worth billions of dollars.Trump, however, seems to have a very different memory of his visit with the German leader.
While speaking of the visit with the Associated Press, Trump said: Yeah, it s funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with Merkel.
As if that weren t ridiculous enough, considering that the whole world saw how that visit actually went, Trump continued, this time trying to excuse his rudeness with the handshake debacle: And I guess somebody shouted out, Shake her hand, shake her hand, you know.
But I never heard it.
But I had already shaken her hand four times.
You know, because we were together for a long time.
He went on to boast: Because, um, I m at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I m at odds on immigration.
