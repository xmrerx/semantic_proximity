( ( this sept. 12 story corrects name of sacked minister in paragraph 2 ) ) bangui ( reuters ) - central african republic president faustin-archange touadera sacked his defense minister on tuesday evening , according to a state radio broadcast , amid growing violence that threatens to spin the country out of control .
the dismissal of joseph yakete was part of a wider cabinet reshuffle .
the statement did not say if his dismissal was related directly to growing violence .
thousands have died and a fifth of central africans have fled a conflict that broke out after mainly muslim seleka rebels ousted president francois bozize in 2013 , provoking a backlash from christian anti-balaka militias .
although unrest has since subsided , fighting has spiked this year and the united nations warned this month that ethnic fighting could descend again into a much larger conflict if combatants are not disarmed .
national security forces are too weak to tackle armed groups and counter the spillover from conflicts in neighboring countries , said the united nations .
in a sign of the deteriorating security situation , six red cross volunteers were killed in an attack on a health center in southeastern central african republic on aug. 3 , the aid organization said last month .
