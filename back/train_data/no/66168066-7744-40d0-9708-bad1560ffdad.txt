abidjan ( reuters ) - three united nations soldiers from chad were killed and two others wounded by an explosive device as they were escorting a convoy in northern mali on thursday , the peacekeeping mission in the west african nation said .
more than 80 members of the un mission , known as minusma , have been killed since 2013 in attacks by militant groups active in the country s north and center , making it the world s deadliest peacekeeping operation .
the mission said in a statement that the peacekeepers vehicle struck the explosive device between the northern towns of tessalit and aguelhok around 2:30 p.m. ( 1430 gmt ) .
minusma spokesman olivier salgado later told radio france internationale that the soldiers involved were from chad , which has one of the region s most effective armies .
i condemn with the greatest energy such abject acts , whose only objective is to destabilize the country and harm the peace process under way in mali , said interim mission chief koen davidse .
the rise of jihadist groups - some linked to al qaeda and islamic state - in the arid sahel has alarmed western powers like france , which has deployed thousands of troops to the region in response .
four u.s. special forces troops were killed earlier this month in neighbouring niger by fighters believed to belong to a local islamic state affiliate operating out of mali .
militants have exploited porous borders - particularly between mali , niger and burkina faso - to step up attacks on military and civilian targets , including tourist sites in regional capitals .
the g5 sahel , an anti-terrorism taskforce of soldiers from those three countries , as well as chad and mauritania , plans to launch its first joint operations in the coming days .
