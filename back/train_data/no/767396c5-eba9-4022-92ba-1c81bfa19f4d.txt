addis ababa ( reuters ) - ethnic clashes killed 11 people this week in ethiopia s oromiya region , a regional government official said on sunday , the latest unrest in a province that was wracked by violence in 2015 and 2016 .
nearly 700 people died last year during one period of the violence in ethiopia s largest region and other areas , according to a parliament-mandated investigation .
the unrest forced the government to impose a nine-month state of emergency that was finally lifted in august .
sporadic protests have taken place since then .
violence broke out this week in two districts in the province s west after protests led to clashes between ethnic oromos and amharas , the spokesman for the region s administration said on sunday .
eight oromos and three amharas died , spokesman addisu arega kitessa said in a statement .
the previous unrest was provoked by a development scheme for the capital , addis ababa , that dissidents said amounted to land grabs .
broader anti-government demonstrations followed , over politics and human rights abuses .
the violence included attacks on businesses , many of them foreign-owned , including farms growing flowers for export .
separately , clashes along the border between the country s oromiya and somali regions last month also displaced hundreds of thousands of people .
the area has been plagued by sporadic violence for decades .
a referendum held in 2004 to determine the status of disputed settlements failed to ease tensions .
those clashes have fueled fears about security in ethiopia , the region s biggest economy and a staunch western ally .
