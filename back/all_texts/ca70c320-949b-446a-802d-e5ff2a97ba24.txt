Yes, we did say she s a Harvard Business School graduate.
Just goes to show, you can t buy brains Kiran Gandhi, who has played drums for singer M.I.A.
and Thievery Corporation, decided to run the London Marathon without a tampon.
Gandhi let her blood flow freely to raise awareness about women who have no access to feminine products and to encourage women to not be embarrassed about their periods.
I ran the whole marathon with my period blood running down my legs, the 26-year-old wrote of the April race on her website.Gandhi, a Harvard Business School graduate, wrote that she got her period the night before the big race and thought that a tampon would be uncomfortable while she ran.
But that isn t the only reason she decided to let it flow.
I ran with blood dripping down my legs for sisters who don t have access to tampons and sisters who, despite cramping and pain, hide it away and pretend like it doesn t exist.
She added: I ran to say, it does exist, and we overcome it every day.
After the race, she took photos with her family and friends, wearing her period-stained running pants proudly.Gandhi tells PEOPLE that she decided to run without a tampon to highlight the sentiment of period-shaming and the language surrounding women s menstrual cycles.
She wrote on her site that on the marathon course, sexism can be beaten.
If there s one way to transcend oppression, it s to run a marathon in whatever way you want, she wrote.
Where the stigma of a woman s period is irrelevant, and we can re-write the rules as we choose.
