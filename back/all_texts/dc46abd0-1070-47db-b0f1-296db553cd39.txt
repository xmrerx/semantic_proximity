As one would expect the Obama regime is tripping all over the dead bodies of this tragedy to promote gun control.
They only take a break from their embarrassing behavior to assure Muslim s they ve got their backs.
Will this nightmare ever end?On Thursday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, speaking at the Muslim Advocate s 10th anniversary dinner, shockingly refused to focus on the Muslim community after the terrorist attacks committed by Muslims in San Bernardino and Paris, instead.
She reassured her audience, We stand with you in this.
In another astonishing moment, Lynch said that since the Paris attacks, her greatest concern has been the incredibly disturbing rise of anti-Muslim rhetoric that fear is my greatest fear.
One humdred thirty people were massacred by Muslim terrorists in Paris last month, added to the 17 killed in the Charlie Hebdo and kosher supermarket attacks in Paris, plus the 14 slaughtered in San Bernardino, the 13 soldiers murdered at Fort Hood, and the four Marines killed in Chattanooga.
Lynch would not say how many Muslims have been killed in the United States because of backlash.Lynch pontificated, When we talk about the First Amendment we [must] make it clear that actions predicated on violent talk are not American.
They are not who we are, they are not what we do, and they will be prosecuted My message not just to the Muslim community but to all Americans is We cannot give in to the fear that these backlashes are really based on.
The Obama Administration has been loath to ascribe any religious motive to Muslim terrorists, with the Defense Department referring to the Fort Hood slaughter as workplace violence, Obama himself saying the murderers at the kosher Paris supermarket randomly shoot a bunch of folks in a deli in Paris, and Obama assiduously avoiding any reference to Islam or Muslims in his statement after the massive Paris terror assault.Via: Breitbart News
