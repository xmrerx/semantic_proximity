on september 13 , president trump warned hillary on twitter that the americans she referred to as the deplorabes would come back to haunt her , as she travels around the nation on her blame anyone and everyone but me book signing tour for her embarrassing new book what happened .the `` deplorables '' came back to haunt hillary.they expressed their feelings loud and clear .
she spent big money but , in the end , had no game !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) september 14 , 2017thousands of trump supporters responded to his spot on tweet to hillary with various comments and videos .
the funniest video clip or gif , came from mike who sent a hilarious video of president trump golfing and then showing the golf ball landing squarely on the back of hillary s head , sending her flying into the cockpit of the plane she s boarding .
while hillary s trip into the cockpit is real , ( probably a result of too much chardonnay that she s always bragging about drinking ) , trump hitting her in the back of the head with his golf ball is obviously not real.watch : donald trump 's amazing golf swing # crookedhillary pic.twitter.com/vkhxxfcbv1 mike ( @ fuctupmind ) september 14 , 2017sadly , the left continues to prove that they re just a bunch of crybabies and delicate snowflakes who clearly can t take a joke .
as we ve all come to expect by now , the left went nuts on twitter simpy because our president retweeted a gif that he found humorous .
here are a few of their responses : apparently the only person left that has free speech is the @ potus in this dictatorship !
