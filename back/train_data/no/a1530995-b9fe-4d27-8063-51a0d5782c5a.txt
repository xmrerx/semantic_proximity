paris ( reuters ) - france s foreign ministry said on tuesday that it picked its former ambassador to saudi arabia as a special envoy to see how paris could support mediation efforts in the rift between qatar and several of its neighbors .
kuwait s emir sheikh sabah al-ahmad al-jaber has led mediation efforts to resolve the row , which began in early june when saudi arabia , bahrain , the united arab emirates and egypt cut political and trade ties with qatar .
france , which has close ties with egypt and the united arab emirates while also being a major arms supplier to qatar and a key ally of saudi arabia , has been relatively discreet on the crisis , largely sticking to calls for calm .
i confirm that bertrand besancenot , diplomatic advisor to the government , will soon go to the region to evaluate the situation and the best ways to support the mediation and appease tensions between qatar and its neighbors , foreign ministry spokeswoman agnes romatet-espagne told reporters in a daily briefing .
qatar s neighbors accuse it of supporting regional foe iran and islamists across the region , a charge doha denies .
