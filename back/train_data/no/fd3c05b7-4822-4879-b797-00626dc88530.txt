because by 9 years old , pretty much every person in the world is 100 % in tune with their sexuality right ?
and pretty much every person in the world wants a picture of a 9 year old boy dressed as a girl on their coffee table , where they used to keep their copy of national geographic right ? here is the number:1-800-647-5463 to cancel your subscription to national geographic , or to voice your opinion on their latest cover .
the cover of national geographic s upcoming january issue has sparked outrage online for featuring children questioning their genders and spotlighting what they call a gender revolution .
with articles titled , making a man , dangerous lives of girls , and rethinking gender , the publication is dedicating their entire first issue of 2017 to the single topic of the shifting landscape of gender , according to a press release .
to a degree unimaginable a decade ago , the intensely personal subject of gender identity has entered the public square , the press release states , adding that the issue will hit print newsstands on december 27 .

children are not mature enough to make these decisions .
they 're still developing .

say what ?
: a penis does n't make a man any more than a vagina makes a woman .
qed : gender has nothing to do with genitalia .
