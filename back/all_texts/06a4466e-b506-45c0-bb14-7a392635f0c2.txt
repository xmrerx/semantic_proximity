Until recently, Iowa Democrat Kim Weaver was running a promising campaign against noted white supremacist, GOP Rep. Steve King.Weaver raised $100,000 in four days following King s racist claim that we can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies just one of his many, many bigoted outpourings.This, of course, made him very popular with the alt-Right (the modern term for Nazis).The 15 Words:[C]ulture and demographics are our destiny.
We can't restore our civilization with somebody else's babies.

Beginning during my 2016 campaign, I have received very alarming acts of intimidation, including death threats, Weaver explains on Facebook.
While some may say enduring threats are just a part of running for office, my personal safety has increasingly become a concern.
King, almost following a script that seems to be read every single time the Right threatens someone into submission, claimed that the death threats likely didn t happen but a fabrication.
I wanted #KimWeaver IN the race-not out.
Democrats drove her out of the race-not R's.
Death threats likely didn't happen but a fabrication.
