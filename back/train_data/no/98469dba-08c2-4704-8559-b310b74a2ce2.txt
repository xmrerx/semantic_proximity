yangon ( reuters ) - two hunters from a remote village in the north of myanmar s troubled rakhine state were killed and two others were injured by unidentified gunmen after crossing the border into bangladesh , myanmar s government said on monday .
the incident took place on sunday evening near the village of aung thabyay , which is located some 2 kilometers ( 1.24 miles ) from myanmar s border with bangladesh .
the four crossed the border fence while searching for a boar and got shot by 15 people wearing civilian clothes with guns 100 yards from the border fence , myanmar said in a statement that gave no other details .
the wounded hunters were treated at a hospital in the regional town of maungdaw , some 60 kilometers ( 37 miles ) south of where the incident took place .
the hunters belong to a small ethnic group from northern rakhine called the daingnet that is mostly buddhist .
unlike the rohingya muslims , they are recognized among myanmar s 135 national races .
about 600,000 people have crossed the border since aug. 25 when rohingya muslim insurgent attacks on security posts were met by a counter-offensive by the myanmar army in rakhine .
the united nations says the government s actions amount to ethnic cleansing .
