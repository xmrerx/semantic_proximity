prague ( reuters ) - czech billionaire andrej babis gained possible support on monday for his bid to form a minority government with his ano movement when the small communist party said it could tolerate the prospect .
ano won nearly three times as many votes as its closest competitor in a parliamentary election this month when voters shunned traditional parties but fell short of a majority in the lower house .
since then , the other eight parties that won seats have refused cooperation with ano with the exception of the spd , a far-right , anti-european union party that is not a preferred coalition partner for babis .
the businessman ran on an anti-establishment platform and pledged to fight political corruption but he faces potential fraud charges himself .
the ano has 78 seats in the 200-seat lower house and is considering forming a minority government but it must win a confidence vote with a simple majority of those present .
the head of the far-left communist party ( kscm ) said he could tolerate a minority cabinet as a way out of the impasse .
it is a question of how much the government s program would fit us , to tolerate this government , kscm chairman vojtech filip told czech television .
i am not saying we will support it , i am speaking about tolerance .
kscm with its 15 seats would have to leave the lower house during a confidence vote thus lowering the threshold ano would need to win .
president milos zeman , who will meet with babis on tuesday , told czech radio a minority government would be a good option .
most parties shun babis and his ano party because of the fraud charges .
police say he hid ownership of a farm and conference center near prague in 2008 so he could qualify for a 2 million euro eu subsidy normally meant for small businesses .
babis denies wrongdoing and says the charges were politically motivated .
