washington ( reuters ) - president barack obama on tuesday said he would seek changes in the way u.s. oil and coal resources are managed , prompting a flood of reaction from environmental groups pushing him to do more to limit fossil fuel production - and producers anxious about regulatory changes .
“ i ’ m going to push to change the way we manage our oil and coal resources , so that they better reflect the costs they impose on taxpayers and our planet , ” obama said in his state of the union address .
as he enters his final year in office , obama is looking to secure his legacy on priorities like curbing climate change .
the white house did not provide details on tuesday .
“ that ’ s an issue i would say , stay tuned for the months ahead , ” white house communications director jen psaki told reporters during a briefing ahead of the speech .
“ this is not a speech where i would expect a 25-page fact-sheet .
this is more talking about his vision and the issues we need to address , ” psaki said .
the western energy alliance , a group that represents oil and natural gas companies that drill on public lands in the western states , said it suspected the lack of immediate details meant that obama would look for ways to act without congress .
“ he ’ ll close out his term by continuing to issue new rules through the federal agencies that kill jobs and economic growth in order to promote his climate change agenda , ” said tim wigley , the group ’ s president , in a statement .
environmental groups noted obama ’ s pledge comes as his administration works on a new five-year plan for offshore oil and gas leases .
they are also calling for changes to rules for production of oil and gas on federal lands .
“ for far too long , the interior department has given away our publicly owned fossil fuels to mining and drilling companies without regard for the damage they cause to communities and our climate , ” said annie leonard , executive director of greenpeace usa , in a statement .
