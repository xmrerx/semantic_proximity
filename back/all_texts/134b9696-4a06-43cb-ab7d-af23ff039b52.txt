GOP now stands for grab our p*ssies, Maher declared.When Fallon joked that it sounds like Maher supports Trump, Maher got serious.
It s not funny, he said.
This is a different thing.
I did a whole mea culpa on my show Friday night, I talked about Mitt Romney, George Bush, Reagan, McCain like it was the end of the world.
It would never have been the end of the world with those guys.
This is different.
This guy is different.
They have no respect for the rule of law.
It s only about vengeance.
When asked what he would say to undecided voters, Maher made things simple.
First of all, really?
I mean, he s a racist, a liar, a tax cheat, a deadbeat, a Russian agent, and a sexual predator.
How do you find your way out of the door in the morning?
is what I would say to the undecideds.
Maher concluded by slamming conservatives for creating an alternate reality where America is failing and President Obama did a horrible jobs.
The facts, however, paint a different story before unemployment is down to 4.9 percent and the stock market has more than recovered since the Great Recession.Here s the video via YouTube.Americans need to vote in this election no matter what.
