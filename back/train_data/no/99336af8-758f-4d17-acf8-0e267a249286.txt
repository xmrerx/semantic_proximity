mexico city ( reuters ) - hurricane irma left a trail of absolute devastation as it tore across the tiny caribbean island of barbuda on wednesday with 185-mile-per-hour ( 295-kph ) winds , destroying houses , snapping trees and killing at least one person gaston browne , the prime minister of the two-island nation of antigua and barbuda , described the island as barely habitable after the powerful category 5 storm struck early on wednesday .
this rebuilding initiative will take years , browne told local abs television radio after a visit to the island , where he confirmed that one person died in the storm .
describing the scene as absolute devastation , he said the storm , which also snapped a telecoms tower , had caused estimated damage of some $ 150 million .
lying a little over 250 miles ( 400 km ) east of puerto rico , barbuda has a population of 1,800 and is one of the caribbean s quietest getaways for tourists coming to enjoy its turquoise seas and coral reefs .
aerial footage of the island after irma had passed through showed a desolate , flooded landscape shorn of trees and foliage with overturned vehicles and scattered debris .
an island resident who identified himself as king goldilocks , 60 , said he had been left homeless .
last night was the worst night of my life , goldilocks said on abs , wearing a raincoat and clutching a cane .
we had minimal loss of life but we had maximum damage .
browne , who said earlier the damage had not been serious on barbuda , about 30 miles ( 48 km ) from antigua , changed his mind after taking a helicopter to the island once the winds died down .
he said barbudan residents should be evacuated if a second hurricane , jose , turns toward the islands later this week .
jose is forecast to become a major storm and pass close to antigua and barbuda on saturday .
