after a fox business interview earlier in the day ( see below ) , gino defabio was asked to speak at the ohio rally by president trump .
speaking from the heart , gino explained how he knew he had to support trump in 2016 : gino s interview on fox business caught the eye of president trump : difabio was interviewed by fox s david asman who immediately pointed out defabio s t-shirt : by the way , your t-shirt we can just see the first part .
it says trump won .
what s the second part ?
defabio proudly said , deal with it asman asked what made a lifelong democrat switch parties to support trump : my whole life i was raised democrat .
you re in the steel valley here .
we re proud of our work ethic .
we re proud of our families and that s how we are here .
for about the last thirty five years i ve been hearing oh yeah , we re going to fight for you .
we re going to take care of you .
i m going to go to washington and do this and do that .
they ve done nothing for us , nothing but promise .
defabio was asked about overregulation : the regulations they put on us are incredible , he said .
they re killing jobs .
they re trying to kill the coal industry .
if he gets rid of the regulations , frees up some of the trade deals that are ridiculous where we just give everything away , we re all going to be better off .
how could you be against that message ?
president trump had to love the answer to the question asman asked about the russia : there s no russians behind the trees .
there s no russians under jared kushner s bed .
they are trying to find an excuse why they lost the election and now they are trying to come up with a new message .
every time they beat the guy down , he gets stronger .
believe me , we re not buying the fake news and the fake media , and we re not buying the russians , so just stop it .
awesome !
