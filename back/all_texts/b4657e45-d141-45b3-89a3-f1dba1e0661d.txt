Sean Hannity is pissed.
Really pissed.
Earlier today, he appeared on CBS Sunday Morning for an interview with veteran ABC News anchor Ted Koppel, which didn t go well for him.
In that interview, Hannity did his level best to keep Koppel from making his point (meaning he was interrupting Koppel every chance he got), but Koppel wasn t having it.
He literally said that he thinks Hannity and his ilk are bad for America, and dropped the hammer on why: You have attracted people who are determined that ideology is more important than fact.
That s the truth, and Hannity doesn t like it.
In a way, he s like Trump he s not wrong, everyone else is wrong.
Whether or not he agrees with something is what determines whether it is a fact.
So, like his idol, President Cheeto McTinyhands, he took to Twitter to blast CBS for editing the interview the way they did: Fake Edited News @CBSNews release the Unedited 45 minute interview so people can see the BS games you play in the edit room.
I dare you!
https://t.co/prynzE2yLQ Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 26, 2017 Fake Edited News, and then a demand that they air the entire 45-minute interview is classic Donald Trump.
But what can we expect?
It s been obvious for a long time that he s in love with Trump.
Now he s even copying him, so when can we expect Hannity to start stalking him?More to the point, though, as someone who himself conducts on-air interviews that have time constraints on them, Hannity is acting extremely hypocritically here.
He also just made himself look incredibly dumb both things with which Twitter is having a field day:@seanhannity Has your show ever edited an interview or cut one short due to time constraints?Or are you just a massive hypocrite?

@seanhannity @CBSNews Were you really expecting to be treated as a real journalist by a real journalist?
Andrew Murphy (@amurphous) March 26, 2017@seanhannity Oh Sean.
Just say I m so mad cuz Ted made me stop interrupting and then skewered me.
Want me to say it with you?
@CBSNews Catherine N. (@catherinemom23) March 26, 2017@seanhannity @CBSNews You are bad for America.
There s nothing fake about that.
John Doherty (@Babababootsiea) March 26, 2017It s really time for Hannity to get his head out of his ass.
He was nailed, he knows it, and now, like his hero in the White House, he s going to whine about it on Twitter.
Poor guy.
