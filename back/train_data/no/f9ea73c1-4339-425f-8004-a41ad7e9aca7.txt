remember when the us had a president who took the lead in the war on terror ?
russia has carried out a series of deadly airstrikes against the terrorist group and vladimir putin has now sent the country s most elite special forces team into the war zone.and speculation is heightening that offensive will be bolstered by the china s people s liberation army , following a number of reports of military movements in the region backed up by strong words from a senior government member at a united nations meeting.reports emanating from the middle east last week said china was planning on joining the fight against isis in the coming weeks , according to a syrian army official.while beijing insists it will abide by the united nations ( un ) in the region , hints of an action were backed up when it spoke strongly about a coordinated response to the rising terrorist threat.speaking of the syrian crisis china s foreign minister wang yi said at the un security council session in new york : the world can not afford to stand by and look on with folded arms , but must also not arbitrarily interfere .
he added that nations should stand united against violent extremist ideology .mr wang and his opposite number in russia , sergey lavrov met at length last week and afterwards mr lavrov said the two countries are in similar positions on many domestic and international issues.china has also shown solidarity with syria , joining russia in vetoeing un proposals against bashar al-assad , which are likely to prevent him being referred by the council to the international criminal court.the latest actions at the un conference have come amid reports , citing key military sources , chinese warships have made their way to syrian shores through the suez canal.it was said china s j-15 warplanes would launch from an aircraft carrier for attacks on isis.russian media followed that up by quoting igor morozov , a member of the russian federation committee on international affairs , confirming chinese aircraft carrier , lianoning , and a guided missile cruiser were heading to the area , and adding chinese military advisers were already in the region.mr morozov said : it is known that china has joined our military operation in syria .
the chinese cruiser has already entered the mediterranean , followed by its aircraft carrier .
these reports have not been verified by china and satellite images show the syrian port of tartus , currently empty.however , china come under threat from isis in recent months increasing the theory an attack is in the pipeline .
