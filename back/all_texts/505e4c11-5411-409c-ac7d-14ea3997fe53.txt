PARIS (Reuters) - Eight suspects have been placed under formal investigation in France following their arrest in joint counter-terrorism raids with Swiss authorities, a judicial source said on Saturday.
The suspects were among 10 detained on Nov. 7 by French and Swiss police as the result of a four-month investigation into a group of young Islamists thought to have been radicalized by a Swiss imam, who was among those detained.

Seven of the eight suspects placed under formal investigation have been remanded in custody, the judicial source said.
A ninth person arrested in the French swoop was released without charge.
