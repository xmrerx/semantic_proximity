One of Trump s Latino surrogates, Marco Gutierrez, warned us of an oddly specific horror should we not elect Trump in November.
Apparently, he thinks we ll have taco trucks on every corner, because his culture is very dominant and it s causing problems.
Most of America seems to see this as the opposite of a problem, though, including the Arizona Democratic Party.
They re going to host a taco truck on their particular corner of Phoenix this weekend.The horror.
The sheer, hilarious horror of it all.
Someone make them stop before others get ideas and we see more taco trucks pop up.They even changed their sign.
Check it out below:.
@AZDemParty updated its sign, y all.

In Denver, Colorado Democrats set up a taco truck right outside of Trump s campaign headquarters there.
This particular taco truck isn t just selling tacos, though.
It s registering voters.
And those voters will be Democratic as well.Gutierrez shot himself, and Trump, in the foot here.
They can probably expect much more trolling over this, while Trump tries to warn us that these taco trucks are a mere harbinger of all the terrible things to come should Hillary get elected.
Sadly for the Trump campaign, this gaffe will just be a boon for anyone who operates a taco truck, and for Americans who love tacos.Featured image via screen capture from embedded tweet
