if this isn t white guilt on steroids and indoctrination , we don t know what is !
teachers need to teach history and not use it as a way to indoctrinate kids .
playing slave ship captain and slave is extreme and has been going on for some time at this cerritos , california high school sickening ! whitney high school junior timothy reyes had his hands taped together and was a part of a slave ship reenactment when he was an 8th grader on the cerritos campus.so this has been going on for at least three years ! a mother complained recently after getting an email from her son s teacher explaining the unique classroom activity , which was to be a surprise .
staff would act as slave ship captains , the email described , and the children slaves.after lining the kids up , the note said , they d use masking tape to tie their wrists together , make them lay on the ground , and in a dark room have them watch a clip from the film roots .
our education system has been so destructive to young minds with all of the indoctrination into radical liberal thinking .
nothing could be worse than having liberals take control of education.the photo above is from crazy lifeline exhibition : this is more of the same ridiculous i m sorry white guilt trip the first lifeline expedition journey was the jubilee 2000 lifeline walk in england .
during the course of that journey , it became evident that the major reconciliation issue between europe and africa , was that of the legacy of the trans-atlantic slave trade.in 2002 , a team of 20 from the three corners of the former slavetriangle , europe , west africa and the caribean , travelled through france .
for the first time the slave coffle was used , with white europeans and americans walking in replica yokes and chains as a symbolic sign of apology for the slave trade.in 2003 , the lifeline expedition visited spain and portugal and another new feature was added : copies of the apology statement for the slave trade , issued at the last liverpool city council meeting of 1999 , were delivered to city halls.other ports of call have include the usa , the caribbean , and west africa.via : cbs local
