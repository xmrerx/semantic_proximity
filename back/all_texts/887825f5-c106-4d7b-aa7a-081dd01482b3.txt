Joaquin Castro of Texas is a rising star in the Democratic Party and a member of the United States House of Representatives.
He s also pretty outspoken.
So when Trump insisted via Twitter, of course that he won the popular vote as well as the Electoral College, but it wasn t showing in the counts due to illegal voting, Castro couldn t take it anymore.
After all, Trump s tweet clearly has zero basis in reality, and like many of his bogus claims, is a combination of his overactive, childlike imagination and crackpot notions from feverish right-wing conspiracy theories.
So, Rep. Castro baited Trump by Tweeting back:It's going to be hard to work with someone this delusional.

It s also likely that he doesn t care, either.
After all, he s right.
Trump is delusional, and has displayed that fact repeatedly, not just over the course of his travesty of a presidential campaign, but over his entire life.
Rep. Castro was right to call it out.
After all, we re talking about the madman who will have control of America s nuclear arsenal come January 20.
If his spineless GOP bedfellows won t call Trump s rantings out for what they are, at least we have Rep. Joaquin Castro to do it.Godspeed, Rep. Castro.
May you survive having to work with this delusional jackass.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
