Of course in their blind rage for the conservative Right, the media did everything in their power to blame this sick person s actions on who else the GOP frontrunner and one of the Tea Party favorites, Donald J. Trump The mainstream media are reporting that a Bay Area plumber who allegedly planned to bomb a California mosque was a Donald Trump supporter though he explicitly supported Hillary Clinton.On Sunday, police arrested 55-year-old William Celli on suspicion of possessing an explosive device and making criminal threats, CBS San Francisco reported.
A bomb squad detonated a device at his house.
The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) cheered the arrest.CBS elaborated further: On Facebook, Celli repeatedly praised Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, whose plan to bar any Muslims from entering the United States has drawn criticism even as he continues to rise in the polls.
The Huffington Post and other left-wing sites played up Celli s support of Trump, implying that Trump was responsible for propelling bigotry and white domestic terrorism into the mainstream of political debate.What the media left out, however, is that Celli also praised Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton.In one post, Celli wrote: Hillary Would make a great president.
If she would commit to what she is hiding.
But she has to crucify the president.
Then her run for the White house is over.
