edinburgh ( reuters ) - the spanish region of catalonia should be allowed to determine its own future , scotland s devolved pro-independence government said , adding that the strength of catalan feeling could not be ignored by the international community .
the statement came after an independence vote organized by catalonia s autonomous regional government on sunday , ruled illegal by madrid , erupted into violence as police tried to stop it going ahead .
the results of the vote overwhelmingly backed independence , although turnout was 42 percent because those in favor of keeping spain as one country boycotted it .
the autonomous catalan government has called for international mediation .
spain will maintain that this vote is not legitimate but the strength of feeling demonstrated can not be ignored by spain , nor by the wider european and international community , scotland s foreign minister fiona hyslop said .
there must now be dialogue to resolve this matter in a way that respects both democracy and the rule of law , and allows the people of catalonia to determine their own future .
scotland itself rejected independence from the united kingdom in a binding 2014 referendum , although nationalists are still the dominant force in scottish politics .
