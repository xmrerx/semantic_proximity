Beginning in 2011, Republican-controlled states began setting up what they claim is a system to identify voters who have voted in more than one place.As reported on Democracy Now, at least 27 states began using an interstate cross-checking system, which identifies voters whose names appear on the voter rolls in more than one state.Investigative reporter Greg Palast was able to access the list of flagged voters, which has now grown to include more than seven million names.As Palast explains during a recent episode of Redacted Tonight, not a single person whose name appears on the list of flagged voters has been prosecuted for voter fraud.In fact, none of the people whose names have been removed from the voting rolls for suspected voter fraud has even been reported for further investigation.That s because Republicans know that this system does not identify people who are voting multiple times, as they claim it does.After reviewing the list firsthand, Palast discovered that it is made up of voters who have very common names; for example, Joe Smith.While it would be surprising if a name like Joe Smith didn t appear multiple times on several state voter rolls, the system flags any voter who appears to be registered twice.
Worse, it even flags voters who may have the same first and last name as another person, but an entirely different middle name.Not surprisingly, the interstate cross-check system overwhelmingly impacts minority and Democratic voters.During a March 10, 2016 interview with Lee Camp, Palast described the likely impact of the interstate crosscheck system on the 2016 election.Watch the interview below:Palast first began sounding the alarm over inaccuracies in the interstate crosscheck system in 2014.A thirty-minute special report titled Jim Crow Returns: Interstate Crosscheck Program threatens Millions of Voters, provides a closer look at the list of voters who have been impacted by the bogus system.Watch the full report below, via Greg Palast on YouTube:Millions of voters are likely to be kicked from the voter rolls between now and November, if they haven t been already.One of the most important things voters can do to protect their voting rights is regularly check their status as a registered voter.As we get closer to the general election, republicans will step up their efforts to disenfranchise as many democratic voters as possible.Lee Camp s third video in the series Seven Ways To Beat The Ballot Bandits drives the point home:Go here to find out what else you can do to preserve and protect your vote.Image credit: video screen capture via Greg Palast on youtube
