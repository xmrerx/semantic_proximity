beijing ( reuters ) - china s gasoline and diesel exports to north korea and iron ore imports from the isolated nation fell in august as trade continued to slow after the united nations latest sanctions , customs data showed on tuesday .
the release comes after data on saturday showed china s trade with north korea jumped in august even after the u.n. sanctions , mainly driven by a rise in imports .
the data also showed china imported 1.6 million tonnes of coal from north korea , the first since february when beijing banned purchases of the fuel from its northern neighbor .
it was not immediately clear why the data showed shipments had resumed .
a customs official said she would investigate the matter .
last month , the u.n. security council unanimously imposed new sanctions on north korea targeting its exports of coal , iron ore , lead , lead ore and seafood .
the sanctions took effect this month , but china enforced the new measures from aug. 15 .
china s diesel exports to north korea were 170 tonnes , compared with zero tonnes in august last year and gasoline shipments were 180 tonnes , down 96.3 percent from a year ago .
