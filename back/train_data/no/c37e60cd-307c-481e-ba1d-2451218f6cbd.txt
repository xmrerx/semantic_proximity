the berkeley , california anti-trump protesters got a dose of reality today when pro-trump patriots fought back .
video after video posted on twitter shows the pro-trump group fighting back against the antifa anarchists .
one video in particular shows a punk anarchist telling a veteran he s un-american huh ?
since when is it unamerican to serve your country ?
this punk immediately got an earful from the veteran .
it s beyond pitiful and sad that this kid wasn t taught about our heroes .
the kid is lucky someone didn t knock him out disgusting !
antifa kid calls u.s .
veteran an `` anti-american '' .
