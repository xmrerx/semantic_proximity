One of the most well-known white supremacists in American history just had his chosen candidate, Donald Trump, become the presumptive Republican presidential candidate.
Notorious former KKK Grand Dragon David Duke is letting the entire world know how happy he is to have Trump leading the ticket.On his radio show yesterday, white supremacist David Duke celebrated Donald Trump s victory in Indiana, which made him the presumptive Republican nominee for president.
Duke also used the show as yet another opportunity to promote his virulent brand of anti-Semitism, blaming Jewish neo-cons for trying to destroy Trump s candidacy and for allegedly controlling the country.Duke asserted that Jewish extremists have made a terribly crazy miscalculation, because all they re going to be doing by doing a Never Trump move ment is exposing their alien, their anti-American, anti-American-majority position.
They re going to push people more into an awareness that the neo cons are the problem, that these Jewish supremacists who con trol our country are the real problem, and the rea son why America is not great.
Duke has been on the so-called Trump Train for months, expressing pride that for the first time in decades a candidate for one of America s two major parties was openly expressing some of the ideas that the white supremacist movement does.The hate leader loves that Trump has been demonizing Latinos as criminals and rapists, while the former Klansman also agrees with Trump s plans to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border and his idea of limiting Muslim travel into the United States.It isn t just Duke.
Trump has attracted backing from anti-Semites and other bigots, who he has often amplified on social media.
Those bigots have also often gone after journalists whose reporting on Trump they find problematic with rape threats, racist and sexist epithets, and worse.A group of white supremacists have even put together pro-Trump robocall efforts in multiple states.Featured image via Flickr
