moscow ( reuters ) - russia opposes a draft u.n. resolution to extend the mandate of an international inquiry into chemical weapons attacks in syria , russian deputy foreign minister sergei ryabkov said on wednesday .
ryabkov s comments came hours after russia rejected a report by the international inquiry blaming the syrian government for a deadly toxic gas attack , casting doubt on the u.n. security council s ability to extend the investigation s mandate before it expires next week .
russia last month cast a veto at the united nations security council against renewing the investigation s mandate .
i stress that we are in no way raising the question of ending this structure s activities , ria state news agency quoted ryabkov as saying .
we are in favor of its maintenance , but on a different basis .
the draft u.n. resolution by the united states says syria must not develop or produce chemical weapons , and it calls on all parties in syria to provide full cooperation with the international probe .
the investigation by the united nations and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons known as the joint investigative mechanism ( jim ) was unanimously created by the 15-member security council in 2015 and renewed in 2016 for another year .
its mandate is due to expire in mid-november .
the investigation found that syrian president bashar al-assad s government was to blame for a chemical attack on the opposition-held town of khan sheikhoun that killed dozens of people in april , according to a report sent to the security council on oct. 26 .
russia , whose air force and special forces have bolstered the syrian army , has said there is no evidence to show damascus was responsible for the attack .
moscow maintains that the chemicals that killed civilians belonged to rebels , not assad s government .
