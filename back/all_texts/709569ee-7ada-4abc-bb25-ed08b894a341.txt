Donald Trump, increasingly desperate as the election begins to slip away, has begun simply making up nightmare scenarios that he claims would occur if Hillary Clinton wins the upcoming presidential election.
Speaking to Reuters, Trump said Clinton has no plan for Syria and with her you ll end up in World War Three.
He went on to claim that the former Secretary of State doesn t know what she s doing and would be unprepared to lead if elected President.Yet despite Trump s criticism, he is the one who has been on record during the entirety of the campaign expressing extreme views about national security and foreign policy.
Declaring that he loves war, Trump has promised to bomb the hell out of ISIS, torture America s enemies (even though experts say that increases danger and terrorism), and vowed to commit war crimes by killing the families of terrorists.As a result, Trump has seen an unprecedented backlash against his campaign.
Many foreign policy experts who served under previous Republican presidents George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan and George H.W.
Bush now back Clinton and oppose Trump, because they believe he would be an erratic leader with access to America s gigantic nuclear arsenal and military.For her part, Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama have repeatedly made clear that with their experience in proximity to major crises that Trump would not have the mettle to make calm and level headed decisions.
Clinton has cited Trump s habit of making Twitter tirades at three o clock in the morning as evidence that he has disqualified himself.Arguing without merit that Clinton would trigger World War III while polling shows that Trump at best has between a 9% to 15% chance at winning enough electoral votes to become President will not help the negative perceptions held about him amongst the public at large.Featured image via screen capture
