In an unusual and shocking move, the editorial board of USA Today did something no one say coming: for the first time in their 34-year history, they broke their rule of neutrality, and blasted Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.Never before taking any side let alone taking a position of any sort the board labeled Trump a danger to America, writing that his erratic, ill-equipped personality (as well as his checkered business past) disqualify him from the presidency.Writing not in support of Clinton but rather in sheer resentment of Trump, the board blasted the nominee for his unconventional and downright prejudiced ways:This year, the choice isn t between two capable major party nominees who happen to have significant ideological differences.
This year, one of the candidates Republican nominee Donald Trump is, by unanimous consensus of the Editorial Board, unfit for the presidency He has demonstrated repeatedly that he lacks the temperament, knowledge, steadiness and honesty that America needs from its presidents.The board called on voters much like Ted Cruz did at the RNC to vote their conscience and follow their convictions, asking them to resist the siren song of a dangerous demagogue, and by all means vote, just not for Donald Trump.
One of the biggest reasons for the plea of deflection is due in part to Trump s misguided and dangerous view of the world, from his blunders on NATO to his high regard for Vladimir Putin.Trump s foreign policy pronouncements typically range from uninformed to incoherent.
It s not just Democrats who say this.
Scores of Republican national security leaders have signed an extraordinary open letter calling Trump s foreign policy vision wildly inconsistent and unmoored in principle.
In a Wall Street Journal column this month, Robert Gates, the highly respected former Defense secretary who served presidents of both parties over a half-century, described Trump as beyond repair.
The stinging rebuke comes just days after Vice Presidential candidate Mike Pence penned an op-ed in the newspaper outlining why voters should choose Trump and himself.Talk about great timing.USA Today s half endorsement, half non-endorsement follows a slew of newspaper who are famously bucking Donald Trump (and instead endorsing Clinton).
USA Today s editorial board expressed deep concerns for Hillary Clinton, citing her emails, her candor, and issues with her entitlement.Nonetheless, the board sent a strong message in an age of neutrality: the stakes could not be higher, and we as a nation cannot take a risk with Donald Trump in the White House.Much like the onslaught received by the Arizona Republic, USA Today is sure to feel the wrath of Trump supporters in the coming days.
However, a poll on the paper s website asks readers if they agree with the board s decision or not.
Out of almost nine thousand votes (so far), 85 percent agree.That s a good start.Good for the USA Today editorial board they have a backbone, and it s about time those in the media stand up to the racist, fear mongering bully that is Donald J. Trump.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images
