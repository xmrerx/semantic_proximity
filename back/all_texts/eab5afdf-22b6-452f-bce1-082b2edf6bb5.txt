On Friday, freelance reporter and political consultant Michael J. Hout tweeted a photo of Hillary Clinton walking with forearm crutches at Yale Law School on Saturday.
Hillary told the world that she broke her toe while walking downstairs with a cup of coffee in her hand, while she was in the UK promoting her ridiculous book What Happened , that tells the story of how it s everyone else s fault but her own that she lost the presidential election to Donald Trump.

The Washington Free Beacon took a closer look at Hillary s story to see if she really broke her toe, if she just had a bit too much to drink, or if she s hiding from interviews after the new Uranium One story broke, with evidence of Hillary selling 20% of America s uranium to Russia in return for contributions to her Clinton Foundation slush fund.Watch:
