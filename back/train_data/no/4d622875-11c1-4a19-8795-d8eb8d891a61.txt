united nations ( reuters ) - international community sanctions on north korea may be hurting key economic sectors and hampering the human rights of its citizens , a united nations expert said on thursday .
it is my conviction that a comprehensive assessment of the sanctions regime is needed in order to avoid unintended negative impact on human rights , said tomas ojea quintana , the u.n. s special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in north korea , in a speech to a u.n. committee .
ojea quintana said the sanctions must be evaluated to avoid imposing what would effectively constitute a collective punishment on north koreans .
the rapporteur said pyongyang was ultimately responsible for protecting the human rights of its citizens , yet patterns of grave violations persisted .
the u.n. security council last month strengthened sanctions against pyongyang , including export bans as well as asset freezes and travel bans on various officials , over the country s sixth and most powerful nuclear test so far , conducted on sept. 3 .
on thursday , the united states unilaterally imposed sanctions on seven north korean individuals and three entities over what it called serious human rights abuses , including forced labor .
ojea quintana highlighted the deplorable conditions of detainees in detention centers near the border with china including widespread sexual and gender-based violence .
