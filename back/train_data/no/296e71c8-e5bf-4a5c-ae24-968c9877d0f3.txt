athens ( reuters ) - a greek court on wednesday backed the extradition to moscow of a russian citizen who also faces being sent to the united states on allegations of laundering billions of dollars in bitcoin .
alexander vinnik , the suspected mastermind of a $ 4 billion bitcoin laundering ring , is one of seven russians arrested or indicted worldwide this year on u.s. cybercrime charges .
judges ruled last week that he should be extradited to the united states , a decision russia criticized as unjust and illegal and which vinnik is challenging at greece s supreme court .
should it decide to uphold the ruling to extradite him to the united states , the final decision is in the hands of greece s justice minister , who can approve extradition to one country and block the other .
vinnik denies all charges against him .
but he has agreed to be returned to russia where he is to be tried on lesser fraud charges .
that is his wish - to be extradited to russia and to give his account before the russian judicial authorities , alexandros lykourezos , the lawyer leading vinnik s defense , told reporters after the ruling in thessaloniki .
in the united states , where he faces up to 55 years in prison , vinnik is accused of running btc-e a digital currency exchange used to trade bitcoin to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking since 2011 .
he has told greek judges that he was a technical consultant to btc-e and not its operator .
vinnik was arrested while on holiday in a seaside village in greece in july .
russia then sought his extradition as it has done with other nationals wanted by the united states .
the supreme court hearing is expected within the next three weeks , lykourezos said .
