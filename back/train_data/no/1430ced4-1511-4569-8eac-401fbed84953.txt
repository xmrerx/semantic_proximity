istanbul ( reuters ) - the turkish capital ankara has banned the public showing of films and exhibitions related to lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender ( lgbt ) issues , the governor s office said on sunday , citing risks to public safety .
the move is likely to deepen concern among rights activists and turkey s western allies about its record on civil liberties under president tayyip erdogan s islamist-rooted ak party .
starting from nov. 18 , 2017 , concerning our community s public sensitivity , any events such as lgbt ... cinema , theater , panels , interviews , exhibitions are banned until further notice in our province to provide peace and security , the governor s office said in a statement .
it said that such exhibitions could cause different groups in society to publicly harbor hatred and hostility toward each other and therefore pose a risk to public safety .
authorities in ankara had already banned a german gay film festival on wednesday , the day before it was due to start , citing public safety and terrorism risks .
in addition , gay pride parades have been banned in istanbul for the last two years running .
unlike in many muslim countries , homosexuality is not a crime in turkey , but there is widespread hostility to it .
civil liberties in turkey have become a particular concern for the west following the attempted military coup in july 2016 .
since then , more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial on suspicion of links to the coup .
some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from their jobs .
human rights groups and turkey s western allies fear erdogan is using the coup as a pretext to quash his opponents .
ankara says the measures are necessary , given the extent of the security threat it faces .
