WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton said on Thursday Republican candidate Donald Trump is unqualified to be president of the United States.
“I know how hard this job is, and I know we need steadiness as well as strength and smarts in it, and I have concluded that he is not qualified to be president of the United States,” she said in an interview on CNN.
