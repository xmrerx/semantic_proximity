berlin ( reuters ) - german consulates in the united states have seen a significant rise in requests for citizenship since november 2016 , when donald trump was elected president , data collected by the german foreign ministry shows .
total citizenship applications - including those filed by u.s. citizens already living in germany - are reported yearly , with data for this year not expected until summer 2018 .
however , german consulates receive citizenship requests filed overseas , including those filed by former germans who were stripped of their citizenship during the nazi era .
the german government s offices in the united states are currently seeing a significant increase in legal queries related to citizenship issues , the german interior ministry said in response to an official query by the greens party .
applications do not ask why an applicant wants to become a citizen , so the reasons for the increase are a matter of conjecture .
but applications by german stripped of citizenship during the nazi era and their descendants rose sharply after the u.s. election in early november .
such applications climbed from 92 in october 2016 to 124 in november , 144 in december and 159 in january 2017 .
at least 100 people living in the united states have applied every month through june .
data from the german foreign ministry showed that , all told , 1,190 such applicants sought citizenship in the first eight months of 2017 , compared with 792 in the full year of 2016 .
germany has also seen a surge in british nationals applying for german citizenship since the country voted to leave the european union last year .
the federal statistics office said a total of 110,400 foreigners took up german citizenship last year , a 2.9 percent increase from the previous year , with britons making up the largest share of the increase .
