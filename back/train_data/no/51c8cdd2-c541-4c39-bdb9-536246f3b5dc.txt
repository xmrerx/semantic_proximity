krakow , poland ( reuters ) - demanding reparations from germany for its actions in poland during world war two is a matter of honor for warsaw , jaroslaw kaczynski , the leader of polish ruling law and justice ( pis ) party , said on saturday .
the issue of reparations , revived by poland s eurosceptic pis after decades of improving relations with germany , could escalate tensions between the two european union members .
in september polish parliamentary legal experts ruled that warsaw has the right to demand reparations from germany , although poland s foreign minister indicated that no immediate claim would be made .
the french were paid , jews were paid , many other nations were paid for the losses they suffered during world war two .
poles were not , kaczynski said .
it is not only about material funds .
it is about our status , our honor ... and this is not theater .
this is our demand , a totally serious demand , added kaczynski , poland s de facto leader .
the pis government , deeply distrustful of germany , has raised calls for wartime compensation in recent months but foreign minister witold waszczykowski has said further analysis was needed before any claims were lodged .
six million poles , including three million polish jews , were killed during the war , and the capital warsaw was razed to the ground in 1944 after a failed uprising in which 200,000 civilians died .
