berlin ( reuters ) - germany s pro-business free democrats ( fdp ) will have to accept smaller income tax cuts than they had previously wanted , their leader said on tuesday , signaling compromise in discussions with two other parties on forming a new government .
fdp leader christian lindner said his party would not be able to push for tax relief totaling 30-40 billion euros ( $ 35-46 billion ) and will instead seek to get the greens and the conservatives to accept an abolition of the solidarity tax introduced after reunification in 1990 to support poorer eastern states .
