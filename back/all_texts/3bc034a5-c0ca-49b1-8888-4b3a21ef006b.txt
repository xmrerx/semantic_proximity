Hunger strikes for the oppressed seem to be all the rage, both at home and abroad The refugee crisis has many faces.
Alongside the urgent need of many, there are also some who believe they can exploit this Culture of Welcoming to make shameless demands, said Christian Ragger who represents the Carinthia branch of the Freedom Party of Austria in the regional parliament.He is making reference to events currently underway in St. Kanzian.
On Tuesday 20 asylum seekers went on hunger strike because they were given residency permits, as the law provides for, and not passports, and because they are not receiving 2000 euros of pocket money each month.The most bizarre thing is that these striking asylum seekers also want to hold a press conference.
They apparently assume that related reports in the media will ensure their demands are met.
