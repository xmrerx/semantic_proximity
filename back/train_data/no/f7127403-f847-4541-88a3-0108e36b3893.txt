ankara ( reuters ) - turkish president tayyip erdogan will visit russia s sochi on november 13 , followed by a visit to kuwait the following day , his office said on monday .
the visit to sochi comes amid reports of potential sticking points in turkey s planned purchase of a russian s-400 surface-to-air missile system , and turkish objections to the attendance of syrian kurdish groups to a russian-sponsored syrian peace congress scheduled for nov. 18 .
last week , the two countries took a step toward the solution of an import crisis as russia lifted restrictions on import of turkish tomatoes .
