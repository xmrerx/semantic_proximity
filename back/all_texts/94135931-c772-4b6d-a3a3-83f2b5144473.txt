The Daily Show may finally have found a format in which the boastful, bragadocious word soup of Donald Trump actually makes sense: a hip hop video.One of the show s finest correspondents, Roy Wood Jr., plays Black Trump, in a video which takes Trump s own actual words, and forms them into a song called They Love Me.
To give you you an example of some of the lyrics, pulled straight from Trump speeches and tweets, here are some sample lyrics:I was down there at 7/11 Spent almost nothing on my run for president All the women flirted with me on The Apprentice If Ivanka weren t my daughter, then perhaps I d be dating herAll backed up by a solid hip hop beat and plenty of bling and crotch shots.Can you believe Ted Cruz who been killing our country?
Lyin Ted Cruz used a picture of Melania Careful Lyin Ted, I ll spill the beans on your woman I be watching Modern Family, written by a moron I never liked Bette Midler s persona (Told ya!)
I have black guys counting my money The one who can beat Hillary, I m not a Mitt Romney Remember I m the only candidate who s self-funding (Told ya!
)It s hard to ignore that Donald Trump really does makes a lot more sense as a Frat Bro hip hop wannabe, than as a presidential candidate.
As Roy Wood Jr., tells Daily Show host Trevor Noah: Everything Trump says is straight out of a rapper s play book.
He brags about his money, he s disrespectful to women, and there s always fights at his concerts.
In case anyone was wondering if the words actually come from Trump, Genius.com has painstakingly sourced every last one of Wood s lyrics, which you can play interactively here.
