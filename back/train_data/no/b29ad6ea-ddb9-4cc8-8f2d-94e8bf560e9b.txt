warsaw ( reuters ) - poland hopes turkey will eventually join the european union , polish president andrzej duda said on tuesday , days ahead of an eu summit which will discuss the frayed relations between brussels and ankara .
the eu , particularly heavyweight member germany , has become increasingly critical of turkey since president tayyip erdogan launched large-scale purges of state institutions , the military , the judiciary and academia after a failed coup in july 2016 .
poland has supported and ( also ) today supports turkey s eu accession efforts , duda told a joint news conference with erdogan during his visit to warsaw .
i hope turkey and the eu will continue on the same path ... leading to a full membership for turkey .
eu leaders will discuss the bloc s deteriorating ties with ankara on oct. 19 during a two-day summit .
turkey s 12-year-long accession talks , already dogged by disputes on a range of issues , have ground to a halt since the post-coup crackdown , in which more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 - including judges , journalists and soldiers - have been sacked or suspended .
within the eu , poland has traditionally been among the most staunch supporters of enlargement , including turkey s accession .
erdogan , speaking alongside duda , reiterated his criticism of the eu s accession policy , saying the bloc should announce the end of talks if it doesn t mean to accept turkey .
we won t bother you any further and you don t bother us , he said .
