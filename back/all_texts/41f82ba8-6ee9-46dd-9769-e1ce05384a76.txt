After Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump suffered a truly embarrassing second-place loss to rival Ted Cruz in Iowa, the internet was quick to humble the usually overly-confident front-runner.On Tuesday morning, the website Loser.com joined those trolling Trump by hilariously redirecting its domain name to Trump s Wikipedia page clearly rubbing it in considering Trump had been especially cocky about winning the Iowa caucus for several months.Trump s Wikipedia pageBrian Connelly has been the domain s owner since 1995 and has routinely been using it to mock whoever happens to deserve it based on current events in the news.
This particular redirect, as almost anyone with half a mind would agree, was certainly well-earned.Licking his wounds, Trump was also busy on the internet on Tuesday.
He went into recovery mode by spending his entire morning reaming and blaming voters for his loss in Iowa.
Shaming both voters and media alike, Trump tweeted: I don t believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one.
I will keep doing, but not worth it!
The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly.
Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history!
In all honesty, Trump s loss to Cruz was so much celebrated by the internet and social media, that one of Trump s own tweets from 2014 was repurposed for an entirely appropriate revival:Trump twitterAnd brilliantly enough, one other website has joined in the redirecting fun after the caucus: the website nobodyrememberswhocameinsecond.com is now leading people to a particularly unflattering YouTube video of Trump.This devastating loss in Iowa has definitely had an effect on Trump.
Now moving onto the New Hampshire primary, Trump s previously unshakeable confidence seems to be somewhat deflated.
Clearly missing half the ego he used to speak with, Trump said, I think we re going to be proclaiming victory, I hope.
