dublin ( reuters ) - non-eu norway called on brussels and london on wednesday to ensure that brexit does not disrupt its trade relations once britain leaves the european union .
norway has chosen to remain out of the eu but pays hundreds of millions of euros to access the single market as a member of the european economic area ( eea ) and is also in the european free trade area ( efta ) along with switzerland , iceland and liechtenstein .
to preserve the integrity of the single market , the eu-27 , the uk and efta should agree on legal arrangements to enter into at the same time that the eu-uk agreement is reached , marit berger roesland , norway s european affairs minister , said in a speech in dublin .
norway is concerned , among other things , about the fate of norwegians living in britain after brexit ; fisheries policy ; what kind of terms would be given to britain after brexit and whether britain would get preferential treatment over norway .
roesland told reuters that while oslo is not at the negotiating table , there was a good understanding of its position in london , and that it was now up to finding a technical solution .
if the eu and uk agree on withdrawal terms relevant to the single market , such as the rights of citizens , we need to find ways to extend these to the members of the eea , said roesland , who was appointed to the role last month .
likewise any transitional agreements that extend the application of the single market should also include the eea states .
otherwise we risk having a fragmented solution and that would be a great problem for norway .
