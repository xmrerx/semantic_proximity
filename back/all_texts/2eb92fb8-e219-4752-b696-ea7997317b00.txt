MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Sunday her cabinet fully backed her approach to Brexit, including Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.
Johnson, a leading campaigner to leave the European Union in last year s referendum, has set out a number of demands in recent weeks over how Britain should leave the bloc that go beyond May s plans.
What I have is a cabinet that is united in the mission of the government, May told BBC television.
Boris is absolutely behind the Florence speech and the line that we have taken, she said in reference to a speech she made in Italy last month about her approach to Brexit.
