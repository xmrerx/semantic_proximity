No challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change.
Obama State Of The Union speech, 2015There is a very good reason why the Left is now SHAMING anyone who doesn t believe in the phony science of global warming.
In what amounts to essentially a money laundering scheme, the campaigns of some of the most dishonest politicians in Washington are being funded by the business owners who are hand-selected by those crooked politicians to receive billions for global climate change initiatives.The liberal media machine has spent decades bulldozing anyone who tells you global warming is a sham.They even came up with a clever little title deniers.
Every time a heat wave hits, every time a picture of a lone polar bear gets taken .
.
.
the left pounds the table for environmental reform, more policy, more money to combat climate change.
But how much has the world really warmed?Their message is simple: Get on the man-made global warming bandwagon .
.
.
or you re just ignorant.But how much has the world really warmed?It s an important question, considering the U.S. government spends $22 billion a year to fight the global warming crisis (twice as much as it spends protecting our border).To put that in perspective, that is $41,856 every minute going to global warming initiatives.But that s just the tip of a gargantuan iceberg.According to Forbes columnist Larry Bell, the ripple effect of global warming initiatives actually costs Americans $1.75 trillion .
.
.
every year.That s three times larger than the entire U.S. federal budget deficit.So, has anyone stopped to ask .
.
.
how much has the globe actually warmed?Well, we asked, and what we found was striking.According to NASA s own data via Remote Sensing Systems(RSS), the world has warmed a mere .36 degrees Fahrenheit over the last 35 years (they started measuring the data in 1979).Hardly anything to panic about; however, that does mean the world is warmer, right?The problem with that argument is that we experienced the bulk of that warming between 1979 and 1998 .
.
.
since then, we ve actually had temperatures DROPPING!As can be seen in this chart, we haven t seen any global warming for 17 years.Weakening the global warming argument is data showing that the North Polar ice cap is increasing in size.
Recent satellite images from NASA actually reflect an increase of 43% to 63%.This is quite the opposite of what the global warming faction warned us.In 2007, while accepting his Nobel Prize for his global warming initiative, Al Gore made this striking prediction, The North Polar ice cap is falling off a cliff.
It could be completely gone in summer in as little as seven years.
Seven years from now.
Al Gore could not have been more wrong.However, despite this clear evidence that the temperatures are not increasing, the global warming hysteria only seems to be increasing.For example: President Obama himself tweeted on May 16, 2014: 97% of scientists agree: climate change is real, man-made and dangerous.
John Kerry, Al Gore, and a host of others have championed this statistic.Since then, it has become clear that this statistic was inaccurate.The Wall Street Journal went as far as to say, The assertion that 97% of scientists believe that climate change is a man-made, urgent problem is a fiction.
Forbes headlined Global Warming Alarmists Caught Doctoring 97% Consensus Claims.
Come to find out, the study President Obama was citing was botched from the start.A host of other problems for the global warming crowd are emerging, such as .
.
.Leaked emails from global warming scientists state that the Earth is not warming, such as this one from Kevin Trenberth that states, The fact is that we can t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty we can t. Claude Allegre, the founding father of the man-made global warming ethos, recently renounced his position that man has caused warming.Proof is emerging that Al Gore and even President Obama have financially benefited from fueling the global warming hysteria (click here for an internal report on this).It is becoming harder and harder for the global warming community to ignore some of the scientific data that show the Earth is not getting warmer .
.
.
instead, the world is getting cooler.Which makes one wonder why are we still spending $22 billion a year on global warming initiatives, and where is the money going?
Global warming has been kept on life support for another crucial reason: It has been a practical ATM for every in-the-know political figure.Al Gore, for example, has been one of the most vocally aggressive crusaders for global warming.
In 2001, before leaving office as vice president, Gore was worth less than $2 million.
Since then, he has grown his wealth to $100 million .
.
.
almost entirely by investing in a handful of green-tech companies .
.
.
14 of which received more than $2.5 billion in loans, grants, tax breaks, and more from the Obama administration.The Telegraph reports Al Gore could become the world s first carbon billionaire thanks to his investments in green companies .
.
.
all of which benefit from tax dollars and government loans to prevent global warming.
And he s not alone.You are likely familiar with the story of the failed Solyndra green energy initiative, which cost taxpayers $500 million; President Obama took a lot of flak for that.But here s a little-known side of the Solyndra story I bet you haven t heard: Obama, in essence, used taxpayer money to finance his re-election campaign .
.
.
by funneling it through Solyndra.You see, when Solyndra fell on hard times, it passed into the hands of two large private equity investors .
.
.
Goldman Sachs and George Kaiser.
When $500 million in taxpayer money was given to Solyndra, both Goldman Sachs and George Kaiser benefited.
Coincidentally, both have made contributions to Obama s election campaigns adding up to roughly $1.25 million.It doesn t stop there.In 2010, another federal loan of $400 million went Abound Solar.
That resulted in a bankruptcy as well.
But investors in Abound Solar seemed to do just fine .
.
.
investors like billionaire heiress Patricia Stryker.
Stryker has famously contributed $500,000 to the Coalition for Progress while throwing $85,000 toward Obama s inaugural committee.
It s just a coincidence that the government handed a company she invested in $400 million just before bankruptcy .
.
.
right?There s also A123 Systems, which paid one lobbying firm $970,000 to secure money from the government and received $279 million in federal assistance.
The CEO of A123 Systems went on to fund multiple Democratic senators and contributed to Obama s campaign.First Solar received $646 million in government loan guarantees, and has since contributed more than $180,000 to Democratic campaigns.GE is notorious for spending tens of millions of dollars a year to buy green energy credits for its wind turbines and other green technologies credits which helped the firm pay ZERO taxes in 2011.There are a host of other examples of liberals getting wealthy off global warming initiatives just like these.You can see why green energy is such a profitable business CEOs and executives get to rake in millions of dollars, while politicians get lucrative donations for their campaigns .
.
.
and scientists get all the funding they need to keep them going .
.
.
all on your dime.But here s the cherry on top .
.
.While $22 billion of our money is being redistributed every year to greedy scientists, politicians, and corporations .
.
.$22 billion is just what is spent on these global warming initiatives.The reality is, these initiatives have ripple effects .
.
.
mainly the regulations (from government agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency) that shackle free enterprise and force us to rely on foreign energy.According to Forbes, the total cost of these ripple effects is a staggering $1.75 trillion annually.I want you to really think about that for a moment.We re watching $1.75 trillion per year .
.
.
$3,329,528 per minute .
.
.
go to waste.It s worse when you note that the U.S. Energy Information Administration says these regulations could ultimately cause gasoline prices to rise 77% over baseline projections .
.
.
send 3 million Americans to the welfare line .
.
.
and reduce average household income by a whopping $4,000 each year.Washington knows all of this .
.
.
and is still barreling forward with its nonsense policies!They re just letting you foot the bill, while they pocket the benefits.
Climate change is no longer some far-off problem; it is happening here, it is happening now.
Fact is, organizations like the Environmental Protection Agency have handcuffed capitalism .
.
.
based on a theory even its staunchest supporters have already renounced.The result: reduced business, higher energy and food costs, higher taxes, lost jobs, and more money going overseas.For entire story: NewsMax
