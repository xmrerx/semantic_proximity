kabul ( reuters ) - a rocket attack on an afghan religious school killed about 20 taliban insurgents exchanging fire with security forces , officials said on friday , adding that no children were among the victims .
the insurgents had taken shelter at the school compound in the central eastern province of wardak , 35 km ( 20 miles ) southwest of the capital , kabul , when the air strike hit late on wednesday , the officials said .
international forces that conduct most of the air strikes across the country were not immediately available for comment .
abdul rahman mangal , a spokesman for the governor of wardak , said there were no civilian casualties , adding that all the pupils had gone home before the air strike .
foreign troops have stepped up air strikes in afghanistan in recent months as afghan forces struggle against a resilient taliban insurgency .
the taliban are seeking to reimpose strict islamic law after their 2001 ouster by u.s.-led troops .
