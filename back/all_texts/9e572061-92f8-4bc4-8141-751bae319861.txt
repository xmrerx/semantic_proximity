:TONIGHT S UPDATE IS BAD NEWS:Sen. John McCain, Arizona Republican, has been diagnosed with brain cancer, according to a statement released Wednesday evening by Mayo Clinic.
According to the office, the cancer was discovered after some surgery last week to remove a blood clot above his left eye.
Subsequent tissue pathology revealed that a primary brain tumor known as a glioblastoma was associated with the blood clot, the statement said.
The senator s overall health is fine and he is recovering from his surgery amazingly well, his office said.
The Senator and his family are reviewing further treatment options with the Mayo Clinic care team.
Treatment options may include a combination of chemotherapy and radiation.Many questions have been left unanswered, including whether McCain had symptoms that prompted doctors to look for the clot.
In June, his somewhat confused questioning of James B. Comey, the former F.B.I.
director, led to concerns about his mental status, which he later jokingly dismissed by saying he had stayed up too late watching baseball the night before.
