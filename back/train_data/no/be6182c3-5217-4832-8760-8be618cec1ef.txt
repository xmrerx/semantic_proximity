( reuters ) - melissa gilbert , best known for playing laura ingalls wilder in the 1970s television drama “ little house on the prairie , ” has dropped out of the race for a u.s. congressional seat in michigan for medical reasons .
gilbert , 52 , said continued problems from neck and back injuries from a 2012 accident forced her to give up her democratic candidacy for the republican-held seat .
“ while i have received the best treatment and therapy i could have asked for , those injuries have only gotten worse , ” gilbert said in a statement .
“ as much as it breaks my heart to say this , my doctors have told me i am physically unable to continue my run for congress. ” gilbert , who lives with her husband , actor timothy busfield , in howell , michigan , about 60 miles ( 100 km ) from detroit , has no political background but served two terms as president of the screen actors guild from 2001 to 2005 .
she is the author of three books , including “ prairie tale : a memoir , ” about her role in the show about a minnesota farm family in the 1870s and 1880s .
gilbert ’ s departure from the race improved the already strong odds that u.s. representative mike bishop , a republican , would win a second two-year term in the district , the detroit free press reported .
