leaked documents from george soros open society foundations reveal how soros works to defeat populist candidates and movements in europe.soros , a u.s. citizen , uses a network of nonprofits and partner organizations across europe to try and affect the outcomes of elections in foreign countries , the documents show.through advocacy efforts , education campaigns and media influencing projects , soros does his best to affect electoral outcomes around the globe in support of his open borders worldview.populist candidates opposed to mass immigration represent a direct threat to that worldview : the pm of hungary has called out soros on his mass migration effort : it is causing trouble that they are trying secretly and with foreign money to influence hungarian politics , orban said.osf sent $ 35,000 to the athena institute for the express purpose of analyzing and reporting the 2014 european elections and countering extremist and populist political voices in hungary .
another $ 49,930 went to the institute for european policy for naming and shaming populism in [ the european parliament ] election campaign in the czech republic , hungary and slovakia.another $ 27,049 was given to the public diplomacy council of catalonia for a workshop to influence leading journalists and media practitioners from europe to change their coverage to prevent populist , xenophobic and eurosceptic movements .
the stated aim of the workshop was to trigger a change of attitude amongst journalists and media practitioners so that they will report about the eu in a way that does not directly promote the cause of these movements .
an osf spokesperson said the organization has funded efforts to encourage voter participation and education , encourage policy innovation , and promote independent journalism to help make governments of all types more transparent and accountable to the people they serve .
open society foundations does not financially support candidates for public office .
osf may not financially support candidates for public office , but it is clear from the documents that osf did support organizations who opposed candidates who clash with the osf worldview.a $ 46,840 grant to the center for peace studies , for example , was meant to stimulate public support and election turnout among ambivalent voters in order to prevent the election of xenophobic , racist , and other radical political options representing croatia at the eu level .
supporting restrictions on immigration is typically synonymous with xenophobia in osf s internal documents.another $ 100,000 went to united for intercultural action to counter the election [ of european members of parliament ] from populist and far-right parties in europe .
according to the documents , united teamed up with the european network against racism ( enar ) and hope not hate to push back against populist candidates in all 28 member states of the eu , while particularly focusing on five countries : france , greece , hungary , italy , and the netherlands .
local groups in these five countries will be formed to organize meetings and door-to-door campaigns ahead of the ep elections to ( 1 ) encourage voters to register and vote ; and ( 2 ) to vote for non-extremist candidates , the documents state.netherlands , a separate osf document explained , was one of the five priority countries because of the rise of the far-right ppv party , lead by populist geert wilders.osf chose netherlands because polling showed ppv will have a very good result in the european parliament elections , and because it is one of the drivers of anti-european and anti-migration discourse in the eu .
another document , from two months before the 2014 ep elections , stated that osf s strategy in the netherlands varied depending on the success of wilders and ppv .
the outcome of the european parliament elections in may 2014 and how well the ppv , the populist party of geert wilders , does will help to determine [ osf s ] next steps in the netherlands , the document stated.in total , soros gave more than $ 6 million to 90 different partner organizations to influence the outcome of the 2014 european parliamentary elections.read more : daily caller
