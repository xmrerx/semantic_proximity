as the nation is embroiled in one scandal after another with donald trump , as the world now has first-hand knowledge of the buffoon who was chosen by the electoral college , there was a tiny sliver of a break .
on tuesday night , barack obama and justin trudeau had a candlelit dinner in montreal and all was right with the world , even if it was very short-lived.the couple of world leaders , that is discussed how to get the next generation involved in their communities , between heartfelt confessions of how much they missed each other ( probably ) .the most talked-about international date night of the modern diplomatic era had every romantic element the trudeau-obama fandom could ever dream of : an intimate restaurant booth , an abundance of gazes into each other s eyes , presumably some secret service right outside the door.source : cnnsocial media went completely nuts : obama and trudeau on a dinner date tonight in montreal .
