are we the mutation nation now ?
is this person the most qualified for the job or does he/she just fit the agenda to diversify the white house ? president obama has made equality for the lgbt community a priority of his administration , and advocates praised the president for diversifying his white house .
raffi freedman-gurspan , who formerly served as a policy advisor at the national center for transgender equality , has been hired as an outreach and recruitment director in the white house office of personnel .
i am elated that raffi freedman-gurspan will become the first openly transgender staff member at the white house .
president obama has long said he wants his administration to look like the american people .
i have understood this to include transgender americans , said mara keisling , executive director of the national center for transgender equality .
a transgender person was inevitably going to work in the white house .
that the first transgender appointee is a transgender woman of color is itself significant .
and that the first white house transgender appointee is of a friend is inspiring to me and to countless others who have been touched by raffi s advocacy .
