manila ( reuters ) - philippine troops on friday rescued three vietnamese sailors abducted by a group of islamist militants nine months ago in dangerous southern waters near the malaysian border , an army spokeswoman said .
seventeen vietnamese sailors were taken captive in the south of the philippines when pro-islamic state militants attacked commercial ships in the sulu and celebes seas , generating millions of dollars from ransom payments .
four vietnamese sailors were found on a remote island in tawi-tawi , but one was already dead from illness , captain jo-ann petinglay told reporters .
she said philippines marines were pursuing a small group of militants who had fled and abandoned the captives .
of the 17 vietnamese sailors abducted in february , 10 were rescued in earlier operations and two were killed by the militants while attempting to escape , she said .
the rest were brought to nearby jolo island , she added without elaborating .
the military said the militants , known for kidnapping , bombing and beheading captives , are still holding 16 captives on jolo island , including seven foreigners , including a dutch and a japanese national .
