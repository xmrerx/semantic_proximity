President Obama appeared at a campaign rally alongside Hillary Clinton, and just couldn t resist getting in a dig or two about our wannabe Tweeter-in-Chief (because really, he makes it so easy).
He said that generally, people don t understand the job that is being President of the United States, and then went into expert-marksman mode to hit Trump for his tweeting and lack of experience: Everybody can tweet, but nobody actually knows what it takes to do the job until you sit behind the desk.
I mean, Sasha tweets, but she doesn t think that she s thereby should be sitting behind the desk.
The implication is that his daughter, Sasha, is smarter than King Dunce because she knows tweeting is just tweeting.
King Dunce uses Twitter as a weapon, talking himself up and tearing down anybody he doesn t like with childish namecalling, complete ignorance, and outright lies.
What his tweeting does is actually show him for the fraud he is.Watch him hit Drumpf below, via ABC News:.
@POTUS takes shot at Donald Trump at Clinton rally: Everybody can tweet https://t.co/i2lNlfUQnT https://t.co/Lr5grwuuQz ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) July 5, 2016Obama also talked up Hillary s qualifications in that speech, explaining how he s come a very long way in how he sees her since the 2008 election cycle, when they were opponents.
She, likewise, praised Obama, saying she d been privileged to see him in so many different roles.
Then she took her own shot at the Dunce-in-Chief s birtherism and tweeting, saying: And Donald, if you are out there tweeting, it is Hawaii.
The snark is strong in these two.
Tweetle-Drumpf hasn t tweeted a response to this yet, but if he does, it will lack the sharp edge of experience and intelligence that Obama and Hillary display, even in their snarkiness.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
