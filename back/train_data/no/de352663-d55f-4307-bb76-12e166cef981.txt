tokyo ( reuters ) - a window fell from a u.s. helicopter onto a school sports field near a u.s. marines air base on okinawa on wednesday , the marines said , the latest in a series of accidents that have fanned safety concerns on japan s southern island .
japan s central government and okinawa authorities have been at odds for years over the futenma base .
residents complain about what they see as the unfair burden they carry in supporting the u.s. military presence in japan .
a 10-year-old boy suffered a minor injury but the exact cause was unclear , an okinawa prefecture official told reuters .
the boy was among about 50 children on the elementary school grounds when the window fell from a u.s. ch-53e transport helicopter .
japan s chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said : this sort of incident creates anxiety not only among those involved with the school but the people of okinawa and should never happen .
suga told a regular news conference that the government would respond appropriately after getting an explanation from u.s. officials .
the u.s. marines on okinawa said in a statement the helicopter had immediately returned and reported the incident .
we take this report extremely seriously and are investigating the cause of this incident in close coordination with local authorities , the statement said .
this is a regrettable incident and we apologize for any anxiety it has caused the community , it said .
the futenma base is surrounded by schools , hospitals and shops , and residents worry about air crashes .
crime committed by u.s. servicemen has also occasionally angered residents .
