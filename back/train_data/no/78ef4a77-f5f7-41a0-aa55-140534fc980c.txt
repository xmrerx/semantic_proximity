jared kushner is an orthodox jew working in a white house surrounded by neo-nazis , but he s also the son-in-law of donald trump , so principles be damned .
now , kushner is normally a reasonably handsome man , if you like the boyish white collar criminal type , but lately it seems , he s been channeling some of his father-in-law s worst qualities , including ( bizarrely ) his hair , which he s been wearing in that famous trump combover/swirl/whatever the hell that thing is.i think we re in big trouble now .
for some reason , jared kushner has started styling his hair like donald trump . ?

what if ivanka chose the style , because the weird fascination and inappropriate relationship is a 2 way street ? !

( @ sheilaginhb ) april 29 , 2017 @ mikesington @ gillyarcht the right-posterior oblique partline , combined with an anterior pushthrough , is classic emerging authoritarian .

( @ stillsheresists ) april 29 , 2017some see something a bit more calculated .
@ mikesington mimic the narcissist .
that is how you rise in power .
that is how you stay in power .
trump will notice & limp ego will get momentary rise .
snohomo ( @ snohomo ) april 29 , 2017it s entirely possible that kushner chose this new look to impress his father-in-law , although he was made the de facto president with his old hair , so he had clearly already made the right impression.more likely , this hairdo was trump s doing .
despite the fact that trump is a one man what not to wear ( ties too long , suits too big and that hair !
) , # 45 is obsessed with what everyone around him wears .
kushner s monstrosity reportedly came courtesy of trump s stylist which is located across the street from trump s new york residence .
it s not tough to imagine him telling kushner to get the trump .
on a subconscious level , though , this hair style speaks to more than just trying to suck up to the boss .
it s about a full makeover , which with kushner , includes his principles.featured image via win mcnamee/getty images
