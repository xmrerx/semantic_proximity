moscow ( reuters ) - russia s foreign ministry has summoned a u.s. diplomat in moscow to hand him a note of protest over plans to conduct searches in russia s trade mission complex in washington , which should soon be closed , the ministry said in a statement on saturday .
it said it has summoned anthony f. godfrey , a deputy chief of mission at the u.s. embassy in moscow .
the ministry called the planned illegal inspection of russian diplomatic housing an unprecedented aggressive action , which could be used by the u.s. special services for anti-russian provocations by the way of planting compromised items .
the closure by sept. 2 of the consulate and buildings in washington and new york that house russian trade missions is the latest in tit-for-tat actions by the two countries that have helped push relations to a new post-cold war low .
the kremlin has said the moves to close the russian facilities pushed bilateral ties further into a dead end .
on friday , the russian foreign ministry also said the u.s. special services were prepared for searches in its consulate in san francisco .
some media reported that a smoke was billowing from a chimney of the building .
maria zakharova , the spokeswoman for the ministry , said it was part of a mothballing .
in relation to this , the windows could be closed , the light could be turned off , the water could be drained out , the heating appliances could be turned off , the garbage could be thrown away , essential services could be turned off and many other things , she wrote on social media .
moscow last month ordered the united states to cut its diplomatic and technical staff in russia by more than half , to 455 people to match the number of russian diplomats in the united states , after congress overwhelmingly approved new sanctions against russia .
