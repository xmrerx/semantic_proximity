It s not shocking that Hillary s lying again, but it s probably not such a good idea to start out the investigation by lying to the public about it Hillary Clinton is fond of downplaying the gravity of the FBI s investigation into her private email server by calling it a security review, but that s a term that has no meaning to FBI director James Comey.Talking to reporters during a meeting at FBI headquarters on Wednesday, Comey said that the term security inquiry does not register with him and that agents are conducting an investigation.
It s in our name.
I m not familiar with the term security inquiry, Comey said, according to Politico s Josh Gerstein.Clinton has refused to use the term investigation to describe the probe, which is looking at whether classified information was mishandled on her private email server.
She refers to it in interviews as a security review, as do her campaign team and surrogates.
