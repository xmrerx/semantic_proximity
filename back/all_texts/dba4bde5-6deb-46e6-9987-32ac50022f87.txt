Rep. Maxine Waters is taking a page right out of Donald Trump s playbook and turning it into a piece of political art.
Since Trump took office, Waters has been among Trump s biggest critics.
Most, though, have tempered their rhetoric about the Putin Puppet in Chief, but not Waters.
Like Trump, she refuses to be politically correct.
Only unlike Trump, she s really good at it.On Wednesday, Waters took to Twitter after it was revealed that former FBI Director James Comey didn t want to be alone with Donald Trump.
Waters understood.
She tweeted:So Comey told Jeff Sessions he didn t want to be alone with Trump.
Women across the country can relate.So Comey told Jeff Sessions he didn t want to be alone with Trump.
Women across the country can relate.
