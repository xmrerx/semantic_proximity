copenhagen ( reuters ) - denmark s right-wing government secured backing from a junior partner for the 2018 budget on tuesday , defusing a crisis that had threatened to bring down the minority coalition .
the liberal alliance ( la ) , part of the three-way coalition led by prime minister lokke rasmussen s liberals , said it would support the budget in parliament and agreed to postpone the negotiations on tax and immigration reforms it wants until january .
the anti-immigrant danish people s party ( df ) , whose support the government needs to pass laws , gave its backing on dec. 8 for the 2018 budget , but the la had said it still wanted an agreement on tax cuts .
i am willing to make another attempt to secure an ambitious tax reform and a new modern immigration policy , foreign minister and liberal alliance leader anders samuelsen said at a press conference .
the budget will be passed at a parliament vote on friday , he said .
failure to secure backing from la could have forced rasmussen either to hand power to the social democrat-led opposition or call a snap election .
tax cuts have been on the right-leaning government s wish list for a long time , but pro-welfare df has been less eager to back that part of the government s policies .
the 2018 budget deal includes among other things increased spending on health and elderly care and on infrastructure .
