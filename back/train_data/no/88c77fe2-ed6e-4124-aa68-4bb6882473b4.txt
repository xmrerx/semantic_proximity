brasilia ( reuters ) - billionaire joesley batista , one of the owners of jbs sa , the world s largest meatpacker , and executive ricardo saud surrendered on sunday and were arrested by brazilian police , their lawyer said .
batista and saud went to federal police headquarters in sao paulo on sunday afternoon and will be transferred to brasilia on monday , their lawyer , pierpaolo bottini , said .
the arrests were ordered by supreme court justice edson fachin , who agreed to a request by brazilian prosecutor-general rodrigo janot .
the court revoked immunity from prosecution under previous plea deals struck by batista and saud , a former director of holding company j & f investimentos .
in his decision ordering both arrested for at least five days , fachin wrote the state witnesses were selective and did not present all information related to crimes they confessed to in their plea deals .
janot sought the arrests after batista and saud recorded themselves discussing crimes not covered in the plea bargain .
the taped conversation , made public by the supreme court , was inadvertently submitted to prosecutors with unrelated material last week .
in a statement on sunday , j & f lawyers said both men did not lie nor omitted information in their plea deals .
the supreme court justice denied a request for the arrest of former prosecutor marcelo miller , who was accused by the prosecutor-general of helping wesley and joesley batista with their plea deal before leaving the prosecutor s office in april to a private law firm .
