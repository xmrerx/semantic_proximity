It s probably not very controversial to say that Donald Trump has an image problem.
Sure, the Republican base turn up to his rallies to be turned on by his xenophobia, but his electability in a general election is an entirely different matter.
In some of the latest polls done on Trump s favorability, the Republican front-runner is the most hated politician since post-Watergate Richard Nixon.
When it comes to Trump, most of the country falls somewhere between actively loathe and hate with a passion.
This is due, in large part, to the fact that the very stuff that helps him in the primaries anti-immigrant bashing, open bigotry, violence against minorities at his rallies repulse everyone else.
In short, if you aren t the guy literally dressed as a wall at a Trump rally, you probably hate him.This guy attended a recent Trump rally dressed "as the wall" pic.twitter.com/AaF9TfBFSC Pigeon Today (@PigeonToday) April 15, 2016To address this glaring problem, Trump s campaign has been quietly pivoting from Our candidate, the bigot to a supposedly softer tone that presents Trump as more presidential.
In a recording made to a group of Republican insiders, Trump s campaign manager Paul Manafort said Trump s part would be evolving.The part he s been playing is evolving into the part of that you ve been expecting but he wasn t ready for it because he had the first phase.
You ll start to see more depth to the person, the real person.
You ll see him in a different way.Are you buying that?
Singer and firebrand Cher sure wasn t. On Twitter, she gave Trump and his changing tone the brutal beatdown it deserved.TRUMP JUST SAID,ALL THESE MONTHS HES BEEN ACTING,PLAYING A PART 2APPEAL 2A BASE THAT HES BEEN TRICKING?IS HE GOING 2 PRETEND 2B HUMAN NOW?
Cher (@cher) April 21, 2016Trump Says he's BEEN "ACTING"In Front Of His Followers.He Couldn't Have Gotten SO MANY PPL AT RALLIES,IF HIS PPL KNEW WHO HE REALLY WAS Cher (@cher) April 21, 2016WONDER IF TRUMPSUPPORTERS KNOW YET, THAT HE WAS ONLY "ACTING"AT HIS RALLIES HE KNEW JUST HOW 2 SUCK EM IN?
"THE ART OF THE DOUBLE DEAL" Cher (@cher) April 22, 2016Cher emojis and all brings up an inconvenient truth for Trump s followers.
The man they adore is either pandering to their racism because he knows it will get them going, or he is lying now about ever changing.
Neither option is a good one.
Both suggest Trump is a manipulator and untrustworthy.The singer also seems to think Trump s real image isn t the presidential, mature one his campaign is now suggesting.
She has a little reminder.Trump?says past monthsWe're just PART he was playing,projecting FAKE image.He REALLY LOVES WOMEN&"BLACKS"?HE WAS 1ST BIRTHER&MUSLIM OBAMA Cher (@cher) April 23, 2016The Trump who once said he would spend almost any amount of money to prove President Obama was a Kenyan Muslim, now wants us to believe he is really a mature, intelligent guy.
It may just work on his supporters, but the rest of the country?
