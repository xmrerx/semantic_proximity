kigali ( reuters ) - rwandan authorities have charged a critic of president paul kagame with inciting insurrection and forgery after she was barred from challenging him in august elections , the public prosecutor s spokesman said on wednesday .
diane shima rwigara , a 35-year-old accountant , has repeatedly accused kagame of stifling dissent and criticized his rwandan patriotic front s near total hold on power since it fought its way to power to end a genocide in 1994 .
kagame won the august election with 98.8 percent of the vote .
rwigara s mother adeline and sister anne have also been charged with incitement and discrimination and sectarianism , prosecutor s spokesman faustin nkusi told reuters .
he said the cases were filed in court on tuesday and awaited a trial date .
the three women have been in detention for around two weeks .
they were first taken from their home in the rwandan capital on aug. 30 on tax evasion allegations related to the family s tobacco company .
that charge was not listed in those filed on tuesday .
kagame won international praise for restoring stability in rwanda and presiding over a rapid economic recovery after the genocide , in which an estimated 800,000 ethnic tutsis and politically moderate ethnic hutus were killed .
but human rights groups say he has muzzled independent media and suppressed potential democratic opponents .
some critics of the government have been imprisoned or killed .
electoral authorities barred rwigara from standing in august , saying she had not submitted enough supporters signatures and some of the names she did sent in belonged to dead people .
rwigara s brother aristide , who lives in the united states , said the charges against the three women are politically motivated and intended to punish the family for her attempted presidential bid .
he was not reachable for comment on wednesday .
nkusi said the charges were not related to politics .
