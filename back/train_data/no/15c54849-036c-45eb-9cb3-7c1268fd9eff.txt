tokyo ( reuters ) - japanese foreign minister taro kono said on wednesday that any attempt to revise tokyo s 2015 agreement with south korea over comfort women forced to work in japan s wartime military brothels would be unacceptable and make relations unmanageable .
kono s comment comes after his south korean counterpart , kang kyung-wha , said the agreement failed to meet the needs of victims and apologized for the controversial deal .
the japan-south korea agreement is an agreement between the two governments and one that has been highly appreciated by international society , kono said in a written statement .
if the south korean government ... tried to revise the agreement that is already being implemented , that would make japan s ties with south korea unmanageable and it would be unacceptable .
