On Friday night s episode of HBO s Real Time, host Bill Maher responded to guest Sen. Ben Sasse s question, Would you like to come work in the field with us?
with the N-word.
This man is beyond disgusting in his past comments but THIS is the absolute worst.
He responded to the audience groans by saying it was a joke .
So this jackwagon jokes at the expense of those in the black community Shame on him!
He s in the same boat with Kathy Griffin when he makes a joke at the expense of others.REMEMBER WHEN MAHER MOCKED ANN COULTER FOR SUPPORTING TRUMP?They laughed at us when we said @realDonaldTrump would win This morning they're too devastated to get out of bed.#MAGA #TrumpTrain pic.twitter.com/A0xApdid7K Harlan Z. Hill (@Harlan) November 9, 2016Let s hope Bill Maher is treated just as any other person in entertainment has been treated if they go down this path.
The left has a double standard when it comes to this so we doubt anything will happen to punish Maher for his racist comment on live TV.
