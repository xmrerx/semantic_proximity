beirut ( reuters ) - france should not interfere in iran s missile program , ali akbar velayati , a senior adviser to iran s supreme leader , said on saturday according to state media .
french president emmanuel macron said on friday that tehran should be less aggressive in the region and should clarify the strategy around its ballistic missile program .
it does not benefit mr. macron and france to interfere on the missile issue and the strategic affairs of the islamic republic , which we have great sensitivities about , velayati said .
what does this issue have to do with mr. macron ?
who is he at all to interfere ?
if he wants relations between iran and france to grow then he should try not to interfere in these issues .
u.s. president donald trump has said iranian missile activity should be curbed .
iranian officials have repeatedly said the islamic republic s missile program is for defense purposes and is not up for negotiation .
the program was not part of the 2015 nuclear deal with western powers under which iran agreed to curb its nuclear program in exchange for the lifting of some sanctions .
france said on wednesday it wanted an uncompromising dialogue with iran about its ballistic missile program and a possible negotiation over the issue separate from tehran s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers .
