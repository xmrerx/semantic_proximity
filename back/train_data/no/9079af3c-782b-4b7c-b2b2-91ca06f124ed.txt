in typical obama fashion , the extravagant tax-payer funded nordic state dinner looked more like an after-party for the academy awards than a state function .
how is anyone supposed to take this ass-clown seriously when he has turned our white house into a playground for the who s who in the hollywood communist party ?
but then again , nothing obama does is for the good of our country , it always has been , and will continue to be , all about him until he and his sorry excuse for a family exit the white house .
i m sure the sight of pop singer demi lovato and comedian aziz ansar with nordic leaders at the white house left putin shaking in his boots president obama and the first lady have welcomed five nordic leaders to the white house for a lavish state dinner after earlier putting on a show of unity against vladimir putin s recent military aggression in the baltics.the obamas first welcomed icelandic prime minister sigurdur ingi johannsson who has only been in charge of his country for a month and his wife ingibjorg elsa ingjaldsdottir as they arrived at the north portico of the white house.they were swiftly followed by the prime ministers of sweden , finland , denmark and norway , who were also invited to the unusual if a little crowded meeting.the dinner will send a strong statement to russia , who the five heads of state earlier slammed for its military buildup including the buzzing of a u.s. warship near kaliningrad as they called for economic sanctions against moscow to be maintained.here s a peak into the academy awards after party nordic state dinner .
true to our divisive president s nature , there wasn t a single republican invited to the affair.more than 300 guests including actor will ferrell , david letterman and former nba star alonzo mourning were invited to the dinner.ferrell , who attended the dinner with his swedish wife , vivica paulin , said it was his first time at the white house .
i hope we don t do anything wrong , he joked.also expected are girls actress allison williams , scandal star bellamy young , singer janelle monae and former victoria s secret model miranda kerr , as well as a smattering of nordic celebrities .
several democratic lawmakers were on the guest list , but no republicans a possible sign that obama s efforts to win over his political rivals are waning as the end of his presidency nears.via : daily mail
