senator elizabeth warren took to twitter to cheer the failure of the republicans first attempt at replacing the disastrous obamacare .
she went on to lie to her followers saying she wasn t doing a touchdown dance as long as the gop is still hell-bent on rigging the system for the rich and powerful .
but i 'm not doing a touchdown dance today .
not when the gop is still hell-bent on rigging the system for the rich & powerful .
