A Republican candidate for a U.S. House seat is under fire from a police union after she made incendiary remarks about pointing guns at police officers and possibly shooting them.Nevada Assemblywoman Michele Fiore is on the receiving end of a rebuke from the largest police union in that state.Nevada s largest police union has come out against Assemblywoman Michele Fiore (R) for her recent suggestion that citizens can take aim at law enforcement officers so long as police point their weapons first.
Ms. Fiore, we no longer see you as a passionate advocate for your Second Amendment rights, which we support, Nevada Association of Public Safety Officers Executive Director Rick McCann wrote in a letter to her office.
Rather, these comments were utterly irresponsible, an embarrassment to your District and our State, and they continue to demonstrate why you are unqualified to hold the position of United States Congresswoman.
The comments that enraged the union came in an interview with a local TV station, where Fiore said, Whether you re a stranger, a bad guy, or an officer, and you point your gun at me and you re gonna shoot me and I have to decide whether it s my life or your life, I choose my life.
Fiore has a long history of these types of comments.
She described the Bureau of Land Management as the bureaucrat agency of terrorism, and was involved in negotiating the surrender of the domestic terrorists in the Bundy rancher family who illegally occupied a federal facility earlier in the year.Fiore is so into guns that she released a 2nd Amendment calendar, featuring her in numerous glamour photos while also toting a gun, juxtaposed with quotes from Abraham Lincoln and racist rock star and NRA board member Ted Nugent.She writes on the back cover, The main purpose of this calendar is to focus on the many positive aspects that firearms can play in our lives.
