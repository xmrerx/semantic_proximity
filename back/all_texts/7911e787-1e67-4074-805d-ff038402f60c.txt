Earlier today, Donald Trump whined about being held to a ridiculous standard in his first 100 days as POTUS, despite spending two years bragging about all the things he would get done in his first 100 days.
By now most of us know that Trump has hardly accomplished anything during his first several weeks in the White House, and there have been far more failures than successes.Now, the White House is joining in on the mounting pressure for Trump to actually do something before his first 100 days come to an end.
The Trump administration is now bending over backwards to make it seem as if Trump s presidency isn t the massive failure we all know it is and of course they had to lie to make that possible.The White House has just claimed that Congress is going to vote on healthcare and tax reform next week, and that the government will be open despite the fact that the Republicans don t have any votes lined up and Congress will only be in session for half the week.
According to CNBC: The White House hopes language on a possible health-care deal can come as early as Friday or Saturday, leaving the potential for an agreement next week, a White House official told CNBC.
The Senate Budget Committee is assisting with the draft, which would be introduced first in the House.
This is absolutely insane, and clearly a response to the fact that Trump hasn t accomplished anything in his first 100 days and the Trump administration is desperate to have something to show for it.
In just 4 days, Trump expects the House to vote on health care, examine Trump s tax plan, and keep the government open just so he can have at least one win.
That s not going to happen, and the American people know it.
