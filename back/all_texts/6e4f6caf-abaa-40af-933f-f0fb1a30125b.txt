Ben Carson says he s still ironing out his role in the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump, but one thing s certain: He ll have a role in helping craft the replacement plan for Obamacare.
I think the replacement obviously must come first and it must be something that is very appealing and easy to understand.
And then, only then, would you dismantle what s in place, the retired neurosurgeon said in an interview.Asked if he intends to be involved in designing that plan, Carson said, Yes, of course.
Watch Dr. Carson explain his role in helping to reshape a health care policy for Americans:https://youtu.be/tdPM7HKkjBICarson, who ran against Trump in the Republican presidential primary, burst onto the national scene in 2013 when he rebuked Barack Obama s health care law at the National Prayer breakfast, while the president sat a few feet away.
He declined to say whether he was in line for a Cabinet role such as secretary of health and human services, or a broader advisory role.Trump ran his campaign on a pledge to replace Obamacare with a simpler and less expensive plan.
But he s provided no details on what that plan would look like or how he d handle the millions of people who have obtained insurance under the law.
But the election of a Republican Congress ensures that he ll have the best chance since Obamacare passed in 2010 to make that campaign pledge a reality.
