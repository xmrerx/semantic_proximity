Wow that s gonna leave a mark!When she s not being arrested for defacing public property, she s actually kinda funny!Jill Stein is no stranger to breaking the law.
She currently has a warrant for out for arrest.
A North Dakota Judge is charging her with criminal trespass and mischief during protest against a pipeline project on September 1st.The bottom line is, she may be a bit of a fruitcake and a rabble rouser, but she wasn t far off with her evaluation of Hillary s rallies LOL!
