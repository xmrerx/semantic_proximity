WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House Intelligence Committee’s top Democrat on Thursday accused panel chairman Devin Nunes of violating his recusal from its Russia probe by issuing three subpoenas to U.S. security and other officials.
“Commitments to recuse himself have not been fully honored,” Adam Schiff said in an interview with MSNBC.
Schiff added that he and Republican Representative Michael Conaway, the top Republican now leading the panel’s probe into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, would not be distracted from their investigation.
