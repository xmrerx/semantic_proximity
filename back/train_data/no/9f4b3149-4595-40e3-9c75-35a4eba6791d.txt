ottawa ( reuters ) - u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson plans to meet canadian prime minister justin trudeau next week for talks on how to address the crisis over north korea s nuclear weapons program , an ottawa source said on monday .
canada and the united states are due to co-host a meeting of foreign ministers in vancouver in january to discuss north korea .
north korea has fired missiles over japan as it pursues nuclear weapons and ballistic missiles in defiance of u.n. sanctions .
last week it said u.s. and south korean military drills meant the outbreak of war was an established fact .
during a day trip to ottawa on dec. 19 tillerson will also meet foreign minister chrystia freeland , said the source , who requested anonymity because the meetings have not yet been formally announced .
a canadian government source confirmed that tillerson and trudeau plan to meet but declined to give a precise date , saying scheduling issues still had to be worked out .
the u.s. embassy in ottawa declined to comment .
freeland said last month that the vancouver talks would show the unity of the international community in applying pressure on pyongyang .
