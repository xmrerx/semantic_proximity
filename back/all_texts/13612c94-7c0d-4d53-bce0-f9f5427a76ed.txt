If Obama had a communist friend he d be this poor victim Raul Castro the champion of human rights and justice What a dog and pony show.Cuban leader Raul Castro used his first speech before the United Nations General Assembly to lash out at the international body, saying Monday that member states have failed to produce much beyond an illusion of the human rights, justice and development promised in the charter.Castro made scant mention of last summer s landmark restoration of ties with the United States after a five-decade break, instead delivering a searing indictment of world superpowers for allowing millions to remain hungry, illiterate and at risk of death by curable illnesses while annual military expenses worldwide amount to more than $1.7 trillion.
Barely a fraction of that figure could resolve the most pressing problems afflicting humanity, Castro said.Castro received warm applause and scattered cheers when he made his U.N. debut, and several Latin American and African leaders gave him a standing ovation at the end of his remarks, in apparent approval of his narrative that Western colonialism and imperialism are at the roots of today s conflicts.
He didn t name names, but his allusions to the United States and its allies were clear as he criticized invasions and overthrows, the selective and discriminatory approach to human rights, and the threat of climate change stemming from an irrational and unsustainable consumerism.
There have constantly been wars of aggression and interference in the internal affairs of the states, the ousting of sovereign governments by force, the so-called soft coups and the recolonization of territories, Castro said.Via: McClatchyDC
