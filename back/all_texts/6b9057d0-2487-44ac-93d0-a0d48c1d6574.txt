Fox News is now part of the lamestream media as far as Sarah Palin is concerned, and that s not the only shot she fired at the conservative network.On Saturday, Palin responded to reports that she had dropped out of an appearance at the Wyoming Primary in support of Trump, who went on to lose all of the delegates in the state.
No, despite reports, I didn t drop out of anything in Wyoming s GOP Primary today, Palin wrote on her Facebook page.
I wasn t scheduled to be there, which can be verified by the Trump Campaign and our email exchanges from EIGHT DAYS AGO where it was agreed a trip to Wyoming wouldn t fit in with my prior obligations to work in DC and Nevada this weekend.
Not satisfied with just accusing the media of issuing false reports, she threw an absolute temper tantrum to the point where she actually stated that she wants to put the media over her knee and spank them.But the most interesting part of Palin s rant came in the third paragraph when she threw Fox News under the bus and confirmed what we all already knew: that Fox News does not seek out the facts before reporting stories.Too bad reporters don t bother to seek facts before spewing their bull.
(Here s to you even, Fox News.)
I ve never had a PR team to correct the record for me, so within reason I try to keep up with constant misreporting but it s impossible to do when I have a life and don t waste precious time perusing press clippings.Here s the full post via Facebook:As you ll recall, Sarah Palin was once employed by Fox News before they gave her the ax, only for her to return and then leave the position herself.
Fox News and Sarah Palin have clearly not always been on good terms but it definitely looks like the GOP civil war now includes a newly sparked battle between America s village idiot and the propaganda arm of the Republican Party.
Now we just need to grab our popcorn and wait for Fox News to respond.Featured Image: Flickr
