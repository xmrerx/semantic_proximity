havana ( reuters ) - venezuelan president nicolas maduro arrived in cuba on thursday evening in a surprise visit to bring a donation of goods after hurricane irma wreaked havoc on the caribbean island , state-run media there said on friday .
cuban president raul castro received maduro at the havana airport , state-run television showed .
the two countries are close ideological and strategic allies against what they call u.s. imperialism .
this aid will contribute to making up for the damage caused by hurricane irma , state-run radio station radio reloj said .
cuba and venezuela became strategic allies in 2000 with the rise to power of socialist hugo chavez in the south american country , which holds the world s largest oil reserves but is undergoing a major economic crisis .
an agreement to exchange oil for medical and other technical services underlies their economic relationship and continues despite a drop in oil deliveries by venezuela and payments to cuba for services .
millions in venezuela are suffering from food shortages and soaring inflation .
