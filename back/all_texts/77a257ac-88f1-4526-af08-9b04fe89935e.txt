There s really no better person to roast Sarah Palin than Bill Maher, and he most definitely didn t disappoint on Friday s edition of his HBO show.
After the failed vice presidential candidate and half-term governor of Alaska endorsed Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump this past week, it s been pretty much nonstop coverage of her idiocy.
After all, the woman showed up, dressed in wind chimes, and was clearly either drunk or overly caffeinated.
Any way you put it, no one put it better than Maher when he stated: Trump and Gump.
Fatman and Little Brain it was really something.
Did you happen to see any of her speech?
Oh my God.
It was like a crazy drunk bridesmaid grabbed the mic at a wedding reception.
This woman has a thousand stupid clich s in her head, and when she opens her mouth, it s like they re all escaping a nightclub fire.
He then showed a clip of all her craziness during the endorsement, and said: You cannot put into words how much she cannot put something into words.
Maher also brought up Palin blaming her son s domestic violence on Obama somehow not respecting the troops, saying: and that s what makes the Republican party the party of personal responsibility If Obama would just secure the borders, maybe Bristol would stop getting knocked up all the time.
And that s really the truth of all of it.
Sarah Palin wants to pretend that she s some high and mighty person, somehow morally superior to others, but the truth of the matter is, her son beats up women, and her daughter needs to learn where the condom aisle is.
Palin is a walking and talking joke, and the sooner she realizes this the better.Kudos to Bill Maher for utterly annihilating Palin and her craziness.
