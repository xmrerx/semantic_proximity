london ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump would effectively be making a declaration of war if he recognizes jerusalem as israel s capital , the palestinians chief representative to britain said on wednesday .
if he says what he is intending to say about jerusalem being the capital of israel , it means a kiss of death to the two state solution , manuel hassassian said in a bbc radio interview .
he is declaring war in the middle east , he is declaring war against 1.5 billion muslims ( and ) hundreds of millions of christians that are not going to accept the holy shrines to be totally under the hegemony of israel , hassassian added .
senior u.s. officials said on tuesday that trump will recognize jerusalem as israel s capital on wednesday and set in motion the relocation of the u.s. embassy to the city .
