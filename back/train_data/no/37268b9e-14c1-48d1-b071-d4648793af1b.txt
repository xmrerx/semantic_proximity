what a bunch of unbelievable traitors we have in this white house kerry can t be that naive or dumb to iran s evil .
the more he opens his mouth , the more i question his motives.secretary of state john kerry told nbc s chuck todd that the arms and the missiles were thrown in as an add-on to this nuclear agreement .
so this [ deal ] focused on getting rid of the principal problem in the region , which is iran s threat to israel , their threat to the region , to have a nuclear capacity , kerry said defending the deal .
we believe with this , for years into the future , we have this incredible capacity to have access , to have inspections , to hold them accountable .
and by the way , even though the arms and the missiles , they were thrown in as an add-on to this nuclear agreement .
it was always contemplated if iran did come and deal on the nuclear program , that was going to be lifted .
