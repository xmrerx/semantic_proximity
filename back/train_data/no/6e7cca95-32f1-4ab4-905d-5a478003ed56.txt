jake tapper gave an oscar-worthy performance with his fake concern for most americans who he claims are thinking president trump is unfit for office .
he jumped on comments made by sen. bob corker last week , when corker suggested that he doubted trump s stability and competence .
the left is thrilled with this idiotic comment from corker tapper and the dems will ride this narrative for as long as they can ! tapper announced : according to a new quinnipiac university poll released this afternoon , voters overwhelmingly saying president trump is not level-headed , 68 percent to 29 percent .
voters saying president trump does not provide the u.s. with moral leadership , 62 to 35 percent .
that he s not honest , 61 to 36 percent .
voters believe by a two to one margin that president trump is doing more to divide the country than to unite it , 62 to 31 percent .
nearly six in 10 voters say president trump s decisions and behavior have encouraged white supremacist groups .
now president trump is a man who looks to numbers and to ratings .
these numbers , sir , these numbers are disastrous .
tapper concluded with his effort to speak for the majority of americans according to some poll : you are no doubt pleasing your base , but your behavior is causing great concern among the majority of the american people .
