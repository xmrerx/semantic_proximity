WHEN YOU AGREE WITH LIZ WARREN YOU KNOW SOMETHING S WRONG!Democrat Sens.
Joe Manchin (WV) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) went to the Senate floor to push for immediate consideration of a bill that would make the Obamatrade text public.
Currently, Congress has to go to a secured room to review the text and can t take notes out or discuss what is in it with the public.
The motion to make the text public failed when Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT)objected.Manchin and Warren even praised President George W. Bush, who released his free trade text in 2001.
President Obama, who promised to have the most transparent administration in history, is not releasing his trade deal text.
We re just asking for some transparency before we have this crucial vote, said Warren.
She said people have heard a lot about the trade bill, but haven t seen it.
The press hasn t seen it, neither have economists or legal experts because the administration is making it impossible for any of those people to read it.
We should keep the deal secret because if the details were made public now, the public would oppose it, mocked Warren.
Well, that s not how our democracy is supposed to work.
Warren went on to introduce her legislation with Manchin in order to make the bill public and transparent.
This bill would require the president to publically release the scrubbed bracketed text of a trade deal at least 60 days before Congress votes on any fast-track for that deal.
That would give the public, the experts, the press an opportunity to review the deal.
It would allow for some honest pubic debate, Warren said.Via: Breitbart
