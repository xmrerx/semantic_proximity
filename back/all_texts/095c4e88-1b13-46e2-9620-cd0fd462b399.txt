PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday that it would look for an opportunity to reschedule President Donald Trump’s meeting with Mexico’s president after Enrique Pena Nieto canceled a visit next week.
“We will look for a date to schedule something in the future.
We will keep the lines of communication open,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer said.
