brasilia ( reuters ) - congressmen from brazil s social democratic party ( psd ) on wednesday invited finance minister henrique meirelles to run for president in 2018 , growing the list of potential contenders from within president michel temer s fragmented coalition .
meirelles , after meeting with psd lawmakers at his house in brasilia , wrote on twitter that he felt honored but was not a candidate .
the psd leader in the lower house of congress , marcos montes , nevertheless said meirelles received the invitation with enthusiasm but would not respond immediately .
reuters reported late in august , citing a source close to meirelles , that he wanted to run for president on the psd ticket , but knew he would have a strong chance only if the economy improved substantially .
meirelles , in his twitter post , said that he was focusing his energies on helping brazil obtain sustainable growth after emerging from its worst recorded recession .
under brazilian rules , ministers who wish to run in the october 2018 election will need to leave their posts by april , although a formal register would only happen in august .
other potential contenders being floated by ruling parties include sao paulo state governor geraldo alckmin and sao paulo city mayor jo o doria jr. , both from the psdb party .
a civil engineer by training , meirelles is the former chairman of now defunct bankboston corp and former president of brazil s central bank .
