nothing shady here , huh ?
unbelievable ! even by the standards of arms deals between the united states and saudi arabia , this one was enormous .
a consortium of american defense contractors led by boeing would deliver $ 29 billion worth of advanced fighter jets to the united states oil-rich ally in the middle east.israeli officials were agitated , reportedly complaining to the obama administration that this substantial enhancement to saudi air power risked disrupting the region s fragile balance of power .
the deal appeared to collide with the state department s documented concerns about the repressive policies of the saudi royal family.but now , in late 2011 , hillary clinton s state department was formally clearing the sale , asserting that it was in the national interest .
at a press conference in washington to announce the department s approval , an assistant secretary of state , andrew shapiro , declared that the deal had been a top priority for clinton personally .
shapiro , a longtime aide to clinton since her senate days , added that the u.s. air force and u.s. army have excellent relationships in saudi arabia .
these were not the only relationships bridging leaders of the two nations .
in the years before hillary clinton became secretary of state , the kingdom of saudi arabia contributed at least $ 10 million to the clinton foundation , the philanthropic enterprise she has overseen with her husband , former president bill clinton .
just two months before the deal was finalized , boeing the defense contractor that manufactures one of the fighter jets the saudis were especially keen to acquire , the f-15 contributed $ 900,000 to the clinton foundation , according to a company press release.via : ibt
