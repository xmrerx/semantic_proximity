discussion in america has been officially hijacked by the unhinged left and is supported by radicals with deep pockets we know you re thinking george soros but there are more men with tons of money to support this effort to fundamentally change america .
tom stayer , john posesta , seiu , jimmy dahman and others are all trying to hijack free speech by dominating and shutting down discussion at town halls across america .
this is a serious effort to undermine america with tactics that are planned out in advance with a manual full of how to s. it s a recipe for the overthrow of our way of life .
but will it backfire on these democrats ?
do you think this will change the minds of the voters or just make them angrier at the radical dem agenda ?
their tactics are truly unamerican and they come off as jackasses we think this means more votes for republicans.the center for american progress action fund , the advocacy arm of an organization founded by hillary clinton s former campaign manager john podesta , has partnered with a town hall protest group for upcoming anti-trump events during the congressional recess and beyond.the town hall project , a group that has served as the central hub for raucous town hall events against republican lawmakers , announced the partnership with cap action to amplify their efforts .
so today i m excited to announce a partnership between town hall project and the center for american progress action fund , an email from town hall project said .
with cap action amplifying our town hall event research , we can even better ensure that that all americans have the tools needed to channel their organic energy to ensure their voices are heard and their elected representatives held accountable .
advertising let me emphasize that this is collaboration towards a common goal , the email continued .
town hall project is 100 % independent and will never waiver [ sic ] from our core values of grassroots research and citizen engagement .
while we stay true to ourselves and to supporters like you we know the way we win is to build a big coalition of progressive groups : big and small , new and old , online and offline , all working together to fight back .
