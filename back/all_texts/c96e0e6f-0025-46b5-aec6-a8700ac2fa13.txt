Republicans don t care about the American people and this is proof.One of the first actions Republicans intend to take when Donald Trump takes office in January is to repeal Obamacare, which would strip millions of Americans of their health insurance.
It would return America to a time when insurance companies could deny people coverage because of pre-existing conditions, which would hurt women most since insurance companies consider being female a pre-existing condition.
It would also reverse the ability of children to remain on their parents insurance until the age of 26 and give insurance companies the power to raise costs like never before.Millions of Americans across the nation, especially those in red states would lose their healthcare coverage, causing the uninsured rate to skyrocket back to historic levels.Repeal would punish Americans simply for getting access to healthcare coverage.But repeal would be a windfall for the wealthy.That s right.
Republicans are going to take healthcare away from Americans and give the rich a massive tax cut at the same time.According to Talking Points Memo,Two taxes that will be presumably axed with the law affect only those making $200,000 or more.
The break the ACA repeal will bring to those taxpayers will amount to a $346 billion tax cut in total over 10 years, according to the CBO report on the 2015 repeal legislation GOP lawmakers say they ll be using as their model next year.These taxes help cover the subsidies many Americans received in order to help them afford a healthcare plan.
But if Obamacare is repealed, those subsidies will be eliminated and will serve as a tax hike on the poor and middle class.This is how Republicans are going to begin 2017.
They are literally going to prevent Americans from affording healthcare while giving even MORE money to greedy people who don t need it.On top of all this, Republicans are aiming to phase out Medicare by privatizing it and turning it into a worthless voucher system and have introduced legislation to slash Social Security.In short, Republicans are planning to break the back of the middle class and screw over the working class once and for all.
The lives of every American who is not wealthy are about to become a living hell.Featured Image: Image of Paul Ryan by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.
