This is a great clip from Ralph Peters, explaining why Obama taking an apology trip to Hiroshima is so offensiveIt was a great point he made about how the atomic bomb actually saved lives versus how many would have been killed if we had to invade, so that there are veterans still alive today from that fight.And he s right to point out the sheer brutality of the Japanese when they invaded China.Look, there was only one country that we nuked in WWII and we had to do it twice.It wasn t Germany.
It wasn t Hitler.It was Imperial Japan.And that right there should tell you something.
