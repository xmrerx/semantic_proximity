dublin ( reuters ) - ireland might consider adding elements to the text of an agreement on the post-brexit future of northern ireland s border as long as they do not undermine those already contained in the deal , the irish times reported on tuesday .
british prime minister theresa may has found it difficult to come up with a formula that satisfies both eu member ireland , which wants to avoid creation of a hard border , and northern ireland s democratic unionist party ( dup ) , which says the british province must quit the eu on the same terms as the rest of the uk .
the dup props up may s minority government .
a tentative deal on the border , promising regulatory alignment on both sides of the island of ireland , was agreed on monday .
it was later rejected by the dup , which says it can not allow any divergence in regulation between northern ireland and other parts of the uk .
brussels says agreement is needed before it will give the green light for britain to begin talks on future free trade when european union leaders meet next week .
the irish times quoted a spokesman for irish prime minister leo varadkar as saying the adding of elements to assuage the concerns of the dup doesn t seem unreasonable and was a possibility .
the irish times suggested such an element might refer to the strength of the uk as a political entity .
asked to comment on the report , a spokesman for varadkar said the view of the irish government is that the terms of the deal reached on monday must stand .
it s up to the uk government to work out with the dup how it proposes to move forward , the spokesman added .
