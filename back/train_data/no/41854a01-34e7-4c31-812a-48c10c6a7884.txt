how very progressive while hillary insults women who are victims of sexual abuse , her creepy vp uses women who are forced to live like they re still in the dark ages , as progressive role models for american women vice presidential candidate sen. tim kaine , d-va. , said tuesday that the united states has made it difficult for women to be elected to higher office , and argued that america ranks behind iraq , afghanistan and rwanda in this area .
it took 144 years before women even got the right to vote in this country , kaine said at a campaign rally in fayetteville , n.c. what were we thinking when we said equality mattered , but no .
one hundred and forty four years .
it took us that long to say in 1920 , to say women get a right to vote .
and now we re 96 years later and we have just nominated a woman .
we know we haven t had a woman president .
but in congress right now , we re doing the best job we have ever done in women in the federal legislature : 19 percent .
that s the best job we ve ever done , he said.the virginia senator claimed smaller , less wealthy countries actually put the united states to shame when it comes to electing women to higher office .
hold on for this , folks .
nineteen percent ranks the united states 75th in the world , below the global average , he said .
iraq is 26 percent .
afghanistan is 28 percent .
number one [ is ] rwanda .
sixty-four percent .
so for reasons , some of which i understand , some of which i don t , we have made it hard .
we have made it hard for women to be elected to the highest positions in our federal legislature and as president , he added.however , with the nomination of hillary clinton , that s all about to change , he said .
we are about to change that .
and that s why i m so excited !
he said.kaine s statistics are based on numbers compiled by the inter-parliamentary union , which bases its data on information provided by national parliaments .
