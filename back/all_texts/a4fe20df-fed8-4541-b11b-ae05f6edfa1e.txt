Everybody under the sun has had something to say about Trump s boasts of sexual assault in the bombshell pu**ygate tape and the avalanche of accusations against him that followed.
Everyone that is, except his oldest daughter, Ivanka Trump.In the Access Hollywood tapes from 2005, Trump brags that he just starts kissing random women if he finds them attractive and can even grab em by the pu**y because he is a star.
People have come out of the woodwork to weigh in on Trump s sexually predatory boasts, but until now, Ivanka has kept her silence.On Monday, Ivanka issued a statement regarding her father s disgusting comments to Fast Company.
My father s comments were clearly inappropriate and offensive, and I m glad that he acknowledged this fact with an immediate apology to my family and the American people.
And that s all she has to say about that.
He said he s sorry, so no harm, no foul.
For the record, she said nothing in the statement about her father telling Howard Stern that it was okay to refer to her as a piece of ass.
But as short as her statement was, she did go further than her brother by calling dear old dad s remarks offensive.
Eric Trump defended his father s comments as just being locker room talk and the inevitable result of two alpha personalities having a conversation.In a separate interview with Fast Company, Ivanka said that she is able to shrug off all the negative reports about her father, even the long list of women accusing Trump of sexual assault.
The greatest comfort I have is the fact that I know my father.
Most of the people who write about him don t. I do, she explained.
So that gives me an ability to shrug off the things that I read about him that are wrong.
