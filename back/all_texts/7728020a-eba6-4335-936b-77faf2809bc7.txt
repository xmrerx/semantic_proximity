The latest video from Campus Reform shows just how far some college students think universities should go to recognize people s racial identity delusion and all!The Ivy League setting of Brown University shows Cabot Phillips asking students about a hypothetical Pocahontas policy that would allow students to self-identify based on race.
Overall I think it s a good thing, one student said.
However, that student later said in the video that he feels weird talking about this as not a person of color.
Phillips asked, But what if you feel like one though?
Another student answered, It s intended to create uh, you know, an atmosphere of inclusion and support diversity and I don t see anything wrong with that.
If somebody identifies as something it should be their right to, another student said.Soooo these college snowflakes choose to live in the land of delusion and call it an atmosphere of inclusion and diversity .
