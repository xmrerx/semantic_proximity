twitter exploded when god bless america was beautifully sung by american servicemen at the world series on tuesday night .
the left was triggered by the beautiful and patriotic song that they ve been trying to censor from mlb for some time .
several recent articles by slate and other publications call for god bless america to be omitted from being played at games : nydn reported : major league baseball must permanently retire god bless america , a song that offends everyone the yankees still play it at every game , but most teams , like my beloved mets , play god bless america only on sundays or holidays .
but even that s too much .
this is why what happened during the seventh inning stretch for game one of the world series is a beautiful thing : major league baseball hit it out of the park by playing a song that s even more despised by the left than the national anthem .
it was performed with a little help from american servicemen during the seventh inning stretch : god bless america !
thank you god and america !
look nfl no whinny nfl babies # gostros @ nflcommish # nflboycott # boycottnflsponsors @ mlb pic.twitter.com/fgfefeomax ibc medias ( @ bychauvin ) october 25 , 2017liberals went ballistic on twitter : the american jingoism is unbearable the left detests patriotism and anything to do with national pride .
a very sick mindset.mike dalager , a petty officer at the united states coast guard second class performs this rendition of god bless america during the 7th inning stretch at game 1 of the 2017 world series between the los angeles dodgers and the houston astros .
great performance :
