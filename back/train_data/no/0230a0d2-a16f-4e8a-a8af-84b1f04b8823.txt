21st century wire says 21wire reported on friday about the fbi s surprising announcement that it would be reopening the clinton email case due to new evidence of classified information found on sex cheat anthony weiner s ( newly estranged husband of clinton chief aid huma abedin ) computer which was subject to a seperate investigation .
will this really yield anything significant in the 10 days running-up to the nov 8th election , or is this just clever democrat party smoke and mirrors ?
it seems that washington s political tricksters have already sprung into action after comey s shock announcement , a leaked memo appeared out of nowhere , supplied to fox news , in which comey and the fbi seem to be going through a routine set of prescribed political moves designed to implement damage control .
elite circles : fbi head james comey and friend hillary clinton.certainly , a desperate democratic party , and an even more desperate obama white house ( over the last 3 weeks , obama and his wife michelle have been out campaigning more that hillary clinton herself ) , could be pressuring or nudging the fbi on this volatile issue which could easily tilt a close presidential race against donald trump .
aside from the obvious potential of another clinton scandal , yesterday s fbi move could also be a prelude to the following possible scenarios : note : despite calls from the clinton camp for fbi to disclose what they have ( which they can not by law anyway , you d think hillary would have already known that ) , it is highly unlikely that the fbi will release any real specifics before the election if they have anything at all .
it s just too early to tell .

needless to say , all comey would need to do to regain the demcorats trust and favor is to announce in just a few days that nothing material has been found and that the second probe is also over .
here is leaked ( aka just covering my ass ) memo from fbi director james comey : watch this space .
