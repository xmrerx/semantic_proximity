Is this any way to run a campaign?
Jeb Bush was living La Vida Loca with his soirees at the Four Seasons and jet set campaigning.
He s not the only one to spend big.
Wisconsin Gov.
Scott Walker spent nearly $10 million before dropping out after three months.
Silver spoon or just unable to run a campaign efficiently?HERE S JUST ONE GLARING EXAMPLE:Bush s prospects were far brighter last summer.
Trump had yet to join the race and Bush was making headlines for the size of his war chest.
His Super PAC had just cracked its goal of raising more than $100 million in just six months an unprecedented haul in American politics.To celebrate, Jeb s parents and family welcomed their large network of well-heeled donors to their oceanside compound in Kennebunkport, Maine, where attendees were treated to rides in private trolley cars, lobster rolls and group photos with the sprawling Bush clan.There were stays at boutique hotels featuring rooftop pools, private soirees at members-only, jacket-and-tie clubs and fundraisers at the Four Seasons, the St. Regis and the Mandarin Oriental.In the world of Jeb Bush, the campaign for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination has at times been a whirl of private planes and high-end affairs, according to the federal filings of Bush s campaign and his super PAC, Right to Rise, which can raise unlimited funds for Bush as long as it does not coordinate directly with him.It is not unusual for US presidential candidates to fly private or even sometimes stay in luxury hotels.
But some disgruntled donors say they are unhappy with Bush s large outlays, which also include big spending on staff and tens of millions of dollars in ad buys.Eleven of 16 major donors contacted by Reuters questioned whether it was money well spent, especially given how the one-time frontrunner has stumbled badly in the polls and is now facing questions about whether he should withdraw from the race.Via: NYP
