One of the guests at what Trump calls the Winter White House his private business in Florida really got to feel the privilege associated with being able to drop $200,000 on a membership fee to gain access to the President on Saturday.
Guests were treated to quite a bit of excitement when a call came in that North Korea had launched a missile and Trump read over confidential documents in full view of everyone as his white supremacist staffers held their cell phones flashlights on it so he could see properly at the dinner table.Richard DeAgazio, one of the rich guests who somehow gets access to the President simply by paying him money, posted about watching Trump deal with the North Korea news complete with photos of Trump reviewing information that is supposed to be secure.But that s not all DeAgazio posted!
He also snapped a photo with the guy whose job it is to carry the nuclear football.
Now the existence of the football is, of course, not a national secret.
Hillary Clinton, for example, warned us that it is dangerous to place something so dangerous in Donald Trump s care.
But DeAgazio made sure our enemies know who has it, what he looks like, and what his name is.
This is Rick He carries the football The nuclear football (also known as the atomic football, the President s emergency satchel, the Presidential Emergency Satchel, the button, the black box, or just the football) is a briefcase, the contents of which are to be used by the President of the United States to authorize a nuclear attack while away from fixed command centers, such as the White House Situation Room, he posted on Facebook along with a photo of Rick, whom he says is the Man.
All it costs is $200,000 and literally anyone is able to get within inches of access to our nuclear secrets an interesting fact given The Donald s constant stream of attacks on Hillary Clinton simply for using a private email server.
This, of course, is a small matter when compared to Trump s friends exposing details related to our national secrets on social media in real time.I never want to hear about emails again.
On the plus, we finally figured out what it takes for one of Trump s rich white buddies to be willing to touch a black man.Featured image via Facebook
