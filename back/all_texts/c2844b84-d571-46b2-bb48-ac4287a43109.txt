This didn t stop other veteran advocates like Marvel Entertainment CEO Ike Perlmutter from going.
Why was Shulkin such a schtick in the mud?
Maybe it s because the meeting was due to be held at Mar-a-Lago, Trump s West Palm Beach golf castle, and Shulkin didn t have his shots.Speaking of Mar-a-Lago, this is Trump s fifth weekend there since his inauguration five weekends ago.

Good work if you can get it.Trump has spent nearly a quarter of his time at Mar-a-Lago since taking office.
A lot of elderly people like to go to the Sunshine state when they need a break.By the way, who s paying for the $3M a pop to the southern White House?
Not veterans programs, at least, not yet.
The Department of Veterans Affairs is penciled in for a 6% bump in Trump s budget proposal, which is currently facing a rocky road in the ongoing Federal budget process.
As far as fiscal 2017 goes, most departments have been operating on a continuing budget resolution good through the end of April.
If things aren t ironed out by then, the resulting partial government shutdown shouldn t affect most veterans services significantly, since VA funding has already been approved.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images
