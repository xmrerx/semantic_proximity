cox s bazar , bangladesh ( reuters ) - four rohingya muslims , a man , woman and two children , drowned when a small wooden fishing boat carrying dozens of refugees fleeing ethnic violence in myanmar capsized off the bangladesh coast on tuesday , police said .
residents of the coastal strip south of the bangladesh port of cox s bazar fished 37 survivors out of the water and 11 have been admitted to hospital in a critical condition , said police officer mohammad abul khair of the area s ukhiya police station .
the boat had keeled over in choppy seas as rain fell .
according to survivors they had paid 50,000 kyat ( $ 37 ) to be taken to bangladesh , having abandoned their homes in buthidaung , in the strife-torn north of myanmar s rakhine state .
in a separate incident at the southernmost tip of the cox s bazar district , three rohingya infants drowned as they slipped from their mothers clutches when the boat bringing them from myanmar reached the bangladesh shore , police official main uddin khan of the region s teknaf police station told reuters .
the babies , aged between three and 10 months , were lost in the waves pounding the beach .
the bodies of two were found on monday evening , and the third on tuesday .
more than 600,000 rohingya have fled to neighbouring bangladesh since the military in predominantly buddhist myanmar launched a counter-insurgency operation after attacks on security posts by rohingya militants in late august .
united nations officials have described the myanmar military s action as ethnic cleansing , an accusation that myanmar denies .
around 200 rohingya refugees have drowned since late august , while making the perilous sea and river crossing to the safety of predominantly muslim bangladesh .
