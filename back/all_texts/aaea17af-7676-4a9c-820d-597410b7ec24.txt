It seems that Fox News repeated decisions to shower of Donald Trump with adoration and excuses has gotten to now-former Fox News host Megyn Kelly.
That s right now former.
According to the New York Times, Kelly will be jumping ship to NBC where she will hist a daytime news and discussion program, anchor her own weekend show, and be a part of the network s special political coverage.This may or may not come as a shock to Fox, whose ousted former chairman Roger Ailes sexually harassed Kelly for about a decade, but perhaps they might be having some hindsight issues surrounding their recent decision to side with Trump over Kelly when The Donald was bullying her on social media, regular media, and everywhere else imaginable after she challenged him during a debate.Whatever her reason for leaving, she is passing up a pretty sweet $20 million a year that Fox offered her to stay after her current contract expires.
NBC has been crystal clear that they can not and will not match that money.
Sources declined to tell the New York Times what, exactly, Kelly s annual salary will be, but she is almost assuredly taking a pay cut based on past remarks.While it is entertaining to see Kelly stick it to Fox News, we have no choice but to wonder why NBC would hire someone who thinks that Santa and Jesus are both real (and white dudes), who blamed Sandra Bland for her own death, who thinks that pepper spray is a food product, essentially, and who has done and said so many horrific things over the years that a truly functional society would treat her as a pariah though, of course, she was one of the few right-wing voices who actually stood up to Donald Trump to some degree.Naturally, Trump fans are celebrating the news:Megyn Kelly is moving to NBC!
Hahaha Feminazi cunt.

Now, I have decided to end my time at Megyn Kelly 3 2017Is Kelly s decision to move to NBC or their decision to hire her a good thing?
Only time will tell; it depends on how much of her horrible, bigoted Fox News persona was an act.
In any case, her departure leaves her former network with a huge, gaping hole in its lineup one they will likely fill with someone a thousand times more horrible than Megyn Kelly could ever be.Featured image via screengrab
