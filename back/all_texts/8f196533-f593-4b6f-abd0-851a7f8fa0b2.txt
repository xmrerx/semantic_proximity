Please listen to this incredibly offensive commercial from Josh Gottheimer who attacks his opponent for being divisive by attacking another state and demeaning everyone in Alabama as a racist.
On a personal note, I m from Georgia and find that people from the South are stereotyped like crazy!
How offensive is this?
The people of new jersey should send this goofball packing for his idiotic commercial!
Gottheimer was a former speechwriter for Bill Clinton which explains everything!
