paris ( reuters ) - a suspected islamist militant accused of killing four in a 2014 attack on a jewish museum in belgium was placed under former investigation in france on wednesday for allegedly kidnapping four french journalists in syria .
mehdi nemmouche was briefly transferred to paris from a jail cell in belgium , where he is being held pending a trial over the may 2014 attack in which four people including two israeli tourists were killed in brussels .
speaking outside paris s lawcourts , a lawyer for nemmouche said his client had been notified of the additional french probe and that he had chosen to say nothing on the advice of his legal team .
the investigating judge told him he had been formally put under investigation over the kidnapping and hostage-taking of four french journalists in relation with a terrorist group , vuillemin said .
nemmouche was arrested by police in the southern french port city of marseille shortly after the brussels shooting attack and extradited to belgium in july 2014 .
french journalists who were released months earlier after almost a year in captivity in syria identified him as their jailor there and said he was among french nationals working with the islamic state group .
wednesday s brief transfer to paris came two days after the second anniversary of other attacks in which islamist militants , some of them residents of belgium , killed 130 people in paris .
scores more have been killed in belgium , france , britain and spain in attacks commissioned or inspired by the islamic state group , whose territory in syria and iraq is diminishing under military pressure from an international coalition .
