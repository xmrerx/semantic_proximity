On Thursday, Donald Trump hopped on the Twitter Machine and made a promise to all Americans, tweeting out a graphic posted on his Instagram account: My Administration will follow two simple rules: BUY AMERICAN and HIRE AMERICAN!
#USAA photo posted by Donald J. Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Dec 29, 2016 at 6:52am PSTTrump must have a very short memory because during the campaign it was revealed that his suits and ties, as well as a number of other products, are made in China (that s the country The Donald has been going out of his way to provoke as of late) or other countries.
He appears to be blissfully unaware of his own long and storied history of hiring Mexican and other foreign workers.
He also seems to be ignoring or somehow oblivious to the fact that his daughter, incoming First Lady Ivanka, was recently busted manufacturing her clothing in China, Indonesia, and Vietnam and the fact that his presidency was made in Russia.While the Trumps will say this is part of their mission to make America great again, Twitter jumped on the President- elect for his hypocrisy:.
@realDonaldTrump You have frequently hired foreign guest workers to fill jobs that could be completed by Americans https://t.co/Vhfe3nQnAf Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 29, 2016.
@realDonaldTrump Great slogan, sweetie!
Nobody sells like my Donny!
but being the architect of viable policy should be a bit more nuanced.

@realDonaldTrump oh, "buy American and hire American."
Few of your companies, or your cabinet members, even do that.
But your admin will?
Isaac Saul (@Ike_Saul) December 29, 2016@realDonaldTrump It's nice to see that you linked to your Instagram to your Twitter.
You are so MAGA tech savvy.

You're not "colluding with Nazis" if you call them a different name Jon Bershad (@JonBershad) December 29, 2016Really @realDonaldTrump ?
Your company doesn't even do that.
Also can you hire a graphics team?

Unfortunately, The Donald s inbred, meth-addled fans are exactly the level of stupid required to fall for Trump s Buy American, Hire American line of bullsh*t.Featured image via Getty Images(Win McNamee)/screengrab
