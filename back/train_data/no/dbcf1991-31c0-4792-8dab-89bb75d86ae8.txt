winston-salem , n.c. ( reuters ) - a north carolina sheriff ’ s office said on monday it would not charge republican presidential front-runner donald trump or his campaign with “ inciting a riot ” at a rally in the state last week .
north carolina is one of five states holding republican and democratic primary elections on tuesday in the race to select candidates for november ’ s u.s. presidential election .
the cumberland county sheriff ’ s office , based in fayetteville , earlier had said it was reviewing whether trump or his campaign incited a disturbance at a rally last wednesday .
at the rally in fayettsville , john mcgraw , a 78-year-old white trump supporter , was arrested on a misdemeanor assault charge after he was seen on video punching a 26-year-old black protester in the face .
on monday evening , the sheriff ’ s office said in a statement it would not seek a warrant or indictment for trump or his campaign over the incident .
“ the sheriff ’ s office legal counsel advised , and the sheriff concurred , that the evidence does not meet the requisites of the law as established under the relevant north carolina statute and case law to support a conviction of the crime of inciting a riot , ” the office said .
in north carolina , “ inciting to riot ” is a legal charge that can apply to a public disturbance and does not necessarily involve a full-scale riot .
the offense can be classified as a misdemeanor or a more serious felony .
during a trip on monday to north carolina , trump rejected suggestions that his language was to blame for recent clashes at his rallies .
