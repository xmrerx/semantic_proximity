ankara ( reuters ) - the kurdish regional government s proposal to freeze its push for independence is an important step but does not go far enough , turkey s foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu said on thursday .
cavusoglu was speaking a day after iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi , who visited ankara on wednesday , insisted that last month s kurdish independence referendum be declared void .
