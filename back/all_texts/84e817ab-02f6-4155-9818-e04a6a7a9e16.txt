Ivanka Trump is catching hell right now for being a hypocrite when it comes to women s healthcare.In 2016, Ivanka Trump campaign for her dad by claiming that his administration would support a variety of women s issues including maternity leave.However, Donald Trump s desperate effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act would wipe out maternity care, mammograms, contraception, and would make the cost of healthcare for women skyrocket because insurance companies would be allowed to once again classify being a woman as a pre-existing condition.In short, for all of Ivanka s claims that her dad will be a champion for women, he is proving her to be a total liar.
And what s worse is that she is doing nothing to stand up for women.And that s why Planned Parenthood CEO Cecile Richards called out Ivanka on Friday and warned her not to betray women.
It s time for Ivanka to stand for women, Richards said before calling Ivanak s silence on the bill deafening.
Currently, Ivanka is on a swanky ski trip in Aspen while Republicans prepare to gut healthcare for millions of women across the country.
This is going to be a catastrophe for women in this country, Richards continued.
Any woman who votes for this bill is betraying every woman in America.
Women will lose not just their healthcare, but lose their lives over this bill.
Here s the video via YouTube.Ivanka s refusal to help women by standing up to her dad has also created a firestorm on her Twitter feed as even more people called her out on social media for being a hypocrite in response to her praise of a paid leave speech delivered by actress Anne Hathaway.
