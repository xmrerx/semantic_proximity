baghdad ( reuters ) - kurdish leader masoud barzani gave a bitter speech on sunday to announce his resignation , saying no one outside the kurds home region had stood up to support their right of self-determination .
barzani made a televised speech after the iraqi kurdistan parliament approved his request not to extend his term beyond nov. 1 , after an independence referendum he championed last month backfired and triggered military and economic retaliation against the kurdish region he has been leading since 2005 .
three million votes for kurdistan independence created history and can not be erased , he said , referring to the referendum held on sept. 25 .
nobody stood up with us other than our mountains , he said , speaking with kurdish and iraqi flags behind him .
he criticized the united states for allowing abrams tanks supplied to iraqi forces to fight islamic state militants to be used against the kurds .
he said american weapons were also used in attacks by iranian-backed paramilitaries .
without the help of peshmerga ( kurdish fighters ) , iraqi forces could not have liberated mosul from isis alone , he said , referring to islamic state s former stronghold in northern iraq .
why would washington want to punish kurdistan ?
he said followers of rival kurdish leader jalal talabani , who died in early october , had been guilty of high treason for handing over the oil city of kirkuk to iraqi forces without a fight two weeks ago .
he said the iraqi offensives since oct. 16 and the refusal of the iraqi government to agree to dialogue vindicated his view that iraq no longer believes in kurdish rights .
