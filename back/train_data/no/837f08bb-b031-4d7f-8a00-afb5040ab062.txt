manchester , england ( reuters ) - britain wants to negotiate a brexit agreement with the european union , but is ready to walk away with no deal , brexit minister david davis said on tuesday , warning that any error in the talks could cost them billions of pounds .
at the annual conference of the conservative party , davis told members the government did not want to fail in the talks to unravel more than 40 years of union , but officials were contingency planning to make sure all scenarios were covered .
british prime minister theresa may has tried to unblock the talks with eu leaders , after they stalled over disagreements on the final divorce bill , by making concessions on the role of the european court and the financial settlement .
but earlier on tuesday , the european parliament passed a non-binding motion calling on eu leaders to conclude at a summit on oct. 19-20 that brexit talks had not made sufficient progress to justify opening trade negotiations with britain .
on the negotiating front , we are aiming for a good deal .
and that is what we expect to achieve .
however , if the outcome of the negotiation falls short of the deal that britain needs we will be ready for the alternative , davis said .
that is what a responsible government does .
anything else would be a dereliction of duty .
davis , who said britain was nearing agreement with the eu on citizens rights - one of three issues to be settled in the first round of negotiations , criticized the main opposition labour party for having an unclear position on brexit this is the most complex negotiation you could imagine , where one oversight , one error could cost the taxpayer billions of pounds , he said .
