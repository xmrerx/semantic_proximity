Donald Trump seems to love it when his rabid, racist followers attack black people at his rallies.
For instance, last year when Trump s supporters attacked a black man, calling him a n*gger as they punched and kicked him, the 2016 hopeful spoke out in support of the assault, declaring that maybe he should have been roughed up.
The Donald, who has been known to tweet white supremacist propaganda and order police to remove African-Americans from his rallies even if they did nothing more than stand still, strives to maintain an authoritarian atmosphere at his rallies, even promising to pay for the legal defense of anyone who attacks protesters black or otherwise at his events.At a rally in North Carolina on Wednesday, one Trump fan took his Fuhrer s words to heart, attacking an African-American man who was in the process of leaving the event.
The unnamed black man was just one of several protesters who nonviolently protested the racist GOP frontrunner s speech.
As the men leave, Trump supporters can be seen doing their thing namely, acting like f*cking @ssholes.
One of the African-American men can be seen flipping the bird to the white-faced Trump supporters.
One TrumpFan walks to the end of a row, waits for an opening, and sucker punches one of the protesters.The attack happens in full view of members of the security staff, who are escorting the men out.
The logical thing would be to detain the attacker until police arrive.
After all, this is clearly an unprovoked assault.
But, as this is a Trump rally, security instead throws the victim of the attack to the ground, completely ignoring the white man who assaulted him.Unfortunately, this is where we re at: we have a mainstream GOP candidate who encourages acts of violence specifically against African-Americans and security officers who are willing to completely ignore any acts of violence committed by the faithful, no matter how clear-cut they are.Watch this preview of a Donald Trump America below, and remember to VOTE BLUE in November:Featured image via screengrab
