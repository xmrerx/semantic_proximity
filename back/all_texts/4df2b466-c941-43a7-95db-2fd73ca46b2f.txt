I am a student of history so I tend to actually be familiar with many of these episodes that have been mentioned.
I am the first one to acknowledge that America s application to concern around human rights has not always been consistent.
And, I m certainly mindful that there are dark chapters in our own history in which we have not always observed the principles and ideals upon which the country was founded.
Just a few weeks ago I was in Selma, Alabama celebrating the 50th anniversary of a march across a bridge that resulted in horrific violence and the reason I was there and the reason it was a celebration is because it was a triumph of human spirit in which ordinary people without resort to violence were able to overcome systematic segregation.
There voices were heard and our country changed.
America never makes a claim about being perfect, we do make a claim about being open to change.
