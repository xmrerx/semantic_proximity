paris ( reuters ) - france on friday called on iraq s central government to show restraint after taking control of the last district in the oil-rich province of kirkuk and said baghdad should take the rights of kurds fully into account .
iraqi forces are seeking to reestablish baghdad s authority over territory which the kurdish forces occupied outside the official boundaries of their autonomous region , mostly seized since 2014 in the course of the war on islamic state militants .
[ l8n1mv1k2 ] we ask the federal government to show restraint and fully respect the rights of the kurds , foreign ministry spokeswoman agnes romatet-espagne told reporters .
tens of thousands of kurds have fled kirkuk and tuz to the two main cities of the kurdish autonomous region , erbil and sulaimaniya , according to kurdish officials .
the united nations expressed concern on thursday at reports of forced displacement and destruction of kurdish homes and businesses , mainly in tuz .
romatet-espagne said the kurds also needed to accept a dialogue with baghdad within the framework of the constitution .
