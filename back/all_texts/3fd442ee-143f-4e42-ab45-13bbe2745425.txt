Neo-Nazis and white supremacists gathered in Pikeville, Kentucky yesterday.
They were met by scores of protesters who booed the group.
Approximately 70 members of the Traditionalist Workers Party, the League of the South and the National Socialist Movement were heavily armed when they gathered at the courthouse in town.Pike County is a very white place.
At least 98 percent of the people who live there are white.
The area also went heavily for President Donald Trump.
Eighty percent of the people there voted for Trump.
These are the reasons that Pikeville was selected for the rally.
The neo-Nazis and white supremacists are looking to become more politically relevant.
They picked the area because they thought their message would appeal to the working class people who live there.Pikeville residents wanted no part of the message the rally organizers were trying to spread.
Most of the rally supporters are not from Pikevillee.
Lifelong Pikeville resident, Elizabeth White said, We have no clue why they would even pick Pickville.
Why don t they go disrespect their own homes, their own people, their own families?
We need Trump to tell them to go back to their own place.
There had been a lot of concern about the rally as recent protests around the country have turned violent.
One protester was shot in the abdomen at an event in Seattle.
Several people were stabbed at another event in Sacramento.
Unlike Washington and California, which have strict gun control laws, Kentucky residents are allowed to carry weapons.
Organizers of the Pikeville protest said beforehand that their people would be heavily armed.
That led some to be concerned that violence at the protest could turn deadly.Luckily, none of that happened.
The three hour rally included harsh words from both sides but was peaceful.
As the protesters left town, people protesting the protest shouted, Get the fuck out.
Get the fuck out and stay the fuck out.
You are not welcome here.
