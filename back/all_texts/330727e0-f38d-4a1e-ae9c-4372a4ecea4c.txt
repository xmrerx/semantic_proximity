It s the fake assassination attempt heard around the world and everyone is laughing at Donald Trump.On Saturday night in Reno, Nevada the Secret Service rushed the stage and escorted Trump to his safe space after some of his paranoid supporters yelled gun because they thought a guy was gong to shoot the Republican nominee.
Instead, it was just a Republican who was trying to unfurl an anti-Trump sign.Soon after, Trump returned to the stage and began talking tough like this was a real assassination attempt by thanking the Secret Service and telling the crowd that we will never be stopped.
Trump s campaign has also been touting the falsehood that Trump survived an assassination attempt even though no gun was found and the man was only holding a Republicans Against Trump sign.Clearly, for all their talk of supporting gun rights, these Trump fans sure are scared of them.
It sounds like these Trump supporters were just manufacturing a reason to pummel the man because he doesn t support their candidate.Trump even posted that nothing will stop us on Twitter in reference to the incident in Reno.Thank you Reno, Nevada.
NOTHING will stop us in our quest to MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!

Bad Hombre (@SPhilipGray) November 6, 2016Donald Trump and his campaign should be ashamed of themselves for touting this as an actual assassination attempt.
The guy whom Trump supporters accused of having a gun did NOT have a gun and was released after speaking to Secret Service.
Frankly, Trump deserved to get his ass handed to him on social media, and hopefully he will get his ass handed to him on Election Day.Featured Image: Brian Blanco/Getty Images
