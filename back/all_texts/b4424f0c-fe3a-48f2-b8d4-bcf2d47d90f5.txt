Reps. Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) and Elijah Cummings (D-MD) dropped a bombshell on Tuesday morning.
During a press conference, they announced what Cummings described as a major problem for the Trump administration: it looks like former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn committed a felony.
We received a response from the White House refusing to provide any of the documents we requested, Cummings said.
The White House has refused to offer a single piece of paper in response to this committee s bipartisan request.
According to the congressman, classified military documents have revealed that Flynn failed to disclose payments he received from foreign governments before he became Trump s National security advisor.
This is a major problem, Cummings said.
I believe these documents should be declassified to the fullest extent possible without compromising sources or methods, he added.Cumings also noted that Flynn s illegal actions could land him in prison for up to five years.
Chaffetz said that if these documents are correct, then Flynn s actions were clearly illegal and there will be consequences.
As a former military officer, you simply cannot take money from Russia, Turkey or anybody else, Chaffetz said.
And it appears as if he did take that money, it was inappropriate, and there are repercussions for it as a violation of the law.
The congressmen, who both serve as senior members of the House Oversight Committee, said that so far, they haven t seen a shred of evidence to suggest that Flynn actually followed the law and got permission from the federal government before taking cash from multiple foreign governments.You can watch video of their press conference, here:Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
