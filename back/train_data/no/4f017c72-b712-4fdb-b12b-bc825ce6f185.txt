cairo ( reuters ) - egyptian authorities have detained 15 people pending an investigation into an attack on an unlicensed coptic christian church in a village south of cairo , a security source said on sunday .
dozens of muslims from the village of kafr al-waslin attacked the church after friday prayers , smashing the windows and breaking everything inside , the archdiocese of atfih said in a statement .
the diocese had applied to legalize the status of the church , which has housed worshippers for 15 years after a church building law was passed in 2016 , the statement said .
those detained are accused of stirring sectarian strife , harming national unity and destroying private property , one judicial source told reuters .
the owner of the building was also in custody pending inquiries into the operations of the facility by state security and the interior ministry , the source added .
egyptian christians make up about a tenth of the country s almost 95 million population and are the middle east s largest christian community .
they have long complained of discrimination in the majority-muslim country .
the government does not make the official number of christians public in its census and christians have long complained of being undercounted .
some muslims object to turning this building into a church because there s a really big mosque beside it , one villager who asked not to be named told reuters .
there are strong social ties between the muslims and christians [ in our village , he added .
