( reuters ) - a drone hit an airplane landing at a quebec city airport this week , the first time an unmanned flying object has collided with commercial aircraft in canada , transport minister marc garneau said on sunday .
no injuries were reported in the incident , which happened on thursday at jean lesage international airport and involved a plane belonging to quebec-based skyjet aviation .
i am extremely relieved that the aircraft only sustained minor damage and was able to land safely , garneau said in a statement .
there were six passengers and two crew members on board the airplane at the time of the collision , according to local news media reports .
drones are not allowed within 5.5 km ( 3.4 miles ) of canadian airports , helipads and seaplane bases .
operators who put aircraft at risk face steep fines and jail time under canadian law .
drone usage has soared in north america , europe and china , raising privacy concerns and fears of collisions with commercial jets , and prompting the united nations aviation agency to back the creation of a single global drone registry .
there have been 1,596 drone incidents reported to transport canada so far this year , with 131 of them deemed to be aviation safety concerns .
in november 2016 , a canadian airliner with 54 passengers on board had to swerve to avoid an unmanned flying object near toronto , slightly injuring two cabin crew .
