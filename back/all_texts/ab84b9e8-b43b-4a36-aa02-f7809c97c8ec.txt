According to Donald Trump, he didn t lose in the Republican Iowa Caucus.
He came in second, which is really the same thing as winning when you really think about it.
Except it s not.
However, to Trump s fragile ego, and what he tells himself in the mirror each night, is that he really won, because Ted Cruz was a meanie and cheated.Now, to prepare himself for loss everywhere he goes, Trump has now taken to telling everyone he doesn t actually have to win a state.
In this case, New Hampshire.
Someone should probably let Trump know that in order to win the Republican Party nomination he s going to have to not only win states, but win a lot of them, not come in second, but actually, in all legitimacy, win.However, Trump being Trump, and with his narcissistic personality disorder preventing him from being able to wrap his giant head around a loss, even losing is a win to him.
He even told CNN s Jake Tapper on State of the Union: I want to win New Hampshire, but I don t think I have to win it.
He s clearly preparing himself for a loss, despite having a monster lead in the Granite State, but after Iowa, he s probably thinking all bets are off.Donald Trump will never admit to losing, now if he does lose, well, he can say he called it and claim he never needed it: I told you guys I didn t need it!
He s creating a bit of an insurance policy for himself as really any good businessperson would: you have a contingency plan.Oh, Trump.
If not for your ego, you would be a very lonely man.
Your love for yourself is unending.
Trump: I want to win N.H., but I don t think I have to win it.
