At this point, it could be said that Donald Trump is just trying to see how awful and extreme he can truly be.
He s already got the bigot vote locked up, including white supremacists and those who really don t want Mexicans anywhere near the United States.
Now, it seems he s also totally cool with torture to gain intelligence.Trump is totally trying to get us to believe that he will be incredibly tough on suspected terrorists or those who may hold valuable intelligence.
Not only did he say that waterboarding is absolutely A-OK, but he s also insinuating that he s going to be even more extreme in regards to torture and interrogation.
Ethics and Geneva Convention be damned, right?When asked what s worse than waterboarding by Los Angeles Times reporter Chris Megerian, Trump responded with: Uh, you ll find out.
Umm how evil does that sound?
You ll find out.
Holy crap.
That could mean anything.
And we have to wait until he s elected?
Thank goodness that will never happen because Democrats will get their act together and unify behind one candidate if Trump or any GOP nominee is the candidate they are facing.The fact that a candidate for President of the United States is advocating torture is outright horrifying.
We are better than that as a nation and we need to prove it on election day.
What s worse than waterboarding?
You ll find out, Trump tells me.
