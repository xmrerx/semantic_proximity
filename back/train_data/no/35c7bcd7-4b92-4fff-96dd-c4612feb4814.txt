bernie sanders should know his socialized medicine but in an exchange on sunday he failed when he was pressed to explain why a single-payer health care system was rejected in vermont and california , two staunchly democratic states : cnn host jake tapper said that california and vermont are cobalt blue states and asked how single-payer could be affordable at the national level if they rejected the system at the state level because of the expense : single-payer failed to pass in both california and vermont after lawmakers were unable to figure out how to fund the system .
