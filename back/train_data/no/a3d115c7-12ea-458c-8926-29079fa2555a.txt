athens ( reuters ) - israeli players have been denied visas to participate in a speed chess championship hosted by saudi arabia this week , a vice president of the world chess federation ( fide ) said on sunday .
seven israeli players had requested visas for the tournament on dec. 26-30 .
it would have marked the first time saudi arabia had publicly hosted israelis as the gulf state does not recognize israel and there are no formal ties between them .
israel gelfer , vice president of fide , whose secretariat is based in athens , told reuters in an email that visas for the israeli players have not been issued and will not be issued .
he said the tournament would go ahead as planned .
it was not immediately clear if other delegations had been excluded but players from qatar had suggested they may have been rejected .
saudi arabia s center for international communication said in a statement that more than 180 players would participate but did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
israel chess federation spokesman lior aizenberg said efforts were still being made by various parties to ensure the israeli players took part .
the event is not a world championship if they prevent chess players from several countries from taking part , aizenberg told reuters .
every chess player should have the right to participate in an event on the basis of professional criteria , regardless of their passports , their place of issue or the stamps they bear .
aizenberg said fide should ensure israeli players could compete in international events and that the israeli federation was considering all options , including legal action and holding an international competition in israel for players excluded from the saudi match .
fide had said in november it was undertaking a huge effort to ensure all players were granted visas .
