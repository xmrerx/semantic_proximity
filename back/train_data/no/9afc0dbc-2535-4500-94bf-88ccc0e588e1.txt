wheel of fortune caved to the left and apologized for using what appeared to be slaves in a photo on the show on thursday : we regret the use of this background image , and we will be replacing it moving forward on any rebroadcast .
but wait !
the people in the photo are tour guides and not slaves !
this didn t stop the goofballs on the left from freaking out on social media : someone please tell me why @ wheeloffortune has slaves in their southern charm week images ?

the left claimed it was a photo of slaves !
as it turns out , the two women were in period costumes and happen to be tour guides at the historic plantation : a spokesperson for the plantation said , the plantation employs a diverse range of people of all skin colors for tour guide roles .
even though they wear clothing indicative of the period , the actors who work at the plantation do not try to portray slaves .
get that ?
the actors who work at the plantation do not try to portray slaves can we move forward already ?
it s like the left wants to keep us stuck in the past .
