house republicans are gathering closely around a bill that would essentially block president barack obama from releasing any more detainees from guantanamo bay until congress can create a new defense policy bill.even though the house passed the bill on a 244 to 174 vote , some leading republican house members acknowledge that it stands almost no chance of being approved by the senate.despite that possibility the house s vote represents a final stand in the eight-year struggle between republicans and president barack obama , who have fought rigorously over the future of the detention facility housing suspected terrorists that obama has sworn to shut down .
the white house has also threatened to veto this attempt as well.in august , the president approved the largest single transfer of detainees , 15 total were sent to the united arab emirates , leaving the population at 61 .
two of those released from guantanamo bay now join others that have reengaged in terrorist activity.the bill s sponsor , rep. jackie walorski , r-ind , states we wouldn t be seeing 30 percent recidivism if we had true partners in this cause and in these countries .
he continues by saying that obama s detainee transfer policy is more about the president running out of time to fulfill his campaign promise than about the national security interest of the united states , and that puts americans at risk .
let s hope that the bill either passes or holds obama off long enough for his term to end.h/t [ breaking 911 ]
