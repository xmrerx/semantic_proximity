the republican party has failed in its effort to steer the american people in their direction which is one of establishment politicians or else .
the people are being ignored as the party elites huddle in meetings plotting and planning a way to get their guy instead of who the people want .
even some republican delegates are saying they ll vote for hillary if trump is the nominee : republican delegate should be kicked out after exposing her plan if trump s the nominee [ video ] do these people really want 4 or 8 more years of obama ?
really ?
