let s play a fun game called , what the hell did nancy just say ?
every time nancy opens her mouth , she proves that president trump s election has caused her and her dingbat counterpart rep. maxine waters to become completely unhinged.here is the transcript from nancy pelosi s most recent appearance at the peter g. peterson foundation s 2017 fiscal summit .
can someone please tell us exactly what nancy is trying to say here ?
talk about russia s undermining our elections .
they did it .
thisss .isss ( mumble , mumble ) isn t any question .
they hacked , they leaked , they disrupted .
the question is , was there collusion between the ( mumble ) campaign and the next .
you can t know until you have the full-fledged ( mumble mumble ) .

too bad she doesn t even know the nra isn t part of the intelligence community :
