It s no secret that Hillary Clinton is deeply concerned about what Donald Trump is doing to America.
However, as a former major party presidential candidate, she cannot openly and directly criticize him or his administration without looking like a sore loser.
That, however, has not stopped the former Democratic presidential nominee from openly signalling that she is opposed to Trump and his policies.
In fact, in a recent video, Hillary championed women more loudly than before, praised the Women s Marches around the nation and world.
She also made a bold and direct declaration: The Future is Female.
The video was made for the 2017 Makers Conference.
Hillary said in her videotaped speech: We need strong women to step up and speak out.
Just look at the amazing energy we saw last month as women organised a march that galvanized millions of people in our country and across the world.
Now more than ever we need to stay focused on the theme of this year s conference: Be Bold.
She ended with an uplifting and inspiring message for women and girls everywhere, as well as other vulnerable communities, who may be worried about their futures under the tyranny of the Trump White House: So please, set an example for every women and girl out there who s worried about what the future holds and wonders whether our rights, opportunities and values will endure.
And remember, you are the heroes and history makers, the glass ceiling breakers on the future.
Hillary is right.
This is why #TheResistance is so important.
Trump is a threat to our future, but it is the responsibility of the people to be the guardians of our own democracy.
Listen to Hillary we are the future.
Trump is one man, and he doesn t represent us.Watch the brilliant video below: Yes, the future is female.
@HillaryClinton.
The 2017 #MAKERS Conference is LIVE now!
