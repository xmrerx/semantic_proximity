Michael Savage is a very well known radio talk personality.
The Savage Nation is a nationally syndicated talk show that is the second most listened-to radio talk show in the country with an audience of over 20 million listeners on 400 stations across the United States.Earlier today he was discussing his perspectives on the presidential debate and giving examples of current and anticipated debate bias.In addition, the broadcaster began discussing Hillary Clinton s mysterious health condition that Savage believes might be Parkinsons.Almost immediately, and without any notification, New York (tri-state area) radio station WABC-Radio TV cut Savage off the air and replaced him with the lesser rated Curtis And Cooby Show.Shortly thereafter, as Michael Savage discovered the issue and began discussing what was going on in/around the New York broadcast area, all Savage affiliates nationwide cut off the broadcast and replaced the live transmission with a recording of a previous show.
