It appears that someone has possibly hacked the GOP s official Twitter account.
On Wednesday evening, they sent out an absolutely crazy tweet that simply cannot be real.
The account, @GOP, tweeted that the party is better with a pretty much guaranteed Donald Trump nomination.
Considering the massive fracturing and panic going around in GOP circles right now due to Trump s divisive bid for the presidency, one would think that the GOP establishment wouldn t be too happy that he seems to be in it to win his way to Pennsylvania Avenue in November.
Here is the tweet:Thank you to the entire Republican field for a hard fought race.
The Party is better for your efforts.

Here are just a few:.
@GOP The party is better?

There s no way that the GOP establishment believes that Trump is a good thing for their party or for the country.
He s an obnoxious, violent, thin-skinned spoiled brat.
All of that aside, he s also nothing but a reality television personality.
That does not = presidential material.
Being rich and famous does not make one fit to occupy the Oval Office.Congratulations, dumbass Republicans.
You ve effectively allowed that buffoon to make your party into a laughingstock around the nation and the world.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
