belfast ( reuters ) - the head of northern ireland s democratic unionist party , which is propping up british prime minister theresa may s government , on friday called for any brexit transition period to be kept to a minimum and accused the eu of trying to damage britain .
in some of her most anti-eu comments since she agreed her 10 members of parliament would support may , arlene foster said in a statement that she believed aggressive eu negotiators ... seem determined to do as much damage as they can to the uk .
the dup campaigned to leave the european union during last year s referendum .
but 56 percent of northern ireland voters supported remain , and foster has tended to shy away from hard brexit positions .
northern ireland is widely seen as the region with the most to lose if customs barriers are introduced between britain and the eu .
foster described may s friday speech in florence , in which she called for britain to stay in the single market under its current terms for around two years , as a positive vision .
any transition period should be for the absolute minimum period , she said .
the wishes expressed in the referendum should be delivered without undue delay .
