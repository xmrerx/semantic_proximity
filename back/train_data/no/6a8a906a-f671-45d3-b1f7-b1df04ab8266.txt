istanbul ( reuters ) - turkey intends to open an embassy in east jerusalem , president tayyip erdogan said on sunday , days after leading calls at a summit of muslim leaders for the world to recognize it as the capital of palestine .
it was not clear how he would carry out the move , as israel controls all of jerusalem and calls the city its indivisible capital .
palestinians want the capital of a future state they seek to be in east jerusalem , which israel took in a 1967 war and later annexed in a move not recognized internationally .
the muslim nation summit was a response to u.s. president donald trump s dec. 6 decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital .
his move broke with decades of u.s. policy and international consensus that the city s status must be left to israeli-palestinian peace negotiations .
erdogan said in a speech to members of his ak party in the southern province of karaman that turkey s consulate general in jerusalem was already represented by an ambassador .
god willing , the day is close when officially , with god s permission , we will open our embassy there , erdogan said .
jerusalem , revered by jews , christians and muslims alike , is home to islam s third holiest shrine as well as judaism s western wall - both in the eastern sector - and has been at the heart of the israeli-palestinian conflict for decades .
foreign embassies in israel , including turkey s , are located in tel aviv , reflecting jerusalem s unresolved status .
a communique issued after wednesday s summit of more than 50 muslim countries , including u.s. allies , said they considered trump s move to be a declaration that washington was withdrawing from its role as sponsor of peace in the middle east .
