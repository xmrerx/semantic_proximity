cox s bazar , bangladesh ( reuters ) - wild elephants trampled sleeping rohingya refugees in bangladesh in the early hours of saturday , killing three children and a woman in the second such incident since the arrival of hundreds of thousands of refugees from myanmar in just a few weeks .
many trees on the forested hills of balukhali in southern bangladesh , where the incident took place , have been chopped down to house the massive influx of rohingya muslims escaping violence in neighboring myanmar .
tarpaulin and bamboo shelters have been built on elephant walkways in some areas , sparking environmental concerns , as the country struggles to accommodate an unprecedented number of people .
besides those killed , four refugees from neighboring tents were injured and were in critical condition at sadar hospital in cox s bazar , the town s additional superintendent of police afrujul hoque totul told reuters .
at the refugee camp , cooking utensils the family had brought from myanmar lay crushed under a jumble of bamboo sticks and clothes .
abdul sukoor , 30 , whose tent on the edge of the camp was also trampled , said he and his family managed to escape when they heard the screams of other refugees as the elephants approached .
he is now moving to a tent further inside the camp , but said he was still worried .
we have to be constantly alert at night , he said .
more than 530,000 refugees from myanmar have fled to bangladesh over the last two months since attacks by rohingya militants on security posts triggered a myanmar army operation that the united nations has described as ethnic cleansing .
