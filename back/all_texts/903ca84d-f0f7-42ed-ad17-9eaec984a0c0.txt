Republican Congressman Charlie Dent represents a district with one of the largest Syrian refugee populations in the country, and he is not happy about Trump s Muslim ban.
He spoke to The New York Times Jonathan Martin, saying: I urge the administration to halt enforcement of this order until a more thoughtful and deliberate policy can be instated.
One of Dent s constituents is a family that was detained in Philadelphia, despite having all the necessary paperwork, including green cards, to enter the country.
This has been the story all over the U.S. people held, or even turned around, despite having all of the necessary legal paperwork to enter the U.S.And there are protests erupting all over the place because of this.
People are demanding U.S. Customs release those they ve detained, even though Customs officials have to follow Trump s edicts.But Dent seems to be primarily alone in his party.
Republicans on Capitol Hill seem to be keeping their mouths shut on the issue, probably because they thought it was a good idea and now can t admit they might have been wrong about what would happen.
Or they re still delusional.
The New York Times Glenn Thrush said they haven t been this quiet since the last positive jobs report under Obama.
The few that have spoken about it say it s necessary to prevent terrorists from entering the U.S., but what they re totally missing is that this is just going to provide more fodder for radical elements like ISIS to recruit new members.
It also splits families up, prevents people from coming home even if they live here perfectly legally, has already sparked backlash from Iran, and is an overall mess.One immigration expert calls this illegal because of a 1965 law that prohibits discriminating against people based on their race, sex, nationality, place of residence, or place of birth.
So where are Republicans?Except for Dent, they seem to be hiding.Featured image by Pete Marovich via Getty Images
