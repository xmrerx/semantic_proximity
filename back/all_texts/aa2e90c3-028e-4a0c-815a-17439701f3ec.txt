After Beyonc released her song Formation and then performed it at the Super Bowl, it left many reactionary conservatives attacking her for being anti-police.
However, she s now clearing the air once and for all, and has something very important to say.Beyonc told Elle in a recent interview: I mean, I m an artist and I think the most powerful art is usually misunderstood.
But anyone who perceives my message as anti-police is completely mistaken.
I have so much admiration and respect for officers and the families of officers who sacrifice themselves to keep us safe.
Although, she s not apologizing for putting the spotlight on police brutality, especially how much they ve gone after people of color.
She said: But let s be clear: I am against police brutality and injustice.
Those are two separate things.
If celebrating my roots and culture during Black History Month made anyone uncomfortable, those feelings were there long before a video and long before me.
I m proud of what we created and I m proud to be a part of a conversation that is pushing things forward in a positive way.
And she is absolutely correct.
Police brutality and injustice are very real, and need to be talked about as part of the national conversation.
Nothing is going to change if we ignore the problem and submit to the status quo.
Far too many people of color are being gunned down in the streets, or taken into custody for literally no good reason, but rather for just existing while black, and several people have actually died in custody.
It s not okay.
It s never okay.
And it needs to be discussed.Good on Beyonc for speaking up, speaking her mind, and not backing down.
She s absolutely on point and her bravery for bringing police brutality into the national spotlight in such a widespread way should be applauded, not torn down by people scared to see the truth.Featured Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images
