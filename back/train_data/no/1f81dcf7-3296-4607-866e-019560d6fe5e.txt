says the women whose whole life has been a series of lies.hillary clinton on sunday effectively dismissed her two remaining white house rivals , suggesting that she s better vetted and tested than democratic primary opponent sen. bernie sanders and that presumptive republican nominee donald trump is only pretend successful .
i have been vetted and tested , the democratic front-runner and former secretary of state said on nbc s meet the press .
clinton also suggested that the vermont senator has not had a negative ad against him during the primary and said , i am going to be the nominee .
i m in a much stronger position , and voters who have given me 3 million more votes think that as well .
clinton repeated what she has said in recent days , we re stronger together , a likely reference to the acrimony between the clinton and sanders campaigns and supporters , as sanders keeps alive his longshot white house bid.recalling how she stayed late into her failed 2008 primary race against now-president obama , clinton said that sanders , campaigning hard this weekend in california ahead of the state s june 7 primary , has every right to finish off his campaign however he chooses .
she also appeared to dismiss trump s business success , the centerpiece of which is his real estate holdings , in an apparent attempt to get him to release his tax returns .
she compared him to business people who are really successful , instead of pretend successful .
