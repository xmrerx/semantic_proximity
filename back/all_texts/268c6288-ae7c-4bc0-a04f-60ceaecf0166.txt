Meryl Streep and Viola Davis weren t the only ones who blasted Donald Trump at the Golden Globes.Dr.
Gregory House, also known as British actor Hugh Laurie, also won an award on Sunday night for his role in The Night Manager and used about one minute of his speech to mock Trump and Republicans.As we all know, Trump and his Republican fans hate the press, foreigners, and Hollywood.
So seeing as how the Golden Globes are put on every year by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, it s safe to say the Golden Globe Awards is not their favorite at all.And during his acceptance speech, Hugh Laurie absolutely torched Trump and the Republican Party.
Thank you first to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association for this amazing honor, Lauire began.
I suppose it s made more amazing by the fact that I ll be able to say I won this at the last ever Golden Globes.
I don t mean to be gloomy, it s just that it has the words Hollywood, Foreign and Press in the title.
To some Republicans, even the word association is slightly sketchy I accept this award on behalf of psychopathic billionaires everywhere.
Here s the video via YouTube:As previously mentioned, Meryl Streep and Viola Davis also delivered blistering messages to Trump.
But so far, Trump has only thrown a temper tantrum over Streep s speech, calling her overrated and a Hillary flunky on Twitter.
Seriously.Many conservatives are whining about the Golden Globes, claiming that it s inappropriate to deliver political speech at an awards show.
But the First Amendment says otherwise.The Golden Globes is a platform that reaches millions of Americans so it s the perfect place to make a political stand that will be seen and heard.
If Donald Trump and his conservative supporters don t like that, they can go f*ck themselves.Featured image via Wikimedia
