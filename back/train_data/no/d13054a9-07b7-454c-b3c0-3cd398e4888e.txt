the hague ( reuters ) - a dutch businessman convicted in april of selling weapons to ex-liberian president and warlord charles taylor was arrested in south africa on a dutch warrant , officials said on friday .
blood timber trader guus kouwenhoven was sentenced as an accessory to war crimes for providing arms to taylor s government in violation of a u.n. embargo .
kouwenhoven , 75 , has been living in cape town and had refused to return to the netherlands for trial , citing health problems .
he was not present at the trial .
dutch prosecution spokesman bart vis said kouwenhoven would appear before a judge in south africa on friday and a court there would rule later on the dutch extradition request .
known in liberia as mister gus , kouwenhoven ran two timber companies in the west african state in 2000-03 and used them as cover to smuggle arms , according to the dutch court that sentenced him to 19 years in prison .
at the time , liberia was in the grip of a civil war between then-president taylor s government and several rebel factions .
liberia s string of conflicts since the 1990s left an estimated 250,000 people dead .
thousands more were mutilated and raped and all sides in the conflict used child soldiers .
taylor stepped down in 2003 .
he was arrested in 2006 and in 2012 sentenced to 50 years in prison for aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring sierra leone by the special court for sierra leone .
