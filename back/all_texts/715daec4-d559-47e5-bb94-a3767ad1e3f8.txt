Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer has been pushing for Donald Trump to negotiate with him and his fellow Democrats on health care.
On Wednesday, he renewed his calls for Trump to work with him in an open, bipartisan way.
I have a challenge for @POTUS.
It s simple: let s move forward on #healthcare in an open, bipartisan way.

During a photo op at the White House with the Chicago Cubs, ABC News Jon Karl asked Trump if he d be willing to negotiate with all of them.
Trump s response was to slam Schumer, because, of course it was.I better find out if he s serious.
He hasn t been serious.
Obamacare is such a disaster, such a wreck, and he wants to try and save something that s really hurting a lot of people He d have to be very, very serious.
You know, he s done a lot of talking, bad talking, and he just doesn t seem like a serious person.
Trump, who is a freaking reality show star, seriously has the nerve to sit there and say that Schumer doesn t seem like a serious person?
The absurdity of this statement and the irony of who is saying it is enough to make your brain hurt.
And as usual, it all goes right over Trump s head.You can watch Trump s latest attack on Sen. Schumer here:Featured image via Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images
