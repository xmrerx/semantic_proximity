new delhi ( reuters ) - indian prime minister narendra modi plans to reshuffle his cabinet over the next two days and some mid-level ministers have offered to quit to pave the way for changes , sources in the party and aides to the ministers said .
a revamp of the cabinet has been on the cards for months because some ministers are holding multiple portfolios which is seen as a drag on efficiency .
modi is also seeking to improve governance before he seeks re-election in 2019 .
with economic growth slowing to its slowest pace in three years , modi is coming under pressure to deliver the promises he made in 2014 .
there was no official announcement of the cabinet revamp but sources reuters spoke to said if it took place it would have to be done before modi leaves on a foreign tour on sunday .
the death of environment minister anil madhav dave and the election of minister for urban development m. venkaiah naidu as vice-president opened vacancies , giving modi an opportunity to bring in members from regional political parties .
according to four party sources , sanjeev balyan , minister of state for water resources , rajiv pratap rudy , minister of state for skill development and entrepreneurship , kalraj mishra , minister of micro , small and medium enterprises , and mahendra nath pandey minister of state for human resource development have all offered to resign .
