After the FBI declined to charge Hillary Clinton of any wrongdoing in the email scandal conservatives have been frothing at the mouth about for years now, Sarah Palin threw an even bigger temper tantrum than Donald Trump did.In a long rant on her Facebook page, Palin literally called upon conservatives to tear down this tyrannical system because Hillary Clinton was not charged with committing any of the crimes conservatives imagined she committed.
It s a farce that no one is above the law and my heart goes out to all who ve been unjustly accused and destroyed over much lesser crimes than Hillary s, Palin wrote.
We MUST redouble efforts to restore the rule of law that had sustained the most exceptional nation on earth, with everyone doing their part After telling conservatives to brainwash their kids and annoy anyone who will listen about how Hillary somehow orchestrated the FBI s decision, Palin whined about all the scandals President Obama and Hillary Clinton have gotten away with and accused Congress of being complicit.Letting Hillary skate today is no surprise when the team she s on has celebrated its administrators pleading the fifth, over and over again, sending messages to America that they re all above the law.
From the IRS s Lois Lerner to Hillary herself testifying in front of Congress, they ve all told Congress to kiss off, and Congress kissed off.Today s FBI forgiveness of tyrants illegal acts illustrate purpose in why I insist Americans rise up and tear down this tyrannical system that is destroying America from within.
Truly, you re either with us or you re against us.Palin concluded her rant with a message to Republicans who refuse to blindly support Donald Trump by referring to them as traitors.
Message to all the Republican elites throwing in for Hillary, boasting they ll stay home instead of vote because their particular weakened good ol boy is not the GOP nominee (the R.A.T.s suffering chappedass because their power and purse are threatened by the grassroots movement to destroy their failed politics-as-usual), Hillary thanks you.
She knows she can t win without you.And then she included a bunch of anti-Hillary memes that repeatedly refer to Clinton as a criminal or a crook as well as images that bring up other imaginary scandals Republicans wasted time and money investigating only to find zero evidence to support their claims.Here s the full post via Facebook.It must be truly exhausting using the few brain cells she has left whining all the time just because she and her conservative trailer park fans didn t get their way.But that s why she s known as America s village idiot.Featured image via Flickr
