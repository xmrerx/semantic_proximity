sheriff clarke : barack obama for seven plus years has played the race card that every time somebody criticized him it was because he was black and it scared off a lot of republicans .
so now they re going to switch and try to play the gender card .
problem is the american public is tired of this class warfare .
the reason why they don t like mrs. bill clinton is not because she s a woman .
it s because she s dishonest and because she s hiding something .
she s hiding the truth .
she tries to play herself off as a victim like she s little red riding hood but she s more like the big bad wolf .
as soon as you turn your back on her , she ll bite you .
look this is politics .
it s a contact sport .
it s not for the faint of heart .
