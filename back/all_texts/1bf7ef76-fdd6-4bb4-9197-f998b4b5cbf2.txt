Apparently being the daughter of the most corrupt political couple in America comes with some pretty significant financial benefits Politico reported last year:When Hillary Clinton s speaking fees proved too steep for one public university last year, school officials reached for a less expensive alternative: her daughter, Chelsea.According to a report from The Washington Post, representatives from the former secretary of state s office gave officials at the University of Missouri-Kansas City a $275,000 quote for a one-time speaking fee.
Yikes!
one official emailed another, according to the report.
Rather than paying that much, UMKC opted to pay Chelsea $65,000 for a brief appearance in February 2014.
The former first daughter spoke for 10 minutes before participating in a 20-minute Q&A session and posing for pictures.
For a sample of what that $65,000 might have bought the university, check out the clip above of Chelsea recently on the campaign trail bashing Trump.At one minute, the former first brat thinks this is worth $6500 of a public s schools money.What s that about wage equality, Clinton spawn?
