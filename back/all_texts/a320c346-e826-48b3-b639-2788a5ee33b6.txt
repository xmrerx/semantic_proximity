The things that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump says and does seem completely indefensible, but ABC News Anchor David Muir somehow found a reason to protect Trump for one of his most horrific qualities: his blatantly obvious racism.
And unfortunately for him, he did it in front of the WRONG person.On Wednesday night, Muir interviewed Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren at the Democratic National Convention to talk about her ongoing feud with the brash Republican nominee.
In asking Warren about Trump s latest attack on her in which he (once again) called her Pocahontas, Muir basically baited the iconic liberal into calling Trump a racist and then criticized her for telling the truth when she did.When Muir asked Warren if Trump calling her Pocahontas was racist, Warren had responded: Donald Trump has proven that he is a thin-skinned racist Muir scolded her and said, But is that calling him a name, too?
It was the wrong thing to say to Warren, because she fired back with pure logic and gave him the education that he so desperately needed.
She said: No, it fits the facts.
Come on.
Then she provided, off the top of her head, a list of some of Trump s greatest, most racist hits: Look at what he has said about Mexicans.
Look what he has said about Muslims.
Look what he says over and over.
As a matter of fact, you don t have to quote me on this.
When he had rulings against him over Trump University he tried to attack the judge on the basis of his Mexican-American heritage.
Muir should really be thanking Warren for helping him put a childish nickname and an actual prejudice and human rights offense into perspective.
There is no defending Trump for all of the disrespectful things he has said about minorities, and we all need to be better educated in calling his bigot remarks out instead of brushing them off, or worse yet, likening them to smaller offenses.You can watch Warren school Muir in the clip below:Featured image via screen capture
