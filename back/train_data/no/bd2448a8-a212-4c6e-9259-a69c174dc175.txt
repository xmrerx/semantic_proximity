washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. envoy for north korea will travel to japan and thailand next week to discuss how to increase pressure on pyongyang after its latest ballistic missile test , the u.s. state department said on friday .
north korea , formally called the democratic people s republic of korea ( dprk ) , last week tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile ( icbm ) , saying the device could reach all of the united states .
joseph yun , the u.s. special representative for north korea policy , will travel to japan and thailand dec. 11-15 to meet government officials to discuss ways to strengthen the pressure campaign following the dprk s latest ballistic missile test , the state department said in a brief written statement .
the united states looks forward to continuing its partnership with both these nations so that the dprk will return to credible talks on denuclearization , it added .
tensions have risen markedly in recent months over north korea s development , in defiance of repeated rounds of u.n. sanctions , of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the united states .
last week s missile test prompted a u.s. warning that north korea s leadership would be utterly destroyed if war were to break out .
the pentagon has mounted repeated shows of force after north korean tests .
the united states has sent mixed signals about its interest in talks with the north , with secretary of state rex tillerson saying that washington was pursuing such contacts but president trump tweeting that this was a waste of time .
