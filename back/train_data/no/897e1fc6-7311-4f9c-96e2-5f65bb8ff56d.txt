it seems only natural that donald trump , the lowest rated president in modern history , should have extremely unpopular policies to match how much americans refuse to support him.aside from his disgustingly racist travel ban , there s another policy that americans overwhelmingly despise the american health care act , also known as trumpcare .
while it s been widely known that americans prefer obamacare ( the affordable care act ) much more than trump s shady , disastrous alternative , the real numbers prove to be worse than originally thought .
it turns out , one poll states that over 75 % of americans don t want trump s heath care plan to get anywhere near them and their loved ones.this recent poll cited that the american public s support for trumpcare is only 23 % , which basically means that trump is screwed if he thinks he can get this health care bill to take the place of obamacare .
almost half ( 48 % ) of americans stated that they were against trumpcare , with most ( 43 % ) responding that they were strongly opposed to it.so while trump likes to brag about all this winning he s doing , we have yet to see it reflect in the american public s opinion of him and his policies .
people are passionately resisting trumpcare , and have even taken to gop town halls to openly protest against and condemn gop lawmakers who are trying to help trump take out obamacare.trump may not want to admit it , but he s dying in the polls .
it s also been reported that only 29 % of americans felt trump was right to fire fbi director james comey , and 78 % of the public wanted the russia investigation to be handed off to an independent commission.the more trump tries , the more he fails .
as time goes on , we can only expect his approval rating to continue on its downward slope as he makes more horrible decisions for the country.featured image is a screenshot
