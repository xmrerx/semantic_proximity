this past friday at one o clock in the morning , 18 senate republicans joined all of the democrats in voting to bust the budget caps and to completely suspend the national debt limit until march of 2017.these republicans , led by senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ( r-ky ) , surrendered to president obama and gave him an unlimited credit card for the remaining 15 months of his term.republican senators : lamar alexander ( r-tn ) kelly ayotte ( r-nh ) john barrasso ( r-wy ) shelley moore-capito ( r-wv ) thad cochran ( r-ms ) susan collins ( r-me ) john cornyn ( r-tx ) lindsey graham ( r-sc ) orrin hatch ( r-ut ) mark kirk ( r-il ) john mccain ( r-az ) mitch mcconnell ( r-ky ) lisa murkowski ( r-ak ) pat roberts ( r-ks ) mike rounds ( r-sd ) john thune ( r-sd ) thom tillis ( r-nc ) roger wicker ( r-ms ) + every democrat senatorthis debt vote is significant because it is the 20th time in the past 10 months that the new republican majority allowed a bill to pass that was supported by a majority of democrats and opposed by a majority of republicans.if you didn t know otherwise , you would think the democrats still controlled the senate .
senator ted cruz ( r-tx ) was right when he said mcconnell is the most effective democratic leader in modern times .
it s no surprise that a new gallup poll found that more republican voters now view mcconnell unfavorably ( 35 % ) than view him favorably ( 30 % ) .
republicans are beginning to see that he doesn t share their values.senator mcconnell has broken so many promises and betrayed the party s core principles so often that more democrats now approve of the republican-controlled congress ( 13 % ) than republicans ( 9 % ) .all of this is causing many senate republicans to question mcconnell s leadership .
rather than looking out for their political interests , he continues to pressure them to support unpopular liberal legislation.take actionif you have not cast your vote of no confidence against senator mcconnell , please click here to add your name.also , please call the 18 republicans who voted with all of the democrats to give president obama an unlimited credit card for the next 15 months.click here for a list of their phone numbers.tell them that you re disappointed in their vote and will be working to replace them with a true conservative.it s very important that these senators see strong opposition to their debt limit vote so they will be less inclined to betray us next time .
