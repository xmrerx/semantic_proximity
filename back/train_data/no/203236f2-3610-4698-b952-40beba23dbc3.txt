ankara ( reuters ) - the united states has primed a bomb in the middle east with its decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital , turkish prime minister binali yildirim said on thursday .
yildirim said turkey s stark differences with washington , which have already strained ties between the nato allies , meant that an overwhelming majority of the turkish people were now unsympathetic toward the united states .
the united states has pulled the pin on a bomb ready to blow in the region , yildirim told a conference in ankara .
president donald trump on wednesday reversed decades of u.s. policy by recognizing jerusalem as the capital of israel and promising to move the u.s. embassy there .
following the decision , hundreds of protesters gathered outside the u.s. consulate in istanbul ; on thursday , there was a heavy police presence with uniformed soldiers patrolling the roof .
today , more than 80 percent of our citizens are cold towards the united states and they are right to be so , yildirim said , without giving a source for the figure .
bilateral relations had already been hurt by washington s support for the syrian kurdish ypg militia , seen by ankara as an extension of the kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) , which has for decades waged an insurgency against the turkish state .
in addition , ankara has been angered by the united states refusal to extradite u.s.-based muslim cleric fethullah gulen , whom it accuses of orchestrating last year s attempted military coup .
u.s. officials say the courts have not been shown sufficient evidence to extradite gulen , who has denied any involvement in the coup .
turkey also says the case of turkish-iranian gold trader reza zarrab , who is on trial in new york and cooperating with u.s. prosecutors , is an attempt to discredit it and undermine its economy .
zarrab has pleaded guilty to helping iran avoid u.s. sanctions and detailed a vast international money laundering scheme .
