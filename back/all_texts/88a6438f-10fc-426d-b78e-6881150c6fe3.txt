STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven easily survived a parliamentary vote of no confidence brought on Friday by the anti-immigration Sweden Democrats over a botched IT outsourcing project that may have led to the leak of sensitive information.
Only 43 of the parliament s 349 members supported the motion.
Had Lofven lost, the government would have resigned, just a year before a general election.
Two ministers have resigned over the potential leak of sensitive data as a result of a deal under which IBM Sweden took over some IT functions of the Swedish Transport Agency.
During the last 37 years, only eight votes of no-confidence have been tabled in parliament.
None has been successful.
