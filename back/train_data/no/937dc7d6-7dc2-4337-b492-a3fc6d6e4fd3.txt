moscow ( reuters ) - russian property developer sergei polonsky , who has been convicted of defrauding investors , plans to run in next year s presidential election , his campaign manager said on wednesday .
polonsky is one of russia s most flamboyant tycoons , known for once eating his tie after losing a wager and for pouring scorn on anyone worth less than a billion dollars .
he is a divisive figure , with many russians viewing him as a symbol of capitalist excess .
russian president vladimir putin is the strong favorite to win the election , opinion polls show , though he has yet to announce his intention to run .
maxim shingarkin , a former member of the russian parliament , said he had signed up to be polonsky s campaign manager .
sergei polonsky has confirmed that he is running for president of russia , shingarkin said in a twitter post .
i can promise a bone-rattling election campaign .
russian news media quoted polonsky as saying he was planning a presidential bid .
in july a moscow court found him guilty of fraud but allowed him to walk free , saying that too much time had elapsed since the crime for the sentence to have legal force .
he had spent two years in detention in moscow awaiting trial .
it was not immediately clear if polonsky s conviction would disqualify him from running for the presidency .
other people planning to run in the presidential election in march next year are television personality ksenia sobchak , whose late father was putin s boss in the early 1990s , and journalist ekaterina gordon .
