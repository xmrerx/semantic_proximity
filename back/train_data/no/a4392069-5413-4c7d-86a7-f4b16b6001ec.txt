dr. ben carson is brilliant , good-hearted , a true american patriot , and one of the most honest candidates to ever run for president .
he stayed above the fray , yet still managed to hit back hard when it came to the leftist media .
he made a positive contribution to the field of gop candidates and made some very good observations about what needs to be done to heal a broken republican party .
although he is soft-spoken , he didn t mince words or concern himself with political correctness .
he is a true champion of the unborn and does more on his own to help students in poor communities than every democrat politician combined .
he challenged the media and the elitists in his own party .
his wisdom and courage will be missed by many .
