AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - The Dutch government on Friday raised its estimate of casualties caused on the Dutch part of the island of Saint Martin by Hurricane Irma to two dead, one of natural causes, and 43 wounded.
Of those wounded, 11 are in critical condition, Interior Minister Ronald Plasterk said at a press conference.
The island suffered widespread damage in the hurricane, including severe damage to homes, stores, ports, airports, gas stations and power stations.
Two hundred Dutch soldiers are assisting on the island from two nearby ships as it struggles to restore its airport and main harbor in order so that it can receive more aid.
