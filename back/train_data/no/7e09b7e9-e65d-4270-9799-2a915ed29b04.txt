odebrecht was set to travel to sao paulo to begin his house arrest under electronic surveillance on tuesday , according to the federal court in parana .
a representative for the former executive said he remained committed to collaborating with authorities under a leniency deal .
odebrecht was first sentenced to 19 years in prison in one of the many cases related to car wash. that was reduced to 10 years after he signed a leniency deal last december in exchange for paying a nearly $ 2 billion fine , admitting guilt and providing evidence to authorities .
he has already served two-and-a-half years in prison .
under the deal , he must serve another two-and-a-half years under house arrest .
he will then be permitted to leave his home for work for another two-and-a-half years .
he will then be required to do community service for the rest of his 10-year sentence .
separately tuesday , brazil s antitrust watchdog cade said it was investigating two alleged cartels involved in bidding for sao paulo infrastructure projects after receiving information provided by odebrecht executives .
