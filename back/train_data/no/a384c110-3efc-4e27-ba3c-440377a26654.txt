marawi city , philippines ( reuters ) - philippine teachers on tuesday gave families returning to the destroyed lakeside city of marawi a course on how to identify unexploded bombs in their homes and warned them to stay clear .
the five-month battle to retake marawi from pro-islamic state rebels left the city in ruins .
the government announced the end of military operations on monday in the country s biggest security crisis in years , allowing rebuilding and rehabilitation efforts to begin ..
the teachers taught children and their parents how to recognize live mortar shells , grenades , aircraft rockets and improvised explosive devices in their villages .
security forces used artillery bombardment and air strikes to flush out the gunmen who endured 154 days of the offensive by stockpiling huge amounts of weapons , including bombs .
warnings from the teachers included drawings of inquisitive children hammering bombs and trying to set them on fire .
this helps us parents to understand and tell our children not to touch or get near the bombs , said sobaida sidic , a housewife attending the training .
authorities said 920 militants , 165 troops and police and at least 45 civilians were killed in the conflict , which displaced more than 300,000 people .
lominog manoga , a principal at a school in marawi overseeing the training , said it was important to teach people the risks .
philippine president rodrigo duterte had declared marawi city liberated last week , even though fighting was not actually over .
on sunday , he said it was important to be vigilant because no country could escape islamic state s clutches of evil .
