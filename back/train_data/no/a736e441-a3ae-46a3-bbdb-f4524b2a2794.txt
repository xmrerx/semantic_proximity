astana ( reuters ) - kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev threatened on wednesday to sack his cabinet if they failed to make large state companies bring back cash held abroad .
nazarbayev , who wields sweeping powers in the oil-rich nation , also poured scorn on executives in private sector companies who , he suggested , were enjoying lavish lifestyles while keeping funds in foreign accounts .
enough of toying around , look at them , carried away with their games , keeping their money abroad , buying yachts and mansions in multiple countries , he said at a meeting with central government and regional officials .
it is safer to keep money here , at home , we will ensure it is safe .
nazarbayev ordered prime minister bakytzhan sagintayev to investigate why state-controlled companies had tripled their foreign cash holdings to $ 6 billion in the first half of 2017 .
he did not cite a source for that figure .
if you fail to do this , i warn you in front of the whole kazakhstan , i will use other ways to return that money to kazakhstan , but you will not be here any more , he told his cabinet .
nazarbayev said he also expected private sector companies to move cash back , citing tengizchevroil , a joint venture led by chevron , and state firm kazmunaygaz , as examples of groups keeping funds in foreign accounts .
tengizchevroil $ 4.5 billion , national company kazmunaygaz - $ 3 billion , kazmunaigas exploration and production - $ 2 billion .
again , he did not give a source for those figures .
tengizchevroil said it would comment later this week and kazmunaygaz could not immediately be reached for comment .
why are you doing this ?
you keep your money there while profiting from kazakhstan s resources .
why is this money not being put to work in kazakhstan ?
nazarbayev said .
citing central bank data , he said some companies had also abused liberal foreign exchange regulations to delay the transfer to kazakhstan of $ 7.7 billion in export revenue .
