GAZA (Reuters) - Two Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants riding on a motorcycle in Gaza were killed in an explosion on Tuesday which the group implied was caused by an accidental detonation during preparations for an attack.
Israel s military denied accounts by local residents that the militants were killed in an air strike.
Violence along the Israel-Gaza border has flared since U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition last week of Jerusalem as Israel s capital and the Israeli military s demolition on Sunday of a cross-border tunnel it said was dug by Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the small coastal enclave.
On Monday, Israel s Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepted a rocket fired by militants in Gaza.
Shortly afterward, Israel responded with tank fire and air strikes targeting positions of Hamas.
In a statement after Tuesday s explosion, Islamic Jihad said: We mourn the men - martyrs of preparation .
The group usually employs the term to refer to casualties caused by the accidental detonation of weapons or explosives used in attacks against Israel.
