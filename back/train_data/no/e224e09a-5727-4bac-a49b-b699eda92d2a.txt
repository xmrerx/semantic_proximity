khartoum ( reuters ) - a sudanese general and nine soldiers were killed in clashes in the war-damaged region of darfur on sunday after their vehicles were ambushed by militants , state news suna reported on monday .
conflict in darfur erupted in 2003 when mainly non-arab tribes took up arms against sudan s arab-led government and has led to intermittent clashes ever since , though the government announced a unilateral ceasefire last year .
fresh clashes erupted on sunday following a military effort by government forces in the southern darfur region to collect weapons from militants , suna reported .
defence minister ali mohamed salem said that prominent darfur militia leader musa hilal had been arrested and the situation in darfur was now stable following the clashes , according to suna .
