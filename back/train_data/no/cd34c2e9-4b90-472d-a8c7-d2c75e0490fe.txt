clinton foundation drew intense protests for scheduling the wife of a palestinian terrorist to speak at a clinton global initiative dinner .
the foundation saw nothing wrong with this and defended their decision : hanan al-hroub is a beacon of hope in a part of the world that is very dear to me and in desperate need of more hope , said haim saban , a major clinton foundation donor , according to the wall street journal .
i only wish more people honored her and the cause that she embodies .
haim saban has deep roots in egypt and is a controversial figure who totally bought access to the hillary clinton during her time as secretary of state : between 2009 and 2013 , as hillary clinton served as secretary of state , the saban family foundation paid the clinton foundation more than $ 7 million , and listed $ 30.5 million in grants and contributions approved for future payment , according to nonprofit records filed with the internal revenue service .
it s unclear whether there was any overlap between the $ 7 million paid and $ 30.5 million committed to the clinton foundation in those years.what kind of message does this send to the people of israel who had six of their citizens murdered by the acts of this woman s husband ?
hanan al-hroub , this year s winner of the global teacher prize , is scheduled to speak at the dinner despite the fact that her husband , omar , served 10 years in an israeli prison for providing chemicals used in a 1980 terror bombing attack that killed six israelis .
this was apparently no big deal to the clinton foundation even as the u.s. investigates the weekend bombings in new jersey and new york , as well as the stabbing spree that occurred in a minnesota mall .
the decision to honor the wife of a terrorist by hillary clinton s foundation shows a complete lack of judgment and a callousness that should disqualify her from holding the presidency .
foundation donors were quick to defend the invitation of al-hroub .
