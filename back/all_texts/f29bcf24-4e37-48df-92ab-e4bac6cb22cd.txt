After an awful campaign filled with hateful rhetoric, American voters elected a man to lead the most powerful country on earth even after he was accused of raping a 13-year-old.
The year was 2016 and the accused was an alleged billionaire, former reality show star and an admitted sexual predator.
Still, even after the revelations, conservatives saw nothing wrong with Donald Trump s behavior.
The plaintiff described the horrifying incident in which Trump and his friend Jeffrey Epstein allegedly raped a child.
A lawsuit was filed which claims that threats were made in order for the victim to keep her mouth shut about what had just happened.Both Defendants let Plaintiff know that each was a very wealthy, powerful man and indicated that they had the power, ability, and means to carry out their threats.
Indeed, Defendant Trump stated that Plaintiff shouldn t ever say anything if she didn t want to disappear like Maria, a 12-year-old female that was forced to be involved in the third incident with Defendant Trump and that Plaintiff had not seen since that third incident, and that he was capable of having her whole family killed.There was a witness who backed up Jane Doe s claims.
According to the lawsuit, Trump and Epstein sexually and physically abused the then 13-year-old plaintiff and forced her to engage in various perverted and depraved sex acts including being forced to manually stimulate Defendant Trump with the use of her hand upon Defendant Trump s erect penis until he reached sexual orgasm, and being forced to engage in an unnatural lesbian sex act with her fellow minor and sex slave, Maria Doe, age 12, for the sexual enjoyment of Defendant Trump after luring her to a series of underage sex parties by promising her money and a modeling career, according to Snopes.Trump has admitted knowing Epstein for 15 years.
Epstein was named in multiple similar lawsuits, served 13 months in jail, and is registered as a sex offender for life.The lawsuit which was filed in California on April 26, 2016, was dismissed over technical filing errors and it was refiled in June of the same year, then dropped again in November after the plaintiff received death threats.Last year, Trump was also accused by 16 women of sexually harassing or assaulting them.
Conservatives went on to elect him knowing full well that he is a sexual predator because he said so in the Access Hollywood tape.History will not be kind as it remembers November of 2016.Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images.
