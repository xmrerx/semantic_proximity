brasilia/rio de janeiro ( reuters ) - the government of brazil s president michel temer is far from assembling the coalition needed to pass a landmark pension reform , but potential supporters of the measure are now more organized , a key legislator said on monday .
we re still enormously far ( from having the needed votes ) , but we have a party leader committed , a party president committed , one party that s set to commit , brazil s lower house speaker , rodrigo maia , told journalists after an event in rio de janeiro .
pension reform is the cornerstone policy in president temer s efforts to bring brazil s deficit under control .
but the measure is widely unpopular with brazilians , who are accustomed to a relatively expansive welfare net .
in order to curry support from congress , temer and his allies watered down their original proposal in november , requiring fewer years of contributions by private sector workers to receive a pension .
according to several government sources , temer s allies have grown more optimistic in the last week about the reform s chances .
however , speed is essential for the bill s passage .
a congressional recess begins on dec. 22 , and lawmaking thereafter will be hampered by politics , as lawmakers ramp up their campaigns for 2018 elections .
