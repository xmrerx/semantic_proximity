It looks like Donald Trump is having another really bad week.
As Americans are coming to grips with the threat of terrorism, gun violence and homophobia after the attack in Orlando, they are also turning their backs on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.Never mind that the majority of Americans disapprove of how he handled the Orlando situation, a new poll from the Washington Post (the media outlet Trump banned from his camping) shows that Trump s unfavorability rating has reached a record high of 70 percent.As the Post notes: Trump s negative rating is higher now than Clinton s ever have been, even at her highest in unpopularity.
According to the findings:The poll finds 70 percent of Americans have an unfavorable view of Trump, including a 56 percent majority who feel this way strongly.
Negative ratings of Trump are up 10 percentage points from last month to their highest point since he announced his candidacy last summer, nearly reaching the level seen before his campaign began (71 percent).Only 29 percent of Americans have a favorable view of Trump.Here s the damage Trump has done to himself:Trump is even losing support from his biggest base of support: uneducated white men:Among registered voters, Trump s unfavorable mark exceeds Clinton s by 13 points (69 percent vs. 56 percent), a break from a Post-ABC poll last month finding both candidates standings even at 57 percent unfavorable among this group.Negative views of Trump have risen among a wide range of groups, jumping by double digits among liberals and conservatives and among both Republican women and Democratic men.
But his standing has also worsened among two key voting groups: independents and white Americans who do not have a four-year college degree.It looks like the nation is waking up to Donald Trump, and seeing once and for all the mistake that has been made.
