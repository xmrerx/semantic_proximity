This is another example of a thug randomly attacking someone in broad daylight.
The woman lied and said she was defending herself but it was all caught on videotape so the truth was right there.
The fact that onlookers just stood there and watched because police had been called is so wrong.
What if this was your father or grandfather?
You can see on the video below that this woman was full-on assaulting this 73-year old man.
