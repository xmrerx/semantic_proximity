the united states just experienced its worst mass shooting in history .
fifty members of the lgbt community were gunned down in a gay nightclub in orland0 , florida while 53 more were taken to the hospital , many with life threatening injuries.the assailant , a muslim man yielding an ar-15 assault rifle , was allegedly ( according to his father ) incensed after seeing two men kiss , and a rage brewed inside him.and now that the carnage is over , millions have offered their thoughts and prayers .
included in those thoughts and prayers are the phony and hackneyed prayers from the very people who 99 percent of the time , side with guns over people s lives : republicans.from senators to governors to members of the house ( the same people who voted against lgbt equality and for near total gun rights ) , republicans offered their thoughts to the victims and their families.but the deputy director of the center for american progress action fund , igor volsky , reminded the people why the gop s thoughts and prayers are just that and nothing else : we pray you will have the courage to stand up to @ nra and start national conversation about limiting access to guns https : //t.co/aeq1yjw3pd igorvolsky ( @ igorvolsky ) june 12 , 2016 sen @ tomcottonar received $ 2,581,794 in expenditures from nra , so he voted against closing terror gap back in dec https : //t.co/xeovjhjl5d igorvolsky ( @ igorvolsky ) june 12 , 2016 .

thoughts and prayers mean nothing if you aren t willing to change the system.senate republicans allowed people on terrorist watchlists to have guns .
the orlando shooter was on such a list .
republicans can not be taken seriously and their thoughts are empty and their prayers mean nothing.featured image via ethan miller/getty images
