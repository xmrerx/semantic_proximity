The possibility of Donald Trump being elected President of the United States represents a clear and present danger to the global economy, according to a new report from economists a Citigroup.The election of Trump could easily trigger a meltdown, they say.
A Trump victory in particular could prolong and perhaps exacerbate policy uncertainty and deliver a shock (though perhaps short-lived) to financial markets, a team led by chief economist Willem Buiter wrote in the Thursday note.
Tightening financial conditions and further rises in uncertainty could trigger a significant slowdown in U.S., but also global growth.
According to Citi, a conservative estimate of what would happen to the economy should Trump become president implies that global GDP growth could fall easily below its benchmark of 2% for a global recession.By comparison, the economists said Hillary Clinton winning would likely keep the American and world economies growing at the steady rate they are growing at.
A recent report from the credit reporting agency Moody s also saw the Trump campaign as a threat towards the world economy.Objective analysis of stock market returns has shown that they perform better under Democratic presidents than with Republican ones.
Of the last five presidents, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has done better with Clinton and Obama than Reagan and the two Bushes.
The only president to have the market at a lower number than when he first came in is George W. Bush.Many of Trump s economic team are former members of Bush s inner circle but Trump has failed to offer much in the way of substance about his economic plans if elected.
He, instead, has more often than not simply shot off his mouth to whatever television journalists he was speaking to at the moment.Trump has indicated an unusual willingness to go after America s international allies, most notable NATO, while espousing support for the regime of Russia s Vladimir Putin.Featured image via Flickr
