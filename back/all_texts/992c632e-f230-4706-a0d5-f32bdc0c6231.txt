Former Subway spokesman and outed pedophile Jared Fogle is rotting in prison where he belongs, but the scandal surrounding the man who made his fortune by hawking sandwiches for the Eat Fresh chain is far from over.
The whole world knows that the man is a sick old kiddie diddler, but thus far we haven t been privy to the extent of his depravity.
That all comes to an end now, though.The Daily Mail has revealed text messages that Fogle exchanged with a pimp, asking for a 14-year-old girl.
According to TMZ, the texts offered $400 for sex with little girls: I ll pay you big for a 14 or 15-year-old, Fogle said to the pimp.
He goes on to ask, Do you have any access to any young girls?
Like 15 or 16?
When the pimp inquires as to why Fogle was asking about young girls, he responds, Because that is what I crave.
If that s not sick enough for you, Fogle not only paid for sex with youngsters, he also was caught with a boatload of child pornography, involving as many as 12 innocent children.
Hell, even his childhood obesity foundation was nothing more than a way for him and another pedophile he worked with to have access to kids.
Luckily, for those children and for the authorities, an informant actually recorded his descriptions of his disgusting proclivities.Hopefully, this horrible man rots for his entire prison sentence and then some.
He is a menace to society and should never be let out for the sake of innocent children everywhere.Watch the video below, of the informant describing her recorded conversations with Fogle:Featured image via Joey Foley/Getty Images
