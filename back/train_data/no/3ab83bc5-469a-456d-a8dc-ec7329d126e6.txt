luanda ( reuters ) - angola s constitutional court rejected on wednesday an appeal by the largest opposition party to annul the results of last month s election , which gave a landslide victory to the ruling mpla party .
in a 38 page court document , the constitutional court said the evidence presented by the national union for the total independence of angola ( unita ) did not prove there were any irregularities or biases in the electoral process .
the ruling is final and can not be appealed .
a spokesperson for unita said the party did not have any immediate comment .
the people s movement for the liberation of angola ( mpla ) won the aug 23 vote with 61 percent , with unita second on 27 percent .
unita had argued that in multiple provinces the results presented by the national electoral commission differed considerably from their own tally , alleging the results were not the product of local vote counting but were instead centrally engineered .
the constitutional court dismissed this argument , saying the polling station tallies presented by unita did not show any bias against the party .
