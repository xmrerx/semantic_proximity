it s one thing to have the media constantly painting police officers in a bad light on a near daily basis .
but it s entirely another thing to have civilians discriminating against them on completely illegitimate grounds .
this is exactly what happened this week when jim chambers , owner of the eav barbell club in atlanta , posted a sign on the front of his gym forbidding police officers.the message that the sign conveys alone is upsetting .
but the expletives included make it an even more shocking and vulgar .
while the sign is no longer posted on his gym s door , chambers continue to stand by it .
we ve had an explicitly stated no cop policy since we opened , and we also don t open membership to active members of the military , he said.as a lifelong political activist , chamber says that his sign and policy serves as a political statement .
he says groups who work out there are generally minorities who are uncomfortable with the presence of law enforcement agents .
chambers claimed that if any police officials had a warrant , they could do their job but that he is not breaking the law .
chambers insists that they never have , and won t ever need the help of officers .
he plans to put the no cop sign back up without the foul language.when asked to comment , lawyers found the policy strange , but said because law enforcement officers are not a protected class under the law , only the courts can decide if eav barbell club is violating any anti-discrimination laws .
when asked to comment on the incident , the atlanta police department stated , were we to respond to an emergency there , this sign would not stop us from lawfully doing our job .
