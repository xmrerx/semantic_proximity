washington ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump said on friday he was preparing to call british prime minister theresa may after a home-made bomb on a london train injured 22 people .
trump , who spoke briefly with reporters before going into the oval office , said he had been briefed on the attack , which police called a terror incident , calling it a terrible thing .
asked about a friday morning tweet in which trump said the u.s. ban on travelers from certain countries should be more specific , trump said : we have to be tougher and we have to be smarter .
( this story corrects third paragraph to show trump was referring to the u.s. travel ban in his quote , not the london attack . )
