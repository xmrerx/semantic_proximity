tripoli ( reuters ) - twenty eight bodies with bullet wounds and torture marks were discovered on saturday in an area west of libya s capital that has recently seen clashes between rival armed factions , a local human rights group said .
ahmad hamza , of libya s national commission for human rights ( nchr ) , said that the victims were fighters opposed to government-aligned coalition forces , who had been arrested before they were killed .
locals found the bodies near a road in the town of alhira , 60 kilometers ( 37 miles ) southwest of the capital tripoli , hamza said on sunday .
the town is in the wershafana area , where fighting broke out last week when a coalition of forces nominally aligned with the internationally recognized government in tripoli launched a campaign against rival armed groups , including loyalists of former libyan leader muammar gaddafi .
the victims families had not been allowed to receive the bodies for reasons that are not known , hamza said .
according to the fact-finding , monitoring and documentation section of nchr , there are signs of torture and they ( the victims ) were shot in the chest and head , he said .
the wershafana region has been largely cut off from the capital for several years and has become notorious for violence and criminal activity .
the military council of zintan , a town southwest of tripoli that is participating in the campaign against rival armed groups , had said it aimed to deal with murder , kidnapping and acts of barbarism in the region .
there was no immediate comment from the zintan military council after the bodies were discovered .
the recent fighting displaced about 480 families , although around 100 have since returned to their homes , according to local authorities .
libya has been in turmoil since gaddafi was ousted in a nato-backed uprising in 2011 , with loose armed alliances and rival governments vying for power .
