brussels ( reuters ) - belgium will set up an english-language commercial court to deal with disputes between international companies to make the most of britain s plan to leave the european union .
the brussels international business court ( bibc ) will seek to take on cases that are so far handled by british courts or international arbitration tribunals , the belgian government said on friday .
cases in belgium s regular courts are heard in french or dutch .
the government said the demand for arbitration was likely to grow because of brexit .
the same brexit means moreover that going to a court in london might not be an appropriate option , it said , without giving a date for the start of the english-language hearings .
bibc will be presided over by sector specialists and parties will have to agree in advance to let the court settle their differences .
they will not be able to appeal against the decisions .
the development of the european union can not be slowed down by brexit .
our country uses this opportunity to offer a new judicial instrument , belgian prime minister charles michel said in a statement .
some companies , such as lloyd s of london , the world s largest specialty insurance market , have already picked brussels as their european base in order to retain access to the eu market after britain leaves the bloc in 2019 .
