Brilliant just brilliant Remember when Disney s ESPN punished Trump for his remarks about illegal aliens and moved their annual golf outing from Trump s golf course as a punishment for his views?Do you remember when ESPN cut Hank Williams theme song from Monday Night Football after making an analogy to Adolf Hitler when talking about Barack Obama?Remember when their own little ESPN barbie made international news after berating a woman in a parking garage for simply doing her job?https://youtu.be/Pz1XY18_D3gRemember when ESPN decided to give the Arthur Ashe Courage Award to Bruce (refers to himself as Caitlyn ) Jenner only months after killing an innocent woman in a car crash over a young girl who stole the hearts of America when she played college basketball with terminal cancer to inspire others to keep fighting?Remember when Bob Costas was hailed by ESPN s Pardon the Interruption, co-host Michael Wilbon, who gave NBC Sports Bob Costas a standing and loud ovation for using his Sunday Night Football halftime show to espouse his pro-gun control views?Well Now it s Red Sox great, Curt Schilling s turn to feel the wrath of ESPN, as he s been fired for a tweet about muslims by the sports propagandist arm of the Disney Corporation.Because my enemies are legion (and not terribly bright), let s get this out of the way: It is wrong to compare Muslims to Nazis.
Baseball great Curt Schilling did not do that.
In a Tweet that resulted in a pandering suspension from the left-wing sports network ESPN, Schilling compared Muslim extremists to Nazis.Comparing Muslim extremists to Nazis is not wrong, it is science.ESPN knows this but ESPN (which is owned by Disney) has grown into an increasingly ugly, left-wing propaganda machine.
What should be America s Pleasure Island away from political division sports has been destroyed by ESPN.
All that Disney money is now being used to buy all that sports programming that makes tens of millions of sports fans captive to The Realpolitik.Have you had enough?How much of this abuse are you going to take?How much of this abuse are you going to take before you do something?Oh, you didn t know you had The Power to do something?Well, you do because your cable company and ESPN have been playing you for a sucker for decades.Before I get to The Three Easy Steps, here s how the cable television/ESPN racket works:If ESPN is part of your cable package and it most likely is whether you watch or not, this leftwing propaganda outlet soaks you for $6.61 a month.No, for real.By working out a pay TV system (cable and satellite) that forces you to pay for dozens of networks you do not watch, ESPN (and other left-wing networks like CNN, MTV, and MSNBC) gets a piece of your obscenely-overpriced cable bill.Moreover, no other cable network makes more money this way than ESPN.
And with somewhere around 90 million subscribers, that adds up to close to $7 billion annually.And $80 a year comes from you.In other words, you can t hurt ESPN by not watching ESPN.
Ad revenue based on the number of viewers is only a part of ESPN s revenue stream.ESPN s got you in a box.
Watch or no, they make buku off you.There s only one way to send a message to ESPN, and you have the power to do it in just Three Easy Steps.Call your cable company.
Cancel your cable.
Sit back and watch ESPN implode.Listen, I m not a sports guy, so I can t answer the question of whether or not watching The Games are worth funding The Apparatchik.
What I can tell you is that with the purchase of a $49 Roku (which is essentially a cable box) an extraordinary Streaming world awaits a world that is a whole lot cheaper than cable.For $20 you can subscribe to Netflix and Amazon.
Not only is there more TV than you could watch in a lifetime, unlike cable, there is not 20 minutes of catheter ads every hour.You have the power to send ESPN a message.Make the call.Via: Breitbart News
