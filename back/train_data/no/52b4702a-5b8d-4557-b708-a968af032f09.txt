no wonder america loves this guy so much .
it s been a long time since we had a leader who made his enemies look like amateurs after gawker , an online site released one of donald trump s cellphone numbers today .
gawker claims they released trump s number because he released the phone number of political opponent and rino sen. lindsey graham ( r-sc ) .never one to let a good opportunity go to waste , trump changed his voicemail to a free campaign announcement for anyone who cares to call his number : hi , this is donald trump and i m running for the presidency of the united states of america , he says on the recording .
with your help and support , together we can make america truly great again !
visit me at twitter @ realdonaldtrump and check out my campaign website at www.donaldtrump.com hope to see you on the campaign trail , we re going to do it !
gawker responded by saying : we think it s only fair and right that republican primary voters be able to reach out to trump himself .
