frankfurt ( reuters ) - a german nurse serving a prison sentence for murdering two patients is suspected of killing a total of 102 people , more than previously known , police and public prosecutors said on thursday .
that would make him germany s deadliest serial killer if he was found guilty .
the man , identified only as niels h. under reporting rules , has admitted to deliberately injecting patients at two clinics in northern germany with deadly drugs and then trying to revive them in order to play the hero .
he has confessed to some killings , but police said in august that he could not remember all the details of his actions , prompting them to exhume the remains of 134 people with links to niels h. to identify further victims .
the investigation has now turned up evidence leading authorities to suspect niels h. killed 38 people at a clinic in the northern german city of oldenburg and 62 at one in nearby delmenhorst , oldenburg police and the city s public prosecutor s office said in a statement on thursday .
that is in addition to two counts of murder for which an oldenburg court sentenced him in 2015 .
police said in august he was suspected of killing 84 other people in addition to those two and that the toll may rise as toxicology reports were examined .
it could rise further still , the statement said on thursday , as police were seeking for the remains of some people to be exhumed in turkey .
it said the prosecutor s office was likely to bring charges against niels h. early next year .
ten years ago , a german nurse was convicted of killing 28 elderly patients .
he said he gave them lethal injections because he felt sorry for them .
he was sentenced to life in prison .
in britain , dr. harold shipman was believed to have killed as many as 250 people , most of them elderly and middle-aged women who were his patients .
known as dr. death , shipman was sentenced to 15 life terms in 2000 ; he died prison in 2004 , apparently a suicide .
