washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. senate on thursday passed legislation placing a permanent ban on states ’ taxing internet access , sending the measure to president barack obama for signing into law .
by a vote of 75-20 , the senate gave final approval to a bill toughening enforcement of u.s. duties on foreign goods , which contains the permanent extension of the “ internet tax freedom act. ” the measure also would ban some taxes on digital goods and services and will put an end to a series of temporary extensions on the tax prohibitions .
“ most americans pay $ 0 in taxes to connect to the internet .
and thanks to a bill that passed today , you will never have to pay taxes just to get online , or pay more taxes for goods and services just because they ’ re bought online , ” democratic senator ron wyden said in a statement .
the legislation , however , fails to address calls for better enforcement of state sales tax collections related to internet purchases , something that brick-and-mortar businesses have long sought .
separate legislation on this could be considered by congress later this year , according to senate aides .
most u.s. states have imposed sales taxes on online purchases , but the actual collection is spotty .
