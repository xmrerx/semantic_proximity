Huma Abedin is ready to tell all for a cool $2 million.
A nice pay day for a side kick to one of the most corrupt political families in American history.
The problem is she ll NOT tell all but tell what she wants to tell.
It ll be a woe is me tale of marital infidelity.
Her perv husband Anthony Weiner will be her co-star in this tale of woe Gag!
Does anyone really want to rehash the disgusting behavior of this former congressman who was caught fooling around and sexting while he was watching his son.
Ewww!What we REALLY want to hear about from Abedin we know she won t tell us because she probably should be on the stand to tell of the corruption with the Clintons.
