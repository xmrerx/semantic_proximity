washington ( reuters ) - kristie kenney , a former u.s. ambassador to thailand , the philippines and ecuador , was named on friday as the state department ’ s new counselor , succeeding tom shannon , who has been confirmed as under secretary of state for political affairs .
kenney ’ s appointment makes her one of the most senior women foreign service officers in the united states , secretary of state john kerry said in a statement naming her to the position .
shannon ’ s nomination had been delayed mainly by senator ted cruz ’ s opposition to the iran nuclear deal reached last july by six major world powers , including the united states , and iran .
