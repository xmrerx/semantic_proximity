Some, including a former Romney 2012 official, are even supporting Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton just to keep Trump out of office.
That is how bad it is.There s now one more Republican to add to that list: Rep. Scott Rigell (R-VA).

Rigell has been firmly #NeverTrump for quite some time, and vocally so.
In his latest blasting of his party s nominee, Rep. Rigell spoke with TIME Magazine, and said the following:Featured image via Jeff Swensen/Getty Images
