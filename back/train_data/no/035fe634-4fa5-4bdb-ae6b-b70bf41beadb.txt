donald trump must be feeling pretty damn humiliated right about now.it s one thing to call out the media for getting something wrong , but it s another when you are accusing them of misquoting you simply because you didn t bother to read an article all the way through.on thursday , trump frightened the world by declaring his intention to expand america s already over-bloated nuclear weapons capabilities.the united states must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) december 22 , 2016apparently , trump is so narcissistic that he reads about himself when something he says makes the news .
but as he was reading an article written for nbc about his remarks , trump became enraged because nbc allegedly only printed part of the quote .
and , of course , he whined about it on twitter .. @ nbcnews purposely left out this part of my nuclear qoute : until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes .
dishonest !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) december 24 , 2016except that nbc didn t misquote trump at all .
in fact , it turns out trump misread the article , assuming he read it at all .
had he read the third paragraph slowly , he would have found his full quote.in other words , nbc was being the opposite of dishonest while trump lied .
and he was apparently so outraged that his misspelled the word quote .
this is the danger of trump .
he just got busted smearing the media for something that didn t happen .
he lied about nbc and sullied their reputation on purpose , which frankly should result in a defamation lawsuit against trump.but twitter quickly stomped him for it .
@ realdonaldtrump @ nbcnews spell check , my man .
spell check .
