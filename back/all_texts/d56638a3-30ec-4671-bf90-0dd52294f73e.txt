BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said on Tuesday he approved of Austria s coalition agreement, saying he would judge the government of Christian Democrats and the far-right Freedom Party by its deeds.
As is the case with all governments, we will assess the Austrian government by its deeds, Juncker told a news conference in Brussels, after meeting with Austria s new Chancellor Sebastian Kurz.
Juncker said he believed the coalition agreement showed Austria was on a pro-European path.
