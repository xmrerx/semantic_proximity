berlin ( reuters ) - the chief of staff to german chancellor angela merkel said he was optimistic that the parties exploring forming a government together would reach agreement despite failing to achieve a breakthrough in overnight talks .
interviewed on ard television on friday , peter altmaier said he was confident that merkel s conservative camp , the pro-business free democrats and the greens could overcome divisions on migration and climate change policy , but declined to say how long it would take .
we negotiated the whole day yesterday , and that s not a bad sign - it shows that we take the task seriously and want to come together , he said .
i don t want to say tomorrow or the day after , but i believe the problem is solveable .
