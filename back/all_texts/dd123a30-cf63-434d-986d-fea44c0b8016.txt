Who doesn t love George Takei well, aside from Donald Trump at the moment.
The Star Trek actor noticed that The Donald attacked President Obama a man Trump admitted on Friday for the first time to be a legitimate American citizen for campaigning for Hillary Clinton and, well, let s just say Mr. Sulu wasn t willing to let it slide.
Why isn t President Obama working instead of campaigning for Hillary Clinton?
Trump tweeted Tuesday.On Friday, Takei responded, and not in a way that is likely to get him invited to The Donald s home for dinner.
As Commander-in-Chief, he is sworn to protect us from threats both foreign and domestic, Takei wrote.
You, sir, are the latter.
Trump as a domestic threat is not exactly off-base.
In fact, analysts have determined that the 2016 GOP nominee is a global threat.
They say that he poses a greater risk than terrorism coincidentally, one of Donald Trump s favorite fear-mongering talking points.It isn t just President Obama s duty to defend us against threats like Trump.
It s all of ours., and we have the most powerful weapon available: the ability to vote.
The ability to, as a nation, say no to everything Trump represents.Be sure to head to the polls on November 8 the future of our nation depends on it.Featured image via Getty Images (Matt Hayward)/screengrab
