Following the end of every term for the Supreme Court, SCOTUSblog, which is in no way run by the Supreme Court, inevitably finds itself under attack from people who disagree with the rulings.
Many of the trolls who are on the warpath are, predictably, conservatives, and they re attacking in part because they think that SCOTUSblog s Twitter account is the official Twitter account for the Supreme Court.SCOTUSblog could handle this by ignoring it.
They don t. They d rather have fun with the trolls, especially when they re trolled so hard that their account gets suspended.
They ve done this for several years without a problem, and they even warned everyone in the Twitterverse about what they were going to do.You have one minute to unfollow us before we fill your Twitter feed.
SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 27, 2016The Supreme Court only has eight justices this year, which could have resulted in tied votes on a lot of cases.
Thanks in part to Justice Anthony Kennedy, who has long acted as a swing vote on the bench, many of these decisions were actual decisions.
In the spirit of the situation, SCOTUSblog decided they should explain what was really going on, considering these trolls seriously mistake them for the Supreme Court.
#BREAKING: facing constitutional crisis, in an unprecedented move, a blog was named to the empty ninth seat on the Supreme Court.
SCOTUSblog (@SCOTUSblog) June 27, 2016After a couple of false starts, the trolling commenced with some conspiracy silliness.
From there, it was mostly downhill for the trolls, and fun for SCOTUSBlog.We have no comment on the claims we are illuminati.

This is especially true when the trolls think you re someone you obviously aren t. It s almost a shame this only happens once a year.Featured image by Gabriella Demczuk/Getty Images
