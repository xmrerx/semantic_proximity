if facebook has aligned themselves with germany to restrict the free speech of its users , what makes us so sure they won t do the same thing in the us with obama or ( god forbid ) a hillary presidency ?
and wouldn t germany be better off focusing their policing efforts on the over 1 million freeloaders and terrorists they ve just admitted into germanista ? police in germany have started carrying out raids in peoples homes in an attempt to prosecute people for inciting hate speech on facebook.a press release from germany s federal police agency confirmed that around 60 homes were searched this week as a result of people posting messages deemed as extreme by the german authorities .
the action carried out today shows that the authorities are acting firmly against hate on the internet , which has grown considerably in the wake of the refugee situation , said holger m nch , head of the bka , said in the statement .
attacks on refugees are often the result of radicalization , which begins on social networks .
these words should not poison the social climate , he continued.the move comes after it was revealed in january that mark zuckerberg had teamed up with german chancellor angela merkel in order to censor people s frustrations with her migrant policy , when she decided to open up germany s borders to millions of migrants last year.facebook consequently introduced a policy where they agreed to remove anything deemed as hate speech within 24 hours .
