AJ+ interviewed a group of fifth graders following the most recent republican debate.What these kids had to say about the way the supposed grown-ups behaved on the debate stage says it all.
You re adults, you re not children, one girl says.
I mean it s crazy, she continues, before burying her head in her hands, in exasperation.Eleven-year-old Colin Baird pointed out that the candidates are setting a terrible example for kids, saying, What if kids are seeing that on TV or something, thinking Oh, well, they re doing it, maybe I can.
As Addicting Info pointed out here, republican candidates habitually engage in behaviors no decent parent would want their child to imitate, like name-calling and bullying, not to mention arguing about whose penis is bigger.But unlike the GOP candidates, the kids in this video are clearly smart enough to know right from wrong.They were easily able to spot the bullying behavior they saw the candidates engaging in, and quick to call it out for what it is.When asked what a bully is, eleven-year-old Maura Sammis immediately answered by saying Donald Trump.
Another student responded by saying, I think a bully is someone who is deliberately trying to hurt somebody in some way, or make them feel bad.
Ten-year-old Oliver Andress might have summed it up best when he said, They all just want to get in the White House.
He added, They will play dirty.
Another student pointed out the differences she noticed between the democratic debates and the republican debates.
The democrats, they don t fight, she said.
All they do is talk about politics.
She goes to say, I don t want to hear about stuff that s about other people.
I just want to hear about politics.
The students in this video obviously know a lot more about acting like a grown-up than the candidates running for office on the GOP ticket.Watch the video below, courtesy of AJ+ on Facebook.
