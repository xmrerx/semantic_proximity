at the start of the fox news greg gutfeld show , gutfeld showed a hilarious clip mocking the hysteria of the democrat party .
gutfeld began his show by telling his viewers , i m really excited to introduce a new sponsor to our show .
it s a new drug .
it s called victima ' gutfeld went on to explain that the drug was created to help democrats who are feeling defeated after the brutal election of donald trump cope : when identity politics no longer work , try victima .america s been witnessing the embarrassing meltdown of liberals ever since president trump shocked the world with his stinging defeat of crooked hillary , so gutfeld decided to have a little fun by mocking the embarrassing behavior of the left.the voice in the commercial mimics the typical tv drug commercials with sappy music playing in the background : it s not what it used to be .
it used to be fine.the democratic party it s not performong.it s slow , sluggish , confused , prone to fits of despair .
it may be time for victima .
victims , when your old identity politics no longer work , victima gives you that added boost to get you to where you want to be .
when i take victima , i see everyone as a racist .
it really works .
watch : ironically , fox news fired bob beckel , the only liberal on the gutfeld show the day after this show aired , after he allegedly made a racist remark that offended a black employee working at fox .
hmmm
