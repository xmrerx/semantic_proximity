seoul ( reuters ) - south korea said on wednesday traces of radioactive xenon gas were confirmed to be from a north korean nuclear test earlier this month , but it was unable to conclude whether the test had been a hydrogen bomb as pyongyang claimed .
north korea conducted its sixth nuclear test on sept. 3 , prompting the u.n. security council to step up sanctions with a ban on the reclusive regime s textile exports and a cap on fuel supplies .
the nuclear safety and security commission ( nssc ) said its land-based xenon detector in the northeastern part of the country found traces of xenon-133 isotope on nine occasions , while its mobile equipment off the country s east coast detected traces of the isotope four times .
it was difficult to find out how powerful the nuclear test was with the amount of xenon detected , but we can say the xenon was from north korea , choi jongbae , executive commissioner , told a news conference in seoul .
the commission could not confirm what kind of nuclear test the north conducted , he added .
xenon is a naturally occurring , colorless gas that is used in manufacturing of some sorts of lights .
but the detected xenon-133 is a radioactive isotope that does not occur naturally and which has been linked to north korea s nuclear tests in the past .
the nssc also said the xenon traces detected had no impact on south korea s environment and population .
