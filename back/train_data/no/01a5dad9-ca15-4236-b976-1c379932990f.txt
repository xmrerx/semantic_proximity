geneva ( reuters ) - the syrian government s decision to quit peace talks last week was an embarrassment to its main supporter russia , which wants both sides to reach a deal quickly , opposition spokesman yahya al-aridi said on monday .
the delegation left the u.n.-backed talks in geneva on friday , blaming the opposition s demands that president bashar al-assad should play no role in any interim post-war government .
i don t think that those who support the regime are happy with such a position being taken by the regime .
this is an embarrassment to russia , aridi said at the hotel where the opposition delegation is staying in geneva .
we understand the russian position now .
they are ... in a hurry to find a solution .
there was no immediate comment from russian officials at the talks on the withdrawal of the government delegation .
russia helped to turn the syrian war in assad s favor and has become the key force in the push for a diplomatic solution .
last month russian president vladimir putin said a political settlement should be finalised within the u.n. geneva process .
the opposition , long wary of russia s role , now accepts it .
western diplomats say putin s syria envoy alexander lavrentiev was present at the riyadh meeting last month where the opposition drew up its statement rejecting any future role for assad .
asked if the opposition was willing to compromise on assad s role in any post-war government , aridi said his delegation s demands were based on the wishes of the syrian people .
i believe that our mere presence in geneva is in itself a compromise .
we are sitting with a regime that has been carrying out all these atrocities for the past seven years .
what other compromise could we make ?
a source close to government delegation told reuters on monday that damascus was still studying the feasibility of participation in the talks and when a decision was reached it would be sent through ordinary diplomatic channels .
