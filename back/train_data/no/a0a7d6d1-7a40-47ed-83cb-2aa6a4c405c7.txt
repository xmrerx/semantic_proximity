ankara ( reuters ) - the breakup of either iraq or syria could lead to global conflict , turkey s defense minister said on tuesday as turkish tanks deployed near the border with iraq ahead of a planned kurdish independence referendum .
a change that will mean the violation of iraq s territorial integrity poses a major risk for turkey , nurettin canikli said .
the disruption of syria and iraq s territorial integrity will ignite a bigger , global conflict with an unseen end .
turkey , with a large kurdish population of its own in the south of the country , fears that the independence referendum in iraq could embolden the outlawed pkk which has waged an insurgency in the southeast since the 1980s .
canikli said ankara could not allow the formation of an ethnic-based state in the south of the country .
nobody should have any doubt that we will take every step , make every decision to stop the growth of risk factors , he said .
