on this anniversary of roe vs wade , it is so important for americans to understand that just because 43 years ago today , a majority of supreme court justices ruled that women can legally kill the babies god placed in their wombs it s still the taking of a life remember the one that he did ?
that the baby the fetus came out , and it was alive and he had thought he had actually killed it already and the fetus opened up his eyes and grabbed his hand , his finger ?
a lot of times he would bring the big fetus that were over-age in a bag and we would say oh my g * d , that s a big baby !
it would take us over an hour to do an abortion that big .
the women that go there [ abortion clinic ] have no idea what they re getting themselves into .
and a lot of questions would want be , does the baby feel ?
and i would think it would make me so mad because i would say why does that matter to you , when you re coming in here to kill your baby ? '
