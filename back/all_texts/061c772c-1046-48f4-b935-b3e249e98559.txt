Conservatives have embraced the idea that every migrant trying to escape the Syrian Civil War is an Islamist terrorist operating in a sleeper cell who wants to blow up westerners or institute Sharia law.
The reality of the situation is that the people trying to escape this conflict are normal families that look like our own.One such child died trying to escape, and the following heartbreaking photo was taken:Shattering.

Forty-five bodies arrived in the southern Italian port of Reggio Calabria on Sunday aboard an Italian navy ship, which picked up 135 survivors from the same incident.German humanitarian organization Sea-Watch, operating a rescue boat in the sea between Libya and Italy, distributed the picture taken by a media production company on board and which showed a rescuer cradling the child like a sleeping baby.The rescuer, a music therapist, said he began to sing to comfort myself and to give some kind of expression to this incomprehensible, heart-rending moment.
He added, Just six hours ago this child was alive.
While President Obama has decided to accept more immigrants from the conflict, there is an extremely lengthy process for them to come to America, and we aren t accepting very many of them.
Republicans have pushed against even that meager number, and some governors have tried to bar migrants from entry (courts have ruled that such decisions are beyond their jurisdictions and they have no say in the matter).Until then, more will die like this infant, trying to escape the horror of war.Featured image via Twitter
