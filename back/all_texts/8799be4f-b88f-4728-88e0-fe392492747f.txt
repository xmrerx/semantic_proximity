If there s one person that Donald Trump can t STAND to have criticizing him, it s his predecessor, Barack Obama and Obama just attacked Trump in a way that was pretty damn genius.Last night, at a private event in Manhattan, the former POTUS reminded America of the amazing leader they lost when his second term was up.
As Trump continuously blasts him and takes credit for the many accomplishments that he worked hard for, Obama reminded the audience just how resilient and successful Obamacare is by pointing out that Obamacare now has a higher approval rating than the current president.According to CNN: As Republicans in Washington sputtered again this week in their efforts to undo the law, Obama noted to an audience in midtown Manhattan that the Affordable Care Act has never been more popular and it s more popular than the current president, according to a person in the room who paraphrased the comments.
We couldn t have thought of a better way to insult Trump and the Republican Party, especially as their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act continue to be a disastrous, embarrassing failure.Obamacare, which Trump repeatedly referred to as a disaster and jobs killer , isn t going anywhere thanks to its popularity and the GOP s failure to do any better.
Considering that Trump s approval ratings are at a historic low despite its honeymoon period, it s unlikely that any major piece of legislation that he tries to pass will be accepted.It s nice to see that after all the backlash and attacks from Trump and the Republican Party, Obama is reveling in his hard work.
The knowledge that his health care bill could not be taken down so easily and is now more appreciated by Americans than the idiot who replaced him in the White House, must be satisfying as hell and Obama has earned the right to gloat about it.Featured image via Zach Gibson / Getty Images
