united nations ( reuters ) - russia accused the united states of denying entry to a senior military official to conduct a joint russian and chinese briefing at the united nations on thursday that criticized u.s. missile defense systems as a global threat .
u.s. disarmament ambassador robert wood and jeffrey eberhardt , of the state department office of multilateral and nuclear affairs , walked out of the briefing within minutes of it starting in a conference room at u.n. headquarters in new york .
alexander emelianov , from the russian defense ministry international cooperation committee , said moscow had wanted to send a delegation led by lieutenant general tretyak andrey , russian armed forces chief of the general staff advisers group .
the entry visa was not given to them , emelianov told the few dozen diplomats attending the half-hour briefing .
the u.s. mission to the united nations declined to comment on individual visa cases or the russian and chinese briefing .
russia and china have long been critical of u.s. missile defense systems , particularly the deployment of the terminal high altitude area defense ( thaad ) in south korea amid heightened tensions with north korea over its ballistic missile and nuclear tests .
the russian federation is confident that the unlimited deployment of the u.s. anti-missile defense is a serious threat to the global security and can further unleash the arms race and threaten the entire humanity , emelianov told the briefing .
major general zhou shangping , deputy director-general of the operations bureau , the joint staff department of the central military commission , also briefed .
the deployment of the thaad system does little to upgrade the surveillance capability against the dprk ( north korea ) , but significantly enhances the capability to monitor china s strategic depth and russia s far east , zhou said .
china and russia have repeatedly demanded the united states halt the deployment of thaad in south korea .
