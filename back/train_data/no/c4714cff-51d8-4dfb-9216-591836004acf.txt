consortium news exclusive : the neocon royalty kagans are counting on democrats and liberals to be the foot soldiers in the new neocon campaign to push republicans and president trump into more regime change wars robert perry consortium news the kagan family , america s neoconservative aristocracy , has reemerged having recovered from the letdown over not gaining its expected influence from the election of hillary clinton and from its loss of official power at the start of the trump presidency.back pontificating on prominent op-ed pages , the family kagan now is pushing for an expanded u.s. military invasion of syria and baiting republicans for not joining more enthusiastically in the anti-russian witch hunt over moscow s alleged help in electing donald trump.in a washington post op-ed on march 7 , robert kagan ( photo , left ) , a co-founder of the project for the new american century and a key architect of the iraq war , jabbed at republicans for serving as russia s accomplices after the fact by not investigating more aggressively.then , frederick kagan , director of the critical threats project at the neocon american enterprise institute , and his wife , kimberly kagan , president of her own think tank , institute for the study of war , touted the idea of a bigger u.s. invasion of syria in a wall street journal op-ed on march 15.yet , as much standing as the kagans retain in official washington s world of think tanks and op-ed placements , they remain mostly outside the new trump-era power centers looking in , although they seem to have detected a door being forced open.still , a year ago , their prospects looked much brighter .
they could pick from a large field of neocon-oriented republican presidential contenders or like robert kagan they could support the establishment democratic candidate , hillary clinton , whose liberal interventionism matched closely with neoconservatism , differing only slightly in the rationalizations used for justifying wars and more wars.there was also hope that a president hillary clinton would recognize how sympatico the liberal hawks and the neocons were by promoting robert kagan s neocon wife , victoria nuland ( photo , left ) , from assistant secretary of state for european affairs to secretary of state.then , there would have been a powerful momentum for both increasing the u.s. military intervention in syria and escalating the new cold war with russia , putting regime change back on the agenda for those two countries .
