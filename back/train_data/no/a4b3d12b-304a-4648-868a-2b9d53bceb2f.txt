london ( reuters ) - iran has no need to increase the range of its ballistic missiles as they could already reach u.s. forces stationed in the region , the head of the revolutionary guards said on tuesday .
as u.s. president donald trump seeks to impose new sanctions against iran s missile program , major-general mohammad ali jafari said sanctions would only increase number of iranian missiles , and their precision .
trump this month refused to certify tehran s compliance with a deal struck with world powers to curb its nuclear program in return for lifting most international sanctions .
the house of representatives voted last week for new sanctions on iran s ballistic missile program and trump has urged u.s. allies to join washington in taking strong action to curb iran s continued dangerous and destabilizing behavior , including sanctions targeting its missile development .
our missiles range is 2,000 kilometers ( 1,200 miles ) , and that can be increased , but we believe this range is enough for the islamic republic as most of the u.s. forces and most of their interests in the region are within this range , jafari was quoted as saying by tasnim news agency .
americans are trying to impose new sanctions against the revolutionary guards for its missile program , but that is an excuse to harm iran s economy , jafari said .
iran has one of the middle east s largest missile programs and some of its precision-guided missiles have the range to strike israel .
the united states says iran s missile program is a breach of international law because the missiles could carry nuclear warheads in the future .
iran denies it is seeking nuclear weapons and says its nuclear program is for civilian uses only .
