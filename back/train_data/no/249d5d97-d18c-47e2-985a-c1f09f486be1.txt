yes , the democrats think it s a good thing to repeat the foul comment from their chair tom perez ( see video below ) .
remember he s going around saying the republicans don t give a sh * t about the people well , they think it s a great idea to put that on a t-shirt ! note the description : show republicans that you give a sh * t with this american-made t-shirt .
tom perez must not have taken the class about winning friends and influencing people .
how can you win over voters with such bitterness and anger ?
the democrat party has sunk to a new low with this classless thug .
who goes out there and speaks like this ? we reported ( see below ) on the last speech perez gave and he said the same nasty things .
what gives ?
are the deems so desperate that they re now resorting to profanity-filled speeches that make false claims about republicans and president trump ?
we think it s a losing strategy ! newly elected democrat chair tom perez went a little bonkers with a rant on how he wants the dems to think trump didn t win the election .
the democrats are trying to discredit trump at every turn but they re losing .
the american people want good policy and not political turmoil .
that s exactly why trump won !
people are sick to death of this type of outright lying to sway people to your side .
perez has a long radical history connected to la raza and other open borders organizations .
his track record is full on radical .
e s in cahoots with obama to continue the fundamental transformation of america .
anyone who s a democrat should be shocked that he s taking the party in such a far left direction .
do your research and you ll know why he was the choice for dem chair.he just fired all democrat party staffers and is bringing in all new people .
the party is clearly taking a new direction and it s not a good one for any american .
donald trump didn t win
