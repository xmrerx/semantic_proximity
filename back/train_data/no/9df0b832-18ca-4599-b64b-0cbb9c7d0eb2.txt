sean hannity is taking a page from trump s playbook .
when a member of the mainstream media or a person pretending to be a conservative commentator intentionally misrepresents you you strike back.that s exactly what hannity did .
@ megynkelly u should be mad at @ hillaryclinton clearly you support her .
and @ realdonaldtrump did talk to u. https : //t.co/vsqinmghut sean hannity ( @ seanhannity ) october 6 , 2016maybe megyn forgot about this exclusive interview with donald trump : https : //youtu.be/ugpvwdrlzcmfrom usa today : this election has sparked some heated exchanges between family , friends and co-workers and now between fox news hosts.conservative pundit sean hannity leveled what he might consider the worst insult imaginable at anchor megyn kelly in a tweet wednesday night , which said she clearly supports hillary clinton.the tweet was apparently in response to kelly comments earlier in the evening on the kelly file when she accused both presidential candidates of avoiding tough interviews .
they re both in their own version of a presidential protection program , kelly said .
she said clinton makes sure she is not in a place where she feels uncomfortable or anything unexpected could come at her , which is why she sat for a half an hour with mary j. blige , the singer , which is why she did entertainment tonight this evening .
but , kelly didn t stop there .
and donald trump , with all due respect to my friend at 10 o clock , will go on hannity , and pretty much only hannity , and will not venture out to the unsafe spaces these days , which doesn t exactly extend the tent .
trump has made several appearances on hannity s show and the fox news personality has been a vocal supporter of trump.h/t gp
