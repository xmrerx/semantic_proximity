the annual la pride parade and resist march was held on sunday .
bonkers rep. maxine waters led the crowd in a chant to impeach 45 .
at the end of her hateful rant she yelled out stay woke !
this is the definition of undignified and unprofessional ! notice how adam schiff stands in approval next to waters .
mind you , this is while waters is spewing hate speech towards our president and schiff is involved in the fake russia scam going on to try and take trump down : in fact , freedom watch filed an ethics complaint against intel committee member adam schiff for obstruction of justice : larry klayman of freedom watch on schiff : klayman discusses complaint against rep. adam schiff for obstruction of justice & ethics violationsisn t this a huge conflict of interest ?
it certainly doesn t look good and shows us that schiff is not to be trusted when it comes to anything trump.just in case you didn t hear the disgusting speech given by maxine waters : he is not my president .
he is not your president .
he lies .
he cheats .
he s a bully .
he disrespects us all .
if he thinks he can mess with the lgbt community , he better look at what happened right here in west hollywood .
you deny , you disrespect , and you will find that there are people who have the courage to organize and to take back whatever needs to be taken back .
we resist this president because he stands for the worst of everything .
and guess what , i know that people may not quite be ready .
i know some are a little hesitant .
i know some are saying i m not so sure , maxine , that what you are saying is the right thing , but i m saying , impeach 45 .
impeach 45 .
i love you all .
and i know that we are going to take our country back from him .
i know you have the strength .
i know that you have the courage .
i know that each of you knows you have the power !
stay woke !
