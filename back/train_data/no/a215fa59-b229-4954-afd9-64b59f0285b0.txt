new york ( reuters ) - connecticut will cancel pay raises for managers at state agencies after the latest projections suggest the state ’ s fiscal situation may be much worse than previously thought , top officials said on monday .
the canceled raises are an early indication of the harm done by the state ’ s fiscal crisis .
many more cuts are expected this year as officials struggle with a budget deficit that could be as high as $ 900 million in the coming fiscal year .
although high-profile , the amounts involved are largely symbolic .
the cancellations will affect 1,950 employees and represent savings of $ 12.74 million over two years .
the figure does not include pay freezes in the judicial branch .
connecticut has had to slash its revenue forecast because the weak stock market is cutting into capital gains tax receipts , which play a large role in the budget .
it also met resistance when it tried to raise taxes .
general electric moved its headquarters out of the state earlier this year .
“ we have a responsibility to the taxpayers of connecticut not to move forward with managerial raises at a time when so many state programs will see reductions and while many state jobs are likely to be eliminated , ” wrote ben barnes , secretary of the office of policy and management .
the letter was co-signed by brian durand , chief of staff to democratic governor dannel malloy .
a report last week from the non-partisan office of fiscal management said the deficit could be as high as $ 900 million in the next fiscal year , which begins on july 1 .
an earlier estimate from barnes ’ office put the deficit at $ 570 million .
most of the raises , which have already been postponed twice , would have been awarded on friday .
they will be suspended indefinitely .
