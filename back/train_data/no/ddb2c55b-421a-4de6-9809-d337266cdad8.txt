brasilia ( reuters ) - one of four ministers representing a centrist brazilian party in president michel temer s government resigned on monday , underscoring a rift between the embattled leader and one of his most powerful coalition partners .
bruno araujo said in a resignation letter that while he respected the autonomy temer had given him as head of the ministry of cities , his brazilian social democracy party ( psdb ) no longer supported him remaining in the position .
an intense internal debate within the psdb is playing out , with younger lawmakers urging it to abandon the scandal-plagued temer government and elders countering that support should be maintained to provide the stability for the nation .
in late october , however , government sources told reuters that temer planned to shuffle his cabinet and to push out psdb members after a majority of its lawmakers in the lower house of congress voted to put him on trial on allegations of corruption .
temer managed to avoid a trial .
members of the psdb have said that while they support the economic reforms of the temer government , they now consider him to be too fragile a leader to attempt an overhaul of the country s pension system , a move that is viewed as key to plugging the government s budget deficit .
the psdb also plans to stand its own candidate for the presidential election next october , and many of its members want to distance themselves from the deeply unpopular temer government to better their chances at the polls .
