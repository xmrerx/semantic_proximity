mexico city ( reuters ) - mexican president enrique pena nieto said on thursday that he would send a contentious new security law to the supreme court for review after signing it , and would not make use of it until the tribunal has ruled on its constitutionality .
the law , which the government says sets out the rules under which the armed forces can operate in the battle with organized crime , has sparked fierce criticism by opponents who fear it could open the door to more abuses .
acknowledging the concerns that have been stirred by the legislation , known as the law of internal security , pena nieto stressed that the supreme court will have the final say .
i m conscious this law that i will have to enact this afternoon is especially sensitive for the public life of the country , he said .
for that reason , i will not issue an internal security declaration in the terms of this law until the highest court has decided on its constitutionality .
the law was published in the government s official gazette on thursday afternoon .
multiple human rights groups and international organizations , including the united nations , have attacked the bill , mindful of cases of abuses by members of the military in mexico over the past 11 years .
in an address to security forces , pena nieto framed the law as a critical tool to combat mexico s drug-related violence .
2017 is set to be the country s deadliest year on record , as disputes between rival cartels fueled murders .
the challenges confronting our country in this area are great , and they mean that we can not pause , we can not make mistakes and we can not fail , he said .
critics of the law have cautioned that it could lessen the urgency to improve local law enforcement .
pena nieto reiterated his pledge to shift to a system of 32 regional police forces , rather than over 18,000 local units .
