shanghai ( reuters ) - police in southern china have detained seven people in connection with an underground banking scheme involving more than 20 billion yuan ( $ 3 billion ) , the state news agency xinhua reported .
from a suspicious bank account in shaoguan , a city in guangdong province , the investigation snowballed to involve a suspected 10,000 people and 148 accounts across more than 20 provinces , xinhua reported .
the suspects allegedly profited from changes in the exchange rates for yuan and hong kong dollars , it said without giving details .
the yuan , or renminbi , is not fully convertible and the government limits the amount of foreign currency to which individuals and businesses in china have access , which has given rise to networks of underground money changers and banks .
