stephen king ( @ stephenking ) september 12 , 2016and hilariously enough , cthulhu responded in the comments by taking offense at being compared to trump .
@ stephenking sorry , stephen , you couldn t be more wrong .
that clown has nothing on me .
https : //t.co/lhxy2ibln8 cthulhu for america ( @ cthulhu4america ) september 12 , 2016then some cthulhu fans jumped in .. @ stephenking i m sorry mr. king , but candidate cthulhu ( @ cthulhu4america ) is certainly not as duplicitous and fraudulent as trump is .
( ( ( ts valle ) ) ) ( @ tattoosandbones ) september 12 , 2016 @ stephenking @ dmalmon i don t see it .
cthulhu has a coherent , if unspeakable , program .
bill cameron ( @ bcmystery ) september 13 , 2016 @ stephenking that s offensive to our lord and saviour ?
roo morgue ( @ roomorgue ) september 12 , 2016 @ stephenking @ blueravefinn no , he s nowhere near competent enough to be cthulhu .
evil-yet-amazingly-stupid is not an elder god trait .
james petruzzi ( @ hawaiianimages ) september 12 , 2016 @ stephenking interesting hypothesis , but if he were cthulhu at least he d offer a clearer future for america and less insanity .

tom dullemond ( @ cacotopos ) september 12 , 2016cthulhu then posted a statement on twitter categorically distancing himself from trump .
trump could barely hope to be 1/63 as great as i am if he weren t such a buffoon , cthulhu wrote , continuing by saying that trump is an impulsive firestarter .
