washington ( reuters ) - u.s. deputy defense secretary robert work said the pentagon ’ s plan to truncate the littoral combat ship program at 40 ships instead of 52 reflected budget pressures and was “ not an indictment ” of the program .
lockheed martin corp ( lmt.n ) and australia ’ s austal ( asb.ax ) each build different models of the smaller , fast coastal warships .
carter said he wants the navy to have a competition and pick just one supplier for future ships .
work said the pentagon decided to buy two of the ships in fiscal 2017 , instead of scaling orders back to just one ship as defense secretary ash carter had ordered in a memo late last year , at the navy ’ s request .
he said the move was meant to help ensure a smooth transition to a future competition by keeping both shipbuilders working for another year .
