baghdad ( reuters ) - a saudi arabian commercial airplane arrived in baghdad on wednesday for the first time in 27 years , the iraqi transport ministry said .
there have been no flights between the neighbouring countries since former iraqi president saddam hussein invaded kuwait in 1990 .
saudi arabia and the united arab emirates are both wooing baghdad now in an effort to halt the growing regional influence of arch-foe iran .
baghdad international airport today welcomed the first saudi plane after a 27-year break , said a ministry statement cited by local media .
this plane belongs to the saudi company flynas .
flynas , which launched as nas air in 2007 and first turned a profit in 2015 , is facing increasing competition in saudi arabia , its primary market .
it said last week it would soon start flights to several iraqi cities .
in august the two countries said they planned to open the arar land border crossing for trade for the first time since 1990 .
