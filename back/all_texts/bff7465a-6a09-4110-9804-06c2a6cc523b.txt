ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey s BDDK banking regulator urged the public on Saturday to ignore rumors about financial institutions, saying Turkey s banks were functioning well.
The BDDK s statement appeared to be a response to a report by the Haberturk newspaper saying that six Turkish banks could face large fines from U.S. regulators over alleged violation of sanctions with Iran.
It has been brought to the public s attention that stories, that are rumors in nature, about our banks are not based on documents or facts, and should not heeded, it said.
