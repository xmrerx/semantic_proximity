kuala lumpur ( reuters ) - unidentified militants planned to sabotage an annual beer festival canceled this week by authorities in the malaysian capital of kuala lumpur who cited political sensitivities for the move , police said on thursday .
on monday , the authorities scrapped the two-day event , now in its sixth year , after an islamist party objected on the grounds that it could lead to criminal acts , rape and free sex .
around 6,000 people had been expected to attend the better beer festival , showcasing craft beers from at least 11 countries , according to posts on social media site facebook by the organizers and domestic news reports .
protests against events considered western and unislamic are common in muslim-majority malaysia , and are usually led by the opposition pan-malaysian islamic party ( pas ) and conservative islamist ngos .
there was information that exposed plans by militants who would carry out sabotage on the festival , because it is deemed as something that goes against their struggles , said inspector-general of police mohamad fuzi harun .
to avoid any incident beyond our control , the police had to be proactive , by objecting to the organizing of the festival , he added in a brief statement , without naming any suspected groups .
since 2013 , malaysia has detained more than 300 people with suspected links to islamic state in its crackdown on militancy .
the police have arrested seven philippine men on suspicion of involvement in the activities of the abu sayyaf militant group , which has pledged loyalty to islamic state .
