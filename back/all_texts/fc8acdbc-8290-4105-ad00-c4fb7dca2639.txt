Donald Trump threw another Twitter tantrum, so Keith Olbermann gave him something to really cry about.Clearly, Donald Trump is scared that recounts in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Michigan will overturn the initial results of the 2016 Election and make him a loser.That s why he threw another one of his infamous hissy fits on his favorite social media platform in opposition of the recount effort.Trump attacked Hillary Clinton, calling her a hypocrite for supporting the recount because he was asked repeatedly whether or not he would accept the results of the election.
However, Trump only said he would support the results if he wins.It was a nine-tweet rant that once again proved how unfit Trump is to be president.
And Olbermann absolutely smacked Trump down for it.What, @realDonaldTrump, was that bullshit from you this week about everybody uniting?

You ve erased your dignity #GetOutNow pic.twitter.com/drKUYxDtRE Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) November 27, 2016Olbermann even advised Trump to dump Kellyanne Conway, who whines and commits hypocrisy every time she appears on the air.Also, @realDonaldTrump, get rid of this Dolores Umbridge of DC, Conway.
She s doing nearly as much damage to you as your own tweets are https://t.co/oIWZFr8OkD Keith Olbermann (@KeithOlbermann) November 27, 2016Hillary Clinton and the American people deserve a recount.
And if that recount shows that Trump actually lost, he and his team should immediately step aside.
And if it is discovered along the way that Trump s team was aided by hacks into our voting system, every last one of them should be prosecuted for election fraud and put behind bars where they belong.Clinton currently leads in the popular vote by over 2 million votes and her losses in the three states mentioned above were by narrow margins.
Asking for recounts is perfectly legal, and in this case, very reasonable considering the fate of the free world and our democracy hang in the balance.Featured Image: Zach Gibson/Getty Images
