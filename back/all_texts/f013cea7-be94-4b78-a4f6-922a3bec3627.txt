Much like the Republican front runner himself, Donald Trump s supporters also have a tendency to invoke violence any chance they get, as we ve seen proven time after time.On Tuesday, Ohio pastor and Trump fan Darrell Scott went on CNN to discuss Trump s plan for the U.S. border wall, and in no time caused the segment to completely derail.
In speaking to fellow panelists Ben Ferguson and Margaret Hoover, Scott started by giving an absurd example of how Trump would force Mexico to pay for the wall (even though Mexico s president has flat-out refused and basically told Trump to f*ck off).
Scott said: Mexico is going to pay directly, or Mexico is going to pay indirectly.
It reminds me of a friend that I had years ago, OK?
Let me say this for the record.
He said, You re going to give me my money or I m going to break your legs and you re going to give me my money.
Mexico will pay for the wall or Trump will break them down.
Ferguson was quick to point out just how ridiculous Scott s example was as he fired back, We re not 12 years old.
This is not your lunch money.
Scott completely missed the valid point and continued on: I m tired of that 12-year-old stuff.
They re gonna pay it directly, or they re gonna pay it indirectly.
And putting a tax on Western Union transfers is not unreasonable.
These comments came just shortly after Trump s campaign stated that if the business mogul wins the election, the candidate would ban money transfers from the United States into Mexico unless Mexico contributed $5-10 billion for his precious wall.Scott and Ferguson got into a heated back-and forth, and Ferguson told the ignorant pastor, You have no idea what you re talking about.
