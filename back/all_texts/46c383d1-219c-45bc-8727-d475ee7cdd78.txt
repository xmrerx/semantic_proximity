It really doesn t get more pathetic than the folks over at Westboro Baptist Church in Topeka, Kansas.
Their pitiful hatred of anything that doesn t line up with their narrow-minded, myopic view of their own personal brand of Christianity is just short of pure evil.
So, when they decided that they were going to protest legendary artist David Bowie s funeral, one group perfectly protested back, and in the best way possible with love.Here are some of the tweets surrounding WBC s planned protest:Here's something to help your #MotivationMonday which all should've heeded from the first pervert (Cain) to #Bowie: pic.twitter.com/Cr8m4FBoUs Westboro Baptist (@WBCSaysRepent) January 11, 2016We're practicing #DavidBowie s parody, hoping his family will opt for a funeral here (or better yet: NO funeral!)

@CNN: David Bowie memorial concert planned for Carnegie Hall https://t.co/y5xmNs2Wnd pic.twitter.com/VJwVnWA17E Westboro Baptist (@WBCSaysRepent) January 12, 2016But enough of those ridiculous, mindless, moronic unChristian shenanigans trying to wreak unnecessary havoc on those trying to mourn.One group, Planting Peace, located next to the hateful church, is counteracting WBC s message of hate with one of love through a fundraising money for St. Jude s Hospital to benefit children with cancer.Our neighbors at the Westboro Baptist Church have announced their intention to protest the funeral of David Bowie.
They have also tweeted horrible, hurtful messages to his wife Iman in her time of grief, condemning him to hell and telling her she needs to repent .
In keeping with our philosophy of addressing acts of hate and intolerance with compassion and love, we are inviting the public to show their respect and support of a man who was not only a brilliant, transcendent artist and entertainer, but a man who lived his life as a role model for individual expression and authenticity.
He let the world know that being different is not only ok, it can be beautiful.
Like many others, David was taken from us way too soon due to cancer.
To honor David, please join Planting Peace in counteracting the WBC s message of hate through a fundraising event to benefit children living with cancer.
Through this fundraiser, Planting Peace will make a donation to St. Jude s Children s Hospital in Mr. Bowie s memory.You can help here: www.crowdrise.com/bowie // < !

Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.
