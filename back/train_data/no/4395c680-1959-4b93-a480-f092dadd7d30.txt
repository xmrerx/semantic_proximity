a liberal reporter for esquire got a dose of reality when he went along the border and asked anyone he saw to weigh in on what needs to be done on the border to stop illegals .
what he got was a very surprising result !
most everyone he asked wanted a border wall but most shocking to the journalist was the positive hispanic response.esquire sent a journalist to texas with orders to survey the people living along the border and ask them what they think needs to be done to stop the flow of illegal immigrants.the magazine s editor-in-chief , jay fielden , recently appeared on msnbc s morning joe to explain what happened when esquire sent what host joe scarborough referred to as a liberal journalist to the texas-mexico border .
fielden said he instructed the reporter to go down there with no preconceived notions , just an empty notebook .
fielden , a former texan , explained the assignment was to drive or walk the 800-mile border and talk to whoever you see and let them tell us what s really going on and whether we need a wall , he told scarborough and his panel .
they said , build the wall , fielden said , adding , hispanic , anglo , democratic , republican , uncommitted , clueless , whatever , they said , we want a wall , and we want it tied to some compassion .
most of those hispanics are first-generation and they see it as unfair , he said .
i think they feel , as one guy said , get in line .
