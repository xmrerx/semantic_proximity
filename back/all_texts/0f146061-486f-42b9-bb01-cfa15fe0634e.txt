When it comes to Donald Trump, a lot of people have a lot of different opinions.
While some seem to think he speaks for them when Trump elicits fear and anger, others see right through his shenanigans and are very well aware of where Trump has come from, what he as done and said, and how much he s only in this race for himself and not the greater good.One of the people who sees right through Trump and his poppycock is former President Obama speechwriter, Jon Favreau.
He recently took to Twitter to perfectly summarize Trump and give us five reasons no one should ever vote for Trump, especially if they re a working class American.Here is Favreau s summary of Trump:Trump:1) Profited off of 9/112) Rooted for the housing crash3) Ran a fraudulent university 4) Sued for tax dodging 5) Is a dick Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) May 20, 2016And if you think he s lying, don t worry, he sourced everything as well:Links:1) https://t.co/alx1shhGCi2) https://t.co/nERH9BgIoP3) https://t.co/NsmmfGCbbw4) https://t.co/W1hTwTeoS05) Duh Jon Favreau (@jonfavs) May 20, 2016With the duh being, by far, the most accurate.
Of course, there are many, many more reasons not to vote for him as well (racism, sexism, etc.
), but this was a good jumping off point.The only reason Trump wants to be president is to say he s president.
He doesn t care about the nation, and his actions more than prove that point.
He only cares about himself and his own ambitions.
And for goodness sake, America, realize this sooner rather than later.Featured Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images Twitter
