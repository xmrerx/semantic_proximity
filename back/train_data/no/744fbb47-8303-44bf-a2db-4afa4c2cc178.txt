hillary s been using churches across america as a backdrop to promote the violent black lives matter movement in an effort to pander for black votes .
she proves every day how little respect she has for our religious institutions , the christian community and more specifically , the catholic church and it s backwards members .
will catholics finally see the writing on the wall this election , or will they elect a woman who will unquestionably nominate supreme court justices who are hell-bent on destroying our religious rights ? outraged by the anti-catholic bigotry displayed in leaked team clinton emails this week , the powerful philadelphia bishop blasted both president obama and hillary rodham clinton for their efforts to undermine church teachings.in his weekly column for the archdiocese of philadelphia , archbishop charles chaput thursday demanded that clinton repudiate the emails then added that he doesn t expect her to.mocking the theme in the emails that catholics are backward thinking for views on abortion , marriage and other core issues , chaput wrote , of course it would be wonderful for the clinton campaign to repudiate the content of these ugly wikileaks emails .
all of us backward-thinking catholics who actually believe what scripture and the church teach would be so very grateful .
