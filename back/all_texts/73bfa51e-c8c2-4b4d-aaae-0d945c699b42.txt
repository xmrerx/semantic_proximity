Steve Bannon has a clear, strong agenda for Trump s relationship with the press.
The far-right white supremacist just did a rare interview with The New York Times, which is ironic considering how much he seems to hate the press, and he took the opportunity to paint the press as an incompetent enemy.
In that interview, he said, point-blank: The media should be embarrassed and humiliated and keep its mouth shut and just listen for a while.
Listen to what?
More of Trump s lies?
The press should let his lies go unchallenged?
Just for the record, the press does not like being told they can t challenge public figures.
The press does not like being muzzled.So, one member of the press, CNN s Jake Tapper, responded to that with something thoughtful and eloquent, yet appropriately brief.

It s brilliant in the face of Bannon saying, Sit down, shut up, and let him lie all he wants.
That s really what it comes down to letting the administration put forth unchecked lies so they can create the reality they want.
In fact, Bannon actually told the Times to quote him on this: I want you to quote this, Mr. Bannon added.
The media here is the opposition party.
They don t understand this country.
They still do not understand why Donald Trump is the president of the United States.
[emphasis mine]So the media should shut up.
Stop with the criticism.
Stop with the challenges.
It hurts Donald s little feefees and we just can t have that.Too bad for them that the press isn t going to listen.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
