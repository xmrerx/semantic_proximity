21st Century Wire says In a recent interview former House Speaker, Newt Gingrich, told Fox that Trump will likely be vetoing out the majority of executive orders made by Obama.If we examine the mountain of executive orders that were penned under the Obama administration, we must wonder if Gingrich isn t making a good point and an accurate assessment about President Elect Trump s intentions with regards to his promise to drain the swamp.
