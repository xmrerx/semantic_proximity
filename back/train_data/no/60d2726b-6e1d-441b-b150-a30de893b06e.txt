bnei brak , israel ( reuters ) - hundreds of thousands of ultra-orthodox jews crammed into the streets of a tel aviv suburb on tuesday to mourn a 104-year-old rabbi who had significantly influenced a succession of israeli coalition governments .
rabbi aharon yehuda leib shteinman led a council of sages that controlled the small degel hatorah lawmakers faction , part of the united torah judaism party , which has often held the balance of power in israel .
in particular , shteinman broke with tradition by giving tacit consent to the enlistment of religious soldiers in the first ultra-orthodox unit set up by the israeli military .
prime minister benjamin netanyahu , whose government includes ultra-orthodox political parties , said the jewish people had lost a central beacon of spirit , heritage and morality .
special buses and trains ferried mourners to bnei brak , a religious town on the outskirts of tel aviv .
police estimated that several hundred thousand people gathered for the funeral procession , dressed in traditional black ultra-orthodox garb .
shteinman , born in what is now belarus , had led his community of lithuanian-rooted ultra-orthodox jews since 2012 .
