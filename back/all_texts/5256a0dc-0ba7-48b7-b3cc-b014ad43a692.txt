At the Democratic presidential debate on Thursday night, Hillary Clinton brought the event to a complete standstill as she called out the CNN debate moderators for ignoring and downplaying the critical issue of abortion.
The debate had gone on for nearly an hour and a half by the time Clinton made her statement, and the vital woman s health issue had gone unmentioned, as it mostly has for all the previous debates.Clinton wasn t having it, and she let loose: We ve not had one question about a woman s right to make her own decisions about reproductive health care, not one question, Clinton said.
And in the meantime we have states, governors doing everything they can to restrict women s rights.
We have a presidential candidate by the name of Donald Trump saying that women should be punished and we are never asked about this.
The statement was greeted with loud applause and cheers.Clinton noted the issue goes to the heart of who we are as women, our rights, our autonomy, our ability to make our own decisions, and we need to be talking about that and defending Planned Parenthood from these outrageous attacks.
Senator Bernie Sanders added that as president he would take on those Republican governors who are trying to restrict a woman s right to choose.
Unfortunately, on the Republican side, abortion has come up as a topic of discussion.
Donald Trump said that under a scenario in which abortion had ideally become illegal, there would need to be some sort of mechanism in place to punish women who have undergone the procedure.
At the same time, Senator Ted Cruz has been campaigning alongside anti-abortion extremists who have spoken out in favor of anti-abortion terrorists.
And Cruz is on record as opposing abortion in all circumstances, even in the case of a pregnancy caused by rape or incest, provisions which past anti-choice Republicans have even given in on.Featured image via YouTube
