almaty ( reuters ) - the leaders of kazakhstan and kyrgyzstan pledged on monday to improve relations , after ties between the two former soviet republics degenerated into a trade war under the previous kyrgyz leadership .
the standoff between astana and the government of former kyrgyz president almazbek atambayev strained a russian-led economic bloc and disrupted supplies of kyrgyz goods to some european countries .
we have established a constructive and trust-based dialogue in all areas , kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev s office quoted him as telling his kyrgyz counterpart sooronbai jeenbekov .
jeenbekov was elected president last month .
in the run-up the vote , his predecessor and backer atambayev accused the kazakh government of interfering in kyrgyz politics and supporting an opposition candidate .
astana denied those charges but introduced tough border controls that nearly halted the flow of goods out of kyrgyzstan , which is landlocked and sends most of its exports out through kazakh territory .
kyrgyzstan filed complaints both to the moscow-led eurasian economic union , a post-soviet bloc , and the world trade organization , accusing kazakhstan of imposing a blockade .
bishkek also briefly suspended operations at a copper and gold mine operated and run by kazakhstan-based and london-listed kaz minerals .
but tensions started easing after jeenbekov , a former prime minister , took office this month .
last week , bishkek informed the wto it had settled its dispute with astana .
kyrgyzstan will continue to carry out its foreign policy aimed at deepening and intensifying bilateral ties with kazakhstan , jeenbekov s office quoted him as saying at the meeting in astana .
