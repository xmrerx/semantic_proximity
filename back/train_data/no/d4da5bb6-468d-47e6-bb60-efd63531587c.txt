n djamena ( reuters ) - chad s president idriss deby on sunday appointed abdoulaye sabre fadoul as minister of finance and also named new economy , foreign affairs , security and justice ministers , a presidential decree showed .
fadoul has served as interim finance minister since deby sacked his predecessor , christian georges diguimbaye , last month .
the appointment comes amid stalled negotiations with glencore over more than $ 1 billion in oil-backed loans chad owes the commodities trader .
glencore lent the west african country s state oil firm sht about $ 1.45 billion in 2014 to be repaid with crude oil .
the loan was subsequently syndicated with several banks .
it was restructured in 2015 following the crash in global oil prices but chad is again struggling to repay the debt .
funds from the international monetary fund depend on reaching new terms .
in october , chad decided to redirect crude previously allocated to glencore in a marketing agreement to exxon mobil instead starting from january , which has made negotiations fraught .
djimet arabi , an adviser to deby , was named the new justice minister in the reshuffle while ahmadaye abdelkerim bokit takes over the security ministry .
the new foreign minister is mahamat zene cherif , chad s former permanent representative to the united nations .
