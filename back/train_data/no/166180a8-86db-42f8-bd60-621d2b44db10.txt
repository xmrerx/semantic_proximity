we couldn t have said it better !
the brilliant krauthammer rips into obama for his visit to hiroshima epic !
krauthammer : obama closed the apology tour today in hiroshima .
and to say it wasn t a form of apology , of course he wasn t going to use the word .
and yes he did speak in the abstract but he did it in hiroshima look , this is a visit he should have made next year as a private citizen .
in which case he could speak like a naive private citizen about escaping the logic of fear and the president speaking as president , representing the united states , i thought it was embarrassing utopianism and the implicit apology dishonored our nation .
