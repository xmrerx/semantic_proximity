MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine activists will protest on Monday against a tough immigration order by U.S. President Donald Trump and Washington’s decision to upgrade some military bases in the Philippines.
Anakbayan, a Filipino youth movement, said it would hold a “let them in” rally outside the U.S. embassy in Manila against Trump’s temporary freeze on refugees into the United States and his ban of travelers from Syria and six other countries.
Chaos and confusion ensued in the United States at the weekend and a federal judge in New York intervened to block the deportation of dozens of visitors and stranded refugees.
The Filipino group will also protest an announcement last week that U.S. troops would build warehouses, barracks and runways this year in five agreed locations under an Enhanced Defence Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) between the two countries.
EDCA covers the rotational deployment of U.S. ships, aircraft and troops at five Philippine bases and storage of equipment for humanitarian and maritime security purposes.
In November, Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte said he hoped Trump would treat illegal immigrants fairly and trusted his judgment.
Manila had then urged Filipinos working illegally in the United States to return before Trump took office.
Broadcaster ABS-CBN on Sunday quoted Assistant Presidential Communications Secretary Marie Banaag as saying it was too early to comment on Trump’s immigration move and it was the U.S. administration’s right to make such decisions.
