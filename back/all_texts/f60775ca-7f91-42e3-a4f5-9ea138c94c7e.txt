North Korea is now vowing to mercilessly wipe them out while seeking extradition for those responsible for allegedly plotting to kill Kim Jong-un last week.The Vice Foreign Minister Han Song-ryol repeated the charge in a meeting on Thursday with foreign envoys in Pyongyang, that an attempted assassination on Kim Jong Un was carried out by the United States and South Korean intelligence agencies.
Heinous terrorists were recently detected in the DPRK [Democratic People s Republic of Korea], According to North Korean state news agency (KCNA), The terrorists were infiltrated by the CIA of the U.S. and the puppet National Intelligence Service (NIS) of South Korea in a bid to commit state-sponsored terrorism against the supreme leadership of the KPRK by use of a biochemical substance.
So far, North Korea s only individual suspect for the assassination attempt is a Pyongyang resident who allegedly was brainwashed and bribed by U.S. and South Korean agents to assassinate the leader.
According to our law, the Central Public Prosecutor s Office of the KPRK will use all available methods to start to work to demand the handover of the criminals involved, so as to punish the organizers, conspirators, and followers of the terrible state-sponsored terrorism, Said Han.Han then reportedly declared the principle stand of the DPRK government to find out all of the terrorist maniacs and mercilessly wipe them out.
Furthering his warning, Han stated that Korean-style war on terrorism will be commenced at once in a consecutive and intensive way to root out the plot-breeding centers and dens of evil on this planet, including the CIA and the NIS.
Interestingly enough, these threats come days after the newly elected South Korean president, Moon Jae-in, called for economic cooperation and increased dialogue with North Korea.This rhetoric couldn t come at a worse time, considering the increased tensions between the United States and North Korea over its nuclear ambitions and missile tests.Photo by Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images
