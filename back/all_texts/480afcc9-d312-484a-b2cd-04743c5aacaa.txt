Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has claimed that he loves veterans and he loves the military.
To be sure, most of the expressions of this supposed love have come in the form of Trump arguing that he would use the military to execute the innocent relatives of terrorists and that he would force members of the armed services to engage in torture practices banned by the Geneva Convention.But now it has been revealed that one of Trump s companies treated a military veteran in a disgusting way.Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has been vocal about the need to take care of U.S. veterans.
He s said that if elected, he ll put our service men and women on a path to success as they leave active duty.
But that s not what the Trump Institute, a get-rich-quick real estate seminar, did for Richard Wright, a senior master sergeant in the Air Force reserves who worked for the company in 2006 and 2007.
Wright was deployed to Afghanistan in the spring of 2007.
When he came home to his job, the Trump Institute fired him.
All of your absences, Wright s boss at the Trump Institute told him, had forced the company to reevaluate your position with the Trump Institute.
It is a violation of federal law to penalize an employee for absences caused by military service.Wright provided the Huffington Post with proof he was awarded three medals for outstanding service during his time serving in Afghanistan.Stories about the shady and sometimes unethical business practices Trump engaged in or lent his name to over his career will continue to plague the candidate as he tries to restart and remake his image in preparation for the general election.It is unlikely to work and Trump s rhetoric will continue to be exposed as empty words hiding behind the military.Featured image via Flickr
