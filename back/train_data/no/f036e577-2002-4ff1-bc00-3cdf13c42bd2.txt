the transportation security administration ( tsa ) screeners at airports can now force passengers to go through body scanners , according to a new policy change.the department of homeland security ( dhs ) has updated its protocol to no longer allow passengers to opt out of being electronically scanned at through advanced imaging technology ( ait ) machines at checkpoints .
before the change , people could choose a physical screening .
while passengers may generally decline ait screening in favor of physical screening , tsa may direct mandatory ait screening for some passengers , the dhs issued in a dec. 18 policy update.the change weakens the opt-out rule but doesn t entirely eliminate it , a tsa spokesman told time .
passengers undergoing screening will still have the option to decline an ait screening in favor of a physical screening , agency spokesman mike england said in a statement .
however , some passengers will still be required to undergo ait screenings as warranted by security considerations in order to safeguard transportation security .
