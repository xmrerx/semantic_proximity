khartoum ( reuters ) - sudan will extend a unilateral ceasefire with rebels until the end of december , state news agency suna reported on sunday , just days after the united states lifted 20-year-old sanctions tied to progress on resolving ongoing conflicts .
fighting between the army and rebels in kordofan and blue nile regions broke out in 2011 , when south sudan declared independence .
conflict in darfur began in 2003 when mainly non-arab tribes took up arms against sudan s arab-led government .
making progress on resolving these conflicts was one of several demands made by the united states for it to lift a trade embargo , unfreeze assets and remove financial restrictions that have isolated the country for years .
the ceasefire was set to expire at the end of october .
