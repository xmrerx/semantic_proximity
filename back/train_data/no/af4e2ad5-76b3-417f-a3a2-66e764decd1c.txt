istanbul ( reuters ) - turkey issued arrest warrants for 63 people , including former national intelligence agency ( mit ) personnel , over alleged links to the u.s.-based cleric accused of orchestrating last year s attempted coup , anadolu agency reported on tuesday .
the police operation was launched in 21 provinces across turkey , the state-run news agency reported .
ankara says cleric fethullah gulen , who has lived in the united states since 1999 , was behind the abortive putsch in july 2016 .
gulen has denied involvement .
more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial for alleged ties to gulen s movement and some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the public and private sectors for the same reason .
some of turkey s western allies and rights groups have expressed concern about the crackdown and suspect the government has used the coup as a pretext to quash dissent .
the government says the purges are necessary due to the gravity of the threats it has faced since the failed putsch , in which more than 240 people were killed .
