London s Muslim Mayor Sadiq Khan, called on the British government today to cancel their visit with President Donald Trump.
Speaking to Channel 4 news, Khan felt Trump s out-of-context criticisms and continued attacks on Twitter meant that the U.K. should not roll out the red carpet for the president as his policies go against everything we stand for.
He added: When you have a special relationship it is no different from when you have got a close mate.
You stand with them in times of adversity but you call them out when they are wrong.
There are many things about which Donald Trump is wrong.
Hollywood ReporterShouldn t London s government be more concerned with their current mayor s past than of President Trump s efforts to unify the world in the fight against extreme Islamic terrorism?In 2016, the now Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan was branded unfit to be London s Mayor after it emerged that he had described moderate Muslim groups as Uncle Toms a notorious racial slur used against black people to suggest that they are subservient to whites.The incendiary claim emerged in a 2009 interview with Iranian-backed Press TV, when Mr Khan was minister for community cohesion , in charge of Government efforts to stamp out extremism.The revelation is a major blow for Mr Khan, who has faced a string of claims about his past dealings with Muslim extremists during the bitter campaign to succeed Boris Johnson.
Daily MailWatch the 2009 video here:That s not the only video that should make every London citizen be concerned about their Mayor s radical views.
