In the world of politics there are going to be scandals.
It s just a fact.
There s no way around it.
They can be true or they can be false, but they are going to happen no matter who you are.
What s important, however, is how one handles the scandals, and so far Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz has shown that he can t handle much of anything thrown his way.With The National Enquirer printing a story that alleges Cruz s involved with five different women other than his wife, #CruzSexScandal quickly started to take over social media and the national conversation.
Is the story true?
Who knows, really.
But at this point it doesn t really matter, because it s out there.Now, Cruz could simply shrug off these allegations, or even laugh at them for how ridiculous they may be, but instead he chose to throw a ginormous hissy fit on Facebook and blames the entire thing on Donald Trump.
And who knows, maybe Trump is to blame.
However, how Cruz is handling all of this shows how he may handle times of trouble, and let s just say, it ain t pretty.Cruz wrote on Facebook: I want to be crystal clear: these attacks are garbage.
For Donald J. Trump to enlist his friends at the National Enquirer and his political henchmen to do his bidding shows you that there is no low Donald won t go.These smears are completely false, they re offensive to Heidi and me, they re offensive to our daughters, and they re offensive to everyone Donald continues to personally attack.Donald Trump s consistently disgraceful behavior is beneath the office we are seeking and we are not going to follow.

For Donald J. Trump to enlist his friends at the National Posted by Ted Cruz on Friday, March 25, 2016Listen, Ted, calm down.
If the story from The National Enquirer is false, it will simply drift away over the course of the 24-hour news cycle.
Drawing further attention to it, and acting SO defensive doesn t necessarily make you look guilty, but it also doesn t make you look good.
It s a tabloid paper that will also talk about people giving birth to aliens and/ or maybe the Queen of England taking up heroin it s not like it was printed in the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal.
Simmer down now.
Stuff like this is inevitably going to come up, true or not.
For goodness sake, ask a Clinton.If this is how he handles ridiculous stories about himself, how the hell is he going to handle being Commander-in-Chief?
Simple he won t be able to.No matter who, vote blue.Featured image via Gage Skidmore (flickr)
