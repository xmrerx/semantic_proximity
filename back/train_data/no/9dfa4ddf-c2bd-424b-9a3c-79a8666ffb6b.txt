washington ( reuters ) - u.s .
senator lindsey graham , one of the republican party ’ s senior foreign policy voices , said on thursday he would likely support the sale of advanced military equipment including boeing f-18 fighter jets to qatar and kuwait , despite israel ’ s concerns .
israel ’ s government worries that equipment sent to gulf states could fall into the wrong hands and eventually be used against the jewish state .
“ the israeli argument is that you ’ ve seen regimes in the neighborhood change pretty quickly .
be careful of introducing new weapons into the region , ” graham told reporters following a trip to the region , citing the situation in iraq .
however , he said he thought it was important for such sales to go ahead despite those concerns , given instability in the region and threats including islamic state militants .
“ i say to my israeli friends , ‘ we need partners .
partners without capability are paper partners. ’ ...
so i ’ ll probably be in the camp of pushing the increased capability of gulf arab states , understanding israeli ’ s concern , ” graham said .
he acknowledged that there was strong opposition in congress toward arming some gulf arab states .
“ i don ’ t know how the votes go right now , ” graham said .
graham is a senior member of the senate armed services committee and the chairman of the senate appropriations subcommittee that oversees foreign aid .
