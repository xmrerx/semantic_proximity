As you have all probably heard by now, Donald Trump had an absolute hissy-fit on Twitter, Wednesday morning.
The Republican front-runner was very, very upset that he did not come out on top in the Iowa caucus and he decided that it was all because of Ted Cruz the declared winner.To express his extreme displeasure Trump claimed that Cruz illegally stole Iowa (how one legally steals is not clear) and claimed that he was going to demand a recount.The Cruz Campaign laughed at The Donald s meltdown and Spokesman Rick Tyler said: Reality has hit the reality star.
Since Iowa, no one is talking about Donald Trump.
That s why he s popping off on Twitter.
There are Twitter addiction therapy groups, and he should check in with his local chapter.
But the Cruz Campaign wasn t the only ones to respond to the billionaire s epic temper tantrum, Twitter did too with the hashtag #TrumpTantrum and it is brilliant:If you threaten to sue your neighbor because he has more friends than you, you might be having a #trumpertantrum SherH (@shernajwine) February 4, 2016 #Trumpertantrum Everyone is being mean to me!

SourceFed (@sourcefed) February 3, 2016Donald should probably think his crazy Twitter rants through a little bit more, because this is pretty embarrassing.
I mean, when Twitter is constantly mocking you for your childlike behavior, that doesn t bode well for the rest of your candidacy.
Does this guy seriously believe Americans see his meltdowns and say, Oh yeah, that s the guy I want giving military orders.
?
