it s been two months since the 2016 election took place but donald trump refuses to stop whining about the results.trump posted on twitter claiming that the media is saying that he thought he was going to lose as election day approached .
and it certainly looked like he was going to lose as just about every poll had trump trailing hillary clinton .
but as we all know , russia and the fbi intervened and battleground states flipped to trump.rather than ignore the media analysis about something that has been over with for awhile , trump chose to lash out on twitter instead and brag about his electoral victory.various media outlets and pundits say that i thought i was going to lose the election .
wrong , it all came together in the last week and .. donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 2 , 2017i thought and felt i would win big , easily over the fabled 270 ( 306 ) .
when they cancelled fireworks , they knew , and so did i. donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 2 , 2017seriously , trump is incapable of just letting things go .
and he got ripped apart on twitter for being so petty and thin-skinned .

@ realdonaldtrump donald , the more you go on about this the less convincing it is .
a big president doesn t go on and on about his feelings .

( @ brettdruck ) january 2 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump i keep getting you lost we won , get over it in my mentions .
tell donald , he needs to hear it the most .
? brett druck ?
( @ brettdruck ) january 2 , 2017also , it should be pointed out that trump s electoral victory is one of the smallest in american history , like his hands.with 18 days left before the inauguration , this is what donald trump is focusing on .
he has to be watching the news constantly in order to catch things like this and then he wastes more time by tweeting about it .
at this rate , trump is going to remain the least prepared president-elect in history if he continues to focus more on what people say about him than the job he is about take over.featured image via alex wong/getty images
