a petition started by government workers has over 70,000 signatures protesting a christmas gift from obama that gave them a half day off on december 26th .
it was just not good enough government employees wanted a full day off this year over the christmas holiday .
bah humbug ! president barack obama just gave all government employees a surprise holiday present.on friday , he signed an executive order announcing that employees only have to work a half day.but that was not good enough for many as a petition was started for them to get the whole day off , as they did on december 26 last year .
obama wrote in his order this year : the benefits of the executive order include recognizing the dedication of federal employees serving the public , improving workforce morale , and valuing a family-friendly work environment .
last year federal employees were granted the entire day after christmas off from work .
december 26 fell on a friday then .
as a result , a petition has been started demanding federal employees get the entire day off on christmas eve this year , which falls on a thursday .
it would mean for many that they get thursday , friday , saturday and sunday off , like last year .
we feel unappreciated with pay freezes and constant threats of government shutdowns , reads the petition .
it then adds ; giving federal employees thursday december 24th off paid , would go a long way in showing that we deserve nothing but the best for our daily contributions in serving the people and would show how much our accomplishments and dedication deserves .
so far more than 70,000 people have signed the petition.read more : uk daily mail
