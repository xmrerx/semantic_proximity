# merkellegacy pic.twitter.com/wbh5cjj2iw james woods ( @ realjameswoods ) february 24 , 2017in august 2016 , angela merkel defended her open-borders policy : aug. 23 , 2016 angela merkel has defended her open-door immigration policy claiming it was a humanitarian duty to let in almost two million migrants last year.however , the german chancellor admitted some areas of her immigration stance could be improved following a u-turn in public opinion against refugees.this was sparked in part by the cologne sex attack , carried out by migrant gangs on thousands of women , and a string of recent terror attacks where the attacker was an asylum seeker.nearly a year on from when germany s borders were opened , mrs merkel still defended the controversial decision but identified certain areas where change was needed.faced with international criticism , she claimed the open-door policy was necessary and right .on september 4 , 2016 angela merkel s party cdu party was soundly defeated by the anti-migrant afd party in the german state election .
merkel assumed some of the blame for her reckless immigration policy , but still defended her position.on september 19 , 2016 , merkel admitted for first time she may have blundered over the migration crisis in the wake of another bitter poll drubbing.the german chancellor admitted she was unprepared for last year s one million strong migrant influx .
if i could , i would go back in time to be better prepared for the refugee crisis in 2015 , for which we were rather unprepared .
so why are the mainstream media sources ignoring what is really happening to countries like germany , sweden , austria , italy , hungary , greece , france and the uk ?
why are they not reporting the truth about the damage this invasion of refugees has done to their culture , to crime rates ( specifically rape and sexual assaults ) in their communities and to their welfare systems ? watch this eye-opening interview with filmmaker ami horowitz as he explains to fox news tucker carlson what he found when he traveled to open-borders sweden to make a documentary on the effects of the invasion of refugees : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=-avs2u-r1mk
