our homeland security director gave us all the lowdown on the refugee program and it s what we all thought : isis has been trying to use the refugee program to come to america .
why in the heck are we still trying to bring refugees here ?
can t we help them in the middle east ?
the only thing i can guess is that this is obama s agenda and he s not letting up on fulfilling it .
the state department and un are pushing refugees through the system as fast as possible .
this is big , big business for the refugee resettlement contractors ho get paid per refugee and then get millions from the feds on top of that .
the kicker is that you pay for the goodies the refugees get once they re here .
that s why america is a global magnet for refugees !
