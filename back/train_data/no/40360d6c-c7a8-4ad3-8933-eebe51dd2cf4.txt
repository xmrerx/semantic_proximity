mumbai ( reuters ) - a passenger train slipped off the rails in northern india early on friday , killing at least three people and injuring about 10 , the railways ministry said .
the train was on its way from goa in western india to patna in the east when 13 coaches derailed , the ministry said .
it did not provide any reason for the accident , which occurred in the northern state of uttar pradesh .
television news agency ani however quoted the uttar pradesh additional director general of police as saying that the cause of accident is most probably a fractured railway track as per local assessment .
a medical train and a relief train had reached the accident spot , the railways said .
india has seen a spate of rail accidents over the last 12 months .
earlier in august , there were three separate incidents on the world s fourth-biggest rail network injuring over 165 people and killing several others .
the biggest accident so far this year was on aug. 19 in uttar pradesh , which resulted in the death of 23 people and led to the suspension of three senior railways officials .
a crash in uttar pradesh last november killed 150 people .
india s ailing rail network is in the midst of a $ 130 billion , five-year modernization process .
in addition , the government launched a $ 15 billion safety overhaul in february after the surge in accidents blamed on defective tracks .
but in june , reuters reported that the overhaul was facing delays as the state steel company could not meet demand for new rails .
