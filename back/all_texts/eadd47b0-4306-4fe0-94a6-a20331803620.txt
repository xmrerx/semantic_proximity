Donald the Trump went to speak at the NRA s annual meeting today, and his speech was utterly ridiculous.
He borrowed a lot of what he said from the rhetoric of an extreme right-wing, anti-government group known as the Three Percenters, including saying that there will be another revolution if the government finds ways to regulate guns.Because that s what the people from the group that donated $30 million to Trump s campaign want to hear.
Whenever there s another violent tragedy and guns are involved, we get to hear all about how it happened because not enough people were armed, because it was a gun-free zone, etc.
These people think nothing, care nothing, for the lives lost due to gun violence.
And Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy has had it.So he went on a devastating tweetstorm today, complete with pictures of children and young adults who have died at the hands of senseless gun violence.
Look below:.
@realDonaldTrump about to take stage at NRA, to celebrate right of criminals to own guns, to glorify weapons that kill Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) April 28, 2017Here s my advice.
Turn off cable.
Don t watch @realDonaldTrump s NRA speech.
Instead, think about who we are fighting for.

And with 90% of Americans and 80% of gun owners on our side, we can t lose.
Let s get to it.
Chris Murphy (@ChrisMurphyCT) April 28, 2017But the NRA behaves as though it speaks for all gun owners when it advocates for more guns, more guns, and more guns.
Even for criminals, even for people who are a danger to themselves and others.Murhpy s tweetstorm prompted people to share their tragedies, too:@ChrisMurphyCT @realDonaldTrump My niece Michel Rose David, age 23, killed by her ex-boyfriend 12/10/10.
