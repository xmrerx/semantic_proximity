beijing ( reuters ) - china s foreign minister on thursday said that ties with japan should not take two steps back for every step forward , after japanese prime minister shinzo abe made a rare appearance at an anniversary event for the normalization of diplomatic relations .
speaking on the eve of the 45th anniversary of the resumption of ties between beijing and tokyo , foreign minister wang yi told japan s ambassador to china , yutaka yokoi , that he hoped for greater improvement in relations .
we hope that the japanese government can pursue a more positive policy towards china ... and not take one step back for each step forward , even two steps back for each step forward , wang said , according to a statement released on the ministry website on friday .
relations have been complicated for decades by the legacy of japan s wartime aggression , as well as by a festering territorial dispute in the east china sea .
abe on thursday evening made an appearance at a chinese embassy event in tokyo that jointly celebrated the anniversary as well as china s oct 1 national day .
wang called the appearance good news and added : we hope for more good news in china-japan relations and not for bad news to follow shortly after good news .
chinese premier li keqiang and abe also exchanged congratulatory messages on friday , in which li said that the two countries should properly manage and control their contradictions and differences , china s official xinhua news agency reported .
japan s cabinet on thursday announced oct. 22 as the date of a snap election where abe , a conservative who returned to power in 2012 , hopes a recent boost in voter support will help his liberal democratic party-led coalition maintain a simple majority .
it now holds a two-thirds super majority .
