decades ago he stood against oppression by sitting at a north carolina lunch counter , today he stands beside donald trump for president.clarence henderson , who participated at the sit-in protest in 1960 , is backing the gop candidate despite receiving backlash from some in the black community , the associated press reported .
donald trump is certainly not a politician , and politicians are a dime a dozen , but leaders are priceless , he said.henderson has been brutalized on social media for his standing position.but henderson is undeterred .
he has proved to be a leader in the business field .
has he done everything right ?
no , certainly not .
but i think that he has more at stake than hillary does , henderson told the ap.the civil rights leader originally supported ted cruz but joined the trump train when trump won the republican nomination .
i stand before you as one that knows what america s all about the good , the bad and the ugly .
i would not live in any other country except america that put jim crow on trial and found him guilty of trying to separate the races .
so i stand before you to say that we are unified , he said at a trump rally in september.and he plans to vote for trump for the same reason he sat at that lunch counter in the 60s .
i would rather be in the minority on the side of justice than in the majority on the side of injustice , because i have lived a life where i saw there was injustice , he said .
