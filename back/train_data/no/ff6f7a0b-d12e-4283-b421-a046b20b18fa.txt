lisbon ( reuters ) - a portuguese court has handed long prison sentences to six members of a bogus religious cult that sexually abused boys , including their own children , under the pretence of rituals on a farm just southeast of lisbon .
tuesday s verdict by the setubal district court sentenced rui pedro , the 36-year-old leader of the self-proclaimed celestial truth sect , to 23 years after finding him guilty of rape , procuring prostitution , child pornography and other crimes , a court official said on wednesday .
his wife and four other men were sentenced to prison terms of between 7 and 19 years .
two women were acquitted .
the crimes were committed between 2011 and 2015 , mostly on a farm rented by the group in 2014 .
prosecutors told the court that the cult was fake , and its rituals set up as a means to lure and scare the children .
the eight victims , including the leader s son and the son of another of the sentenced men , had been told that the sect s master had supernatural powers and could perform acts of purification on them , which was the term for sexual abuse .
the boys , aged between 5 and 16 at the time of the crimes and mostly from the setubal area , were kept in fear of his powers so they never disclosed what happened to anyone .
their families had been led to believe the children played football or studied and received psychological counselling or religious guidance on the farm .
police arrested the group in 2015 after one of the members , andre marques , reported them to the authorities .
he was still sentenced to 19 years , as the court ruled that he had only cooperated to save his own skin , daily newspaper publico reported .
