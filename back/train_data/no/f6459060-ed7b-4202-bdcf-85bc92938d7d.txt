frankfurt ( reuters ) - german authorities arrested a suspected child sex abuser on tuesday after taking the extraordinary step of circulating a photograph of his 4-year-old victim found on the dark web , a prosecutor said .
bild newspaper said the suspect was identified on monday evening when the child and her mother saw the images - posted online and shown on television - and went to their local police station .
the man - identified in the media as the woman s 24-year-old boyfriend - was detained hours after the nationwide manhunt began , frankfurt prosecutor georg ungefuk said .
on tuesday , a judge approved an arrest warrant and sent the suspect to pre-trial detention , a spokesman for the prosecutor s office said .
the man s apartment in the wesermarsch district of lower saxony was searched and evidence seized , officials said .
the suspect is believed to have seriously sexually abused the child a total of nine times , to have made films of the abuse and then distributed them , ungefuk said .
he faces a possible prison sentence of up to 15 years if convicted of multiple counts of sexual abuse , according to the prosecutor s office .
experts had worked on the case since images of the abuse first appeared on the dark web - a part of the internet not accessible via search engines - in late july , he said , and authorities took the unusual step of distributing the photograph because they had run out of other options .
authorities were tipped about the case by foreign officials , who identified germany as the likely location of the crime since a german television program could be heard in the background of one of the videos .
ungefuk said there was no link between this case and the elysium platform , a child pornography network with 90,000 users whose suspected operator was arrested in july .
prosecutors in hanover will now take over the case given that the alleged crime took place in lower saxony state .
