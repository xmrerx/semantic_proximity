It s one of Madagascar s most widespread rituals, historian Mahery Andrianahag told AFP.
It s necessary to assure cosmic harmony it satisfies our desire to respect and honour the ancestors so that they can be blessed and one day return.
The dead are believed to reciprocate the blessings.
Says one participant, I am extremely proud to go to rewrap the bones of my grandmother and all of our ancestors.
I will ask them for blessings and success in my school leavers exams.
Famadihana is also an opportunity to party:The customary ritual, rather than a religious rite, can be shocking for some, but for those taking part, it is an intense celebration accompanied by music, dancing and singing, fuelled by alcoholic drinks.When the party is over, participants store the mats that the bodies are laid on under their own mattresses.
This is said to bring good luck.But some doctors warn that they can also transmit germs and infections.And, at a time when Madagascar is enduring its most lethal outbreak of the plague in years, the practice of body turning has raised fears among health officials.Since August, the disease has infected more than 1,100 people, with 124 deaths.
Health ministry epidemiologists have long observed that plague season coincides with the period when famadihana ceremonies are held from July to October.But who cares about the plague?
Scoffs one participant, I will always practise the turning of the bones of my ancestors plague or no plague.
The plague is a lie.
