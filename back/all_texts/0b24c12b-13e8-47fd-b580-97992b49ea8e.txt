Borderless travel through Europe is dying, a political victim of mass-murder in Paris.
That is the conclusion of many sensible people, including Alex Carlile, the former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation.
Lord Carlile, incidentally, is a Liberal Democrat.
Seeing the flaws in the Schengen rules, which allow free movement across much of the European Union, is no longer confined to the political Right.That conclusion is based on reports that at least one of the Paris killers arrived in Greece and claimed to be a refugee from Syria, then travelled on from Greece across the EU unchecked before reaching France.Even before Paris, Schengen was crumbling under the pressure of what some have called the great migration from the Middle East and Africa into the EU.
Borderless travel meant a lopsided distribution of new arrivals, often unwanted.
The fences that went up over the summer will now become higher and more numerous, as many will no doubt conclude that not only do the foreigners arriving on this continent threaten their culture and livelihood, some of them pose a physical threat too.
