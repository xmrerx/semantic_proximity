brussels ( reuters ) - at 70 euros ( $ 82 ) a night , with the rumble of the brussels metro thrown in , carles puigdemont is hardly living the high life of a political fugitive charged with abusing public funds .
the catalan leader , ousted by madrid and facing charges of rebellion and sedition as well as wasting money on a referendum on independence , has been staying since his arrival in belgium on monday at the 3-star chambord hotel , staff said .
and while it may be named after the grandest french chateau on the loire , once home to the 18th-century deposed king of poland , it offers rather more modest accommodation for today s exile behind an elegant 1920s art deco facade .
it does , however , offer a rapid getaway into the adjacent underground station .
puigdemont told a news conference on tuesday that he had not come for the belgian asylum which at least one flemish nationalist government minister has said might be offered , but to lobby the european union institutions .
he forswore , however , staying in the european quarter itself , and its upscale hotels which regularly house eu heads of state during summit meetings .
his plans remain unclear and he has had only the coolest of welcomes from the eu and the belgian government .
with prosecutors summoning him to testify before spain s high court on thursday , puigdemont may face demands from madrid for his arrest if he fails to heed the summons .
as television camera crews set up outside in the hope of catching europe s most wanted politician step out for dinner , no belgian police were visible at the hotel on tuesday evening .
