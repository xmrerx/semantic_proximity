Another huge crowd of Americans tuned in last week as the Republicans held their latest fear-fest, also known as a debate.
Refusing to acknowledge that so many people have been tuning in to watch them make fools of themselves and to see what Donald Trump will say next, the GOP field of freaks took the opportunity to once again go at each other s throats for at least half of the debate while invoking fear and bashing Hillary Clinton for the other half.On the flip side, the Democratic debate held at 9PM on a Sunday night after a long day of playoff football drew a tenth of the audience but had a thousand times the substance.
As the GOP remains focused on having Americans clutch their guns while watching out the front window for ISIS to come knocking on their doors, the Democrats were firmly planted in the world of domestic policy, discussing things that the next president will have the pleasure of dealing with here at home.Both debates had desirable outcomes.
The Republicans continued making fools of themselves, alienating more independent voters in the process, in two and a half hours of Clinton bashing, fear-mongering nonsense while the Democrats finally got to see the candidates bear their teeth while Martin O malley interrupted every so often to spread his vision of a world where tree-hugging liberals will stand next to Ammon Bundy for the betterment of humanity.No matter who you support, there was plenty of material from both debates to go around.
As comedians and late-night show hosts get back to work, there will be plenty of laughs to be had.
Trevor Noah and the team at Comedy Central s Daily Show were the first to hit an absolute home-run with a hilarious segment that includes brutal jabs at the GOP combined with some hilarious Democratic moments as well.Trevor Noah may be having trouble with ratings and people may still not be over the loss of Jon Stewart from their Daily Show fix, but he continues to show why he was Stewart s choice to move his beloved show forward.
