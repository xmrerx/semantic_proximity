cairo ( reuters ) - islamic state released a video on tuesday that it said showed two russian soldiers captured by its fighters in the syrian city of deir al-zor , where russia has been backing the syrian military against militants .
but the russian defence ministry denied their soldiers had been captured , interfax news agency reported .
the defense ministry , and the foreign ministry , did not immediately respond to requests for comment submitted by reuters .
in the 42-second video , released on the group s amaq news agency , two men appeared briefly in a room wearing gray tunics .
one , with a beard , appeared to be in handcuffs .
the other seemed to have bruises on his face .
reuters could not immediately verify the video .
the bearded man spoke in russian , the other remained silent , with arabic subtitles in the video .
it was dated oct. 3 , though there was no other evidence when the video was made .
the bearded man , speaking to the camera , gave his name , his date of birth , and his home village in southern russia .
he then said : i was taken prisoner during a counter-offensive by islamic state .
he said he was taken prisoner with a second man , whose name , date of birth and home district he also gave .
amaq said late last month the militants captured two russians as they battled in towns around deir al-zor .
the russian defense ministry denied then that any military personnel were taken hostage .
with russian air power and iran-backed militias , the syrian army reached deir al-zor city in august , breaking an islamic state siege of an enclave there that had lasted three years as the jihadist group lost ground in iraq and syra .
with u.s.-led jets and special forces , an alliance of kurdish and arab militias is battling islamic state on the east side of the euphrates river , as they also capture swathes of deir al-zor province from islamic state .
