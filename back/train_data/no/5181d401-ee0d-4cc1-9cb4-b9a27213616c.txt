yaounde ( reuters ) - cameroon authorities on friday banned all gatherings of more than four people , ordered bus stations , eateries and shops to shut and forbade movement between divisions of its english-speaking region for three days to prevent planned protests .
anglophone cameroonians plan to demonstrate on oct. 1st , the day of their independence from britain , over what they say is ill treatment and neglect by the predominantly francophone government of president paul biya .
the protests have become a lightening rod for opposition to biya s 35-year rule .
the last time there were big protests in the western region , the government responded by unplugging the internet , shooting dead six protesters and arrested hundreds of others , some of whom were charged with crimes that carry the death penalty .
public gatherings and assembly of more than four persons shall be strictly forbidden .
all off licenses , snack bars and night clubs shall not operate .
motor parks shall remain closed , said the order signed by adolphe lele lafrique , governor of the northwest region .
any persons who attempt to violate this order shall be prosecuted , it added .
the draconian measures are likely to provoke further anger driving a movement that is fast morphing from a bid for equal rights into a full-fledged struggle for independence .
cameroon s divide has its roots in the end of world war one , when the league of nations divided the former german colony of kamerun between the allied french and british victors .
thousands of anglophone demonstrators took to the streets last friday , some of them hoisting separatist flags .
the government ordered its border with nigeria closed this weekend .
the anglophone regions have strong ties to eastern nigeria and authorities may fear that allowing the border to remain open during protests offers the demonstrators a rear base and makes it harder to maintain order .
