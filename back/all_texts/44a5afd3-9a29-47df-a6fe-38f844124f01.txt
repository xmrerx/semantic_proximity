Bennett is the highest-paid African-American in the Mayor s Office.While most fathers wouldn t want their daughters hanging around a violent thug like this, when your dad is an adamant supporter of Black Lives Matter and mom hangs out with rappers, guys like this are who they want in their family s inner circle.
