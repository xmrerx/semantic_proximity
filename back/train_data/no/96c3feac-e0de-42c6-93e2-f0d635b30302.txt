zurich ( reuters ) - more than a quarter of austrian voters may still be undecided ahead of the oct. 15 election , according to one poll , although a separate survey suggested that foreign minister sebastian kurz s people s party maintains a robust lead .
twenty-seven percent of voters were undecided , according data from a research affairs online poll of 600 people released late saturday by tabloid newspaper oesterreich .
another poll published on sunday by the kurier newspaper showed 33 percent of voters backed kurz s conservative party , with current chancellor christian kern s left-leaning social democrats running second at 27 percent .
the rightist freedom party was third , according to the kurier poll , with 25 percent .
last week the social democrats chairman resigned after the party was linked to two facebook accounts that made unsubstantiated allegations against kurz and the controversy is likely boost voter turnout , said wolfgang bachmayer , whose ogm research service conducted the survey for kurier .
his poll suggests 79 percent of eligible voters will cast their ballots .
issues of substance have been completely overshadowed , with mud-slinging instead moving into the spotlight , bachmayer said .
on the brighter side of things , there are clear indications that participation will rise .
austria s co-governing social democrats and conservative people s party said on friday they would sue each other in the escalating scandal .
the kurier poll was conducted between sept. 29 and oct. 5 and included 1,002 telephone interviews , with 470 people identifying themselves as voters certain to cast ballots on oct. 15 .
oesterreich s online survey , gathered from last monday to wednesday , had a relatively small sample size of 600 people , with a wide margin of error .
