moscow ( reuters ) - north korea has petitioned the russian parliament to help 3,500 migrant workers from the isolated asian country stay in russia despite new u.n. sanctions , the interfax news agency reported on friday , citing a russian lawmaker .
tougher sanctions on north korea , imposed by the united nations security council over pyongyang s ballistic missile and nuclear programs on sept. 11 , banned countries from providing new work permits for north korean nationals , but allowed existing workers to remain .
most of the around 30,000-40,000 north korean migrants legally working in russia were hired before the new sanctions entered into force and the ban will not affect them , interfax said , quoting an earlier statement from maxim topilin , russia s labor minister .
but the ban could apply to 3,500 workers who only signed their contracts in september , the month when the u.n. security council , including russia , voted for the new sanctions , interfax reported .
it cited kazbek taysayev , a lawmaker in the lower house of parliament and a member of a friendship group between the russian and north korean parliaments , as saying : north korea s embassy officially addressed us .
we supported them and sent our petitions in order to let these people stay so that they can work .
even if the workers signed their contracts after the ban took effect , they had started making arrangements and preparing the documents earlier and could be allowed to stay , said taysayev .
the u.n. resolution said it did not apply to work permits for which written contracts have been finalized prior to the adoption of this resolution .
north korea s embassy in moscow was not available for immediate comment .
