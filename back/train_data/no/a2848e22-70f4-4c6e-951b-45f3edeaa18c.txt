doesn t matter if it s a bible or a holy quran , it s just the promise to perform to the best of your ability , swearing on something sacred to you , a facebook user said .
the problem is that america isn t a christian nation .
it s supposed to accept all religions and be a nation that accepts people regardless of their race , religion , and now sexual orientation .
if we don t allow all to be equal and free , then we lose the essence that makes us truly american , she added .
she follows the constitution just as christian judges don t follow the bible when they pass a verdict , she will not follow the quran when she rules in a court of law , a user said in response to those against her induction.meanwhile , others denounced the fact that she was allowed a to take oath on the quran instead of the bible.a facebook user posted a picture of the holy quran burning in flames to express his disagreement , while others took it a step further and posted images where the quran is used as toilet paper , and messages such as f * * k islam and obscene remarks against muslims.while social media users were arguing about whether she is allowed to take oath on the quran , no one focused on carolyn walker s exceptional work .
here s a glimpse of her skills and achievements : carolyn received a juris doctor from new york law school .
she serves as first vice-chair of brooklyn community board 5 , board chair of the george walker jr. community coalition , inc. , board member of the east new york restoration local development corporation , and a member of the 75th precinct community council .
she is also a trained mediator with the new york peace institute , according to her biography.via : free republic
