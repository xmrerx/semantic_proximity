21st century wire says after 7 years of systematic and pathological lying , and fabricating thousands of fraudulent news reports about syria , by now it s widely understood that us and uk media have now lost all credibility by now .
even since the defeat of the western-backed terrorist occupation of east aleppo in december 2016 , western corporate media outlets dispatched various trained gatekeepers and deep state stenographers in an attempt to try and rescue many of their legacy narratives , all of which have since collapsed after most western and gulf-backed terrorists have fled their strongholds while leaving volumes of damning evidence behind in the process .
with that in mind , we thought it poignant then to re-air this timeless exhibit a breathtaking display of us propaganda gone array , where yahoo !

in this embarrassing exchange , isikoff tries on a series of contrived reports concocted by amnesty international and the fbi , and even alludes to the widely discredited caesar photos hoax , amid a sustained barrage of human rights virtue signalling , all while accusing assad of numerous war crimes .
as interviews go , this was certainly one of the low water marks in us media history .
