On Thursday afternoon, Hillary Clinton delivered an impassioned speech regarding foreign policy and how dangerous Donald Trump would be not only to the nation, but to the world.
She delivered it well and made point after point driving home the fact that Trump simply cannot be our next president.Not taking too kindly to the fact that Clinton was going after him, Trump quickly took to his medium of choice Twitter.Trump wrote: Bad performance by Crooked Hillary Clinton!
Reading poorly from the telepromter!
She doesn t even look presidential!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 2, 2016If only he knew how to spell teleprompter.And does Trump consider name-calling, explanation points and spelling incorrectly presidential?
Apparently so.Oh, and yes, Trump did use a teleprompter for his foreign policy speech as well, and it was about as awkward as a 13-year-old boy asking the prettiest girl in school to the middle school spring fling.Truth be told, Trump doesn t even have the maturity level of a 13-year-old boy, probably more along the lines of a five- or six-year old.
It s gotten to the point where you re waiting for him to tell people Hillary has cooties.
Maybe he already has.
Who s to know, really?Trump can go after Clinton all he wants on foreign policy, but the facts are the facts, and she absolutely wipes the floor with him in regards to experience.
For example, he has none, and she s a former Secretary of State who is more traveled than any other Secretary of State in the history of the republic.
She s brokered peace deals, for goodness sake.At the end of the day, it comes down to who can actually lead and get the job done, and Trump most certainly is not that person.
No matter who the nominee is for the Democrats, they need to win in November.Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images Twitter
