beirut ( reuters ) - a syrian kurdish militia accused turkish forces on tuesday of aggression and escalation in the afrin region , which it controls , on syria s northwestern border with turkey .
ankara has sent forces into areas of syria adjacent to afrin to oppose the influence of the ypg militia , which it sees as a branch of the pkk movement that has waged a three-decade insurgency inside turkey .
the ypg spearheads the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) , an alliance of kurdish and arab militias fighting islamic state with the help of a u.s.-led coalition .
turkish president tayyip erdogan said last week that turkey needed to cleanse afrin of the ypg .
on monday , ankara accused it of attacking an observation post in idlib province .
in an apparent response to that charge , the ypg said in a statement that turkey was spreading several rumors about our forces attacking turkish lands .
it said turkey had fired artillery and machine guns at several villages in afrin on monday .
turkey backed an incursion into a part of syria immediately east of afrin last year in support of anti-government syrian rebel factions , which led to frequent clashes with the ypg .
last month , ankara also sent some troops into idlib , south and west of afrin , as part of a deal it has agreed with russia and iran to set up so-called de-escalation zones to reduce fighting .
