( reuters ) - the head of a g4s-run immigration unit in britain at the center of allegations of bullying and abuse , has resigned , the outsourcing company said on friday .
g4s said ben saunders , director of the immigration removal center near gatwick airport in southeast england , would be replaced on an interim basis by lee hanford from monday , sept. 25 , pending the appointment of a permanent successor .
british lawmakers accused g4s last week of repeated failures of detainee welfare safeguards and whistleblowing mechanisms at the immigration center , after physical and verbal abuse by guards was revealed in a bbc documentary .
g4s , contracted by the british government to run the brook house center , earlier this month suspended 10 members of staff , three of whom have now been sacked , for abusive behavior following the documentary .
police are also investigating .
earlier this year an investigation at the g4s-run medway secure training centre resulted in allegations of abuse and mistreatment of youngsters .
the center is now run by the government s national offender management service .
