Trump has signed a stream of executive orders stripping federal funding from international, non-governmental health organizations that so much as mention abortion, authorizing a gigantic wall to keep brown people out of our country to create a gigantic safe space for his racist followers and authorizing concentration camps in which to keep the millions of immigrants he rounds up, and in a move that literally mobilized the world against him enacting a partial ban on Muslims entering the United States, including dual citizens, legal permanent residents, students, people with jobs, and others he considers dangerous.Even the most casual observer can see that Donald Trump s horrific policies are doing nothing but creating a destabilized environment not only in the United States, but worldwide.
On Sunday, Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham released a joint statement warning that Trump s Muslim ban is a self-inflicted wound in the fight against terrorism.
Our most important allies in the fight against ISIL are the vast majority of Muslims who reject its apocalyptic ideology of hatred, the senators said [Trump s] executive order sends a signal, intended or not, that America does not want Muslims coming into our country.
That is why we fear this executive order may do more to help terrorist recruitment than improve our security.
We should not stop green-card holders from returning to the country they call home.
We should not stop those who have served as interpreters for our military and diplomats from seeking refuge in the country they risked their lives to help, the senators, added.
And we should not turn our backs on those refugees who have been shown through extensive vetting to pose no demonstrable threat to our nation, and who have suffered unspeakable horrors, most of them women and children.
Trump could take this message to heart, pausing for a glorious moment of self-reflection, and apologize to the world for his actions.
He could fire the white supremacists, Kremlin cronies, and imbeciles with which he has stacked his cabinet and replace them with people who will work for the good of the country, once and for all cementing himself as a true legend among world leaders.
Trump could apologize to the Muslim community but that s just not the guy he is.In a statement on Twitter, which is apparently where the President releases important information now, Trump responded to the senators condemnation of his bigoted executive order, which was literally written by a white supremacist, by informing the world that McCain and Graham are trying to start World War III by saying that we shouldn t ban Muslims from our country.The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong they are sadly weak on immigration.
The two Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017 Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017 The joint statement of former presidential candidates John McCain & Lindsey Graham is wrong they are sadly weak on immigration, Trump said, apparently not having read a single one of the senators words.
The two Senators should focus their energies on ISIS, illegal immigration and border security instead of always looking to start World War III.
Naturally, the irony of that whole World War III thing was not lost on the Internet.
@realDonaldTrump They should focus on removing you from office.

I think you might be 'projecting' as the psychologists say.

@realDonaldTrump Blanket Muslim bans is a pretty effective way to start World War III.
Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) January 29, 2017@realDonaldTrump You are The one about to get us involved in World War III.

The Socialist Party (@OfficialSPGB) January 29, 2017@realDonaldTrump Please, please, don't even mention World War III.
We're tense enough already.
Matt Peterson (@mattbpete) January 29, 2017@realDonaldTrump Presidents shouldn't tweet about World War 3.

Molly Knight (@molly_knight) January 29, 2017Trump s chief strategist and newest member of the National Security Council described himself as a Leninist whose goal is to destroy the state and bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today s establishment, during his time running white supremacist hate rag Breitbart.
He s also the guy who has been in charge of writing The Donald s executive orders.Trump can accuse others of attempting to start World War III all he wants, but if anyone is going to kick that world-ending disaster off, it will be his team.Featured image by Christopher Furlong/Win McNamera via Getty Images/screengrab
