Early Saturday morning, a customer at a Kansas International House of Pancakes called 911 to report that one of the NRA s responsible gun owners had opened fire on him for the most ridiculous reason one can think of.According to Wichita Police Sgt.
Steve Yarberry, the 31-year-old victim had asked another man to stop spewing racial slurs at the restaurant.
Instead of offering a polite acquiescence or even engaging in a spirited debate, the hate-spewing gentleman opted to communicate using the Second Amendment not the words, but the action.
At least one shot was fired in the parking lot of the IHOP.
Upon leaving the restaurant, the unnamed victim noticed a black sedan following him.
Then at least three more gunshots rang out.
Police believe that the shooter stalked his victim.
One of the rounds struck the tailgate of his vehicle, Yarberry explained.
Fortunately the target, who only asked that the man stop acting like a racist douchebag, was not hurt in the attack.
He did not know the shooter, the Sergeant says.According to the National Rifle Association, nothing should have impeded the shooter s ability to own and possess a firearm until the very moment he pulled the trigger or committed another crime with the gun.
Until that moment, he was a good guy with a gun, the last line of defense against a tyrannical government and criminals like himself.
But that s the problem good guys and bad guys look exactly the same, until it is too late, that is.The suspect has still not been identified or apprehended.Featured image via The Wichita Eagle
