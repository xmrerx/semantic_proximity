bosaso , somalia ( reuters ) - the u.s. military said on monday it had carried out an air strike against islamic state militants in northeast somalia , killing one person .
islamic state has been gathering recruits in the region , although experts say the scale of its force is unclear and it remains a small player compared to the al shabaab group .
in coordination with the federal government of somalia , u.s. forces conducted an airstrike against isis , in northeastern somalia on nov. 27 , killing one terrorist , the u.s. africa command said in a statement .
colonel ali abdi , a military officer in an area near the town of qandala in the semi-autonomous puntland region , said the strike took place in hills near the town .
we heard a huge crash of air strike in the hilly areas of dasaan remote area behind qandala town this afternoon abdi told reuters from dasaan .
after the strike the is militants ran away from there .
we went to the scene and saw pieces of a dead body .
last month , a group loyal to islamic state seized a small port town in somalia s semi-autonomous puntland region , the first town it has taken since emerging a year ago .
the group , which refers to itself simply as islamic state , is a rival to the larger al shabaab force , which is linked to islamic state s rival al qaeda and once controlled much of somalia .
early this month , the u.s. military carried out its first air strike against islamic state militants , killing several .
last week , somalia s government said it had requested a u.s. air strike that killed scores of suspected militants to help pave the way for an upcoming ground offensive against al shabaab .
earlier this year , the white house granted the u.s. military broader authority to carry out strikes in somalia against al shabaab .
