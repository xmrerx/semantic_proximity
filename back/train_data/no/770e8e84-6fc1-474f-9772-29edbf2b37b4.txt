paris ( reuters ) - president emmanuel macron formally signed five decrees overhauling france s labor rules on friday , the first major economic reforms since he took power in may .
the new rules , discussed at length in advance with unions , will cap payouts on dismissals that are judged unfair , while also giving companies greater freedom to hire and fire employees and to agree working conditions .
macron said that the decrees would become law in the coming days , although they do not take effect in practice until further decrees spelling out finer details are signed before the end of the year .
leaders and members of labor unions opposed to the reform - not all unions are totally opposed - marched through cities across france on thursday in protest , albeit in much lower numbers than similar protests a week earlier .
the changes to the labor code are the first in a number of reforms macron has promised with the aim of reinvigorating the economy and bringing down unemployment .
there are also plans to amend the unemployment benefits and pension systems , changes that are likely to provoke much more popular unrest .
