WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama did not specify a candidate preference in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination at a Democratic National Committee fundraising event, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters on Thursday.
Earnest was asked about a New York Times report that said Obama told Democratic donors to rally behind candidate Hillary Clinton during the fundraiser in Austin, Texas last weekend.
