DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran has halted flights to airports in Iraqi Kurdistan at the request of the central government in Baghdad, the semi-official Fars news agency reported on Sunday, a day before a Kurdish independence referendum.
The agency quoted Keyvan Khosravi, spokesman for Iran s top security body, as adding that Iran was also closing its airspace to flights originating in Iraqi Kurdistan.
