WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney said on Thursday that any tax reform package passed by Congress this year would be retroactive.
“If it passes by the end of the year it will be retroactive,” Mulvaney told Fox Business Network when asked whether any changes in law would be retroactive to the start of the year.
