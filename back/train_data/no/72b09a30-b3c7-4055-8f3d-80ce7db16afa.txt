frankfurt ( reuters ) - prosecutors and tax authorities on tuesday raided the offices of several senior officials of volkswagen ( vowg_p.de ) , the german car-maker said .
investigators searched the offices of supervisory board chairman hans dieter poetsch , finance chief frank witter , and human resources head karlheinz blessing , a volkswagen spokesman said .
files and computers were seized .
the raid was related to suspicions of overpayments for works council chief bernd osterloh , the spokesman said .
osterloh s office was also searched .
neither the works council nor the prosecutor in braunschweig were immediately available for comment .
a person with knowledge of the matter said the tax authorities were acting on suspicion of tax evasion .
that is because over-remuneration could result in overly high operating expenses and the payment of too little tax .
it was revealed earlier that german prosecutors were investigating current and former executives at volkswagen on suspicion that they paid works council chief bernd osterloh an excessive salary .
in germany , wasting corporate funds is legally a breach of fiduciary duty .
