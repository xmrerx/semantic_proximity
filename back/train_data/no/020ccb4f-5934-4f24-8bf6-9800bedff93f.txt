goma , democratic republic of congo ( reuters ) - a home belonging to democratic republic of congo president joseph kabila has been attacked and a policeman died in the incident , local lawmakers and u.n. sponsored radio said on monday .
photos posted on social media showed the main house on the farm , located near the village of musienene in north kivu province in the east of the country , was gutted by fire .
kabila was not at the property during the attack which took place overnight from sunday to monday .
it was not immediately known who was responsible for the raid .
the body of the policeman who died was burned , a local government official said .
congo is embroiled in a political crisis linked to kabila s refusal to step down as president when his mandate expired a year ago while militia violence and political unrest are increasing .
we firmly condemn this barbarous act and call on the population ... to disassociate from any actions likely to compromise peace and development in this part of the country , lawmakers said in a statement .
more than a decade after the end of a 1998-2003 war in which millions of people died , mostly from hunger and disease , rebel fighters and local militias stalk congo s mineral-rich eastern borderlands .
the armies of congo and neighboring uganda launched a joint operation against the congo-based , ugandan allied democratic forces ( adf ) last week .
the islamist rebel group is suspected of being behind a dec. 8 attack on a united nations base in north kivu that killed 15 tanzanian peacekeepers and five congolese soldiers .
the adf has been blamed for a wave of attacks and massacres in the area .
raids by local mai mai militia fighters are also growing increasingly frequent .
