It seems that Donald Trump is often incapable of avoiding really stupid, but public, mistakes on Twitter.
Oftentimes those are spelling errors, and sometimes they re factual errors, but sometimes they re just bizarre.
April 26 is Melania s birthday, and to look like a good husband, he tweeted a happy birthday message to her.
Across the bottom of the image is a banner that reads, First Lady Melania Trump 4.26.2017, with an American flag.HAPPY BIRTHDAY to our @FLOTUS, Melania!

The flag on that banner there never existed.
It only has 39 stars the U.S. has never had a 39-star flag.
In 1889, flag makers were making 39-star flags in anticipation of North and South Dakota becoming states, but they thought that they would be admitted as one state, not two.
In addition, three other states were added to the Union in 1890.
We went from 38 states to 43, which made the 39-star flag useless before it was even official.As is always the case, Twitter locked onto the fact that the man in the White House, who holds the highest office in the land, tweeted a fake flag:@christinawilkie @chrislhayes @FLOTUS @eventsforgood How soon before we find out a 39-star American flag is some sort of alt-right meme?
Greg Saunders (@waltisfrozen) April 27, 2017The US flag in Trump s tweet is missing 11 stars; it only has 39. h/t @christinawilkie (https://t.co/05dwk78JSD) pic.twitter.com/nvyuOBT3Eu southpaw (@nycsouthpaw) April 27, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS @mauriciomacri @WhiteHouse @HillaryClinton Did he tell you that there are actually 50 stars on the American flag, not 39?https://t.co/pTB5Dy5PUn pic.twitter.com/sAkF5V8rgQ ?

WE NEVER EVEN HAD A 39 STAR FLAG.
ND (39) and SD (40) Were admitted on the SAME DAMN DAY.

TheWood (@TheWood52925) April 27, 2017So apparently #DonaldTrump s tweet had a flag with only 39 stars on it.

https://t.co/AVPHcTUx3u Politics Village (@PoliticsVillage) April 27, 2017@ALT_uscis And there s a 39-star flag being featured on official WH documents!
His plan is to save money by eliminating STATES.
Like Hawaii.
Now PR?
actor1 (@Actor1) April 27, 2017THE IDIOT THINKS THE FLAG ONLY HAS 39 STARS Even DT s birthday tweet to Melania has a factual error it in https://t.co/KDu5zmWHjf via S. Best-James, Ph.D. (@JoylynBest) April 27, 2017@Brasilmagic It s brutal finding a clipart flag with 50 stars.
The hilarious part is you probably have to work pretty hard to find one with 39.

Terry Hannan (@terryhannan) April 27, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS why are there only 39 stars in that flag?
what 11 states are you removing for her birthday?
TJ Liwanag (@TimothyJLiwanag) April 27, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FLOTUS Really, a 39 star flag.
Someone on your staff needs to purge his computer, since this is 2nd time this has happened Lewis Shatzer (@Shatzer667192) April 27, 2017Maybe the 39-star flag is the last one that Russia recognizes.
https://t.co/ENenQx2hGS CharlieL (@CharlieLevenson) April 27, 2017LOL what s worse is that the flag has NEVER had 39 stars, on July 4th 1890 it went from 38 to 43 stars w/ addition of ID MT WA ND SD #USA https://t.co/tcenf9u70j Lonnie H.
