It would be a real shame if that hot coffee was made by some horrible war-mongering veteran or evil gay person .A Marine veteran who spilled coffee on Westboro Baptist Church protesters last weekend admits he lost his temper, but says defending the U.S. flag is worth possible jail time.
So many people have died in defense of that flag.
I don t care who you are, you are not going to disrespect the flag.
And if I have to go to jail to defend that flag, I m going to do it, said Richard Pierce, 64, The News Journal of Delaware reported Wednesday.The veteran was arrested and charged with disorderly conduct after the June 6 incident.
He has a July 20 hearing in the Court of Common Pleas, the newspaper reported.Mr.
Pierce, who served in Vietnam, said he wasn t expecting to cause trouble on Saturday while watching the presidential motorcade for Vice President Joseph R. Biden s son head for Wilmington.
The funeral for 46-year-old Beau Biden, who died after a two-year fight with brain cancer, was held at St. Anthony of Padua Catholic Church.
When I saw the young lady walking across the highway, dragging our flag under her feet, I lost my temper and the only way that I could demonstrate that is spill my coffee on them, Mr. Pierce said, the newspaper reported.The Marine veteran s coffee soaked two of the three members who picketed the motorcade with anti-U.S. and anti-gay signs.Via: Washington Times
