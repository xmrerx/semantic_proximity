Michigan governor Rick Snyder is being called to appear before a congressional hearing about how the city of Flint s water supply was poisoned with lead.Snyder, a Republican, made the call on changing the city s source of water in order to save money.
As a result, thousands in the mostly black city have been affected.A spokeswoman for the committee did not immediately return a request for comment on the hearing, which would be the first congressional inquiry into the crisis.
President Barack Obama signed an emergency designation for Genesee County and Flint last Saturday and the Federal Emergency Management Agency is supplying water and water filters to residents.Lawrence, D-Southfield, a week ago sent a letter to leaders of the committee, of which she is a member, asking for the hearing, saying it s Congress responsibility to address a man-made disaster created by the poor policy decisions of elected and career government officials.
Snyder s office was pushed by national criticism to release internal emails about how they responded to the water crisis, and though some of those emails were redacted to the point of absurdity, they also reveal that early concerns about the water were downplayed and ridiculed:A top aide to Michigan s governor referred to people raising questions about the quality of Flint s water as an anti-everything group.
Other critics were accused of turning complaints about water into a political football.
And worrisome findings about lead by a concerned pediatrician were dismissed as data, in quotes.Hillary Clinton dispatched officials from her campaign to go to Michigan to speak to local officials about the water problems, while Senator Bernie Sanders has called for Governor Snyder to resign.While visiting Michigan, President Obama said the damage to the community was inexplicable and inexcusable.
By contrast, Donald Trump refused to speak about the water issue.Featured image via Twitter
