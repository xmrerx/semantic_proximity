donald trump just doesn t know how to keep his mouth shut and he continues to receive the mockery he deserves.on monday night , the republican nominee accused hillary clinton of being to blame for the recent execution of iranian spy shahram amiri , who gave information about iran s nuclear program to the cia.many people are saying that the iranians killed the scientist who helped the u.s. because of hillary clinton s hacked emails .
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) august 8 , 2016he directly mentioned hillary clinton s email as the reason why amiri was killed , but the new york times notes : among the side players was hillary clinton , the secretary of state , who said as mr. amiri was returning to iran : he s free to go .
he was free to come .
those decisions are his alone to make .
some of her emails , made public last year during the controversy over her private email server , show that her top foreign policy aide warned her that the story was about to break , but they give little insight into what happened behind the scenes.in short , amiri chose to return to iran even though he was warned that doing so could result in his death .
hillary s emails had nothing to do with his demise.but trump made the accusation anyway and twitter users were swift in dealing out mockery with the hashtag # manypeoplearesaying .
