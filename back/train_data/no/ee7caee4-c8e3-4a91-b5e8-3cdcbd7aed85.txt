frankfurt ( reuters ) - tensions between germany and turkey are holding up planned defense projects at rheinmetall , the german company s chief executive told news agency dpa in an interview .
ties between the two nato allies have been strained by turkish president tayyip erdogan s crackdown on opponents after a failed coup last year as well as germany s refusal to extradite people turkey says were involved in the plot .
rheinmetall ceo armin papperger said in the interview published on monday that several projects , including the production of ammunition for fighter jets in turkey and upgrades to turkey s leopard tanks , were still awaiting decisions by the two governments .
if relations with turkey don t improve it will be difficult to obtain clearance from germany , he said .
poor relations have also dimmed rheinmetall s prospects for playing a role in turkey s altay tank project , worth an estimated 7 billion euros ( $ 8.13 billion ) , dpa said .
turkey s bmc , with which rheinmetall has a joint venture in turkey , is among the bidders for the first tranche to build around 100 to 200 of a planned 1,000 combat tanks , dpa said .
if bmc wins the contract , rheinmetall could in theory take part in the development of the tank via joint venture rbss , in which the german company holds a 40 percent stake , but it would need an export clearance from the german government .
papperger said rheinmetall had no plans to build its own tank factory in turkey .
