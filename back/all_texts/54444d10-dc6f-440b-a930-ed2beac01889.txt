Donald Trump s candidacy has been very concerning to experts and leaders on national security.
His erratic and aggressive philosophies on war and security would likely get thousands of Americans and others killed, while destabilizing the world and making the entire planet less safe.To address those concerns, a new ad has been produced by the veterans group VoteVets starring Major General Paul D. Eaton highlighting why he cannot support Trump for president.Referencing his father s military service, and the men and women who served under them during his time in the military, General Eaton says, for all of them, and for our country, I cannot support Donald Trump.
Eaton points out that Donald Trump does not have the temperament or judgement to be our commander-in-chief, that s why I m speaking out.
Trump s agenda presents key dangers for America s military, including his expressed desire to renew the torture program that began under Bush/Cheney.
Trump has said he would expand waterboarding, which is a violation of the Geneva Conventions, and said he would make the military attack and kill the families of terrorists a likely war crime.The presumptive Republican nominee was widely criticized for a speech in which he praised dictator Saddam Hussein the so-called butcher of Baghdad for what he described as good policies against terrorism.
Later fact checks pointed out that in addition to being an oppressive authoritarian dictator, Hussein actually provided shelter and refuge for terrorists.Eaton served as Commanding General of the military coalition section that trained soldiers in Iraq between 2003-4.
He served in the military for over 36 years, then later became a critic of the Bush administration s reckless policies in Iraq.
Eaton since then has served as a military adviser to Hillary Clinton s 2008 presidential campaign, and as a supporter of Obama later that year.Featured image via YouTube screen capture
