The Trump administration likes to keep their backdoor deals tight-lipped, but a government transparency non-profit is about to lift the curtain and and shine some light on Trump s second White House the Mar-a-Lago resort.Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a government transparency watchdog, was able to obtain Mar-a-Lago resort s visitor logs, and will begin to release the logs to the public on September 8.CREW director Noah Bookbinder wants Trump s meetings to be public knowledge.
The public deserves to know who is coming to meet with the president and his staff.
We are glad that as a result of this case, this information will become public for meetings at his personal residences.
