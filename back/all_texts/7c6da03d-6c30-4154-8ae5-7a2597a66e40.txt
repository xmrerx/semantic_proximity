WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House Rules committee approved a Republican healthcare bill late on Wednesday night, a procedural hurdle cleared ahead of a planned vote on Thursday on the legislation by the entire chamber.
The bill would roll back the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, while keeping in place some key provisions and creating an $8 billion fund to cover costs for those with pre-existing conditions who would face higher costs under the new system.
