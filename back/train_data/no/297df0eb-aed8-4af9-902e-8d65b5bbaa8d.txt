the leftist agenda in action blurring the lines of sexuality , while stripping humanity of any sense of individuality or morality a leading north carolina newspaper issued an editorial last week telling girls to attempt overcoming discomfort at the sight of male genitalia , should transgender bathroom laws be enacted.in a defense of president obama s order compelling schools to allow access to restrooms on the basis of gender identity , the charlotte observer editorial board compared the discomfort of school-aged girls seeing male genitalia in locker rooms to the discomfort of white people being around black people in post-segregation america .
this is what the obama administration nudged the rest of the country toward friday , the editorial said .
yes , the thought of male genitalia in girls locker rooms and vice versa might be distressing to some .
but the battle for equality has always been in part about overcoming discomfort with blacks sharing facilities , with gays sharing marriage then realizing it was not nearly so awful as some people imagined .
while admitting that exposure to male genitalia is a possible outcome of transgender bathroom laws , the editorial said the notion that such laws constitute a threat to the privacy and safety of women and children is a political fiction pushed by republicans .
those safety issues are political fiction non-transgender men wouldn t have been allowed in women s bathrooms under the charlotte ordinance that hb 2 killed , and the 200 or so cities with similar ordinances have had no incidents involving bathroom predators , the editorial said .
