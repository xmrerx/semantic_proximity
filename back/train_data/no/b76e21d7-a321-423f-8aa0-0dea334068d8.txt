sydney ( reuters ) - a british explorer reported missing while searching for a remote tribe in papua new guinea has been spotted next to an airstrip and is awaiting evacuation , a friend said on thursday .
benedict allen , a documentary film maker , left last month to seek an isolated tribe , the yaifo , in the north of the remote and rural south pacific country of papua new guinea , but took no means of communication and left no evacuation plan or destination , his friend , frank gardner , told reuters .
according to his blog , allen aimed to be back in britain by mid-november .
don t try to rescue me , please - where i m going in png you won t ever find me you know , he wrote on twitter on oct. 11 .
but after he missed a flight home last weekend , friends and family raised the alarm .
benedict allen is not out of danger yet .
he is currently marooned in a remote part of papua new guinea that is only reachable by air after all the road bridges were cut due to tribal fighting , gardner , who is also the bbc s security correspondent , told reuters .
urgent efforts are now under way to try to airlift him out as soon as possible in case fighting erupts around him .
gardner had earlier told the bbc that a png tribal commission had been looking for allen and that he had been sighted by an airstrip .
reuters was unable to independently confirm the sighting .
allen , who calls himself an adventurer on his website , describes being beaten daily for six weeks on a previous trip to png as part of an initiation ritual .
he also describes trekking a remote section of the amazon , during which , dying of starvation and malaria , he was forced to eat his dog .
