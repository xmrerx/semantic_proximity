mexico city ( reuters ) - mexico s ruling institutional revolutionary party ( pri ) said on thursday registration for pri contenders in the july 2018 presidential election will begin on dec. 3 , and that a national convention would pick the candidate on feb. 18 .
in a statement , the pri said the national convention would be made up of around 19,100 delegates to be chosen during the second week of december .
president enrique pena nieto is barred by law from seeking a second six-year term .
ruling mexico continuously from 1929 , the pri had become a byword for corruption by the time it was voted out in 2000 .
pena nieto returned the party to power in 2012 , but a slew of corruption scandals , ongoing gang violence and anemic growth have sapped the pri s credibility in the past five years .
the party faces an uphill struggle to hang on to power , and veteran leftist andres manuel lopez obrador , twice a runner-up for the presidency , has led most early polling for 2018 .
the run-up to the election takes place in the midst of fraught discussions between mexico , the united states and canada over the future of the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) , which underpins much of the region s commerce .
u.s. president donald trump has threatened to walk away from the accord if he can not rework it in favor of the united states .
the three nations have pledged to keep talking through march .
