Donald Trump s presidential campaign is spiraling out of control, and now that it looks completely doomed, Republican donors are beginning to ask for a refund.
Stunned by the candidate s comments on assaulting women caught on an open mic as he chatted with Billy Bush, Republican donors are now at peak levels of outrage.A prominent Trump bundler told CBS News that he could not tell you how many calls he s gotten from donors in the course of the last day.
After the Washington Post first published the tape, people want their money back, he said.
(The Republican party and the campaign s fundraising apparatus is not returning donations.
)According to the bundler, donors said they feel betrayed by Trump that their efforts have been a waste.
Some said they would like to see Mike Pence, Trump s running mate and the governor of Indiana, at the top of the ticket, though the means of achieving such a switch aren t clear.Trump has already vowed that he will not step down as the Republican Party s nominee, despite pulled support from over a dozen Senators and Representatives.
The national party s hands are effectively tied anyway, as voting is already underway in some states where early voting has begun in person as well as with absentee ballots.While several of the senators who have called on Trump to step down have also asked for his running mate to step in, many believe that this is more of a face-saving maneuver than an actual serious demand.
Many of those who have made this request are Republicans in seats that are under siege from Democratic candidates with a high likelihood of a win, in so-called swing states.For all intents and purposes, the money that donors have sunk into the Trump campaign is lost forever, funds spent on a campaign on the verge of a major loss.Featured image via YouTube
