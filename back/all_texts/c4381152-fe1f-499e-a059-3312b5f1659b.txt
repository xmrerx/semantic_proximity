WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A short-term fix to fund the Children’s Health Insurance Program into January will likely be part of a stop-gap government funding bill Congress is expected to approve this week, White House legislative affairs director Marc Short said on Wednesday.
In an interview with MSNBC, Short also said a measure to protect immigrant youths known as “Dreamers” would probably not be considered until January.
