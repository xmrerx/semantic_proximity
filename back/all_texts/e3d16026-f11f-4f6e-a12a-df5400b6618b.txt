Throughout the course of Donald Trump s campaign for the presidency, he s been stoking fears around the nation.
His goal seems to be to lead through fear and if he can get enough people to believe the lies that he tells, they ll fall in line behind him to be their leader and protector.All of that is absolute poppycock because Trump wouldn t know how to protect you from a falling feather, let alone understand what it takes to be leader of the free world.Now, appearing at Trump s running-mate Mike Pence s campaign event on Tuesday, a Trump supporter brought up Trump s myth of voter fraud.
Which is that if he loses, it s because Hillary cheated, not at all because he s a horrible human being.Ironically, the only voter fraud currently being perpetrated is by Republicans trying to suppress the vote.However, this woman in the audience, with fear and horror in her voice, brought up the voter fraud Trump often talks about.
The woman said she s ready for a revolution because we can t have [Hillary] in.
When Pence heard that he stopped the woman in her tracks and said, don t say that.
And good on him for doing so.
Pence then reiterated that the revolution needs to happen is at the voting booth on November 8th.
Which, in all honesty, is an incredibly accurate and thoughtful response.Pence seems to understand that democracy isn t claiming the other side won because they cheated, but rather getting out the vote so that your side wins.That being said, Hillary Clinton is about to kick Trump s ass this November and it s because more people will want her over a racist a**hole who admits to sexual assault.Watch the video here: Woman: If Hillary Clinton gets in I m ready for a revolution, b/c we can t have her in Pence: Don t say that https://t.co/P5OrJBGW55 Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) October 11, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
