We all know that President-elect Donald Trump has no idea what he s doing in his new role, but he s becoming increasingly dangerous as he appoints billionaires and white supremacists to his cabinet against the advice of basically everyone (besides his racist supporters).Now, a recent report is giving some insight on how Trump will chose his Secretary of State.
According to a source that spoke to the New York Post, Trump left this decision up to his Thanksgiving party guests!
The New York Post reported that someone who had attended Trump s Thanksgiving dinner party at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida recalled that any moment Trump wasn t sitting down and eating with his family, he was running around asking club members who he should pick for his Secretary of State.
The source said: Donald was walking around asking everybody he could about who should be his secretary of state.
There was a lot of criticism about [Mitt] Romney, and a lot of people like Rudy [Giuliani].
There are also many people advocating for John Bolton.
