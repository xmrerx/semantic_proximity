The court records from the divorce of Trump s new campaign CEO have proved to be a treasure trove of information about the man hired to save the Republican nominee s trainwreck of a campaign.
The latest insight revealed in these documents is that Stephen Bannon has deeply anti-Semitic tendencies.
Shocking, I know.
(Insert eye roll here.
)According to court documents, the former Breitbart bigwig was worried about sending his twin daughters to the Archer School for Girls because of the number of Jewish students who were enrolled.
A statement signed by his ex-wife in 2007 said that Bannon was concerned about the impact Jewish classmates would have on his children.
The biggest problem he had with Archer is the number of Jews that attend, read her statement.
He said that he doesn t like the way they raise their kids to be whiny brats and that he didn t want the girls going to school with Jews.
When they looked into at least one other private school they were considering sending their daughters to, his ex-wife said that Bannon asked about the number of Jewish students attending.Naturally, Bannon is denying these claims.
Spokeswoman Alexandra Preate said that Bannon never made any of these statements and added that his girls did end up attending Archer.
Mr. Bannon said he never said anything like that and proudly sent the girls to Archer for their middle school and high school education, Preate said.This is the second damning revelation to come from his divorce proceedings this week.
Accusations of domestic abuse came to light on Thursday.
According to court documents, his wife claimed that he was a sadistic wife-beater who had grabbed her by the throat and arm during a domestic dispute on New Year s Day in 1996.
Police came and photographed her injuries, but Bannon was able to avoid consequences by scaring his victim into leaving town so she would miss the court date.Remember folks, Trump only hires the best people.Featured image via Kirk Irwin/Getty Images for SiriusXM
