lima ( reuters ) - peru s opposition-controlled congress approved president pedro pablo kuczynski s new cabinet with a 83-17 vote of confidence on friday , the latest resetting of relations between the executive and legislative branches in his year-old government .
congress , dominated by the right-wing popular force party , ousted kuczynski s previous cabinet in september in a dispute over a teachers strike and school curriculum that emphasizes gender equality .
in response , kuczynski formed a more socially conservative cabinet led by prime minister mercedes araoz , one of his vice presidents and a lawmaker in his party .
several opposition lawmakers wished araoz cabinet luck during more than 14 hours of debate before the vote of confidence .
kuczynski , a 79-year-old former wall street banker , took office in july 2016 promising to modernize peru and strengthen its economy .
but his first year in office has been marked by clashes with congress and slowing economic growth .
araoz told local broadcaster rpp on friday that the government is planning to revise tax policies to look for ways to close loopholes that have dragged on public revenue .
araoz said on thursday that she is going to ask congress to grant her cabinet special powers to legislate economic policies .
