Donald Trump s rally are a hotbed of bigotry, and that was proven at his latest event in Rock Hill, South Carolina.
A Muslim woman, Rose Hamid, 56, attended, and she says she had some predictably horrific encounters before Trump s goons finally threw her out for no reason other than the fact that she is Muslim.
Speaking to CNN s Don Lemon, Hamid said: One guy was saying, Get out do you have a bomb?
Do you have a bomb?
I said, No.
Do you have a bomb?
They were saying ugly, ugly things.
One guy was saying, God is great.
I said, Yeah, God is great.
Though Hamid wore a shirt that expressed peaceful intentions, she and another man were escorted from the event by a police officer.
To make matters worse, Trump himself seized the opportunity to stoke the fires of hate and bigotry in his ignorant base, saying as they were removed by a cop: There is hatred against us that is unbelievable.
It s their hatred, it s not our hatred.
Hamid summed the experience up perfectly when she told Don Lemon that Trump s repeated Islamophobia and hate speech is a vivid example of what happens when you start using this hateful rhetoric and how it can incite a crowd.
Lemon asked Hamid what most folks would ask a person who goes into a lion s den of hate deliberately: Some people would say, Why even put yourself in that position, Rose?
To be around those people.
Hamid s response was one of wisdom and bravery: Because I don t want to think of them as those people.
I think that s what the problem is, that we look at people and we categorize them as those people who are bad people and these people are the good people.
I believe that people in all camps are decent people as we get to know them.
Well, she has more faith in humanity and especially in Donald Trump supporters than I do.
Hopefully, on some level, Rose Hamid is right and I am wrong.Watch video of the interview below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story
