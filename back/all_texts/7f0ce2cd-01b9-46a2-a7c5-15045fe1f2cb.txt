We ve noticed a trend across America that s disturbing because the communities of Muslims do not assimilate but want Americans to bend to their every whim.
We noticed in the last election that a non-English speaking forum was held in Minneapolis for the 2016 election:Ilhan Omar now addressing the room.
No English so far in candidate speeches, so I can t relay what has been said pic.twitter.com/OH3jTpH91I Eric Roper (@StribRoper) March 2, 2016NO ENGLISH SPOKEN AT ALL Do you call that assimilation?Quite a scene here as Omar (left) and Noor (right) supporters break off pic.twitter.com/O2aRZ18HKC Eric Roper (@StribRoper) March 2, 2016An uptick in Muslim activists running for positions in public office is noticeable so we wanted to find out who s behind it: NEW AMERICAN LEADERS PROJECT RECRUITS ANYONE BUT WHITES TO RUN FOR OFFICENew group in Maryland is recruiting Muslim candidates to run for officeCANDIDATES ACROSS AMERICA WILL SHAPE POLICY:Son Of Egyptian Immigrants Hopes To Become FIRST MUSLIM GOVERNOR In U.S Will Push For Sanctuary State REFUGEE TO ACTIVIST: DEEQO JIBRIL IS GIVING IMMIGRANTS HOPE A nice fluff piece by NBC on a Muslim activist running for city council in MASSDearborn: Amnesty-pushing Obama Muslim appointee announces run for CongressWHY MUSLIMS ARE LESS LIKELY TO INTEGRATE INTO WESTERN NATIONS: Sharia lawyer and expert Daniel Akbari tells Ezra Levant of The Rebel Media why Muslims are less likely to integrate into Western nations.
This is one of the best interviews we ve come across on the truth in Sharia law and abiding by the Koran.
How can a Muslim follow our laws when they are taught to follow Sharia law?WRAPSNET is a great resource for anyone concerned about refugees and where they re going.
You can find out what who, what and where the refugees are going.
It s shocking to see but should be shared with everyone!What we found: Arrivals are close to 50,000!Some of the top states receiving refugees are Florida, Georgia, Texas, California and Arizona.
Please note that California is off the charts with over 4 thousand refugees!
Remember that those refugees can relocate anywhere they want to and do.
Pockets of mostly Muslim refugees like to live separated from their community so they will seek out other Muslim pods of refugees.Places like Minneapolis have become swamped with Somali Muslims.
They even have an area called Little Mogadishu that is flooded with Smoalis:Isolation of the Somali Muslim community AND teaching Sharia law in Muslim schools in Minneapolis are the two main reasons why we should still fear their recruitment to terrorism.
Assimilation hasn t happened and that s a HUGE problem!
A very recent article in the Minneapolis Star Tribune discusses a new Somali Mall:Minneapolis Council Member Abdi Warsame pledges to build new Somali mallPete Hegseth goes to Little Mogadishu and finds out that many Somali Muslims don t speak English and that they actually teach Sharia law in school but not sure about American law.
This all goes back to the REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM and the HUGE problem with bringing over 3 million MOSTLY Muslims to the U.S. in the past 30 years.
We need to take a look at defunding this program because it s ballooned way past what it was originally intended to be.
