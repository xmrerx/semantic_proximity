WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would be submitting planned reforms to the Affordable Care Act in early March or mid-March.
“We’re doing Obamacare, we’re in the final stages,” Trump told a news conference, adding: “So we will be submitting sometime in early March, mid-March.” Trump ran for the White House last year on a promise to repeal and replace the signature healthcare program of his predecessor President Barack Obama known as Obamacare.
