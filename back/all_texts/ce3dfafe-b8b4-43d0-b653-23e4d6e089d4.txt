A 10-year-old girl smacked down Donald Trump, and it was amazing.On Saturday, the Huffington Post interviewed Lexi, an adorable Hillary Clinton volunteer who had absolutely no problem shredding the Republican billionaire when asked how she feels about him.Lexi slammed Trump for having zero experience in government and compared him to her brother who thinks he knows everything.
Number one, he doesn t have any experience, at all, Lexi said.
And he sits there and thinks, Oh I m Mr. Donald Trump, I know everything, which is sort of like my brother.
She also broke the bad news to Trump s supporters that if they think they ll get money by voting for Trump, they are sorely mistaken.
He s just rich, a lot of people just vote for him because they think they ll get some money, too.
But that s not it.
You think you re going to get the money, but that s not the case.
Lexi then took aim at Trump s xenophobia and racism and made it clear what parents who vote for Trump can expect of their children s future should he get in the White House.
Oh, and she also had positive things to say about Bernie Sanders, who she sees as someone who is building an environment for the kids.
It s ridiculous because I mean, look at these people, your best friend you may not know is Muslim or Jewish.
And Bernie Sanders, he s Jewish.
You don t see anybody talking about that.
He s just building an environment for the kids, their parents are voting for Donald Trump, but little do they know that their kids will grow up not having a good education and not having good jobs.
Lexi then warned that if people fail to show up and vote on Election Day in November, it could mean a Trump victory.
And she thinks his hair is gross.
If you don t vote, then Mr. Donald Trump will be president.
I don t think that s his real hair, being president.
His hair, look at it!
Look at it!
It s gross.
I can t believe that s his real hair.
Here s the video via Huffington Post.
