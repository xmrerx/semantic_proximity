Who didn t miss Saturday Night Live s take on the 2016 election?
Alec Baldwin returned this week as Donald Trump (and Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton) to provide us with some much-needed levity following Pussyghazi or whatever one chooses to call the leak of Donald Trump explaining exactly where he likes to grope seemingly every woman he meets.
Sure, some would call that sexual assault, but to Trump and gang it s just a friendly handshake that happens to involve someone s vagina.Trump s campaign has been scrambling to come back from this situation as his former allies practically climb all over one another to denounce, un-endorse, and repudiate The Donald, with many calling on him to drop out and hand the election to Hillary Clinton.
It may seem surprising that talking about groping women was what did it given Trump s wall comments, his support for Muslim bans and even concentration camps, and the 9,764,487,921 other awful things he has done and said in just the past month.
But that s where we re at, and Republicans are finally coming around.It s easy to get caught up in the furor, but Saturday Night Live once again swooped in at the end of the week and saved the day as a re-broadcast of the vice presidential debate is interrupted by coverage of Pussy-Gate.
I deeply apple-gize, Baldwin s Trump continues as they mock his first public apology ever, with Trump being unable to even say the word.The sketch features a cutaway to a party at the Clinton campaign after the news broke and lots, lots more pussy.
