a progressive group charged saturday that the democratic national committee s reliance on paper ballots in the race for dnc chair raises questions of transparency , tainting the process.the dnc had planned on using both an electronic system , as well as paper ballots , but switched gears minutes before the vote when interim chair donna brazille announced they would rely on the ballots in part because of concerns over spotty internet service.now there s a party member you can trust the former interim chair donna brazille , who secretly passed cnn s debate questions to hillary adam green , co-founder of the progressive change committee , pointed to reports that said some dnc members are concerned over blowback they could receive from the bernie sanders-aligned forces that are supporting rep. keith ellison if their support for former labor secretary tom perez became public .
paper ballots instead of visible and accountable voting is something that debbie wasserman shultz would be proud of , mr. green said on twitter , alluding to the former chair , who resigned after hacked emails showed dnc members were biased against mr. sanders in the 2016 primary race.the group also highlighted a dnc rule that said secret ballots are not permitted and the results should be shared with the candidate or their campaign in the case that the contest goes beyond the first ballot .
