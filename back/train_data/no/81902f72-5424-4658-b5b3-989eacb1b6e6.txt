it sounds like a perfectly legitimate reason it s likley nypd commissioner bill bratton has claimed it is hard to hire more black cops because so many of them have spent time in jail .
we have a significant population gap among african american males because so many of them have spent time in jail , he told the guardian .
and , as such , we can t hire them .
partially to blame for the pool of eligible officers that is much smaller than it might ordinarily have been is the npyd s controversial stop and frisk policy that was shut down in 2013 , said bratton.the npyd commissioner said stop and frisk had unfortunate consequences as it resulted in a number of young black men receiving summons for minor misdemeanors.stop and frisk , which allowed police to question and potentially search someone if they had so-called reasonable suspicion that person was committing an offense , was ruled unconstitutional in august 2013 by judge shira a scheindlin.scheindlin said the program was a violation of both black and hispanic people s right to equal protection , as they were being stopped at much higher rates than those who were white.both demographics made up 84 percent of the people who were stopped by officers using the policy , according to a report by the public advocate s office and cited by the washington post.fifty-three percent of that figure was made up of black people.black recruits made up only 6.86 percent of this year s police academy , according to another guardian report , in a city where they represent 22 percent of the population.the nypd stopped supporting the policy when bratton returned as commissioner in 2014 , after serving in los angeles.but he continued to defend a policy he had new york adopt in the early 1990s , dubbed broken windows , which some of his critics say is where the the real blame should lay.robert gangi , the director of the police reform organizing project in new york , said stop and frisk was not at the heart of the problem but a symptom of broken windows blatant racist policing .via : uk daily mail
