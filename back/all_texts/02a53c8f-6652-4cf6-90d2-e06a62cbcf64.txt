A Texas cop is under fire after video surfaced showing him body slamming a 12-year-old girl to the ground.
Joshua Kehm is a uniformed police officer working for the San Antonio Independent School District at Rhodes Middle School.The incident happened on March 29, and was captured by a student on her cell phone.In the video, a uniformed officer is seen struggling with a girl, then slamming her to the ground.
The officer appears to handcuff the girl before having her stand and leading her away.Gloria Valdez, the 12-year-old girl s mother, told CBS affiliate KENS it was completely uncalled for.
Supposedly he was threatened by her that she kicked him, but in the video her legs never went up, Valdez said.Valdez s daughter did not want to go on camera but told KENS that she was having a conversation with another girl when a crowd surrounded them.
She said that s when the officer put his hands on her.The mother told a local TV station that the slam was so vicious that her daughter lost consciousness, and doesn t remember being handcuffed by the cop.
She also reportedly has bruises from the confrontation.The school district has suspended the officer, and a spokesperson told the TV station, we are not going to tolerate excessive force in our district.
The video is the latest in an unsettling series of videos, often recorded by students themselves, showing police officers using what appears to be excessive force to subdue children.
The videos, which have often gone viral on YouTube and other social media, have helped to create a backlash against so-called zero tolerance policies that became popular in the early to mid-1990s.At the same time, rather than admit that the videos show a disturbing pattern, some police unions and conservative politicians have supported legislation that criminalizes recording police, rather than assessing the obvious problem of poor police training and behavior.Featured image via YouTube
