dublin ( reuters ) - the continuing failure of irish nationalists and pro-british unionists to form a government in northern ireland is deeply concerning , ireland s foreign minister simon coveney said after britain moved to directly set a budget for the region .
britain s minister for northern ireland james brokenshire on wednesday said he had no choice but to begin the process of setting a budget directly for the first time in a decade due to the failure of talks to form a devolved executive .
[ l8n1n73rn ] both governments share the view that it is regrettable and deeply concerning that , eight months after the last assembly election , a power-sharing executive is not in place , coveney said in a statement .
the non-functioning of the devolved institutions is not something which the irish government wants to contemplate .
