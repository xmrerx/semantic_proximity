LONDON (Reuters) - Britain and the United States said on Friday that NATO allies needed to commit to increase defense spending every year, calling on countries who do not meet the alliance’s 2 percent spending target to “raise their game”.
“Secretary Mattis and I have agreed that others must now raise their game, and those failing to meet the 2 percent commitment so far should at least agree to year on year real terms increases,” British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said during a joint news conference with U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.
