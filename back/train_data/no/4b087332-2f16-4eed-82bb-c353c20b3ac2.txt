london ( reuters ) - mayor of london sadiq khan called on the british government on wednesday to make a formal apology for the 1919 jallianwala bagh massacre in which nearly 400 sikhs were shot dead by british indian army soldiers .
during a visit to the golden temple at amritsar in northern india , the most important pilgrimage site of sikhism , khan called the massacre one of the most horrific events in indian history .
on sunday 13 april 1919 , some 50 soldiers began shooting at unarmed civilians who were taking part in a peaceful protest against oppressive laws enforced in the punjab by british colonial authorities .
at least 379 sikhs were killed , but the figure is still disputed .
it is wrong that successive british governments have fallen short of delivering a formal apology to the families of those who were killed , he said .
i m clear that the government should now apologize , especially as we reach the centenary of the massacre .
this is about properly acknowledging what happened here and giving the people of amritsar and india the closure they need through a formal apology .
khan , who is from the opposition labour party , does not speak for britain s conservative government .
former conservative prime minister david cameron visited amritsar at the end of a trade mission to india four years ago in a show of contrition over the massacre but stopped short of making a formal apology .
khan is on a six-day mission to india and pakistan to strengthen cultural and economic ties with the british capital .
the british foreign office said in a statement : as the former prime minister said when he visited the jallianwala bagh in 2013 , the massacre was a deeply shameful act in british history and one that we should never forget .
it is right that we pay respect to those who lost their lives and remember what happened .
the british government rightly condemned the events at the time .
