moscow ( reuters ) - russia has sold its advanced s-400 air defense missile system to turkey for over $ 2 billion , sergei chemezov , the head of state conglomerate rostec , said on thursday , the tass news agency reported .
the deal with turkey , a nato member , has caused some disquiet in the united states .
turkey originally awarded a $ 3.4 billion contract for a defense system to china in 2013 , but canceled that two years later , saying it would concentrate on developing a system domestically .
