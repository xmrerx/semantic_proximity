Farmworkers were pulled from fields on Friday after they came into contact with a chemical that the EPA recently approved.
The chemical had originally been flagged by the Obama administration and was in the process of being banned when Trump s White House took over and gave it the greenlight.According to KTEG, more than 50 people working at the farm were exposed to the pesticide, causing the Dan Andrews farm to completely shut down.
We started getting an odor, pesticide odor, coming in from the mandarin orchards west of our fields, said farm supervisor Efron Zavalza.A pesticide called Vulcan, containing a poison called chlorpyrifos, has been sprayed the night before the workers come to the fields to work.
I m not pointing fingers or saying it was done incorrectly.
It was just an unfortunate thing the way it was drifted.
The wind came and pushed everything east and you know we were caught in the path, he observed.Twelve people suffered symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and fainting though half the workers left before medical services could treat them.Mother Jones reported that the Obama administration had taken steps to permanently ban chlorpyrifos, but the new head of the EPA, Scott Pruitt, reversed the regulation.
By reversing the previous Administration s steps to ban one of the most widely used pesticides in the world, we are returning to using sound science in decision-making rather than predetermined results, stated the EPA.Health experts agree that when children are exposed to chlorpyrifos they tcan suffer brain damage and a lower IQ.
A report by the National Institutes of Health concludes that the chemical can cause adverse developmental, reproductive, neurological, and immune effect.
The decision to reverse regulations on this chemical is very scary and could cause a lot of people to get sick.Featured image via David McNew/Getty Images
