Conan O Brien and First Lady Michelle Obama teamed up in an hour long episode chronicling a trip they made to Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar as part of the first lady s Joining Forces initiative.With comedians Laurie Kilmartin, Brian Kiley, and John Mulaney, along with Grace Potter as his musical guest, O Brien performed stand-up for troops stationed at the base.
During his monologue, he regretfully told the audience of his decision to forgo a stay at the posh St. Regis hotel to live on the base just like the troops do.
I said no, I want to live on the base.
That s what I said, because I m a fu**ing idiot, that s why, drawing applause from the crowd.

The video shows the first lady having tomato juice on the plane while O Brien has dozens of bottles of vodka stacked on the table next to him.

Obama told the host the reason why she s decided to shine a light on active service members and veterans.
Obama said: Once you connect, you don t want to let go.
You don t have to be first lady or one of the funniest men on the planet to get involved.
The first lady s Joining Forces initiative seeks to empower veterans and their families: Joining Forces works hand in hand with the public and private sectors to ensure that service members, veterans, and their families have the tools they need to succeed throughout their lives.
