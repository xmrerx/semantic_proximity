In recent weeks, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) has threatened to lead his caucus in filibustering President Donald Trump s nominee to the Supreme Court, Judge Neil Gorsuch, often citing a rule that a Supreme Court nominee needs a 60-vote supermajority in order to be appointed.The alleged rule has been debunked by fact-checkers, but Schumer is still holding out, arguing that Republicans would be violating the established norms of the Senate if they were to subject Trump s Supreme Court nominee to a simple up or down vote.
If Judge Gorsuch fails to earn 60 votes and fails to demonstrate he is mainstream enough to sit on the high court, we should change the nominee not the rules, Schumer said in a Wednesday press conference.
When pressed by Sinclair Broadcast Group, he acknowledged that there was no hard and fast rule subjecting every Supreme Court nominee to approval by a supermajority, but we believe in a 60-vote threshold.
That belief is different from a rule.
And Republicans are now arguing that even though the last four nominees to the Supreme Court were forced to overcome the 60-vote threshold for their lifetime appointments, it is not the standard.Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said on Wednesday that his Democratic colleagues are invoking a mythical 60 vote standard that doesn t exist, because of their 2016 electoral loss.
A 60-vote threshold has never been the standard for a Supreme Court nomination.
The 60-vote standard was even debunked by the Washington Post fact-checker two months ago, saying Democrats were using misleading and slippery language.
The claims by Schumer and other leading Democrats earned Two Pinocchios.Via: FOX 57
