remember when the left would have been ashamed to say singing the star spangled banner was considered a false display of patriotism ?
jamie foxx is being heavily criticized for his performance of the star-spangled banner at saturday night s fight .
how about stopping this false display of patriotism altogether ?
what does two people beating the bejesus out of each other have to do with the rockets red glare and bombs bursting in air ? here s racist jamie foxx s version of the star spangled banner in fact , what does this song have to do with today s america in the first place ?
the melody is based on an old english drinking song , has images of war , and is impossible to sing .
and , contrary to what one might think based on exposure to it , the last two words are not play ball !
in the case of the mayweather-pacquiao fight , the anthem and the whole event celebrated and rewarded an abuser of women .
at least seven assaults against five women have resulted in citations , not to mention other times police were called but no charges were filed .
we re glorifying a violent sport and using our national anthem to sanctify it.let s once and for all confine this song to military exercises and classrooms .
better yet , let s choose a better national anthem , like america the beautiful or this land is your land .
here s an even better idea : since we re a nation of immigrants , how about america from west side story , which would also celebrate a great american composer , leonard bernstein ?
and let s hope mr. mayweather takes some of his millions and donates it to women s shelters.via : huffington post
