(Reuters) - Donald Trump’s spokesman said his team will brief the media on Thursday in Washington, one day before the Republican U.S. president-elect is sworn into office on Friday.
Sean Spicer, speaking to reporters in a daily conference call on Wednesday, said: “Tomorrow, we’re holding a press conference here at 9:15” a.m. Eastern Time (1415 GMT), but it was not expected to feature the president-elect.
