baghdad ( reuters ) - iraqi forces completed an operation to take control of all oil fields operated by state-owned north oil company in the kirkuk region on tuesday , a senior military officer said .
iraqi forces took control of the bai hasan and avana oil fields northwest of kirkuk on tuesday , after seizing the baba gurgur , jambur and khabbaz fields on monday , he said .
oil officials in baghdad said all the fields were operating normally .
the fields were previously held by kurdish security forces known as peshmerga , but they pulled out of the area in the face of an advance by forces of the iraqi central government .
tuesday s deployment of iraqi government forces in dibis , where bai hasan and avana are located , is part of an operation ordered by prime minister haider al-abadi to take control of kurdish-held areas outside the three provinces that form iraq s autonomous kurdish region .
