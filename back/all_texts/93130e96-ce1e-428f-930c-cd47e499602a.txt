It s not tough to imagine that NASCAR races have their share of Donald Trump s Make America Great Again caps.
Your stereotypical NASCAR is a, as we re told by Fox News and those on the right, real American with real American values, which means no tolerance for those people from other places.
A funny thing happens, though, even in NASCAR circles, nearly every American is a product of immigration so some surprising people are taking Trump s Muslim ban very seriously.
NASCAR star Dale Earnhardt Jr. is one of them.Earnhardt has been at the top of his sport for years when it comes to fans.
For the last 14 years, he has won most popular driver, every single year.
Donald Trump is also a big favorite with the NASCAR crowd and the drivers were mostly happy with Trump s electoral victory.
Still, while Earnhardt is hardly a Democratic Socialist (he is a Republican), his politics do skew a little to the left of Trump (of course, these days, Mussolini s politics skew a little to the left of Trump).In 2006, Earnhardt was the only NASCAR driver to answer a question about his support of the Confederate flag.
He didn t support it.
He called it racist.
I guess with popularity comes the courage to drive a different direction and over the weekend, he criticized the Trump administration s Muslim ban on Twitter.Unlike Trump, Earnhardt seems to have a grasp on how our country was built on the backs of immigrants:@GelarBudidarma my fam immigrated from Germany in 1700s escaping religious persecution.
America is created by immigrants.
Dale Earnhardt Jr. (@DaleJr) January 29, 2017Reactions were mixed, but a lot more nuanced than if the message had come from someone who s considered a libtard.
Some are turning their backs on Earnhardt:@DaleJr @GelarBudidarma Immigration is not what the focus is here Dale.
You and I know this, this is about unvetted illegals.
RIP Sr 2ndrun.tv (@2ndruntv) January 29, 2017@DaleJr @GelarBudidarma that is the stupidest thing I ve ever heard.
Lol.
Did they crash planes into buildings in the 1700s.
Dummy.
scottbu70 (@scottbu70) January 30, 2017Even more are thankful:@DaleJr Thank you Mr. Earnhardt.
We need more prominent Southern voices to speak out.
David V. Iannelli (@DVIannelli) January 29, 2017@DaleJr @GelarBudidarma Thank you, sir.
You re a model for those who worry taking a stand might cost them something.
Spencer Critchley (@scritchley) January 29, 2017@DaleJr Good on you for standing on the right side of history ?
C.Mon (@ClaireeMonroe) January 29, 2017@DaleJr Thank you Mr. Earnhardt.
We need more prominent Southern voices to speak out.
David V. Iannelli (@DVIannelli) January 29, 2017But not without backlash:@DVIannelli @DaleJr Yeah David more people like YOU need to leave our country to make room for the jihadis.
Or are U a hypocrite?
Norman South (@NotesfromNorm) January 30, 2017Perhaps people like Earnhardt are the people we need to help get our country back from the fascist dictator that s currently occupying the White House.
Conservatives aren t going to listen to anyone from Hollywood, but they clearly do listen to heroes in their own world.
Let s hope others will join Earnhardt soon.Featured image via Jason Hanna/Getty Images.
