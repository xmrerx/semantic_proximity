The National Rifle Association (NRA) is opposed to any and all sensible legislation when it comes to purchasing firearms.
They want there to be no background checks, no questions and definitely no waiting periods whatsoever.
According to this nutty group, anyone and everyone should be able to have as many guns as they want, whenever they want, and however they want.
This is most curious, though, considering that they are much more strict with how difficult they make it to dress up as their mascot, a large bird-like creature known as Eddie Eagle.Investigating this phenomenon is Full Frontal host Samantha Bee.
You see, this awesomely hilarious lady wanted to dress up like the mascot, only to find that the NRA forces a 20-day waiting period for dressing up as Eddie Eagle, and bans resales of the costume on the interwebs.
Bee says of the experience: There s something about that costume so mockable.
So asinine.
I had to have one.
Bee soon discovered that she d be better off just trying to get a gun online than trying to dress up as that silly bird: But you know what I could buy online without a big hassle?
A used shotgun on armslist.com from a random guy down the road from the TBS headquarters in Atlanta.
So I had one of my employees buy it from him in a parking lot without a background check from the trunk of his car.
This just goes to show how ridiculous the NRA s stances are.
They d rather you be able to buy a killing machine than dress up in their precious bird costume.
None of the people running that organization need to have firearms or any sort of weapons whatsoever, because they clearly lack basic sense.Bravo, Ms. Bee for exposing this absolute insanity.Watch the video of Samantha Bee and Eddie Eagle below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture
