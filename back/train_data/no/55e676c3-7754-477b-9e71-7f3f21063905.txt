phnom penh ( reuters ) - cambodia s economy is forecast to grow 6.9 percent next year , compared with a projected 6.8 percent pace in 2017 , despite risks including uncertainties over next year s election , the world bank said on wednesday .
cambodia s political turbulence has had little impact on economic growth , which has hovered around 7 percent for the past six years .
the world bank said textile exports had moderated and the construction sector showed signs of slowing , but other manufacturing exports had increased and cambodia was also drawing more tourists - particularly from china .
the outlook remains positive , it said in a report .
a possible slowdown of the regional economy , especially china , and potential election related uncertainties , however , pose downside risks to the outlook .
china is now cambodia s biggest aid donor and investor , but western donors remain important and cambodia has been increasingly at odds with them in the run-up to the 2018 election .
they have condemned the arrest of prime minister hun sen s main rival , kem sokha , the dissolution of the main opposition cambodia national rescue party ( cnrp ) and a crackdown on civil rights groups and independent media .
the government accuses kem sokha of plotting to take power with american help and his party of treason - charges the opposition says are politically motivated to ensure hun sen keeps his more than three-decade hold on power .
sweden said on tuesday it was stopping some aid and the united states said it was ending election funding and would take further concrete steps .
world bank senior country economist miguel sanchez said uncertainty had affected cambodia in previous election years , leading to postponed investment decisions and a decline in foreign currency deposits .
it was temporary , he told a news conference .
