these 4 hostages must certainly feel a sense of comfort knowing that our strong commander in chief would never desert an ameri never mind it was reported weeks ago that the american government has abandoned citizens in yemen , forcing them fend for themselves .
now we re facing the prospect of iranian allies holding our countrymen hostage.it really is amazing how many parallels obama shares with jimmy carter .
here s a pretty awful one : the rebel group that has seized power in yemen has taken at least four u.s. citizens prisoner , according to u.s. officials who said that efforts to secure the americans release have faltered.one of the prisoners had been cleared for release in recent days only to have that decision reversed by members of the houthi rebellion that toppled the u.s.-backed government earlier this year and now controls most levers of power in yemen.the americans are believed to be held at a prison in sanaa , the yemeni capital , which has been bombed repeatedly as part of an air campaign led by saudi arabia aimed at dislodging the houthis from power .
the united states has provided intelligence support to that operation.the detention of the americans has complicated u.s. efforts to navigate the chaotic aftermath of the houthi takeover , which displaced a government that had cooperated extensively with the united states on drone strikes and other counterterrorism operations against a dangerous al-qaeda affiliate in the country.u.s .
officials said three of the prisoners worked in private-sector jobs and that a fourth , whose occupation is unknown , has dual u.s.-yemeni citizenship .
the officials said none of the four were employees of the u.s. government.via : soopermexican
