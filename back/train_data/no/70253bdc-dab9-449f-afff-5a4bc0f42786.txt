( reuters ) - virginia governor terry mcauliffe on tuesday vetoed a republican-backed bill aimed at blocking state funding for planned parenthood , which performs abortions and provides other health services .
mcauliffe , a democrat , said the bill passed by the republican-dominated legislature would harm thousands of state residents who relied on planned parenthood for health care .
“ the fact is that virginians , and particularly low-income virginians , need more access to health care , not less , ” he said in a statement .
several states have sought to cut off funding for planned parenthood following the release of videos secretly recorded by an anti-abortion group .
activists have said the videos showed that planned parenthood officials in some states had discussed the sale of aborted fetal tissue .
planned parenthood has denied the accusations .
president barack obama in january vetoed a effort by congress to defund planned parenthood .
