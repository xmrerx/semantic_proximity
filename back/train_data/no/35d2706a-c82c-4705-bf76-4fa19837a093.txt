mogadishu ( reuters ) - two of somalia s highest-ranking military officials have resigned , state outlets said on thursday , in moves that could deal a blow to the war-torn horn of africa country s efforts to fight islamist militants .
somalia has been at war since 1991 , when clan-based warlords overthrew dictator siad barre and then turned on each other .
for a decade , the weak u.n.-backed government has also been fighting alongside african union troops against al shabaab , which aims to topple the government and impose its own strict interpretation of islam .
on thursday , state-owned radio muqdisho said the army s chief of defence forces ahmed jimale gedi had stepped down and defence minister abdirashid abdullahi mohamed had submitted his resignation to president mohamed abdullahi farmaajo s cabinet .
the cabinet appointed general abdiweli jama hussein ... after ahmed jimale gedi resigned on thursday , the radio station said , adding that mohamed s bid was also accepted .
radio muqdishu did not disclose the reasons behind their decisions .
neither the officials themselves nor government spokespeople were immediately available for comment .
al qaeda-allied al shabaab was driven out of the capital mogadishu in 2010 , but their deadly attacks remain one of the main obstacles to stability in the chaotic nation , which lies along one of the world s busiest shipping routes .
somalia s rebuilding efforts have also been hampered by clan rivalries .
rival regions still sometimes take up arms against each other .
