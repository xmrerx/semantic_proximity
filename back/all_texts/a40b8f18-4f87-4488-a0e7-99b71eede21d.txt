One day after Trump had his 12th golfing trip as president he returned to his golf club in Virginia for lucky number 13.Like yesterday, Trump told pool reporters he was at serious meetings.
He spent just 55 minutes at the golf resort he owns.
How did he attend so many serious meetings in so little time?
Easy.
He didn t.And his lie quickly unraveled.During the time in which he was said to be in meetings, an Instagram user posted a picture of Trump sitting in a deserted dining room watching the Golf Channel.Someone just posted this on Instagram from Trump's golf club.
POTUS appears to be watching Golf Channel with 2 other people.

What he isn t doing is actually running the country.
Each of his trips costs anywhere between hundreds of thousand and millions of dollars.Making matters worse, it s been just two days since Trump failed to deliver on his promise to repeal and replace Obamacare.
The bill he and Paul Ryan proposed was so incredibly awful that it failed to even reach a House vote (despite Republicans having an overwhelming majority of seats).
The next day he flew to his Virginia golf course where he you guessed it got caught golfing.Pool was told Trump was in meetings at Trump National this afternoon.
This Instagram photo posted from the course says otherwise pic.twitter.com/WMudqofGmO Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) March 25, 2017Trump is extremely bad at lying about what he is doing.
Apparently the notion that people at his golf clubs might take pictures proving he s doing the thing he promised he would never do as president never occurred to Trump.
He remains either oblivious or willfully defiant of the critics.Unreal.Featured image via Twitter
