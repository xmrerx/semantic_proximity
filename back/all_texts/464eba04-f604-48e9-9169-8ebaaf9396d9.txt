When choosing a candidate for president it s probably a smart idea to choose someone who will best have your back on any number of issues.
What s not smart is supporting a candidate who calls you names, tells you how disgusting you are, and publicly humiliates you.
Yet, Caitlyn Jenner still seems to want to support Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz despite the fact that he is so utterly outspoken against the Transgender community.Jenner has been a Republican for a very long time and still hasn t been able to wrap her head around the fact that she is supporting not only the worst party for her own cause, but also the absolute worst candidate within that party in regards to Transgender rights and protections.In the latest episode of her reality show I Am Cait, Jenner s friends called out this blinding hypocrisy to her face.
During the show, they showed the women sitting around listening to the fact that Ted Cruz is asking for the Houston, Texas HERO Act (which guarantees rights to the LGBT community) to be repealed.
And while Jenner brushed it off as Cruz just being totally misinformed, her friends told her, in so many words, that you can t be a supporter of LGBT rights and a supporter of Ted Cruz at the same time.A Cruz presidency would be devastating to the LGBT community on so many levels, and could turn back the clock on all the progress that has been made over the past decade.
We cannot allow that to happen.
We ve come so far, and we have so much further to go.
