london ( reuters ) - british civil servants will vote next month on nationwide strike action to put pressure on the government to abandon its 1 percent cap on public sector pay rises , their main trade union said on wednesday .
prime minister theresa may s government is considering lifting the cap for at least some public-sector workers later this year , according to media reports earlier this week , as disquiet grows over pay restraint that has lasted since 2010 .
but on wednesday may would not commit to lift the cap for nurses - who are widely thought likely to get an increase - after opposition labour party leader jeremy corbyn challenged her in parliament over wages in the public and private sector .
the public and commercial services union ( pcs ) , the main union for civil servants , said it would ballot nearly 200,000 members between oct. 9 and nov. 6 to assess appetite for what would be their first nationwide strike since october 2014 .
if there are no concessions on pay after the first ballot , the union will hold a second ballot to confirm support for specific strike action .
pay misery for public servants must end and the government must restore public-sector pay to levels that allow working people to live with the dignity and security they deserve , mark serwotka , the pcs s general secretary , said in a statement .
the pcs said it wanted pay rises of at least 5 percent for all public-sector workers .
average weekly earnings in the public sector rose by 1.3 percent over the past year , compared with a 2.2 percent rise in private-sector wages .
consumer price inflation was 2.6 percent over the same period .
some 5.4 million britons work in the public sector , of whom just over 400,000 work in the civil service .
most public-sector staff work as teachers or in the national health service .
