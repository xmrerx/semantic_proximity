A lot of people have a lot to say about the role of Hermione Granger, of the famed Harry Potter series, now being played by black actress Noma Dumezweni in Harry Potter and the Cursed Child.
However, none more than Harry Potter creator J.K. Rowling herself who has slapped down all criticism calling critics idiots and a bunch of racists, because they are.In the latest bout of criticism being thrown at Rowling, one Potter fan decided they would tell her how to cast her own film.
You know, because they know best.
This person named Dan took to Twitter and said: It is not about racism.
It is just about consistency of the movie.
How come you cannot find even a good white actress @jk_rowling it is not about racism.

You can t even take the time to upload a selfie it would take three seconds to take and upload.
However, Rowling wasn t going to let this clear racism slide, even though she was clearly being trolled.Not even giving a clear f*ck what this racist, not racist person has to say, Rowling threw the ultimate shade right back when she said: We found the best actress and she s black.
Bye bye, now.
We found the best actress and she's black.
Bye bye, now.
