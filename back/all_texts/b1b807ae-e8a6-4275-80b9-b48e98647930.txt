Governor Greg Abbott of Texas recently traveled to Israel to kiss the ring of Bibi Netanyahu.
While there, he pledged that he will do what he can as Texas leader to obey Israel s desires and begin working on new ways to re-antagonize Iran.Abbott, like most Republicans, owes his true loyalty to Netanyahu s craving for discord instead of America s effort at peace and cooperation.
Abbott pledged to craft laws in Texas to curb the flow of any public funds to Iran.
He seeks to accomplish this by banning any state-level investments in Iran or by banning Texas government from doing business with any company that does business in Iran.
The second part of that is particularly hypocritical.
Republicans have always used terms like free trade and the concept of little to no government regulation of business to attack liberals.
However, when free trade conflicts with the desires of Benjamin Netanyahu a leader of a foreign nation there suddenly isn t enough regulation that can be enacted.When asked for an example of how many Texan public dollars flow to Iran, Governor Abbott s office was unable to provide any figures.
Without some real data, the impact of Abbott s new laws will be unproven at best, and he would likely have to spend more state money to audit companies to make that determination.
Fiscal conservatism at its best Governor Abbott will obviously not be able to single-handedly bring Iran to its knees over new state-level sanctions, but the politics on this are clear.
Republicans still want to do everything they can to sabotage what is otherwise an incredibly successful and historic win for President Obama on his diplomatic victory with Iran.
Being able to show their undying loyalty to a foreign leader in the process is just a nice bonus.Featured image via Flickr
