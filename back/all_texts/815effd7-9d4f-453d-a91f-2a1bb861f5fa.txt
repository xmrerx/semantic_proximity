Donald Trump has been throwing around the false claim that former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said that there was no evidence of collusion between him and his campaign and Russia recently, but a CNN interview just destroyed any hope of Trump ever using that again.On Sunday, Clapper told Jake Tapper that Donald Trump and his Russian friends are attacking our democracy: I think in many ways our institutions are under assault both externally and that s the big news here is the Russian interference in our election system and I think as well our institutions are under assault internally.
Asked if he meant Donald Trump, Clapper responded with one word: Exactly.
The founding fathers, in their genius, created a system of three co-equal branches of government and a built-in system of checks and balances, Clapper said, adding, I feel as though that is under assault and is eroding.
I think each Senator or Congressman has got to, I hope, will think in terms of their own conscience, Clapper told Tapper.
I hope they speak up.
Clapper also said that Trump is wrong to use him to exonerate himself.
The bottom line is I don t know if there was collusion, political collusion, Clapper said.
I don t know of any evidence to it.
So I can t refute it, and I can t confirm it.
