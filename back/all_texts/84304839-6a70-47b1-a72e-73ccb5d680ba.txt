OTTAWA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama said on Wednesday he is confident Europeans will come up with a prudent plan to move forward after Britain’s vote last week to leave the European Union.
“Despite some of the initial reactions, I am confident that the process can be managed in a prudent, orderly way.
I expect that our friends on both sides of the Channel will develop a workable plan for how to move forward,” Obama said in a speech to the Canadian Parliament.
