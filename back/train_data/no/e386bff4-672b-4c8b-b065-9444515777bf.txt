tokyo ( reuters ) - japan s prime minister shinzo abe on tuesday pledge up to 117 billion yen ( $ 1.03 billion ) of development aid to myanmar in a meeting in manila with government leader aung san suu kyi .
the package of low-interest loans will be used to fund projects including infrastructure and small company financing meant to help improve rural incomes , japan s ministry of foreign affairs said in a release .

abe and suu kyi are in the philippines for an association of south east asian nations conference including other regional leaders .
while there , suu kyi , whose administration has no control over the security forces under a constitution drafted during military rule , discussed the rohingya crisis with u.n. secretary-general antonio guterres .
china and the united states also compete for influence in myanmar .
