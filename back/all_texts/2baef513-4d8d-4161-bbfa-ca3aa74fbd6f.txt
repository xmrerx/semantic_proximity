Former FBI Director James Comey testified under Senate oath May 3rd that the Trump administration had not pressured his agency to halt any investigation for political purposes.
Comey admitted that the FBI has always been free to operate without political interference flying in the face of Democrats paranoid delusions about Russia and President Donald J. Trump, and exposing for what it is a new political witch hunt Wednesday by enemies within the president s own Justice Department.On Wednesday, DOJ appointed a special prosecutor, former FBI Director Robert Mueller, to drum up more hype about Trump s imaginary collusion with Russia during the general election.On May 9th, President Trump fired Comey, who has spent 15 years shilling for Hillary Clinton.Videotaped testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee blows apart the phony narrative New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt wove on Tuesday, which resulted in Mueller s appointment.
Schmidt s only sources were anonymous.
They claimed that on Feb. 14th, the day after National Security Adviser Michael Flynn resigned, Trump had asked Comey to end an investigation into Flynn s connections to Russia.
Got NewsNick Short was first to expose Comey s testimony on May 3rd, where under oath where he stated that, as it relates to Trump or his administration asking him to halt an investigation for political purposes: It s not happened in my experience .If Trump told Comey to "stop investigating" as Comey memo alleges then why did Comey state this on May 3 under oath?
