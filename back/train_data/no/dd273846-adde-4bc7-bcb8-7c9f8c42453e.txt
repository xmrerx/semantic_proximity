harare ( reuters ) - a zimbabwean court on saturday refused to strike down subversion charges against an american citizen who now faces 11 days in a harare jail until her next court hearing .
martha o donovan , who works for magamba tv , which describes itself as zimbabwe s leading producer of political satire , was on friday charged by police , who also accused her of insulting president robert mugabe .
lawyers for o donovan , who appeared in court in jeans and a checked shirt , argued before magistrate nomsa sarabauta that police only informed o donovan of the more serious charges of attempting to subvert the government hours after her arrest , thereby violating the constitution .
but the magistrate said she was satisfied the officers complied with the law and dismissed the application .
the charge carries a sentence of up to 20 years in jail .
a u.s. state department official said on saturday that the government was aware of reports that a u.s. citizen was detained in zimbabwe .
we stand ready to provide appropriate consular assistance for u.s. citizens .
lawyer obey shava said he would now apply for bail at the high court on monday .
o donovan , who denies the charges against her , was not formally charged nor was she asked to plead in court , where she will return on nov. 15 .
the case against her centers around a post on twitter last month in which o donovan allegedly called 93-year-old mugabe a selfish and sick man .
her arrest comes after the creation of a ministry of cyber security last month .
mugabe s government has been particularly uneasy about social media after activists such as pastor evan mawarire and his # thisflag movement last year used social media to organize a stay-at-home demonstration , the biggest anti-government protest in a decade .
a national election is due in 2018 .
