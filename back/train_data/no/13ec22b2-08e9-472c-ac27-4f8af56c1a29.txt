almaty ( reuters ) - uzbek president shavkat mirziyoyev reshuffled senior security officials on monday , sacking the defense minister who was a holdover from the previous administration and appointing an ally .
abdusalom azizov has replaced qobul berdiyev as defense minister , the president s office said without explaining the reasons for the reshuffle .
berdiyev had served as the central asian nation s defense minister since 2008 , having been appointed by strongman leader islam karimov who died last september after running the former soviet republic for 27 years .
azizov , on the other hand , has been promoted by mirziyoyev , who named him interior minister shortly after being elected president last december .
pulat bobojonov , previously a regional governor , was named interior minister on monday .
the reshuffle leaves rustam inoyatov , the head of the snb state security service , as the only karimov-era senior security official still in office .
