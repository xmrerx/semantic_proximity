Pope Francis is once again speaking the truth, and Christian conservatives are going to hate him even more for it.This time it concerns the right s newest endeavor spreading fake news.
With reports of Pizzagate and now Newtown threats causing a rise in violence by right-wing ideologues (and Trump supporters), his holiness is taking on the epidemic of fake news, calling it sin and equating it to eating feces.Speaking to to Tertio, a Belgian Catholic weekly, the Pope said in rather strong terms:I think the media have to be very clear, very transparent, and not fall into no offense intended the sickness of coprophagia, that is, always wanting to cover scandals, covering nasty things, even if they are true.
And since people have a tendency towards the sickness of coprophagia, a lot of damage can be done The means of communication have their own temptations, they can be tempted by slander, and therefore used to slander people, to smear them, this above all in the world of politics.
They can be used as means of defamation.
No-one has a right to do this.
It is a sin and it is hurtful.Not only is it hurtful and sinful, it s dangerous, it s poisonous, and it s beneath our political discourse.Perhaps Christian conservatives should take heed but they won t. They haven t when it comes to climate change, poverty, Muslims and refugees.Considering how much the right hates the Pope, one shouldn t hold their breath.
With General Michael Flynn and his unhinged son passing around fake news in these sensitive, tumultuous times, the Pope s blunt and truthful words should be ringing throughout all media outlets.
Treating fake news as the scum it is should be priority number one, and combating Russian influence should be priority number two.
