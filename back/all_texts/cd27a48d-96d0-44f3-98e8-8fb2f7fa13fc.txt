Last night, the Republican Party did something truly disgusting they not only silenced Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren for opposing Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions, but they went ahead and confirmed him as Attorney General.When she was voicing her opposition to Sessions, Warren began to read the words of Coretta Scott King aloud, which had expressed resistance to Sessions in 1986.
The GOP shut her down, prompting several hashtags such as #LetLizSpeak and #NeverthelessShePersisted to trend on Twitter, as well as national outcry.Later that night, Warren issued her own message to the Republican Party, and she officially put them on notice.
Warning the GOP that they had just put a man with radical hatred in charge of the DOJ, Warren said:Then, she gave them a fair warning that this was far from the last time she would speak out about Sessions:And that wasn t all.
Last night, Warren made a surprising appearance on The Daily Show, where she spoke about being silenced and the new unethical Attorney General.
She said: Look, the main thing is that millions of people are now reading Coretta Scott King s letter.
It is an amazing letter.
It is a letter full of passion.
It is a letter full of heart, and it is a letter full of advice to us.
It talks about a moment in history when African-Americans were beaten away from the polls, and it talks about Jeff Sessions s role in that, and I think it has an important lesson today for all of America.
Thanks to Warren s passion and courage, many Americans throughout the country now know the truth about Jeff Sessions, and will be watching his actions closely.
Yesterday, the GOP showed Americans that the Republican Party truly does not care about racial justice and wants do everything it can to help Trump Make America White Again.
We know that Warren and the Democrats behind her won t let them get away with it, and her warning to the GOP gives us hope.Read more:Featured image via Ethan Miller / Getty Images
