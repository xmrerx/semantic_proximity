The Donald Trump presidential campaign is in trouble.
He s behind in the polls, by as much as double digits, and many of his donors are asking for their money back.
It s crisis time, so naturally, they are asking for more money.
Trump s middle son Eric signed his name to the latest fundraising campaign, and it includes a map showing Trump winning by a landslide with this message: As one of the most dedicated grassroots leaders in the country you know, momentum matters, the email, sent on behalf of the Trump campaign, reads.
And right now all the momentum is on our side.
We re making huge gains against Crooked Hillary that you can see for yourself.
There s just one problem.The map comes from FiveThirtyEight.com s Nate Silver.
Nate rarely screws up, so why does this map show Trump winning nearly every state?Because that map is a part of a little experiment.
It doesn t show momentum, as the Trump campaign is trying to tell us.
It is a map of how the election would look if only men voted.
While that might be a dream of the Trump camp, more than half the electorate are women.
Here s that map if only women voted:Here s what the map would look line if only women voted: https://t.co/sjVY67qouE pic.twitter.com/rrc3GuXmGl Nate Silver (@NateSilver538) October 11, 2016The United States of Women vs.

https://t.co/EuTRbYlNys Heather Reid (@hkreid) October 12, 2016Perhaps pre-suffrage is the America Trump wants to take us back to, but at a time when the campaign is under fire for the way the GOP candidate treats women, this email was either really stupid or the campaign has no desire to get the women s vote, and no desire to win.
