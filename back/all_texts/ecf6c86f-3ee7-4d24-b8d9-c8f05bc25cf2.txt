As Addicting Info reported here, Donald Trump is very likely running the biggest campaign scam in American history.While Trump claims to be self-funding his campaign, the majority of the candidate s funding comes in the form of loans from Trump owned entities, rather than donations.In reality, Trump s campaign owes Donald Trump tens of millions of dollars.
While he claims that the campaign won t be expected to pay the loans back, his most recent campaign filings with the FEC show that this money is still being treated as campaign debt.When Addicting Info first reported on Trump s self-funding scam in April, his campaign owed the candidate $17.5 million.
At that time, loans to the campaign from Trump accounted for 70 percent of all contributions received.As NBC reports here, since the campaign s last filing with the FEC the amount owed to Donald Trump has more than doubled, now exceeding $43 million.In spite of Trump s assurances that the loans won t be paid back, this invitation to an upcoming fundraiser, obtained by the Los Angeles Times and published by NBC News here, raises even more suspicion about the loans.Image credit: Los Angeles Times via NBC NewsAccording to the information printed on the invitation, the first $2700 of each donation received during the fundraiser is designated for the Trump campaign to use in the primary election.NBC News verified that the information printed on the invitation is accurate.Since the republican primary election is over, it would seem that the only reason to continue raising money for Trump s primary campaign is to pay off his earlier campaign debts, all of which are owned by the candidate himself.As we reported here, Trump once vowed to be the first presidential candidate to make a profit from his campaign.There is nothing stopping Trump from using future donations to pay himself back for the loans he s made to his own campaign, with interest.The latest FEC filings, along with the details of his fundraising activities, suggest that that s exactly what he s planning to do.Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images
