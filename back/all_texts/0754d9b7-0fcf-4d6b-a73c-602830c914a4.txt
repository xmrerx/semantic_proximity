Reports out of Texas are saying that Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia was found dead while visiting the luxury resort at the Cibolo Creek Ranch just south of Marfa, Texas.
He was apparently on a hunting trip, and it looks at though his death was from natural causes, but his death is still under investigation.The 79-year-old justice was found in his hotel room after he didn t appear for breakfast.
He was attending the ranch with about 40 other people.Texas Gov.
Greg Abbott issued this statement after the news of Scalia s passing: He was the solid rock who turned away so many attempts to depart from and distort the Constitution.
We mourn his passing, and we pray that his successor on the Supreme Court will take his place as a champion for the written Constitution and the Rule of Law.
Cecilia and I extend our deepest condolences to his family, and we will keep them in our thoughts and prayers.
While there are definitely differing opinions of the Reagan appointed justice, many of whom believe the justice a harsh critic of equality and justice for all, it is still a very sad day in America with the passing of Justice Scalia.Featured image: Flickr
