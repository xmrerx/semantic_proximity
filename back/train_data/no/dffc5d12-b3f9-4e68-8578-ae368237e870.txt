feel the bern of a lot of gullible young people who were fed a big line of bullsh * t socialist senator bernie sanders ( vt ) is the proud new owner of a summer home in the champlain islands , seven days has confirmed.the burlington resident last week plopped down nearly $ 600,000 on a lakefront camp in north hero.sanders new crib has four bedrooms and 500 feet of lake champlain beachfront on the east side of the island facing vermont , not new york .
the bern will keep his home in burlington and use the new camp seasonally .
we ve traveled up to the islands many times over the years almost always on day trips , sanders wife , jane o meara sanders , told seven days in a written statement .
we ve been impressed with the north hero community , eaten at the north hero house and shore acres and have suggested them to friends who were looking for a beautiful place to stay or have dinner .
st. anne s shrine in isle la motte is my favorite church and it is nearby .
last tuesday , the day of the closing , a relaxed-looking bernie sanders posed for a photo at hero s welcome general store on route 2 .
the store , a bit south of his new abode , serves a sandwich called feel the bun in the senator s honor .
the $ 6.99 deli delight consists of a huge homemade roll , sliced turkey , fresh apple chutney , hot pepper relish , lettuce , tomato and provolone cheese .
it s not fair that the billionaire class controls 99 percent of the bread , the menu description reads .
here s a sandwich for the rest of us to keep us nourished until everything cool is free !
