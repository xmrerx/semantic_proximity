TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Sunday the government will proceed with a scheduled sales tax increase in 2019 unless the economy suffers a shock as big as the 2008 collapse of Lehman Brothers.
He also defended the government s plan to divert some of the proceeds from the scheduled tax hike to 10 percent from 8 percent to child care and education, saying that investing in children will undoubtedly lead to stronger economic growth .
Our administration has worked on fiscal reform more than any other administration, Abe told a television program as his ruling bloc headed for a big win in Sunday s general election.
In order to pay back Japan s public debt, you need economic growth, he said.
We d like to proceed with fiscal reform by spurring economic growth and investment, Abe said, suggesting his administration will continue to focus on reflating growth rather than fiscal austerity.
Abe s ruling bloc was set for a big win in Sunday s election, bolstering his chances of becoming the nation s longest-serving premier.
Abe twice delayed the sales tax hike to 10 percent after an earlier increase to 8 percent tipped Japan into recession.
Analysts say increasing the levy is crucial to rein in Japan s huge public debt which, at twice the size of its economy, is the biggest among major industrialized nations.
