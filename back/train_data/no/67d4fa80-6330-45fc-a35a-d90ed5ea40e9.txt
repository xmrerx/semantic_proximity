sydney ( reuters ) - the alarming volume of hate-speech during australia s ballot over whether to legalize same-sex marriage spurred parliament to pass emergency legislation on wednesday to outlaw opponents spewing their vitriol while the vote was in progress .
australia began a non-compulsory postal vote on tuesday that will determine whether it becomes the 25th country to legalize same-sex marriage .
but with an emotionally charged campaign raising concerns about the welfare of vulnerable australians , the government moved to strengthen laws preventing hate-speech .
the opposition labor party supported the amendment , though it had rejected the need for a ballot on the issue .
until voting ends on november 7 , anyone found guilty of intimidation , or threats to cause harm on the basis of the sexual orientation , gender identity , intersex status - people who are born with genetic , hormonal or physical sex characteristics that are not typically male or female - or the religious convictions of someone will be liable to fines of a $ 12,500 ( over $ 10,000 ) and a court injunction .
this bill can not stop all of the hurt , all of the prejudice that is being expressed , all of the lack of acceptance that is being communicated to lgbti australians , to same-sex couple families .
but it provides limited protections , said penny wong , leader of the opposition in the senate .
