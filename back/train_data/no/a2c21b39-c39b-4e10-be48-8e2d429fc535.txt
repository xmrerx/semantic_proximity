we reported yesterday that tea party favorite congressman dave bratt asked house members to consider electing another person to replace the anti-trump ( until days before the election ) paul ryan .
apparently no one cared enough to listen to the voices of 100 % fed up americans paul ryan has recently pledged to support trump .
we ll see about that when it comes to immigration.paul ryan was unanimously chosen for another term as house speaker by his republican colleagues on tuesday as he called for his party to unite behind president-elect donald trump.the 46-year-old wisconsin republican , who was often at odds with trump during the long presidential campaign , has pledged to work closely with the president-elect to advance trump s agenda .
welcome to the dawn of a new unified republican government , ryan declared at a news conference a few hours before the closed-door leadership elections .
it feels really good to say that , actually .
this will be a government focused on turning president-elect trump s victory into real progress for the american people .
our team is very excited , and we can not wait to get to work .
ryan faces an election by the full house in january , when the new congress convenes and will vote for speaker .
he must win a majority of house members 218 votes to keep his job , and republicans will control at least 239 seats .
