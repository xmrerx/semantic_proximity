the acting attorney general , sally yates , has betrayed the department of justice by refusing to enforce a legal order designed to protect the citizens of the united states .
this order was approved as to form and legality by the department of justice office of legal counsel.ms .
yates is an obama administration appointee who is weak on borders and very weak on illegal immigration.it is time to get serious about protecting our country .
calling for tougher vetting for individuals travelling from seven dangerous places is not extreme .
it is reasonable and necessary to protect our country.tonight , president trump relieved ms. yates of her duties and subsequently named dana boente , u.s. attorney for the eastern district of virginia , to serve as acting attorney general until senator jeff sessions is finally confirmed by the senate , where he is being wrongly held up by democrat senators for strictly political reasons .
i am honored to serve president trump in this role until senator sessions is confirmed .
i will defend and enforce the laws of our country to ensure that our people and our nation are protected , said dana boente , acting attorney general .
