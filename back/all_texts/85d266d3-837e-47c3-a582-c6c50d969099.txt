This election is bringing out all kinds of emotions in pretty much everyone.
If you re not extraordinarily passionate about one of the candidates, you re at least passionate about the election finally being over.
The amount of mudslinging and divisive rhetoric throughout the course of this election is enough to make anyone s head spin.Catching up with some folks in North Strabane, Pennsylvania, CNN captured the reaction of one couple, married 37 years, who is most definitely split on who they are voting for.However, the split might not be how you assumed it would go.
The woman, Jackie Krachala, was asked if she s excited for the first female president, but she emphatically shouted: NO!
However, her husband hilarious chimed in behind her, and said: I am.
Ha!
Good for you.This election is definitely dividing friendships and families in ways never quite seen before in any election.
However, one thing is abundantly clear, EVERYONE will be happy when this election is finally over.
Hopefully with Donald Trump staying as far away from the Oval Office as possible.Watch the hilarious moment between the couple here via Deadspin s Twitter:My goodness pic.twitter.com/BF3vzVAxHx Deadspin (@Deadspin) November 8, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
