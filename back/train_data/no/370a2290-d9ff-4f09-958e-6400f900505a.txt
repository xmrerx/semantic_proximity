chilpancingo , mexico ( reuters ) - a protest by government workers in a drug violence-riddled southern mexican city over rotting corpses at the municipal morgue temporarily closed a prosecutor s office on tuesday , officials said .
the protest by some 60 workers forced the office in the city of chilpancingo , the capital of southern guerrero state , to shut for about three hours .
the protesters complained that overcrowding at the morgue was causing unsanitary conditions .
violence has spiked in guerrero in recent years as a growing number of criminal gangs vie for control of crops of opium poppies and for drug-trafficking routes .
media reports said that at least 500 corpses were being stored in the morgue .
officials promised protesters that future transfers of bodies to the morgue will involve better sanitary conditions .
workers in the prosecutor s office will take the necessary precautions so that the situation that occurred today , in which the odor ( from the corpses ) arrived at the office and caused the workers to stop work , doesn t happen again , the state government said in a statement .
