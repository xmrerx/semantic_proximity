washington ( reuters ) - u.s. vice president joe biden said on thursday that he will be “ deeply involved ” in advising president barack obama on picking a candidate for the supreme court but said he had “ no desire ” himself to be named to the nation ’ s highest court .
obama is preparing to name a successor to conservative justice antonin scalia , who died on saturday .
the appointment could change the court ’ s balance of power , and many republican senators want to wait until after the nov. 8 presidential election to give their consent to a new justice .
biden , who was a long-time chairman of the senate judiciary committee , said in an interview that obama has asked for his advice on who to choose , and believes the president will choose a “ consensus candidate. ” “ i haven ’ t even had a chance to sit down with him yet to talk about the potential candidates , ” biden told msnbc ’ s rachel maddow .
“ when we do , as in the past , lay out all the people , go out and survey a little bit , and see who we think meets those criteria and we think could have a chance of being confirmed , ” he said .
asked directly whether he would do the job , biden said he was not interested .
“ you never say to a president for certain you wouldn ’ t do anything , but i have no - look at me now - i have no desire to sit on the supreme court , none , ” biden said .
biden is known for having a good working relationship with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell , who has said the seat should remain vacant until after the election .
biden said he would be an “ interlocutor ” with his friends on capitol hill on the issue , but said he did not know whether he could persuade enough senators to support obama ’ s choice .
“ i will be deeply involved , ” he said .
