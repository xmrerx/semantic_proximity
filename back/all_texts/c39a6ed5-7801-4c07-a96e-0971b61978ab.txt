It s just too hard Too Many Things Christians Cannot Do!
Who needs rules when you can just live in a godless society?
Have some fun YOLO!Brad Pitt is an atheist because his father instilled a Christian guilt in him during his upbringing.The actor revealed that he adheres to no religion in an interview with the UK s Telegraph on Saturday.
Pitt told the paper that he was raised in a Southern Baptist household in Missouri, with all the Christian guilt about what you can and cannot, should and shouldn t do.
The Hollywood mega-star elaborated on the Christian guilt he was raised with in a 2007 interview with Parade.
I d go to Christian revivals and be moved by the Holy Spirit, and I d go to rock concerts and feel the same fervor, Pitt told the magazine.
Then I d be told, That s the Devil s music!
Don t partake in that!
I wanted to experience things religion said not to experience.
Still, Pitt said he learned the value of hard work from his father, who reportedly ran a trucking company in Missouri.
He could be a softie, Pitt told the Telegraph of his father.
But one thing my folks always stressed was being capable, doing things for yourself.
He was really big on integrity and that informed a lot of what [we] try to do now.
Pitt also revealed that he and his wife and By the Sea co-star, Angelina Jolie, originally wanted double the number of children they currently have.
Listen, Angie and I were aiming for a dozen, but we crapped out after six, the actor said, adding: Everyone talks about the joy of having kids blah, blah, blah.
But I never knew how much I could love something until I looked in the faces of my children.
