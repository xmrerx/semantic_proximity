Here s just one video from last night that will tell you all you need to know: We have seen demonstrations and I think you already talked about that around the country.
Young people at Berkeley protesting against this unconstitutional order.
And I heard it say earlier that we need to get involved on the local and state level.
But what concerns me is that the strain that has been placed on local government, particularly local law enforcement dealing with an order that is unjust and proper.
And so as we encourage our young people to get involved I thought it was a beautiful site as we encourage people to get involved, what direction and instructions and how can we have a more organized effort so that they can be a major tool in moving our agenda forward?
Anyone who feels that they can answer this question?
Thank you.
