beijing ( reuters ) - chinese president xi jinping met senior military leaders on thursday and pressed them on his goal of having world class armed forces by the middle of the century , his first publicly announced meeting with them since a new leadership was unveiled .
xi , who is also head of the military and the ruling communist party , has made military modernisation a key policy platform , with advanced new equipment like stealth jets and aircraft carriers either already in service or development .
the armed forces have also been a focus of xi s fight against deep-seated corruption , with dozens of senior officials investigated and jailed .
in his first publicly reported meeting with top officers since wednesday s unveiling of his new standing committee , a seven-man body that is the height of power in china , xi pushed home his modernisation message .
the military must ensure it is a world-class service by 2050 , xi said , in comments carried by state media , a goal he set last week at the opening of a key party congress .
the armed forces must fully recognize the bright prospects for a strong military , xi told them .
put into practice one hundred percent military construction .
though china has not fought a war in decades , it has been taking an increasingly assertive stance in the disputed east and south china seas , as well as over self-ruled taiwan , claimed by beijing as its own , rattling nerves around the region .
china says that it has only peaceful intentions , but that it needs a modern military to protect its interests and citizens around the world and that it will never compromise on china s sovereignty and territorial integrity .
