sacrifice is for the peasants when hollywood actor leonardo dicaprio hosts a reception for a string of a-list stars , supermodels and wealthy philanthropists later this month , he will make an impassioned plea for more action to be taken on global warming.but instead of holding the event in los angeles , where most of his guests are based , they will fly halfway around the world to the glitzy french resort of st tropez at enormous cost to the environment.last night , green campaigners were quick to criticise 41-year-old dicaprio , who in february used his best actor acceptance speech at the oscars to warn about the dangers posed by climate change.the reception the grand-sounding leonardo dicaprio foundation annual gala to fund climate and biodiversity projects will be held on july 20 at the bertaud belieu vineyards on the french riviera.celebrities including kate hudson , charlize theron , cate blanchett , marion cotillard , penelope cruz , robert de niro , scarlett johansson , arnold schwarzenegger and kevin spacey are all expected to attend , along with a host of international rock and pop stars , supermodels and tycoons.and while a table seating 12 people at the gala costs up to 125,000 , the real price will be paid by the environment.if just one guest among the 500 invitees chooses to fly the 12,000-mile round trip from la to st tropez by private jet a notoriously environmentally unfriendly way to travel they will produce 86 tons of carbon dioxide greenhouse gas.even those who use a scheduled flight will be responsible for releasing seven tons of co2 leading green campaigners to ask why the event could not have been held in hollywood or in st tropez during may s cannes film festival , when many of the guests would have been there anyway.robert rapier , an environmental analyst , said : dicaprio demonstrates why our consumption of fossil fuels continues to grow .
it s because everyone loves the combination of cost and convenience they offer .
he believes that no sacrifice is necessary ; just government policies that can provide him with a solar-powered yacht or jet , or that give individuals low-cost renewable energy on a broad scale .
one guest who attended last year s gala said : it s basically a big party for leo and his showbusiness friends and models .
the models , of course , do not pay for tickets , and neither do the vip guests they get to have a nice big free party .
