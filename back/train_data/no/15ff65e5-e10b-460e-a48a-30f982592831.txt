port louis ( reuters ) - the attorney general of the island nation of mauritius stepped down on wednesday after allegations he had helped launder gambling money .
prime minister pravind kumar jugnauth told reporters he wanted an investigation into ravi yerrigadoo to be conducted transparently .
the indian ocean island markets itself as a link between africa and asia and is striving to move from an economy mostly based on sugar , textiles and tourism toward offshore banking , business outsourcing , luxury real estate and medical tourism .
a scandal could hurt its burgeoning financial services industry .
if ravi yerrigadoo is cleared he will be able to resume office , jugnauth said .
mauritius-based l express newspaper reported on wednesday that an affidavit had been filed before the supreme court accusing yerrigadoo of trying to facilitate the transfer of gambling money through a financial structure .
it was not clear who had filed the affidavit .
in a statement , yerrigadoo denied the allegations and said he had quit to avoid the perception of a conflict of interest while the investigation was in progress .
in march 2016 , the environment minister was also forced to resign over corruption allegations .
