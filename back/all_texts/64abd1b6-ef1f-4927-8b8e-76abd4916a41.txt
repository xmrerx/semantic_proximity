At a press conference early Wednesday morning, Attorney Mike Freeman contested one of the chief claims of the protesters; that Clark was handcuffed when shot.
Freeman said Forensic evidence and video evidence both support the belief that Clark was not handcuffed at any time through the altercation.

The paramedics loaded Hayes into the ambulance and locked the doors.
(EMTs) Thompson and Haskell were very afraid at this point.The report explains that Minneapolis police officers Ringgenberg and Schwarze arrived at the scene and were told the person in the ambulance was assaulted by the person up on the curb (Jamar Clark) who was also interfering with the paramedics.
Clark refused to obey the officers and then according to the report:Ringgenberg said he tried to move away from Clark to get in position to handcuff him.
Ringgenberg felt his gun go from his right hip to the small of his back and told Schwarze, He s got my gun.
Ringgenberg said he reached back to the top of his gun and felt Clark s whole hand on the gun.
Ringgenberg repeatedly told his partner Schwarze, He s got my gun, he s got my gun.
Ringgenberg recalled hearing Schwarze tell Clark to let go of the gun or Schwarze would shoot.
Ringgenberg heard Clark say, I m ready to die.
Ringgenberg said, That was the worst feeling ever because, it just, my heart just sank.
Ringgenberg believed he was going to die at that point because he had no control over his gun.
Ringgenberg felt that Clark didn t care what happened to him and remembered thinking that he didn t want his partner to die with his gun.
After Ringgenberg heard the round go off he remembered being able to roll away.None of this evidence satisfied the hundreds of protesters who came out later that night for two rallies and marches that eventually converge in downtown Minneapolis.Mob at last night's #JamarClark rally raise fists, chant Black Panther Fred Hampton's "I am a revolutionary " pic.twitter.com/CsfKfbscfd Lee Stranahan (@stranahan) March 31, 2016After the groups merged, a number of speakers addressed the crowd, agitating them with anticapitalist, anti-American and anti white rhetoric.
