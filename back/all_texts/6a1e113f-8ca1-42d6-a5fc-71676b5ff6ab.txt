Like a stubborn cold that just doesn t seem to go away, Sarah Palin, for some reason or another, is still around and apparently relevant in our media.
You know, the same lame stream media that she likes to claim silences her or mixes up what she says when they just quote her verbatim.
The same media that asks her gotcha questions, which are really just questions she doesn t know the answer to and caught her looking like an idiot.Now, while appearing with Donald Trump at a rally in San Diego, California, Palin told the crowd that despite the media treating Trump like a joke at the beginning, he s still here, and not only is he here, he s going to be the Republican nominee for President of the United States.Honestly, I don t know why she s complaining about the media and Trump considering it s been a non-stop Trump show media circus since he announced his candidacy last summer.However, it was what Palin told the media, and everyone else who thought Trump was a joke, to do with Trump s nomination that was utterly nauseating to say the least.She said of her, and apparently our golden wrecking ball after trashing the media: Weeelll, he is now though.
He is now we the people s nominee.
So, suck it up, cupcake.
Okay, first of all, he is not we the people s nominee, he is the Republican nominee, not representative of all of the nation s people.
Secondly, telling us to suck up anything in regards to Trump will have most of the nation reaching for a barf bag.Oh, and Palin also said Trump wrecked what needed to be wrecked in order to shine light on the shenanigans.
Well, he certainly wrecked the Republican Party and any hope of ever respecting them again, so sure, he wrecked what needed to be wrecked.
However, he s not at all what the country needs, and he needs to stay as far away from the Oval Office as possible.
It s up to us to make sure he s stays out of the White House.Watch her words in no particular order here:https://www.facebook.com/politico/videos/10153565461001680/Featured image via video screen capture
