Remember when Donald Trump said he would debate Bernie Sanders and then refused to do so when Sanders accepted?
Well, now we know how it would have gone.During Trump s coronation at the RNC Convention, the Vermont Senator sat back at home and responded to Trump s acceptance speech on Twitter and the result clearly shows that Sanders can wipe the floor with Trump on social media or in person.Of course, Sanders targeted Trump s economic proposals in particular, but he also counter-punched the Republican nominee on his Middle East policy, students loans, the Supreme Court, and Citizens United all while lampooning Trump for using other nations to manufacture his products.#RNCwithBernie pic.twitter.com/x5nuSI6AuN Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016 Will Trump mention climate change, the great environmental crisis of our time?
Been waiting for a year now.
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016Those who voted for me will not support Trump who has made bigotry and divisiveness the cornerstone of his campaign.
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016 We believe in bringing people together, not dividing them up.
Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016Trump is wrong.
The real cause of instability in the Middle East was the Bush-Cheney invasion of Iraq.
By the way, where is President Bush?
Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016 Trump s big economic plans: Give trillions in tax breaks to millionaires, refuse to raise the federal minimum wage.
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016Trump s economic plan: $3.2 trillion in tax breaks for millionaires, cut programs for low-income Americans.
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016 What a hypocrite!
If Trump wants to fix trade he can start by making his products in the US, not low-wage countries abroad.
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016Fix trade.
Stop manufacturing Trump shirts in Bangladesh at 30-cents an hour.
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016 Fix trade.
Stop manufacturing Trump ties in China.
Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016Fix trade.
Stop manufacturing Trump clothing in Mexico.
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016 Citizens United is one of the worst decisions in our history.
Will Trump mention it or is he too afraid of the Koch brothers?
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016Still waiting for a single word about covering the 28 million Americans without health insurance.
I guess they don t matter much to Trump.
Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016 Trump: I alone can fix this.
Is this guy running for president or dictator?
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016Trump: I alone can fix this.
Maybe he doesn t understand that a president has to work with Congress.
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016 Looks like Ted Cruz was right about one thing.
Trump does not understand what the Constitution is about.
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016Our movement understands that what we don t need is Trump s huge tax breaks for millionaires.
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016 Trump thinks climate change is a hoax.
My supporters understand that we must move away from fossil fuels, not expand them.
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016Will there be one word about student debt or making college affordable?
Or just concerned about more tax breaks for the rich?
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016 Trump s economic plan: same old, same old trickle-down economics.
Pathetic.
#RNCwithBernie Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016Trump s economic plan: let states lower the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour, already a starvation wage.
Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016 Trump s Supreme Court nominees would, like Scalia, oppose a woman s right to choose, support Citizens United and gut the Voting Rights Act.
Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 22, 2016Bernie definitely made it clear that Donald Trump is NOT a viable alternative for his supporters to turn to in the wake of his endorsement of Hillary Clinton.
Sanders understands that Trump would be a disaster for this country and going forward a little by voting for Hillary is way better than going completely backwards by voting for Trump.Oh, and it s also pretty clear that Sanders kicked Trump s ass.Featured image via Twitter
