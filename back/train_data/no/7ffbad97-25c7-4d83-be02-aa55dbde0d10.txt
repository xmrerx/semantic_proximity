benghazi , libya ( reuters ) - a government based in eastern libya said on wednesday it would bar entry to u.s. citizens after president donald trump s administration included libya in a new travel ban .
the eastern-based government of abdullah al-thinni is aligned with libyan military commander khalifa haftar and is opposed to the internationally recognized government of national accord ( gna ) in tripoli .
announcing its ban , the eastern-based government said it was responding to a dangerous escalation that targets libyan citizens and puts them in the same basket as the terrorists against whom our ... armed forces are fighting .
it was not clear when or how the libyan ban would be enforced .
libya is among eight nations included in a new u.s. visa ban announced on sunday .
it was also included on previous bans that have faced multiple legal appeals .
the new ban said libya faced significant challenges in sharing several types of information , including public safety and terrorism-related information .
it said libya also had significant inadequacies in its identity-management protocols and was not fully cooperative with respect to receiving its nationals subject to final orders of removal from the united states .
