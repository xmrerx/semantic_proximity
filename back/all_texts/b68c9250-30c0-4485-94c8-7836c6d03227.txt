Are the people who pay to see Beyonc perform and buy her music even smart enough to figure out she s waging war against many of them?
From her lip-syncing of the National Anthem at Obama s inaugural celebration, to her trip to Cuba with her radical husband Jay Z, they just can t help themselves when it comes to injecting themselves in Obama s race war.Former Mayor Rudy Giuliani blasted Beyonc s halftime performance at the Super Bowl accusing her of using her platform to attack police officers.
This is football, not Hollywood, Giuliani fumed Monday morning on FOX & Friends.
At Sunday night s big game, the singer used her moments in the spotlight to highlight racial tension with her dancers wearing berets similar to those worn by the Black Panthers.Prior to the performance, some of Beyonc s dancers posed for a picture with their fists raised to the sky, evoking the black power salute by two prominent athletes during the 1968 Olympic Games.They also snapped a similar shot while holding a sign that said Justice 4 Mario Woods, referring to the 26-year-old man shot dead in December by San Francisco police.
I thought that she used it as a platform to attack police officers, who are the people who protect her and protect us and keep us alive, Giuliani said.
And what we should be doing, in the African-American community and in all communities, is build up respect for police officers and focus on the fact that when something does go wrong, OK, we ll work on that.
