our white house is currently occupied by someone who s likely certifiably insane , yet for many on both the right and the left , the real travesty is that trump s predecessor is * gasp * earning a lot of money in speaking fees , just like just about every white male former president in the last 40 years.the news that former president barack obama will reportedly accept $ 400,000 to give a speech to wall street investment bank cantor fitzgerald has inspired a strange paroxysm of rage from writers on the center-left .
obama s $ 400,000 wall street speaking fee will undermine everything he believes in , vox s matt yglesias proclaimed .
obama and bill clinton biographer david maraniss said the 44th president does not need the money and should not accept it .
others noted the unseemliness of the fee at a time of income inequality and seemingly rampant populism , especially since barack and michelle obama have already struck insanely lucrative book deals.even elizabeth warren was troubled by obama s speaking fees .
bernie sanders called the fees distasteful .
well , everyone can relax now .
on wednesday it was announced that the obamas would be giving that amount and far more to help youth in obama s adopted hometown of chicago .
one of the things that we ll be starting this year is michelle and i are personally going to donate $ 2 million to our summer jobs programs here in the community , he said at the south shore cultural center .
[ it s ] so that right away young people can get to work and we can start providing opportunities to all of them .
obama is expected to use the center as he focuses on issues such as criminal justice reform and education for underprivileged children now that he has left office .
social media was quick to notice that the obamas are literally donating five times what he will earn for that one speaking fee.this is president obama .
compassion & class .
five times his speaking fee .
the @ gop can now shut the hell up .

? liberal bitch ?
( @ aliberallady ) may 3 , 2017of course , there s also the fact that president obama is retired .
he can spend the rest of his days twitter trolling donald trump and passing out kenyan flags and it would be perfectly within his rights .
but that s not who obama is .
as this proves , he still has his principles and he s still managing to kick everyone s ass in his game of three-dimensional chess.featured image via scott olson/getty images .
