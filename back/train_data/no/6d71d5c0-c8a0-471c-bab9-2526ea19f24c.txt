conservative republican actor and outspoken nra member , tom selleck uses his role on blue bloods , a cbs hit tv show to show the world what patriotism looks like.the episode is titled flags of our fathers , and in it selleck s conservative character frank reagan comes in contact with a crazed liberal named gore , who organizes a protest to burn the american flag at a veteran s memorial.according to conservative tribune , reagan tried to talk gore out of burning the american flag , telling him that he will lose any sympathy for his message by burning the flag .
the liberal , however , won t hear any of it and moves forward with burning the flag .
before he leaves , reagan tells gore that only a fool seeks peace by inciting violence.just as reagan predicted , the riot incites violence and gore tries to blame the police for not protecting him .
reagan shot him down fast , telling him that the cops did their jobs .
when the liberal announces plans to do another similar protest , reagan then gives him a firm dose of reality .
that flag , that you consider a prop and a stunt , has draped the coffins of americans who died to give you the right to ignore that sacrifice , selleck s character said .
you re spitting on their graves .
this scene rings especially true today , when obama s race-baiters are constantly burning the american flag .
we applaud selleck for courageously telling this story despite the threat of liberal backlash ! via : mr. conservative
