scientists have been warning the world for weeks not to stare directly at the sun without protective eyewear during monday s solar eclipse unless you want to suffer damage to your eyes .
true to form , donald trump apparently decided those warnings were either fake news or a chinese hoax and did precisesly what he was told not to do .
like the total dumbass he is , trump stared right at the sun with no glasses on , because of course he did.images via mark wilson/getty imagesaides can actually be heard shouting at him not to look at the sun.someone shouts don t look as pres .
