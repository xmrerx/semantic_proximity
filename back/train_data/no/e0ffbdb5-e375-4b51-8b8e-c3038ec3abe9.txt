beijing ( reuters ) - china denounced on thursday a u.s. congressional commission that accused its state media of involvement in spying and propaganda and called for their staff in the united states to be registered as foreign agents .
the u.s. china economic and security review commission said in its latest annual report that while china had tightened restrictions on domestic and foreign media , its state media had rapidly expanded overseas .
the commission , created by congress in 2000 to monitor national security implications of u.s.-china trade relations , said china s state media expansion was part of a broader effort to exert greater control over how it is depicted globally , as well as to gather information .
chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang they had seen the report .
this commission that released the report has always been full of prejudice on china-related issues , geng told a daily news briefing .
much of the content in the relevant report is sheer fiction , and many of its views reflect their bias against china , he said .
china urged the commission to put an end to its wrong words and actions and really play a constructive role in promoting the development of sino-u.s. ties , geng said , without elaborating .
