in a sit-down interview with fox and friends , brian kilmeade asked president trump what he thought of nancy pelosi s comments yesterday on the cusp of his first major speech tonight .
kilmeade told trump that pelosi said , basically he s done nothing .
president trump responded , well i ve been watching nancy s statements and i think she s incompetent actually , you know , if you look at what s going on with uh , the democrats and the party , it s getting smaller and smaller .
we re soon going to have a one-party system .
i actually think a two-party system is healthy and good .
she s done a terrible job and i don t think she s a good spokesman .
`` i think she 's incompetent , actually , you know , if you look at what 's going on with the democrats and the party . ''
