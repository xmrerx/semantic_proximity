a united states air force squadron leader whistleblower is speaking out and telling the truth about how they could have reached benghazi to help on the night of the attack that killed four americans .
unfortunately , he s been afraid of being screwed over , so he s kept his mouth shut until now.an air force whistleblower says his team could have provided reinforcements to the americans under attack in benghazi in september 2012 , contrary to the obama administration s claims that the military provided the maximum possible support for the embattled diplomatic staff .
i definitely believe that our aircraft could have taken off and got there in a timely manner , maybe three hours at the most , in order to basically at least stop that second mortar attack and have those guys running for the hills , a man purportedly stationed at aviano air force base in italy told fox news on the condition of anonymity.that s a particularly explosive claim , given that two of the four americans who died in the attacks were killed in the second wave of attacks , which targeted a cia annex the morning of sept. 12 .
but the whistleblower has not spoken to rep. trey gowdy , r-s.c. , who is chairman of the select committee investigating the attacks , because there are so many ways you can get screwed over for cooperating with lawmakers.that frustrates gowdy , who accused the obama administration of preventing him from talking to all the relevant witnesses .
as a former federal prosecutor , i find it deeply troubling there are individuals who would like to share their stories , but have not because they are afraid of retaliation from their superiors , he said in a wednesday evening response to the fox report .
no one should be afraid of talking to their elected representatives in congress .
