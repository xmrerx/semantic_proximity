21st Century Wire says Unless you have been living under a rock for the last 20 years, you would have heard about the cultural meme known as the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon , Hollywood s own lowbrow revision derived from John Guare s famous 1990 play about the Six Degrees of Separation .So popular was Bacon s cultural quirk, that the Gods of Google even launched a web tool called the Baconator where users can plug in the name of anyone in order to measure how many degrees of separation there are between you and them.
If I m about to go to work with someone, I ll check their name on the call sheet, and then I ll go to Google, and you can put in their name plus bacon number, and that will tell you how many degrees of separation there are.
It ll tell [me] if I worked with them, said Bacon to TV host James Corden recently.Just as the Baconator was getting going, Kevin was usurped, like everyone and everything else, by the ever-engulfing digital vortex known as Facebook and its hoodie-wearing billionaire co-founder Mark Zuckerberg.Poor Kevin.
According to new data published by the social networking behemoth, Facebook people are separated by only 3.57 degrees of separation.
Casey Williams from the Huff Post explains, One caveat about this research, though: It applies only to the 1.59 billion people who are active on Facebook.
Given that there are more than 7 billion people on the planet, and that over four billion still lack regular access to the Internet, it s unlikely that the new theory holds for humans at large.
The down side of course (although Facebook will never publish its trolling data), is that you are also more closely connected with thousands, if not millions of trolls and their phony, malicious sock-puppet accounts too.Even worse, as 21WIRE discovered late last week Facebook can and will, without any warning whatsoever and with ZERO human feedback on their end block and disable your ability to share information with your peers through its user groups.
When asked, the reason given by Facebook was simply, You re going too fast.
No, we re not kidding Once again, thank you Mr. Zuckerberg for allowing your robots to kill people s ability to share news and information.When they say degrees of separation they really mean separation.READ MORE SCI-TECH NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Sci-Tech Files
