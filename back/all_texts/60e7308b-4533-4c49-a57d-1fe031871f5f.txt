At first I was very surprised that this was in a dorm, because when I go into my dormitory I want to feel I m at home.
So when I looked at the board, I instantly felt shameful for my heritage and my upbringing and for my life choices.
Mission accomplished.A student at Appalachian State University says she was cyber-bullied after she called out a dormitory s Check Your Privilege bulletin board.The board showed memes to depict so-called white privilege, heterosexual privilege, Christian privilege, and able-bodied privilege, among others.A female student, Laurel Littler, objected to the board s apparent shaming, so she posted a photo of it on her Facebook page and was surprised to receive some harsh responses.Her post was picked up by the website Campus Reform and after that, she says she was the victim of tons of cyber-bullying.
I read that because I m white, I had never experiences oppression before, so I deserved the cyber-bullying.
It hurt at first, but after a while, I just realized these people don t know who I am and if they really do want to know my opinion, they re more than welcome to talk to me in person, Littler told Elisabeth Hasselbeck this morning.The privilege board was put up by a resident assistant at the dormitory after three University of San Francisco professors started the Check Your Privilege campaign last fall.The R.A. reportedly does not plan to take it down.Littler said she doesn t want the board to be taken down, but posted it on Facebook out of a concern over the message.
Fox and Friends did not receive a response from the school on whether they plan to act to take the board down.
