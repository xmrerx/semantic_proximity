The domestic terrorists who are holed up in the federal building of an Oregon wildlife refuge get more ridiculous by the day.
Perhaps the most bizarre scene from this insanity yet has been a guy who is sitting in the middle of a vacant lot underneath a blue tarp with nothing but his penis extension rifle for comfort.
Of course, despite the absolutely serious nature of this armed occupation, the ridiculousness of it all definitely gives plenty of material to late night comics, and comedian Seth Meyers has taken full advantage of that.On Wednesday night s edition of his show, Meyers dubbed this particular militia idiot Tarpman, and proceed to mock him relentlessly.
Luckily, MSNBC s Lawrence O Donnell was kind enough to share the hilarity with us.First, the clip showed the local sheriff trying to be sensible and get these yahoos to leave.
Then, it panned to Tarpman hiding with his gun.
After that, we see Seth Meyers relentlessly mocking this insanity.
He even called Tarpman a guess in a game of militia Clue.
Watch the clip below, via MSNBC:Well, it seems that this particular terrorist, Levoy Finicum, has gotten his fifteen minutes of fame, and they re not about to be over.Congratulations, Mr. Finicum.
