Donald Trump s spokeswoman Katrina Pierson went on national television to try and validate and justify Trump s comments about Muslims hating Americans.
This time however, she was schooled by Muslim journalist Dean Obeidallah.During the interview, Pierson labeled the culture of Islam as the problem and referenced polls in some Muslim countries that showed a distaste for America.
However, Obeidallah pointed out that her information is misleading because Indonesia, which is the largest Muslim country in the world, has a more favorable view of the United States than Germany and if a Muslim country has an unfavorable view of America, it s because of U.S. foreign policy and not some congenital hatred for the United States.For example, Pierson cited that polls show that the Palestinian Territories, the majority of whose inhabitants are Muslim, have an unfavorable view of the United States.
While this is true, it s because when Palestinian civilians are tear gassed, gunned down in the streets, or bombed from the air, it s with US made weapons it gives to Israel.
If the Palestinians were majority Christian or Jewish, they would still have an unfavorable view of the United States.Watch Here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xuMKCqgm0Gg]Obeidallah also fired back at Pierson and Trump s idiocy by pointing to Trump s business dealings in Muslim countries.
He said: Let s be honest.
Donald Trump says here in America, Islam hates us.
Then he goes to Dubai and does multi-million dollar business deals.
Donald Trump loves Muslims when he s making money with them.
He loves you when he s making money and demonizes you when he s getting votes.
He s a despicable hypocrite.
A special kind of hypocrite.
There are many more proud and capable Muslim Americans like Dean Obeidallah in the united States and it would be great if we continue to see them on national television to rip apart the racists in our midst.
