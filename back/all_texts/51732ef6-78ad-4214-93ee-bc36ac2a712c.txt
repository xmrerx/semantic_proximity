As Donald Trump continues to sink his political party due to his inability to be presidential (or seemingly human), it s been reported that the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has released internal polling from their campaign headquarters which shows one scary thing for Republicans: Hillary Clinton is beating Donald Trump (by double digits) in seven Republican congressional districts across the country.The districts are:Because Trump s unstable, asinine, and outrageous campaign, districts that have gone Republican for 30+ years (and weren t affected by the Obama wave in 2008) may turn blue this November, and it s all thanks to Donald J. Trump.It s still a steep climb for Democrats, who need to take back 30 seats to have a majority in the House and six in the Senate (which way more probable).
But Democrats took 30 seats in 2006, so the idea isn t entirely far fetched.But there s only one sure way it will happen: Democrats come out and vote in presidential elections, and should they vote down-ticket, not only could the Senate be taken back, significant gains could be made in the House, allowing a Clinton presidency to have a Congress that works with her to get progressive policies pushed through.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images
