The typically bellicose propaganda film posted on Saturday by state media shows mocked-up footage of North Korean troops joyously destroying American bombers and fighting forces.
A female narrator gleefully exclaims over the shrill footage that the United States will perish if it ever thought that an attack on the communist state would result in victory.
A knife will be stabbed into the throat of the carrier, while the bomber will fall from the sky after getting hit by a hail of fire says the narrator according to Yonhap News Agency.
The video shows Foal Eagle military drills with America and South Korea which have long angered the North Korean government according to Newsweek.Uriminzokkiri, the YouTube page where the video was published, has hosted other controversial clips which depict North Korean troops bombing America.In 2013 it published a video showing a North Korean man dreaming of missiles raining down upon Washington, D.C. and New York.The video comes as Kim threatened to reduce the US to ashes with nuclear weapons if American fires even a single bullet at North Korea.Pyongyang said it would use its invincible Hwasong rockets tipped with nuclear warheads to defend its territory as tensions with South Korea continued to escalate.It comes as Seoul insisted North Korea s latest rocket-engine test showed meaningful progress and as an an analyst said the secretive state had taken a dangerous step towards its goal of developing a rocket that could hit the United States.
