an owner of a propane dealership in maine is refusing to deliver gas to anyone who voted for president-elect donald trump.michael turner , owner of turner lp gas in skowhegan , maine , recorded a voicemail greeting that leaves little question as to his feelings for those in his community who supported trump .
thank you for calling turner lp gas .
if you voted for donald trump for president , i will no longer be delivering your gas please find someone else , the message states.turner isn t the first person to refuse to do business with trump voters in late november , mathew blanchfield , ceo of an albuquerque , new mexico-based marketing firm , issued a statement saying he would no longer work with trump supporters.but unlike blanchfield , who lives in a county that voted solidly for hillary clinton , turner lives in a county that overwhelmingly supported trump .
trump won somerset county , maine in which skowhegan is located 57.73 percent to hillary clinton s 35 percent.in skowhegan specifically , where clinton performed better than somerset county at large , trump still received over 50 percent of the vote and had a 10-point lead on clinton , according to rough figures published on skowhegan s town website .
turner is apparently so distraught over trump s win he is willing alienate more than half of his community and possibly sacrifice his livelihood .
