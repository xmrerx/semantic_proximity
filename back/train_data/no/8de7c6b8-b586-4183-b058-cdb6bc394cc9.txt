watch jim acosta wave his hands around and have a temper tantrum on air : the white house press secretary is getting to a point , brooke , where he s just kind of useless .
you know , if he can t come out and answer the questions and they re not going to do this on camera or audio why are we having these briefings or gaggles in the first place ?
acosta expressed dissatisfaction with spicer s method of answering questions with a promise to find out answers but not providing them later.acosta turned around to point at the white house and express his frustration with the white house communications team : that s the white house , behind me .
the white house .
and it s just bizarre .
i don t know what world we are living in right now , brooke.acosta continued : they bring us into the briefing room here in the white house , and they won t answer these questions on camera or let us record the audio .
i don t know why everybody is going along with this .
it just feels like we are sort of slowly but surely being dragged into what is a new normal in this country , where the president of the united states is allowed to insulate himself from answering hard questions .
he finished his comments with a slam to conservatives : maybe he ll take a question from a conservative news media reporter and then somebody from the mainstream media , he said .
this is not how we do things in this country , but for whatever reasons we are all going along with it .
