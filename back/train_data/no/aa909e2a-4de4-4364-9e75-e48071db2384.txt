beijing ( reuters ) - beijing s city authorities have taken down from their website a policy document put up just a few days ago that looked to help improve the city s notorious air quality by banning construction during winter months .
it is unclear if the move means the prohibition is no longer in place , with an official at the beijing municipal commission of housing and urban-rural development who gave his name as yu saying the document had been pulled from the website due to misunderstandings over the rules in media reports .
he declined to give further details .
the statement , dated sept. 15 , was posted on the commission s website last friday , but it was no longer available on wednesday .
it was not clear when it was withdrawn .
under the plan , all construction of road and water projects , as well as demolition of housing , would be banned from nov. 15 to march 15 within the city s six major districts and surrounding suburbs .
as part of dust control measures , the government often instructs construction sites in northern cities to close during bouts of heavy smog in the winter when households crank up heating , drawing on the power grid which is mainly fueled by coal .
provincial authorities are rushing to enforce the central government s ambitious targets for preventing toxic air during the upcoming colder months as it has ramped up its years-long war on smog .
the possible pulling of the construction rules underscores the complexity of implementing some of the steps .
among the most stringent measures are orders for heavy industry such as steel mills to curb output by as much as 50 percent during the colder months .
recent checks of factories across the north have forced many to close or curb operations , roiling supplies of some critical raw materials like coke and coal and sending prices of base metals soaring .
