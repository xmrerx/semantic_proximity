Jodie Foster gives a dose of common sense to set the record straight on the phony war on women being pushed by the left: I don t think there is a big plot to keep women down Jodie Foster said she s tired of people oversimplifying the issue of gender equality in Hollywood, declaring that there isn t some major plot in the industry to keep women down.
The 53-year-old Money Monster director made the comments Wednesday during a panel at the Tribeca Film Festival with fellow director Julie Taymor, Variety reported.Ms.
Foster said, I feel like the issue is way more complicated than saying, Why aren t women making big mainstream franchises?
There are so many reasons, she continued.
Some of them are about our psychology, some of them are about the financial world, some of them are about the global economy.
There are so many answers to that go back hundreds of years.
It would be nice to be able to have a more complex conversation and to be able to look at it more than just a quota or numbers.
I don t think there is a big plot to keep women down, she added.
It is neglect really, and a lot of people that weren t thinking about it, and a lot of female executives who have risen to the top, who have not really made a dent of bringing many women into the mainstream world.
Money Monster, Ms. Foster s fourth feature film which premieres next month at the Cannes Film Festival, tells the story of a failed investor who holds a television commentator hostage on live TV, Variety reported.
Though it comes at a time when Wall Street is at the center of debate in the Democratic presidential race, Ms. Foster insisted the film isn t meant to be political.
For me really it is a character film, she told the magazine.
The backdrop of technology is really interesting to me.
Technology is making us closer and we have this virtual intimacy that sometimes feels closer than real intimacy.
