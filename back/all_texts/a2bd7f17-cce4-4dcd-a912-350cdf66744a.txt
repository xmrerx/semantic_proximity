The violence and hate we witnessed at Trump rallies is now spilling over into the rest of society.
Since the billionaire racist misogynist internet troll was elected to lead the free world, there have been literally hundreds of hate crimes (many of which in his name) and his supporters have proved completely unwilling to behave themselves even in their victory.At an anti-Trump protest in Ohio on Monday, we received a reminder of the violent nature of the animals known as Trump voters.
As Tim Joseph was delivering his message into a bullhorn at the Ohio Union at OSU in Columbus, one Trump voter voiced his displeasure with the current direction of the country (or whatever bullsh*t the media is saying to explain away these alleged people s behavior today) by shoving the protester down some stairs from behind like a coward, of course.
You idiot, the disenfranchised white man screeched as he went all WWE on Joseph.One man wearing a Guy Fawkes mask began to beat the living hell out of the attacker, whose identity has not yet been released.
Instead of joining in like we saw at Trump rallies throughout the election year, other protesters calmed the man down and the crowd detained him peacefully until police arrived.
According to Undergraduate Student Government president Gerard Basalla the attacker, a student, was arrested and placed under indefinite suspension.
The assault that occurred that s what it was in the Union tonight is completely unacceptable, Basalla told The Lantern.
Every person on this campus has the right to feel safe and voice their opinion without fearing harm.
We can t be having this.
We protect First Amendment rights actively, but we do not under any circumstances tolerate intimidation or threats to students, faculty, staff or visitors to our campus, University President Michael Drake said in an email to students following the attack.Watch the assault below:
