Katrina Pierson, Donald Trump s official campaign spokeswoman who appears to have a permanent spot in front of a cable news camera, added to her long list of bizarre claims and blatantly false lies by alleging that Hillary Clinton has a brain disease.Pierson threw out the conspiracy theory on MSNBC on Thursday evening.Speaking on MSNBC, Katrina Pierson alleged that Clinton has a disorder called dysphasia, a condition brought on by brain trauma that erodes a person s ability to speak or comprehend language.
What s new are the other reports or observations of Hillary Clinton s behavior or mannerisms as well as her dysphasia, the fact that she s fallen, she has had a concussion, there are really interesting things out there, Pierson said.The Trump campaign has been echoing conspiracy theorists like radio host Alex Jones (who believes 9/11 was an inside job by the government) and Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone (he thinks that LBJ had John F. Kennedy killed) for the last few months.
And Trump of course was the lead spokesperson for the birther conspiracy theory that alleges that President Obama was not born in America.Along with these conspiracy theorists, right wing media outlets like the Drudge Report and Fox News Sean Hannity have been presenting a pile of false claims that Clinton s health is weak.Months ago, her campaign released a medical assessment from Clinton s doctor and found the former Secretary of State in good health.
By comparison, the Trump campaign s health document was widely ridiculed at the time, as its hyperbolic language seemed to have come from Trump himself, and not a reputable doctor.The wild theories about Clinton s health have coincided with Trump s drop in the polls, as he has plummeted to be anywhere from 4-15 percent behind Clinton nationally.
He is even tied or very close to her in multiple red states that have been easily won by previous Republican candidates like Mitt Romney and John McCain, including Georgia, Missouri, and even Texas.So more conspiracies can be expected.Featured image via YouTube
