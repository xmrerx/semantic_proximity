This week on the show we re talking about what SHOULD be the biggest story on mainstream media but isn t, the latest revalations in the story of the death (murder) of Seth Rich, the DNC staffer who many believe to be one of the main leakers to Wikileaks during the 2016 election.
Is his death a deep-state assassination?
Is there a cover up under way?
Is #TrumpRussia one of the convenient smoke screens to obfuscate this enormous story?

The gang also talks about the death of Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and toss around ideas as to the validity of the suicide narrative coming out of the media so quickly and compare his case to a number of other high profile cases that come with some strange anomalies in their media baggage.
