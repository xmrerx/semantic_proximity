the mosque in finsbury park , london where this morning s tragedy unfolded has been the centre of media attention before .
it opened back in the late 80s , as the muslim population in the area began to grow .
since then it s been one of the biggest prayer halls in britain .
however in the 90s the mosque was accused of radicalism and its preachers linked to al-qaeda.why was this mosque allowed to go on with radical teachings after people like the shoe bomber were connected to it .
it s time for the politically correct residents of towns like this to call out these mosques .
notice that muslims just moved to another mosque instead of making an effort to oust the radicals within the mosque.according to bbc , finsbury park mosque has long been synonymous with the worst fears about islamist extremism in britain .
the mosque s new leadership have been struggling to reclaim it for the local community but that struggle raises questions about who runs mosques in britain .
the finsbury park mosque opened in 1988 .
and with one of the then biggest prayer halls in britain , many muslims regarded it as a major milestone , bbc wrote .
but by the late 1990s , amid the growth of radical islamism , it had become a meeting place for extreme voices , including that of abu hamza .
the mosque was visited by kamel bourgass , an algerian man jailed for the murder of a policeman and an alleged ricin poison plot , bbc reported.according to the telegraph , the finsbury park mosque was long known to have served as a clearing house for radical muslims after hamza arrived as imam in 1997 .
his hate-filled rants inspired attendees such as richard reid ( see below ) , the failed shoe bomber , zacarias moussaoui , one of the 9/11 terror plotters , and mohammed sidique khan , one of the four suicide bombers who blew themselves up on public transport in london on july 7 , 2005 .
remember this guy ? he came from this mosque !
