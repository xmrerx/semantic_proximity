moscow ( reuters ) - a russian military jet crashed while taking off from russia s hmeymim air base in syria on tuesday in an incident that killed its two-man crew , russia s defense ministry said , russian news agencies reported .
the sukhoi-24 attack aircraft , codenamed fencer by the nato military alliance , was heading out on a combat mission , but its crew failed to eject after the plane veered off the runway , the ministry was cited as saying .
a technical fault may have been to blame , the ministry said .
russia has used the hmeymim base in latakia province to launch air strikes against opponents of president bashar al-assad since it first intervened in the syrian conflict in september 2015 .
russia lost two other planes - a sukhoi-33 and a mig-29 - off the coast of syria last year in accidents involving its sole aircraft carrier , the admiral kuznetsov .
