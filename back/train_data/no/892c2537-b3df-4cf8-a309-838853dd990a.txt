nearly 30,000 police officers gathered in tribute to nypd police officer brian moore .
this should send a message to our newly sworn in doj director who was just too busy to attend this very important funeral .

shameful ! their agony was seared on their faces and into a city s heart.the father , mother and sister of nypd officer brian moore sobbed throughout his funeral mass on friday , bereft of all but his heroic memory and a shiny new detective s shield posthumously awarded .
with great honor and great sadness i posthumously promote police officer brian moore , shield 469 , to detective first grade , a choked-up police commissioner bill bratton told the 27,000 mourners , who crowded st. james roman catholic church in seaford , li , or listened to a live feed on the streets outside .
holding the 25-year-old cop s new gold shield aloft at the altar , bratton noted the grim significance of its number .
his family will receive this , shield 9002 , bratton said as moore s father , raymond , a retired nypd sergeant , watched tearfully in the front pew .
that number follows shields 9000 and 9001 , bestowed upon detective rafael ramos and detective wenjian liu , he said , recalling the posthumous honors for the two brooklyn cops killed in december when a gunman ambushed their patrol car in bedford-stuyvesant .
