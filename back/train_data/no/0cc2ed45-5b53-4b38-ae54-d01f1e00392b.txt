moscow ( reuters ) - german president frank-walter steinmeier said he had agreed with russia s president vladimir putin that their countries needed to make efforts to improve badly frayed bilateral relations .
we are far from having normal relations , steinmeier told reporters after a meeting with putin in the kremlin .
there are open wounds still , in particular resulting from the annexation of crimea and the conflict in eastern ukraine that have weighed and continue to weigh on our relations .
he said that both he and putin were realistic about the limits to what could be achieved in a single conversation and further talks were needed to find a way out of the negative spiral of current relations .
we are parting ways with the common goal of doing what we can to not only stabilize our relations but to improve them , he said .
