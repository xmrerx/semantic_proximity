Donald Trump continues to be the biggest pain in the a** for White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who seems to visibly hate his job more and more each day.Earlier today, Spicer crashed and burned during his press briefing when reporters cornered him and asked him why Trump refused to release the alleged tapes and recordings of the private conversations between himself and former FBI Director James Comey.
This was a hot topic, considering that Trump had just accused Comey of lying under oath last week, when Comey said Trump demanded that he drop the investigation on Michael Flynn, Trump s former National Security Adviser.When a reporter questioned Spicer about why Trump wouldn t give up the recordings if they could prove Comey had lied during his hearing, it was clear that Spicer wanted to hide behind the bushes again.
Spicer stumbled over his words and said: I think the president made it clear on Friday that he would get back as soon as possible on this.
Things got even more humiliating as the reporter pressed Spicer further, So what s he waiting for, what s the delay?
It looked like Spicer had completely given up defending Trump or trying to come up with a more clever response.
Instead, Spicer said: He s waiting for he s not waiting for anything.
When he s ready to further discuss it, he will, but he laid out his position very clearly, very concisely on Friday.
You can watch this very awkward press briefing below:Trump has gotten himself in such a mess with this whole Russia thing that not even his own team knows how to defend him anymore.
As Spicer continues to fail Trump, the rumors of his termination have only been strengthened.
After Trump sees this, Spicer s days in the White House may be numbered.Featured image via Win McNamee and Alex Wong / Getty Images
