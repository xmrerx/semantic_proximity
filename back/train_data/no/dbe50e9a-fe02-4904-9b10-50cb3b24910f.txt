washington ( reuters ) - two u.s. f-22 fighter aircraft fired warning flares on wednesday after two russian su-25 jets entered an agreed upon deconfliction area in airspace east of the euphrates river in syria , the u.s. military said .
eric pahon , a pentagon spokesman , said the f-22 aircraft were providing air cover to partnered ground forces when the russian jets came into airspace near albu kamal .
the incident lasted for about 40 minutes and coalition officials contacted the russians through a communication link to avoid a miscalculation .
at one point , pahon said , a russian jet came close enough that one of the f-22 aircraft had to aggressively maneuver to avoid a midair collision .
u.s. officials have said that as the battlefield against islamic state shrinks , they expect russian and u.s. aircraft to be in closer proximity .
since early november , russian jets have flown east of the euphrates river in the deconflicted airspace about six to eight times a day , according to the u.s. military .
it s become increasingly tough for our pilots to discern whether russian pilots actions are deliberate or if these are just honest mistakes , pahon said .
the coalition s greatest concern is that we could shoot down a russian aircraft because its actions are seen as a threat to our air or ground forces , he added .
u.s. defense secretary jim mattis has said the u.s. military will fight islamic state in syria as long as they want to fight , describing a longer-term role for u.s. troops after the insurgents lose all of the territory they control .
