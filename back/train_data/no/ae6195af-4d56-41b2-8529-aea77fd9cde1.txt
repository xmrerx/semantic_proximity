khartoum ( reuters ) - sudanese authorities believe a criminal gang is responsible for the abduction of a swiss humanitarian worker who disappeared outside her home in sudan s troubled darfur region on friday .
authorities have intensified the search in and around the city of al-fashir and believe the gang is looking for a ransom , north darfur s deputy governor mohamed birama told reuters on monday .
we expect that she will be found very soon , he said .
switzerland on sunday called for a rapid and unconditional release of the woman but did not give any other details about her .
sudan will extend a unilateral ceasefire with rebels until the end of december , state news agency suna reported on sunday , days after the united states lifted 20-year-old sanctions tied to progress on resolving ongoing conflicts .
the conflict in darfur began in 2003 when mainly non-arab tribes took up arms against sudan s arab-led government .
