YANGON (Reuters) - The number of refugees arriving in Bangladesh from Myanmar since Aug. 25 has risen to 480,000, international aid bodies said on Tuesday, adding that the figure had risen because 35,000 new arrivals had not been included in a previous tally.
The refugees are fleeing a Myanmar military offensive launched in response to about 30 coordinated attacks by Rohingya Muslim insurgents on Aug. 25.
The change in the new arrivals figure ... is due, in large part, to the additional estimated 35,000 new arrivals settling in the two refugee camps, which was not reported in the last situation report, the Inter-Sector Coordination Group of aid agencies said in a statement.
