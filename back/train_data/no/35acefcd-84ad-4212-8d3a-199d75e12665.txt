sydney - ( reuters ) - australia will send troops to assist philippine forces in the ongoing battle against islamic state fighters in the southern city of marawi , australia s defense minister marise payne said on friday .
small contingents of australian soldiers will be sent to train philippine troops , payne said during a press conference with her counterpart , delfin lorenzana in manila .
we are very committed to supporting the philippines in its efforts to defend itself against terrorist threats , minister payne said .
this is a threat to the region ( that ) we all need to work together to defeat .
but no australian troops will be actively involved in the fighting , lorenza said .
it would not look good if we would be needing troops to fight the war here .
we are happy with the assistance we re getting from australia .
the militants swept through marawi on may 23 and have held parts of it despite sustained ground attacks by hundreds of soldiers and daily pummeling by planes and artillery .
the southern philippines has been marred for decades by insurgency and banditry .
but the intensity of the battle in marawi and the presence of foreign fighters fighting alongside local militants has raised concerns that the region may be becoming a southeast asian hub for islamic state as it loses ground in iraq and syria .
the australian troops will compliment those from their country already sent to the philippines to train local personnel , payne said .
philippine troops fighting islamic state-linked rebels in a southern city have encountered armed resistance from women and children who were likely family member of militants , the phillipine military said on monday .
a spokesman for payne said further details of the training contingent would be determined in coming days .
