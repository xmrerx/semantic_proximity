Before most of us were awake, Trump was busily focusing on solving the world s problems, diligently working to provide a better life for every American was busy moving his thumbs to tweet out more of his unhinged ravings.
Iran is playing with fire they don t appreciate how kind President Obama was to them, Trump tweeted.
Not me!
Iran is playing with fire they don't appreciate how "kind" President Obama was to them.
Not me!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017Trump seems to be referencing an Iranian official rightfully mocking him as an extremist who has alienated the majority of Americans and regularly engages in groundless ranting.
These remarks come after Trump put the country ON NOTICE via a mean tweet:Iran has been formally PUT ON NOTICE for firing a ballistic missile.Should have been thankful for the terrible deal the U.S. made with them!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017Naturally, the people of the internet jumped on Trump s latest attempt to destabilize the world via Twitter:.
@realDonaldTrump This is not how foreign relationships work, you rotting carcass of derangement and deception.
Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump you are the worst at diplomacy.

@realDonaldTrump This is the way the world ends Not with a bang but a tweeter Oliver Duggan (@OliDuggan) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump It wasn t kind.
It s called diplomacy.
You don t understand because you re a narcissistic bully endangering us all.
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump you don't use these words in a Tweet when you are seconds away from a suitcase which can end the world.
Impeach Donald Trump (@Impeach_D_Trump) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump The Iraq war was a costly, destabilizing disaster.
Not sure that a sequel is in our best interests.

@realDonaldTrump it's called diplomacy, Donald.
You know, things that leaders of nations do with one another to avoid war and death.

Darren Bell (@darren_bell) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump Oh my God you're going to bring about the end of the world.

Jeremy Botter (@jeremybotter) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump your childish attitude to foreign affairs is likely to lead to a world war.
You are unfit for office Steve Clark (@steveclarkuk) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump "Almost everything went wrong" because our novice POTUS spends too much time on Twitter being a bully.

Embarrassing.
kevinchesters (@hairychesters) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump FYI, Iran is 1300 miles North East Yemen.
So, make sure that you have smart enough bombs to not hit the wrong country!
Mohamed Alabsi (@Mohamed_Alabsi) February 3, 2017Over this past week Trump has started numerous diplomatic fires, threatening to send troops to Mexico to deal with bad hombres and somehow managing to f*ck up relations with Australia, one of our closest allies.
When you hear about the tough phone calls I m having, don t worry about it, Trump recently told the crowd at the National Prayer Breakfast.
We have to be tough.
We re taken advantage of by every nation in the world, virtually.
It s not going to happen anymore.
Trump s horrible attitude has plunged the United States into an uncertain period of turmoil in which he is lashing out at everyone including our allies to satisfy his gigantic and undeserved ego.
Think about it: the leader of the free world just openly threatened hostile action toward another nation via Twitter.This is bad.
