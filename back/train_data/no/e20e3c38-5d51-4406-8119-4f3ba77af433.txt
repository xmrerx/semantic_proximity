aden ( reuters ) - yemen s national airline said on sunday it still lacks the security permits needed to resume commercial flights , a day after the transport minister said some flights would be allowed as a nationwide blockade is eased .
the saudi-led military coalition fighting against yemen s houthi movement said last week that it had closed all air , land and sea ports in yemen to stem the alleged flow of arms to the houthis from iran .
the move came after saudi arabia intercepted a missile fired towards riyadh , which it blamed on tehran .
transport minister mourad al-halimi had said yemenia flights to the pro-saudi government-held cities of aden and seiyun would resume on sunday , but the national carrier said in a statement that it didn t acquire the necessary permits to fly .
the united nations had warned the total blockade could cause famine in the impoverished country where war has killed at least 10,000 people in the last 2-1/2 years and the united nations population fund ( unfpa ) expressed more concerns on sunday .
it urged in a statement that humanitarian aid be allowed to enter the country immediately , as yemen has registered one of the highest rates in postpartum deaths .
the government-held southern yemeni port of aden was reopened on wednesday , but ports in houthi-held areas are still shut .
the coalition reopened the al wadea border crossing linking saudi arabia with territory in eastern yemen on thursday .
