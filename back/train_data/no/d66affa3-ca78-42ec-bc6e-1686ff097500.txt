on the show , sunday morning futures , a far left activist ranted on about how the wor terror should be banned because it may offend muslims.richard fowler : here s what deblasio tried to do yesterday , right ?
yes , it was an intentional act .
yes , it was an act of terror .
the problem is when you say the word terror because of word association it automatically assumes you are talking about people of the muslim faith .
and that is why he said an intentional act and not terrorism because we don t know if it was muslim .
none of these organizations have taken credit for it .
so before we go out and start to blame and shame a whole religion we ought to be very careful and get all the facts first .
well , mr. fowler , that is the most ridiculous thing ever spewed from a leftists mouth .
there have been over 29,236 islamic terrorist attacks since 9/11 .
maybe muslims wouldn t need to be offended by the word terror of they simply stopped committing acts of terror !
as an american , anyone that is a citizen has the freedom of speech , so to dictate that any word we use that is in fact the correct word to describe attacks such as the manhattan bombing , the new jersey bombing , and even the minnesota mall attack , is well within our rights as said american citizens.if anyone , muslim or otherwise , doesn t like that word they are free to not use it , but no one is free to strip the right to use it from everyone else.h/t [ gateway pundit ]
