There has long been speculation that Melania Trump cannot stand her husband.
After all, Donald Trump is a bloviating, compulsive bully.
If he bullies the rest of the world, chances are he does the same to his wife.
What s to stop him?
He likely controls her money and her access to her son.
If she tried to speak out against him or leave him, she d lose both.
Hell, he might even be able to get her deported.There s plenty of evidence out there that Melania is terrified of The Donald, but it seems she may be getting bolder.
There is, thus far, absolutely no sign that she and her son, Barron, are planning to move to the White House.
The only time we see them is at a few photo-ops, and when the family travels to Mar-a-Lago.
She never says a word to the press, and has not executed any of the usual duties of a First Lady.
Therefore, it should come as no surprise that Melania s official Twitter account liked a tweet that mocks Trump s border wall plan, saying that the only wall he s been able to build is between himself and his wife.
Here is a screenshot of that particular like, in case someone pulls it down:Now, this is a pretty bold move for Melania, and kudos to her or whoever had the guts to do it.
As much as Trump is on Twitter, it s likely he d see it, especially as it gets spread around the interwebs.
Hopefully, he s too busy attacking political opponents, the free press, and anyone else who dares to criticize him to attack his own wife.
Then again, knowing Trump, he won t be able to restrain himself.Melania, I hope you ve got good security after this one.
But thanks for confirming what we already knew: You hate that man as much as we do.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
