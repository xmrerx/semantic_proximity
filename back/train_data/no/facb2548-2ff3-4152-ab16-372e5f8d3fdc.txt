douala , cameroon ( reuters ) - a military court in cameroon sentenced an opposition leader on monday to 25 years in prison , his lawyer and amnesty international said and denounced the trial as politically motivated .
the court convicted aboubakar siddiki , the president of northern cameroon s main opposition party , of hostility against the homeland as well as revolution and contempt of the president over accusations he plotted to destabilise the country .
we are going to appeal this decision , which does not seem to us to be at all just , siddiki s lawyer , emmanuel simh , told reuters .
in a statement , amnesty said the prosecution was part of a government campaign to stifle its critics .
the government denies the charges are political .
dozens of people have been killed and hundreds arrested in a crackdown in recent months on protests in cameroon s english-speaking regions .
residents there say they suffer social and economic marginalisation in the predominantly francophone country .
the protests have become a lightning rod for opposition to president paul biya s 35-year rule .
besides siddiki , the court sentenced abdoulaye harissou , a well-known notary , to three years in prison for failure to denounce a crime .
the court also dropped charges against three journalists arrested in connection with the same case .
