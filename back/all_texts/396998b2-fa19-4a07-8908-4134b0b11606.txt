What happens when the most vile, sexist chauvinist is elected President of the United States (after 11 women accuse him of sexual harassment)?
Women take to the streets, and fight for their right to be treated like human beings.And that s exactly what happened.It s no secret: Donald Trump s inauguration had poor attendance (250,000 compared to Obama s 1.8 million).
He promised that it would be a huge and glorious event, and it wasn t not by a long shot.But do you want to know was a huge a glorious event?The Women s March.According to the Washington Post:Organizers, who originally sought a permit for a gathering of 200,000, said Saturday they now expect as many as a half million participants potentially dwarfing Friday s inaugural crowd.The March is expecting up to 500,000 attendees, doubling that of the President of the United States inauguration.
A mom from Hawaii started it all on Facebook just after the election, and she has successfully beaten out the efforts of a $200 million inauguration for the leader of the free world.Say that out loud if need be.The D.C. Metro was swamped, forcing long and crowded lines that took several hours to overcome, and parking in the downtown Capitol Hill area had been full as early as 8 a.m., forcing other protestors to seek parking miles away.You didn t see any of this at Trump s inauguration.This is what happens when Republican men mess with the women of America.
Ask Clarence Thomas and Todd Aiken what it s like.
Now Donald Trump can be added to that good old boys club that s going to blow it for the GOP in 2018.Trump has put the Violence Against Women on the chopping block and is now being sued in court by one of his accusers, and women are more than ready to take him on full force and this march is just the beginning.Feminist icon Gloria Steinem was amazed by the size of the crowd, saying, This is the upside of the downside.
This is an outpouring of democracy like I ve never seen in my very long life.
When Gloria Steinem who has participated in hundreds of women s marches in her life is amazed, that says something.The resistance is being led by the women of America.Hell hath no fury like a scorned woman, and Trump and the Congressional GOP are soon going to realize that.Featured image via Twitter
