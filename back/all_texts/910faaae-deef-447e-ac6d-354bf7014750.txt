WHAT THE HECK DO YOU EVEN CALL THIS?The U.S. Department of Agriculture s MyPlate service handed out advice on Sunday, and said strawberry s mores are a treat that kids will love.
But expectations for the kids might need to be set in advance, since these s mores don t have any chocolate or marshmallows in them.Instead, USDA encourages people to plop some low-fat vanilla yogurt on a graham cracker, and then top the yogurt with strawberries.
Top it off with another graham cracker, and you have a s more that looks a lot like a regular s more, except when you bite into it, you won t get any ooey-gooey chocolate all over your fingers.
Kids will love that they can make it themselves, and parents will love that it s an inexpensive and healthy treat!
