after the split vote in the iowa caucus race between hillary clinton and bernie sanders there has been talk of voter fraud by the clinton camp .
the video below was posted to cspan with a headline that s pretty intriguing .
please watch the video and tell us what you think a description is below as well : hillary clinton arose the winner , but not until a coin-toss gave her one delegate s vote , and a fracas resulted in more delegates for her in precinct # 43 in polk county.an anonymous user uploaded the video to cspan , along with the subheadline : caucus chair and clinton precinct captain do not conduct actual count of clinton supporters and deliberately mislead caucus .
after the final totals are announced for hillary clinton and bernie sanders , three sanders supporters approach the administrators of the caucus and dispute the tally.they got the big eye roll for asking to recount : view post on imgur.comreddit user cosmicjesus3 broke the accusation down : so basically in the caucus they have to hand count everyone depending on what side they re sitting on .
well when it came time to do the second count the numbers were off .
the first vote breakdown was like thisfirst vote : 215 sanders 210 clinton 26 o malley 8 undecided 459 totaland this is the second vote : 232 clinton 224 sanders 456 totalso somehow they lost 3 people but clinton s vote went up by 14.so basically what had happened was hillary s team didn t take the time to do a full recount instead she just added the new people who joined the second vote .
which clearly wasn t an accurate count .
