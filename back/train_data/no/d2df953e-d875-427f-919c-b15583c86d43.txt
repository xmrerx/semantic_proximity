donald trump isn t subtle .
he totally clueless and unaware of the world around him .
he certainly isn t sensitive and he s definitely tone-deaf about pretty much everything .
take today , when he was speaking to a group of retired veterans , many of whom suffer from ptsd , at a town hall .
while talking to them about veterans care , the terrible suicide rate among vets , and inferior mental health care within the va system , the clueless , draft-dodging egomaniac actually insulted everyone who s ever seen combat .
when you talk about the mental health problems , when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe what a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over , and you re strong and you can handle it , but a lot of people can t handle it .
and they see horror stories , and they see events you couldn t see in a movie nobody would believe it .
that s rich coming from someone with five draft deferments .
he s got no idea at all and he doesn t want to learn .
he d rather tell soldiers what he thinks ptsd is and leave it at that .
so soldiers who succumb to ptsd are weak .
on the internet , people are livid and rightfully so .
they ve been quick to hit back at trump for that on twitter because he really just hurt all the vets suffering from that awful condition , due entirely to being sent off to fight wars trump can t even imagine , but would like to fight more of.ptsd does not mean weakness !
