What s it going to take for someone to step in and tell Donald Trump that his behavior is not okay?
When will he be arrested for inciting violence against others?
He is now literally saying that fighting and punching protesters at his rallies is okay.
Well, guess what?
It s not okay.
Not by any means.
Not if, even as Trump says, the protesters are violent.
At a press conference Friday morning where Dr. Ben Carson slept through his endorsement of Trump, Trump said: These are people that punch.
People that are violent people.
The particular one where I said I d like to bang him, that was a very vicious a guy who was swinging, very loud, and then started swinging at the audience.
You know what?
The audience swung back.
And I thought it was very, very appropriate.
He was swinging.
He was hitting people.
And the audience hit back.
And that s what we need a little bit more of.
This isn t all that surprising considering this is what he has said before: You know what I hate?
There s a guy totally disruptive, throwing punches, we re not allowed to punch back anymore.
I love the ol days.
You know what they used to do to guys like that when they were in a place like this?
They d be carried out on a stretcher, folks.
Enough is enough, folks.
Violence is never okay, and if you want to be the President of the United States, Trump, you can t just throw punches at our enemies if they don t agree with you.
One of the scariest thoughts in the world right now is the thought of Trump with our nuclear codes.
