on thursday , donald trump said something terrifying those mass deportations ?
they re a military operation .
we re getting really bad dudes out of this country , and at a rate that nobody s ever seen before , trump said of the deportation force that is currently roaming the country and pulling undocumented immigrants with brain tumors out of hospitals and domestic violence victims out of courtrooms .
and they re the bad ones .
and it s a military operation .
you see what s happening at the border .
all of a sudden for the first time , we re getting gang members out , trump added .
we re getting drug lords out .
naturally , the idea of any kind of military operation on u.s. soil doesn t play well with voters even if it does help protect us from cancer patients and bad dudes who might need protection from the men who beat them .
@ thehill so let 's be clear : the 5000 border patrol he wants to hire are for a `` military operation '' against america on our own territory ?
yep shockratees ( @ thatshockratees ) february 23 , 2017deportation is a `` military operation ? ''
did trump just create his own gestapo ?
# trumpstapo https : //t.co/21iphtkmuz tea pain ( @ teapainusa ) february 23 , 2017 @ lawyerrogelio so is that a declaration of war on the people in america ?
sounds damn close to one .
a # resistance_dog ( @ elynn_prehn ) february 23 , 2017 @ lawyerrogelio if `` it 's a military operation '' as potus says it is , it is illegal .
military has no police function here .
barry levine ( @ lowki ) february 23 , 2017 @ thehill another step closer to a dictatorship .
jack hand ( @ jackhand11 ) february 23 , 2017 @ cbsnews @ realdonaldtrump it has shades of 1930 's germany heir trump doug ( @ wisemagic777 ) february 23 , 2017 @ cbsnews @ cbslais this a violation of the posse comitatus act ?

odd year bob ( @ sonova_beachbum ) february 23 , 2017 @ cbsnews then just make sure they have their brown shirts on joan mcginnis ( @ joanpennnative ) february 23 , 2017not to worry , though !
white house press secretary sean spicer quickly stepped in to take charge and explain away the president * s statement : : he was just using adjectives .
the president was using that as an adjective .
it is happening with precision , spicer said .
the president was clearly describing the manner in which this is being done .
right .
with the military .
because that s what military operation means.homeland security secretary john kelly later clarified that troops would not be deployed to enforce immigration laws , thus giving us one more day without trump deploying troops on american soil.watch it for yourself below : featured image via screengrab
