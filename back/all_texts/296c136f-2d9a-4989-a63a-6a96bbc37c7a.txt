Donald Trump and Paul Ryan thought they d get to pass what could possibly be described as the most cruel approach to healthcare imaginable this past week.
However, they couldn t even get members of their own party to go along with what was clearly a disaster.
To that end, Trump, never one to take the blame for anything himself, decided to blame the Democrats for not voting with him on his horrible bill even though it could have passed through the House of Representatives without so much as a single Democratic vote.
Now that this excuse won t fly, Trump is back to his old line: Let Obamacare explode.
Well, Representative Ted Lieu (D-CA) is calling Trump on his horrible approach to handling the Affordable Care Act.
Taking to Trump s own favorite platform, Twitter, Rep. Lieu said to Trump: President Donald Trump: You truly are an evil man.
Your job is to help Americans.
Not intentionally try to destroy their lives.
"President" @realDonaldTrump: You truly are an evil man.
Your job is to help Americans.
Not intentionally try to destroy their lives.

Lieu them went on to remind Trump of the oath he took when he assumed the office of the presidency:Mr. "President": Art II of Constitution requires you to faithfully execute laws passed by Congress.
Subverting #Obamacare violates your Oath https://t.co/2M94E1g39b Ted Lieu (@tedlieu) March 25, 2017So, in other words, if Trump tries to sabotage the law, he will be in violation of his Oath of Office.
Then again, he violates it every day, so what s one more instance of said violations, right?Ted Lieu is correct, though.
Donald Trump is evil.
This whole thing was nothing but a massive ego trip for him, and he doesn t give a damn about the citizens of this nation.Featured image via By Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Getty Images
