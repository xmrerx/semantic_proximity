WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on Tuesday said the U.S. debate on healthcare would continue, but said nothing about whether he would bring an Obamacare repeal bill to a vote.
Opening the Senate, McConnell praised the bill sponsored by Republican Senators Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, saying it contrasted sharply with Democratic proposals for “single-payer” healthcare.
“It’s an important debate for our country.
It’s one that will certainly continue,” McConnell, a Republican, said.
Three Republican senators have said they will vote against Graham-Cassidy.
But Republicans can lose no more than two votes on the measure, leaving the bill with no clear path to advancing in the Senate.
