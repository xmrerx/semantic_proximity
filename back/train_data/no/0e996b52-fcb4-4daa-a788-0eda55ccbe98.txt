donald trump s administration is already proving to be a complete and utter sh * tshow , but did you know his twitter security is just as bad as his leadership ?
the intercept reports that donald trump s twitter account that s the one used by the president of the united states was until today secured with a simple gmail account.hacker @ wauchulaghost , trump s @ potus account was set to a personal gmail apparently belonging to dan scavino as well as one that appears to be connected to donald trump s website : hey @ potus , on a serious note .
lets fix your security settings .
should i email you ?
# ghostofnonation @ realdonaldtrump pic.twitter.com/frdmjnzanr wauchulaghost ( @ wauchulaghost ) january 21 , 2017ghost says that @ potus , @ flotus , and @ vp are all vulnerable to attacks because the administration that says it will make our country more secure hasn t bothered to set up the most basic security features on the accounts .
cnn spoke to the hacker , who shared some grim details about exactly how inept the current administration is : according to wauchulaghost , @ potus , @ flotus and @ vp are more vulnerable because they haven t selected a basic security feature on twitter that requires you to provide a phone number or email address to reset your password .
the current security setting for these three accounts allows anyone to click on forgot password and type in @ flotus , @ potus or @ vp .
the next screen says we found the following information associated with your account and gives a partially redacted email address to which it will send a password recovery link.wauchulaghost says being able to fill in the missing letters and guess someone s email address is the first step hackers take when trying to breach an account .
it s not hard for us to go figure out that email , he told cnntech in a twitter direct message .
i ve taken over 500 islamic state accounts .
wauchulaghost says he found the likely email associated with melania trump s handle within twenty minutes .
he said the email associated with vice president mike pence was easy to guess once you saw the redacted version : vi * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * @ gmail.com , which wauchulaghost pieced together as [ email protected ] it has since been changed , but the president and first lady s email addresses remain the same .
( and the vp account still doesn t have the extra layer of security .
) after news broke that trump had his account connected to gmail , someone on his end rapidly changed email addresses but still didn t change security features , which was kind of fun for twitter : so i 'm thinking it 's dstrumppresident2017 ( @ ) gmail ( . )

on top of that , members of his administration have already been busted using private rnc email accounts of their own , placing our nation at risk .
on top of that , trump still uses his own unsecured android phone to tweet from his personal account.how can we expect donald trump to run the country when he can t even manage his own twitter account ? featured image via getty images ( chip somodevilla ) /screengrab
