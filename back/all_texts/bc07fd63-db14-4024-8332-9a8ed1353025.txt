MADRID (Reuters) - The president of Catalonia s regional government, Carles Puigdemont, will deliver a speech at 5 p.m. (1500 GMT), his office said on Thursday.
Puigdemont is set to call a snap regional election, according to his political allies, a move that could help break a one-month deadlock between the Madrid government and separatists seeking a split from Spain.
