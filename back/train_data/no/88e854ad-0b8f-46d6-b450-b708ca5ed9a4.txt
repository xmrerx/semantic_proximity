washington ( reuters ) - u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson on friday warned other countries and groups against using lebanon as vehicle for a larger proxy fight in the middle east , saying the united states strongly backed lebanon s independence .
tillerson said he recognized saad al-hariri as lebanon s prime minister and called him a strong partner of the united states .
hariri unexpectedly resigned his post at the weekend from the saudi arabian capital of riyadh and accused iran and its lebanese ally hezbollah of sowing strife in the arab world .
his resignation thrust lebanon into the front line of a regional competition between sunni saudi arabia and shi ite iran that has also buffeted syria , iraq , yemen and bahrain .
tillerson s backing of hariri and the lebanese government contrasted sharply with the approach taken by u.s. ally saudi arabia which has lumped lebanon with hezbollah as parties hostile to it .
there is no legitimate place or role in lebanon for any foreign forces , militias or armed elements other than the legitimate security forces of the lebanese state , tillerson said in a statement .
lebanese authorities have said hariri is being held against his will in saudi arabia , a charge that riyadh has denied .
tillerson earlier said there was no indication hariri was being held in saudi arabia against his will but that washington was monitoring the situation .
tillerson s statement said there was no legitimate role in lebanon for any foreign forces , militias or armed elements - an apparent reference to hezbollah and its regional backer , iran .
but tillerson also cautioned against any party , within or outside lebanon , using lebanon as a venue for proxy conflicts or in any manner contributing to instability in that country .
