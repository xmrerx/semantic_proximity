On Friday, Donald Trump got himself amped up for CPAC by complaining about leaks, much to the surprise of at least a couple Russian prostitutes and anyone who paid attention during his campaign.
Interestingly, no longer is the information FAKE NEWS Trump, feeling the water level rising, now admits that leaks are happening in his sinking ship of the administration.
And he wants them to stop.
The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security leakers that have permeated our government for a long time, Trump tweeted.
They can t even find the leakers within the FBI itself.
Classified information is being given to media that could have a devastating effect on U.S. FIND NOW The FBI is totally unable to stop the national security "leakers" that have permeated our government for a long time.
They can't even Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2017find the leakers within the FBI itself.
Classified information is being given to media that could have a devastating effect on U.S. FIND NOW Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 24, 2017Wow, Trump seems panicked for some reason.
Could it be that his campaign had almost constant contact with members of the Russian government?
Michael Flynn s discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador that the Trump administration lied about?
The fact that The Donald literally asked Vladimir Putin and his cronies to hack his political opponents and the Russian dictator obliged?
Or is it that the FBI just told Trump to f*ck off when his team demanded that they make a public statement that would discredit any idea that he and his compatriots are lying traitors?Maybe all of the above but whatever the reason, the folks on Twitter were there to mock him for his stupidity:@realDonaldTrump getting nervous, Donnie??
Mike Denison (@mikd33) February 24, 2017@JordanUhl @realDonaldTrump what's up with this video of him freaking when asked about Russian mobster Felix Sater?

Did you hear about this DNC leak over the summer!?
You should look into that!
Evan Dashevsky (@haldash) February 24, 2017@realDonaldTrump Looks like someone is petrified of the public uncovering intel linking Russian penetration into Trump admin.
Ruwayda Mustafah (@RuwaydaMustafah) February 24, 2017@realDonaldTrump Sucks when the FBI rejects your illegal request to declare your innocence on this Russian disaster of yours.
Huh?
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) February 24, 2017@realDonaldTrump insulting the FBI and suggesting an unknown danger to our Country (as you 1st did with your illegal ban) isn't leadership.
Benjamin Byron Davis (@Tooda) February 24, 2017@realDonaldTrump BEFORE THEY PUT ME IN A JAIL.
(You forgot to add that bit) Emma Kennedy (@EmmaKennedy) February 24, 2017@realDonaldTrump Actually the FBI told the media that your team could be involved with Russia.
So they are helping Americans unlike you.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) February 24, 2017@realDonaldTrump an odd coincidence that the only thing leaked of late can be devastating to you personally.
As your employer, I'm concerned Mark Collier (@sparkycollier) February 24, 2017@realDonaldTrump So you're admitting that the information being leaked is accurate?
Interesting.

@realDonaldTrump You'd love to operate in total darkness, wouldn't you?
Second best: discredit the watchers.
We're onto you.
