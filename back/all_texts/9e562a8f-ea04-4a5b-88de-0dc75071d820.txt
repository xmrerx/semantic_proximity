I ve never done this in 22 years, I ve never recorded another journalist, but I knew it was a fraud, that it was lie, Jones said in a video posted on Twitter.
God, she was like, I want to get steaks with you, I m obsessed with you, oh my god, wiggling around in her seat.
It was all crap.
I knew it was all a lie.
I said Sandy Hook happened, and she wouldn t even put it in the promo pieces.
So we re going to release oh yeah the pre-interview.
