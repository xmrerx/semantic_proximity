trump says he s never talked to putin and the allegation that he is working with him to expose hillary s emails is ridiculous .
putin has been threatening the release of 20,000 emails from hillary s private server , and the press is trying to tie his threat to trump .
unlike previous gop presidential candidates s trump s not going to sit back and allow the press to define the narrative .
he s getting out ahead of this email lie and taking it on trump style .a popular theory explaining the attack is that the dnc hack is a russian attempt to embarrass the dnc and influence the election .
republican presidential nominee donald trump has speculated that the hack was actually a false flag operation performed by the dnc to cast aspersions on his campaign .
donald trump has a message for russia : find hillary clinton s missing emails.the republican presidential nominee , holding a wednesday press conference , said that the 30,000 missing emails from clinton s private email server would reveal some beauties and made an extraordinary plea for a foreign power to locate them .
russia , if you re listening , i hope you re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing , trump said .
