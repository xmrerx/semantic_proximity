sen. john mccain ( r-ariz. ) dug himself into a hole on meet the press when he was asked to respond to this tweet by the president.the fake news media ( failing @ nytimes , @ nbcnews , @ abc , @ cbs , @ cnn ) is not my enemy , it is the enemy of the american people !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) february 17 , 2017mccain essentially said that he in no way agrees with the president s position , and thinks an adversarial press is a natural thing .
i guess the idea of an impartial press has been taken off the table altogether.https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=1j_x0gn9bk0as you can see , mccain got a taste of what president trump has been experiencing near the end of the interview with the host attempting to twist his words.while we can admire the politician s optimism , the fact that the news media is biased doesn t go away just because you don t like the person who said it .
