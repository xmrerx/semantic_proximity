from claiming any american who speaks out against hugo chavez should be jailed , to a photo op and interview with one of the most brutal mexican drug lords in history .
sean penn has openly supported cuba s brutal dictator fidel castro , and made known his radical opposition to capitalism by supporting the former occupy movement ( now the # blacklivesmatter terrorist group ) .
despite the fact that he was a gun owner , penn came out one year ago against the second amendment.the journalistic coup of the two-time oscar winner secretly interviewing el chapo and posing for a handshake pic with the world s once-most-wanted drug lord is only the latest surreal saga in penn s personal life .
since the early 2000 s , spicoli has staked himself as one of the politically active stars in america whether or not anyone likes it.scores of people however , have called for sean penn to be arrested for meeting the world s most wanted drug lord el chapo while he was on the run and not turning him in to the authorities .
twitter users demanded penn be questioned by investigators as to why he met with the violent cartel leader and did not help the military track him down.the double oscar-winning actor and mexican actress kate del castillo who brokered the meeting with the self-confessed biggest drug trafficker in the world are now under investigation in mexico.his secret meeting with the notorious drug lord , is just one of many activist stunts by leftist actor sean penn.penn s previous diplomatic doozies have led to eye-rolling oscar jokes , dubious friendships with foreign leaders and accusations of hiring a pr team to show off his odd brand of good will.here is penn in a repulsive attempt to paint brutal dictators , hugo chavez and fidel castro as leaders we should respect .
penn says , the demonization of these people is a myth : here s a short look at penn s past political antics.as america s violent response to the 9/11 attacks started escalating in 2002 , penn spent $ 56,000 to publish an open letter in the washington post urging president bush to ease up on middle east involvement .
you lead , it seems , through a blood-lined sense of entitlement , penn wrote to the president.many others in hollywood may have found penn sentiments sensible but some of his specific recommendations , not so much.among his peacetime prescriptions for the prez : i beg you mr. president , listen to gershwin , read chapters of stegner , of saroyan .
but at least one world leader apparently agreed with penn s prose : venezuelan president hugo chavez , who used penn s letter to trash bush during some of his own speeches , according to the telegraph.the washington post apparently wasn t a big enough forum for penn s bush bashing.here s an excerpt from an interview with piers morgan where penn explains his support for a second term for barack obama in a completely incoherent manner : penn pulled off one major upset at the 2004 oscars by nabbing the best actor statue for mystic river , beating out bill murray in lost in translation as the expected winner.but the second shock came as soon as penn opened his mouth following a standing ovation .
if there s one thing that actors know other than that there were no wmd s it s that there is no such thing as best in acting , he said at the start of his speech , earning some scattered claps and cheers before beginning his long-winded thank yous.more than a decade later , his ill-timed political jab hasn t fared much better : the film site next movie cited penn s speech as one of the worst in oscar history.at first , penn defensively denied rumors that he was close with the venezuelan president , who reportedly took an interest in penn thanks to his anti-bush newspaper ads .
you don t know that i have a friendship with hugo ch vez , you just read it in some piece , he told the telegraph in 2007.watch here at the 1:12 mark , where penn talks about imposing a jail sentence on anyone who speaks out against chavez : but over the years , penn opened up about his chavez love as many others accused the president of running his country as dictator .
penn admitted a relationship and told bill maher that american journalists who slam chavez should be imprisoned.penn sealed the deal upon chavez s death from cancer in 2013 , calling the president a friend in a statement and adding : today the united states lost a friend it never knew it had .
