KHARTOUM (Reuters) - Turkey and Sudan have agreed to set up a strategic cooperation council to strengthen economic ties, their presidents said at a news conference in Khartoum on Sunday after the first visit by a Turkish leader to the African nation.
The countries hope gradually to increase bilateral trade ties to $10 billion a year from the current $500 million, and signed 12 agreements on military, economic and agricultural cooperation.
Sudan s economy has been struggling since the south seceded in 2011, taking with it three-quarters of the country s oil output.
In recent years, Turkey has boosted investments in Sudan.
