the way trump is packing in thousands of supporters at every rally in every state he visits , it s pretty clear his popularity way overshadows that of # crookedhillary .
she s barely getting enough people to fill a phone booth at her rallies !
this event , at the baptist national convention in kansas city turned out to be downright embarrassing for hillary and her campaign .
in a venue meant to hold 5,000 people , hillary only drew about 1,000 .
perhaps there just isn t a huge amount of interest with baptist church members in kansas city when it comes to spending time listening to a sociological liar workers cutting the room down by a third with lower than expected turnout for # clintonkc speech .
