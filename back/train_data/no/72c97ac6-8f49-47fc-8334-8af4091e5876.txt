the cases of fraud , money laundering and theft of american tax dollars by muslim immigrants is outrageous !
the list just keeps on growing why ?
because the punishment is just a slap on the hand and these people are never deported ! the case below is just the latest in a string of muslim immigrants who take advantage of our system : a man accused of running a welfare scam out of a portland halal grocery is pleading guilty .
the market sells meat permissible under muslim law .
according to federal court documents , ali ratib daham is pleading guilty to federal food stamp and other welfare fraud .
he is also admitting to money laundering and theft from the state s mainecare program .
daham is agreeing to a jail sentence of at least 33 months and will pay more than $ 1 million in restitution to the government .
in exchange , prosecutors are agreeing to drop dozens of other charges in the case.the plea deal will be considered in federal district court tuesday .
the guilty plea could cause him to be deported.they never deport these people , and tell me how is he going to repay $ 1 million when i ll bet the money was moved abroad a long time ago .
yes , these crooks send the money back home !
america is a global magnet for all of the goodies we give immigrants .
did you know the feds give money to these people to start a small business ?
they then screw the system and make off with millions taxpayers should be outraged !

does anyone else see how this is a joke of a sentence for a huge crime ?
how is this a deterrent when the guy gets out in 18 months ?
baltimore , maryland u.s. district judge richard d. bennett sentenced muhammad sarmad , age 41 , of nottingham , maryland , to 18 months in prison , followed by three years of supervised release , for conspiracy to commit food stamp fraud and wire fraud in connection with a scheme to illegally redeem food stamp benefits in exchange for cash .
at the sentencing on march 27 , 2017 , judge bennett also ordered that sarmad pay restitution of $ 3,550,662.sarmad , co-defendant mohammad irfan , and other family members owned and/or operated new sherwood market , 6324 sherwood road in northwood , maryland ; martin mart , 1504 martin boulevard in middle river , maryland ; rosedale mart , 6326 kenwood avenue in rosedale , maryland ; and m & a mart 7400-a belair road in baltimore .
all of the stores were authorized to accept snap , except the m & a mart .
according to their plea agreements , from october 2010 through at least july 2016 , sarmad , irfan , and their co-conspirators exchanged ebt benefits for cash , in violation of the food stamp program rules .
sarmad , irfan , and their co-conspirators typically paid half the value of the ebt benefits in cash .
to avoid detection , they often debited the funds from the card in multiple transactions over a period of hours or days , or called a different store where the transaction was processed manually .
since the m & a mart was not authorized to accept snap , sarmad or a co-conspirator would call one of the other stores to run the transaction at the other store and then hand out the cash at m & a mart.sarmad , irfan and their co-conspirators received instruction regarding the requirements and regulations of the food stamp program , including that only eligible food items could be exchanged for ebt benefits , and that a retailer may never exchange ebt benefits for cash or non-food items .
sarmad admitted that from october 2010 through august 2016 , sarmad and his co-conspirators obtained more than $ 3.5 million in payments for food sales that never occurred or were substantially inflated.in addition to sarmad and irfan , nine other retail store operators have pleaded guilty to their roles in similar schemes to illegally redeem food stamp benefits in exchange for cash , and are awaiting sentencing .
