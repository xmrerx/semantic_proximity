london ( reuters ) - british foreign minister boris johnson said on thursday he believed that libya s plans to work toward elections in 2018 were probably the right timescale .
in july , rival leaders pledged in paris to work towards elections in 2018 and a conditional ceasefire .
u.n. libya envoy ghassan salame said constitutional and electoral laws would have to be written to ensure any vote brought lasting change .
would it be premature to hold the elections within a year ?
i happen to think that could be about the right timescale , johnson told a joint news conference with visiting u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson .
it is very important however , that you don t do it too fast and that you get the political groundwork done first , he added .
there has to be a constitution , there has to be an accepted basis for those elections to take place .
