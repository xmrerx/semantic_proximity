pleading ignorance is a perfect ploy for nancy pelosi who wouldn t believe she s clueless on pretty much everything .
pelosi claims she s been busy with lots of things .
that s laughable !
this case is a big deal !
here s what the daily caller had to say about this stain on the democrats : u.s. capitol police and other agencies are probing the cyber activities of three brothers who had jobs as congressional staffers at the office of information technology for lawmakers on the house permanent select committee on intelligence , the daily caller news foundation first reported .
brothers imran , abid and jamal awan also provided their services for other democratic members in the lower chamber.when they came under suspicion by law enforcement for accessing the house network without permission last february , they were all banned from accessing it .
while some democratic lawmakers dismissed imran from their employ when the story , others , like florida democratic rep. debbie wasserman schultz kept him on.are the democrats helping these two men hide the evidence ?
