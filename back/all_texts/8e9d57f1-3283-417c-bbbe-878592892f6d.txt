As Americans we insist that no one should be targeted because of who they are, what they look like, who they love, what they worship.
(Unless of course, you re a cop or a person who enjoys white privilege ).Doesn t Mooch target privileged white people every time she has a microphone placed in front of her?
Whether speaking at a commencement speech or museum opening, Mooch doesn t miss an opportunity to point out how mistreated she and her husband, (the two-term elected President of the United States) are by dragging race into every speech.
Why is that okay?Barack Obama hosted an Iftar dinner at the White House on June 22, 2015.
He paid tribute to three Muslim students (victims killed by a white man) who were murdered in Chapel Hill, NC.
He managed to tie the recent hateful act by another young white man who killed 9 innocent black church members in Charleston, SC into his speech.
The Koran teaches that God s children should tread lightly above the earth and that when confronted with ignorance, reply peace.
Where was your peaceful muslim speech following the attempt by two muslims in Texas to commit mass murder during Pamela Gellar s free speech event?
