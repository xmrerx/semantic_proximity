vienna ( reuters ) - austria s ruling social democratic party ( spo ) is suing foreign minister sebastian kurz , the chairman of its junior coalition partner , after he accused chancellor christian kern s party of secretly accepting a 100,000 euro ( $ 119,120 ) donation .
the lawsuit marks a new low in the already strained relationship between the coalition partners , who have engaged in public squabbles for years .
polls for parliamentary elections scheduled for oct. 15 show kurz s conservative people s party ( ovp ) ahead of the spo .
the lawsuit relates to an interview shown on public broadcaster orf on monday in which kurz said industrialist hans-peter haselsteiner , a vocal supporter of the pro-business neos party , donated 100,000 euros to the spo via opaque channels .
the lawsuit filed at vienna s commercial court on friday said the spo s good reputation , economic progress and honor was damaged by kurz s comments as it implied dishonesty .
the spo wants party donations to be capped at 20,000 euros .
with a view to the upcoming parliamentary elections , there is a very concrete danger that the ( spo ) will achieve a worse result because of this accusation , the lawsuit , seen by reuters , said .
the spo said it has not been offered or received any donations from haselsteiner , who is a key shareholder of construction group strabag .
haselsteiner denied kurz s accusations in newspaper der standard .
the spo wants kurz to publicly retract his comments .
in an emailed statement , the general secretary of kurz s ovp said haselsteiner had donated money to an association that is critical of the ovp and hence indirectly supports the spo .
she said the spo should make all its donations public .
kurz s spokesman was not immediately available for comment .
