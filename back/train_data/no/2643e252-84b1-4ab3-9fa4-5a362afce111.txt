hillary clinton just made the claim that she beat president trump in the 2016 election .
the bitter and delusional clinton is a woman who can t let the loss go in a lengthy interview in new york magazine , clinton made the claim that she beat both sanders and trump in the 2016 election : i beat both of them , she said , evidently referencing her popular vote win over trump.british politician nigel evans has message for anyone , including hillary , who is in denial .
he defends donald trump and his supporters in this must-watch video !
the fact is , there were 61 million people who voted for donald trump , and when we stand up in this country and attack him , we are actually attacking the american people .
bravo !
thank you mr. evans !
