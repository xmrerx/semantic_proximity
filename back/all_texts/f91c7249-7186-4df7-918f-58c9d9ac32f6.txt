While Obama simultaneously works to take our guns away.
Sounds about right The House voted Monday to beef up White House security, including more weapons and defenses for the building and training for the Secret Service.The measure would be a helping hand after a series of scandals have left the agency responsible for protecting the president with its tail between its legs.The Secret Service Improvements Act of 2015 will provide extra training for agents, upgrade the White House s security, and increase transparency.The Secret Service has had a series of failures: multiple White House fence jumpers, including one who made it all the way into the building, and allegations that two agents drove a car into a White House barricade after drinking at a party.
Incidents in recent years involving agent misbehavior and security lapses due to performance issues prompted my colleagues and I to propose this bipartisan bill to improve the Secret Service, Democrat Rep. John Conyers said in a statement.The bill passed 365-16 and instructs the Secret Service to evaluate new defenses for the White House as well as additional weapons.
It authorizes more training and the construction of new training facilities in Beltsville, Md.The bill also addresses new problems, such as allowing the Secret Service to prepare for drone attacks after multiple drones invaded White House airspace in recent months.Via: The Daily Caller
