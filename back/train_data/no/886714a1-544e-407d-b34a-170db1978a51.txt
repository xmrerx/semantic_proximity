sydney ( reuters ) - australian police charged a 38-year-old man on friday for allegedly assaulting former prime minister and same-sex marriage opponent tony abbott in the tasmanian city of hobart .
the man was charged with common assault following an investigation into a complaint made by abbott , tasmania police said on its facebook page .
abbott told local media he was headbutted by a man wearing a yes badge in support of same-sex marriage on thursday evening .
australia began a non-compulsory postal vote this month to determine whether it becomes the 25th country to legalize same-sex marriage .
the emotionally charged campaign has seen an alarming volume of hate speech , spurring parliament to pass emergency legislation to outlaw opponents spewing their vitriol while the vote was in progress .
abbott , who is actively campaigning for the no side , sustained minor injuries from the attack including a slightly swollen lip .
police did not comment on the motivation of the attack .
earlier this month , the godson of former prime minister kevin rudd was allegedly assaulted in brisbane by a man who was tearing down rainbow flags put up in support of same-sex marriage .
in may , qantas chief executive alan joyce , who is openly gay , had a lemon meringue pie launched at his face in a protest about his advocacy for same-sex marriage .
