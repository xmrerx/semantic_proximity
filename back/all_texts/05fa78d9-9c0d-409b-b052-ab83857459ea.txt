The FBI is digging deeper into the e-mails of Hillary Clinton: The FBI is opening up a bigger can of worms and trying to interview officials who could have been e-mailed.
This is a big deal and concerns whether classified information was put out there.POLITICO reported on the full blown investigation: The FBI around early October requested documents from a company involved in the server arrangement after Clinton left State.
It also interviewed a former high-ranking policy official at State about the contents of top Clinton aides emails.
The official, who spoke to POLITICO on the condition of anonymity, said the questions explored whether anyone at State was concerned about classified information being put at risk by communicating over email.
The source did not know of any such concerns.
Confirmation of the interview and document requests is the first public indication that the agency is moving ahead with its inquiry and possibly expanding it.The former State Department official approached by the FBI was not involved with the set-up or approval of the personal email system Clinton used while she served as secretary of state, which indicates that the FBI may now be examining staff communications in addition to the security of Clinton s server.
This sounds to me like it s more than a preliminary inquiry; it sounds like a full-blown investigation, former assistant director of the FBI Tom Fuentes said.
When you have this amount of resources going into it .
I think it s at the investigative level.
When the Department of Justice seized Clinton s server in August after the inspector general of the intelligence community concluded that multiple emails contained classified information, the probe was considered preliminary.The FBI does not need to say publicly that it has escalated a preliminary investigation to a full-fledged one.
