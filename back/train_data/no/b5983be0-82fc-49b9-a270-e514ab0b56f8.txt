donald trump thinks his apology was a great success , and he just got owned on twitter for it.during a speech in north carolina on thursday , the republican nominee claimed to regret some of the things he has said during his campaign .
sometimes , in the heat of the debate and speaking on a multitude of issues , you don t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing .
i have done that , and i regret it , particularly where it may have caused personal pain .
too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues .
but , this is donald trump , so of course he backtracked on that moments later .
in this journey , i will never lie to you .
i will never tell you something i do not believe myself .
i will never put anyone s interests ahead of yours .
trump then took to twitter to tout his speech as a great success .
the reporting at the failing @ nytimes gets worse and worse by the day .
fortunately , it is a dying newspaper .
