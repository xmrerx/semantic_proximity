Donald Trump needs to stop whining before someone puts him over their knee.In addition to claiming that s he s the reason why the stock market rose after Christmas and complaining about the United Nations, Trump whined about the media because they won t call the Trump Foundation a legitimate charity.I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won t report!

100% of money goes to wonderful charities!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016The problem is that the media has extensively reported on the Trump Foundation for many years and there have been so many irregularities and ethical and legal issues surrounding the alleged charity that Twitter users immediately called Trump s claims bullshit.
@realDonaldTrump I believe the first four, it s your style, but not the last one.

@realDonaldTrump hypothetically how much is Tim Tebow s sweaty underwear worth to your foundation and in which casino would you hang them?
Zack Kopplin (@ZackKopplin) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump because it had no employees or infrastructure, you weirdo.
It was a hollow entity as far as anyone can tell.
Evan Dashevsky (@haldash) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump you are not a charity, donald Zach Holman (@holman) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump Trump has largely stopped giving money to his foundation instead uses other peoples money https://t.co/kf0Li2rzBM pic.twitter.com/pC22aQpun5 Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump Trump used $258,000 from his charity to settle legal problems (via @washingtonpost) https://t.co/Cz4hDtzNSJ Ron Pragides (@mrp) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump Trump Foundation received a $5M donation from Linda McMahon.

Drezner (@dandrezner) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump Your tweets give us a centralized place to create a reading list countering your bullshit.
