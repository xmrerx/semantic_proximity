Private jets, lots of cash, presidential suites you name it!
Unreal!Late last month an IB Times report showed that Goldman Sachs paid Bill Clinton some $200,000 for a speech ahead of an effort to lobby The State Department (then led by Hillary Clinton) on Export-Import Bank legislation tied to a $75 million purchase order from a Chinese company to a Goldman-owned aircraft manufacturer.The idea that the paid speech and the authorization of an Export-Import Bank loan to the Chinese firm were related was of course dismissed as preposterous by Goldman (draw your own conclusions) but what certainly isn t preposterous is the fact that the Clintons reap millions for speaking engagements and as you can see from the following, if you want a Clinton, a quarter-million in cash isn t all you ll need to budget for.THE FULL LIST IS HERE:Hillary Speaking FeesAs a reminder, Hillary is running for everyday Americans.
