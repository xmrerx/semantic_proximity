madrid , ( reuters ) - barcelona boss ernesto valverde declined to be drawn on friday on whether a declaration of independence by catalonia s parliament meant his side might end up being kicked out of la liga .
the spanish football league s president javier tebas was previously quoted as saying that , should catalonia become independent , the region s sides would not be able to compete in la liga .
valverde declined to comment on the possibility of that happening .
nothing has happened ( in relation to barcelona not being in la liga ) and we re only talking about hypothetical situations , he said .
i have my own opinion but i just want to concentrate on sporting questions , especially because the political situation appears to change every half hour .
in a bid to draw a line under spain s worst political crisis in 40 years , the government in madrid on friday sacked catalonia s regional government , dissolved the catalan parliament and called a snap election in the region for dec. 21 .
in what appears to be a doomed gesture , the parliament had hours earlier declared independence following a referendum on secession that spanish courts had ruled was illegal .
on the pitch , table-topping barca confirmed that midfield playmaker andres iniesta would miss saturday s visit to athletic bilbao .
the club captain , who this week was named in the fifpro team of the year , has a thigh strain and adds to a growing list of absentees for valverde that also includes ousmane dembele , rafinha , arda turan , aleix vidal and thomas vermaelen .
the news is not all negative , however , with full back jordi alba given the green light by the club s medical staff to return to action .
valverde joined barca from bilbao in the summer and will visit his former club as coach of the catalans for the first time , insisting he will not allow emotion to get the better of him .
for me it s a special game .
a lot of things link me to athletic , but tomorrow i am the opponent , he said .
