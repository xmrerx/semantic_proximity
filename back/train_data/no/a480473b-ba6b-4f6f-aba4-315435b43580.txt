geneva ( reuters ) - the syrian government s delegation returned to geneva on sunday for the resumption of talks with united nations mediator staffan de mistura after more than a week s absence , but western diplomats voiced scepticism about its willingness to engage .
bashar al-ja afari , syria s ambassador to the u.n. and chief negotiator in talks aimed at finding a political solution to end the nearly seven-year-old war , landed in a snowstorm on a flight from beirut , a reuters reporter on board said .
ja afari declined to comment .
de mistura convened an eighth round of separate talks with the government and unified opposition delegations on nov. 28 , focusing on constitutional reform as well as elections .
but ja afari arrived a day late and left after two days , saying the opposition had mined the road to the talks by insisting that president bashar al-assad could not play any interim role in syria s political transition .
de mistura told reporters last thursday that he would assess this week whether either side is trying to sabotage the process .
the opposition has been extremely constructive and willing to get down to it , a senior western diplomat said .
they are in a difficult place while being criticized internally and pressured by the fact that the regime is bombing away in eastern ghouta and other places .
the diplomat told reuters that the government s failure to return as scheduled on dec. 5 had been a clear sign of not being interested in engaging in the political process .
russian president vladimir putin has suggested holding a syrian congress in the russian city of sochi early in 2018 .
diplomats see his plan as a bid to draw a line under the war and celebrate moscow s role as the power that tipped the balance of the war and became the key player in the peace process .
