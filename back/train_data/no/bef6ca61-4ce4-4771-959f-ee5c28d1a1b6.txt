washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. senate is expected to vote at 11 a.m. edt ( 1500 gmt ) on thursday on whether to limit debate and move toward the final confirmation of president donald trump ’ s choice of federal judge neil gorsuch to take a seat on the u.s. supreme court .
democrats are expected to thwart the republican effort by denying the 60 votes needed in the 100-member chamber to advance gorsuch .
if so , republicans are expected to take the rare step of changing senate rules so that they can advance the nomination with a minimum of 51 republican votes , which would clear the way for gorsuch ’ s confirmation on friday .
