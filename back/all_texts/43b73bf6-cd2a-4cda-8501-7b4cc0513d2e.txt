WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will discuss Syria and counterterrorism when he meets with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris later this week, a White House official said on Tuesday.
Trump was invited to France to celebrate July 14 Bastille Day festivities.
During his trip, Trump and Macron will also hold a bilateral meeting and participate in a joint news conference.
“I would characterize the relationship between the two of them as being very positive,” the White House official said.
“There are some issues where we see the world a little bit differently, but many issues where we see the world more or less the same.”
