Donald trump is lonely these days.
Several prominent conservatives and other assorted right-wing loonies have decided that Trump is just a bit too insane and racist for them to associate with.
The Koch brothers, Mia Love, Mitt Romney, Jeb Bush and a rapidly growing list of figures representing the Stupid Part of America have bowed out, refusing to share a building with their nominee.Trump has trouble getting anyone to attend, let along speak at his convention.
Everyone has to make their own choice, but at this point, 70 percent of the American public doesn t like Donald Trump.
That s as toxic as we ve seen in American politics, said Stuart Stevens, a Republican strategist who was partially responsible for the 2012 GOP convention.
Normally, people want to speak at national conventions.
It launched Barack Obama s political career.
Naturally, the repulsion felt by Trump s own party is too much for comedian Bill Maher to resist.
Friday morning, Maher decided to poke a bit of fun at The Donald.
Wow # Trump cant get anyone to show up at his convention!
Maher said.
I m sure this isn t the first time he hasn t been able to make someone come.
Goodnight!
Then the denizens of Facebook joined in, having quite a bit of fun at Trump s expense: Unfortunately for Trump, they re probably all right.
Not only is the 2016 GOP nominee encountering difficulties getting people to come to his convention, he has tiny hands and tiny other stuff that he felt the need to embarrass the country by spending months offering defenses for them.
Since he is a detestable, orange, racist xenophobe with a penchant for douchebaggery, he probably didn t do the other thing either.Unfortunately, it seems like Trump is not going to be successful in unifying his party or pleasing a woman at any point in the near future.
