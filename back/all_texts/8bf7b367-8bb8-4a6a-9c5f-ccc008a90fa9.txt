Trump supporters have proven Hillary Clinton right once again.During a rally in Ashville, North Carolina on Monday, a Trump fan was filmed physically assaulting some protesters with the Republican nominee s full support as he gave the thumbs up.At the top of some bleachers, a middle-aged white guy can be seen grabbing and punching a male protester.
Security intervened, but rather than remove the Trump supporter for committing an actual crime, they kicked out the protesters instead.The man verbally harasses the group as they file out down the steps all while acting like he is some kind of tough guy and then goes as far as slapping a female protester on her way out.Here s the video via Twitter:WATCH: Man slaps several protesters as they are being escorted out of @realDonaldTrump rally in Asheville, NC.

Like the other bullies who have assaulted people during Trump rallies, he was left alone while the protesters were dealt with even though he was clearly the aggressor.At another rally earlier this year in North Carolina, a Trump supporter named John McGraw sucker-punched a black protester and then triumphantly declared to the media that he and his white buddies might have to kill the man next time.
At least McGraw was arrested, but only after the rally.And Donald Trump does nothing to stop this kind of behavior from his hooligan supporters.
He cheers them on and congratulates them.
It seems like he is proud of his supporters for beating up people who don t agree with him.This is how violence finds its way into politics, and Trump has done nothing but allow it to escalate.
Not too long ago, Trump suggested that gun owners do something to stop Hillary Clinton from selecting Supreme Court nominees.
And on Saturday, Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin called for a bloody rebellion if Hillary wins in November.Clearly, Hillary Clinton was right to call Trump s supporters deplorable.Featured image via screen capture
