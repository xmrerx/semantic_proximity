cairo ( reuters ) - president abdel fattah al-sisi has said that egypt is not considering taking any measures against hezbollah despite saudi arabia s call for sanctions against the lebanese shi ite political and military group .
saudi arabia , main backer of egypt , has said hezbollah should be disarmed and kept out of the lebanese government .
the subject is not about taking on or not taking on , the subject is about the status of the fragile stability in the region in light of the unrest facing the region , sisi told cnbc in an interview when asked if egypt would consider its own measures against hezbollah .
the region can not support more turmoil , he said .
riyadh blames hezbollah for the resignation of lebanon s preeminent sunni politician , accusing it of hijacking lebanese politics .
but saudi arabia is also criticized lebanon as a whole , saying it too has declared war on the kingdom .
the resignation on saturday of saudi-allied lebanese prime minister saad al-hariri , announced from riyadh and blamed on iran and hezbollah , is seen by many as the first step in a saudi intervention in lebanese politics .
sisi told lebanon s speaker of parliament on sunday egypt is opposed to any interference in lebanon s internal affairs .
the president expressed egypt s interest in preserving security and stability in lebanon ... and affirmed the importance of avoiding all forms of sectarian and religious tensions or violence , and its opposition to attempted interference in lebanon s internal affairs , sisi s office said in a statement after he met speaker nabih berri in cairo .
it s up to the lebanese to reach the political settlement of their choice , the statement said .
sisi came to power when as military commander he led the overthrow of former president mohamed mursi of the muslim brotherhood in 2013 following mass protests .
saudi arabia backed the move and subsequently showered egypt with aid .
