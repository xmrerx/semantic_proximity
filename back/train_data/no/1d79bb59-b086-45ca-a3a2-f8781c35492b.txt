zurich ( reuters ) - more than one in three swiss feel uncomfortable around people perceived to be different because of their nationality , religion , skin color or other factors , a government survey found .
the poll released on tuesday sought for the first time to gauge how people coexist in a country of 8.4 million residents , a quarter of them foreigners .
thirty-six percent said they felt uneasy in the presence of people they found outside the norm , particularly those who spoke a foreign language , or moved around .
it did not give more details on the last category , but roma and other itinerant groups have complained of discrimination in the mountainous state that has stayed outside the european union .
sixteen percent of respondents went further and said they felt threatened by foreigners .
despite that , most were in favor of granting more rights to foreign nationals , the poll discovered .
two out of three said racism was a key social problem , and 56 percent believed the integration of migrants was working well .
with four national languages and a decentralized system of government , traditionally christian switzerland is increasingly diverse .
there are more than 10 main religious communities in a population made up of people with roots in 190 other countries .
right-wing parties have stoked anti-foreigner sentiment , pushing for a series of measures including a ban on the construction of new minarets on mosques that became law in 2009 .
but parliament last year watered down demands in a 2014 referendum to impose quotas on immigration from the european union , the bloc that surrounds it and provides most of its trade .
