Ever since former House Speaker John Boehner aired out his true feelings about Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz, everyone has been having a field day and running with it.It all started on Wednesday, when John Boehner was asked about the 2016 election during a forum at Stanford University.
It just so happened that Cruz s name came up in the discussion, and Boehner couldn t hold back his disgust for his fellow conservative.
Referring to Cruz as Lucifer in the flesh, Boehner mocked the Texas senator: I have Democrat friends and Republican friends.
I get along with almost everyone, but I have never worked with a more miserable son of a bitch in my life.
This is a thought that many Republicans would actually agree with, as it s been well-documented that Cruz is one of the least-liked politicians with several of those opinions coming from within the GOP.
This fact only gets proven time and time again.On Thursday, the White House hilariously failed to come to Cruz s defense during a daily briefing, clearly amused by the Republicans in-party fighting.
The room broke out in giggles when CNN s Michelle Kosinski asked Press Secretary John Earnest if he felt Obama would agree with Boehner s Lucifer comment, and whether those remarks were appropriate or not.Earnest, trying to hold back laughter, suggested that Boehner was just trying to be as truthful as possible.
Earnest was barely able to keep a straight face as he replied: Obviously, Speaker Boehner was speaking based on his own experience.
I don t know that he was looking to be helpful or harmful, I think he was just looking to be honest about his own view.
Weighing in on whether Boehner s comments had crossed a line, Earnest simply said that if Kosinski was looking for somebody to come to the defense of one Republican who s being attacked by another, you should probably ask somebody else.
