you just can t make this stuff up !
does anyone else see the huge irony in this ? a marxist student group at swarthmore college disbanded itself earlier this year after realizing that its members were too rich and too white to be real commies.according to screenshots confidentially provided to campus reform by an individual with access to the group s private facebook page , the demise of the swarthmore anti-capitalist collective ( sacc ) came in the wake of a farewell letter from a member who had decided the group could never be an effective proponent of unproblematized anticapitalist politics due to its history of abuse , racism , and even classism .
from my understanding sacc disbanded because they realized the makeup and tactics of their group was at odds with their espoused principles , swarthmore conservative society president gilbert guerra told campus reform .
their main support base was middle-upper class white kids who enjoy jogging .
the farewell letter corroborates guerra s understanding , asserting that sacc s fundamental failure was that at its formation , it was made up of entirely white , with the exception of one person of color * , students , and to make matters worse , not one of [ the founding members ] are from low-income and/or working class backgrounds .
arguing that low-income people of color should never be an afterthought in a group whose politics supposedly focus on their liberation , the author then went on to accuse sacc of having a history of abuse , racism , and even classism that was never adequately addressed or recognized despite constantly being brought up as an issue .
