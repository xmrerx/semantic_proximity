WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The World Bank on Tuesday approved $400 million in additional funding to help rebuild services to Iraqi areas recaptured from Islamic State militants after a three-year military campaign, the global development bank said.
The World Bank also said it would fund studies on how to involve the private sector in the reconstruction of Mosul s airport and restoring public transport terminals as well as parts of the railway network.
The package represents an additional financing to the Iraq Emergency Operation for Development Project ($350 million) approved back in July 2015 and already underway in seven cities in Diyala and Salah Ad-Din governorates, the World Bank said in a statement.
It said the new funding would focus on rebuilding in five sectors - water and sanitation, electricity, health, transport and municipal services.
The funds will also help with the restoration and preservation of cultural heritage sites in Mosul s Old City, which was heavily damaged by fighting.
Iraqi government forces, backed by a U.S.-led coalition, retook Mosul in May - by far the largest city to fall under militants control - after nearly nine months of urban warfare.
Iraqi government officials have estimated it will take at least five years and billions of dollars to rebuild Mosul.
