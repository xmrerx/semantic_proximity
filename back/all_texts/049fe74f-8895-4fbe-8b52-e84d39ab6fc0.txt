As the Republican Party establishment continues to ratchet up its support of Ted Cruz and his campaign in order to stop Donald Trump from capturing the party s presidential nomination, a backlash appears to be growing amongst Trump supporters.One Trump fan took to YouTube to reveal his anger at the establishment s machinations:According to the video s description, the man is a Republican Party State Delegate in Colorado, and he burned his party registration card in protest of the recent party event because he was removed from his position because he voted for TRUMP.
The video is in response to the recent event in that state where Cruz was able to engineer a maneuver where he got all the delegates available.
Cruz took all 13 of the delegates up for grabs on Saturday to complete a clean sweep of the state.
Delegates endorsed by his campaign swept all seven congressional district conventions held over the last week as well, which added another 21 delegates.
Another three slots are reserved for state party officials.
Today was another resounding victory for conservatives, Republicans, and Americans who care about the future of our country, the Cruz campaign said in a statement Saturday night.Trump was completely out hustled at the event, and repeating that campaign s habit of being ill-prepared, handed out incorrect fliers and forms advising their supporters how to get through the delegate process.In response to the effort to deny Trump the nomination on the first ballot at the Republican Convention, where he is required to have 1,237 delegates in support, Trump ally and professional Republican dirty trickster Roger Stone recently announced that in cooperation with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones, he plans to hold rallies in Cleveland during the convention.
Stone also said he was encouraging Trump supporters to go to the private hotel rooms of delegates in order to intimidate them into backing Trump.Despite the theatrics, Trump still has a nearly 200 delegate lead over Cruz.
Trump has 743 delegates, Cruz has 545, and John Kasich has 143.
Trump is expected to do very well in the upcoming Republican primary in his home state of New York.Featured image via YouTube
