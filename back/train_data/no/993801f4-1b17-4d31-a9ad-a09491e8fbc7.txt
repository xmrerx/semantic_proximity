zurich ( reuters ) - switzerland has stripped a libyan muslim preacher of his refugee status nearly two decades after he won it following a media firestorm over his sermons that some have branded hate speech .
the man who goes by the name of abu ramadan has been in the headlines since a zurich newspaper branded him a islamist who incited hate in his sermons while living off more than 600,000 swiss francs ( $ 618,000 ) in social benefits .
the 64-year-old preacher denied the hate speech allegations , saying his remarks were poorly translated from arabic .
in a ruling released on friday , the federal administrative court said immigration officials had been right to revoke ramadan s asylum after finding he had kept a libyan passport and gone home a dozen times , most recently for more than a month this year .
the ruling is final and can not be appealed but separate hearings will have to decide if the man can stay in switzerland .
the preacher has told swiss media he was unaware he could not travel to his homeland as a refugee and wanted to see his 93-year-old mother .
