With the release of the 2005 Access Hollywood tape revealing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump saying lewd remarks that revealed him to be a sexual predator, there hasn t been anyone capable of defending him.However, now, in an interview with Anderson Cooper on CNN, Melania Trump is coming to her husband s defense and seemingly blaming Billy Bush, the other man on the Access Hollywood tape.According to Melania, Bush egged Trump on.
Although, if you listen to the tapes it was clearly the other way around.Melania told Cooper: I said to my husband that, you know, the language was inappropriate.
It s not acceptable.
And I was surprised, because that is not the man that I know.
She also said, now making excuses for his horrific behavior: And as you can see from the tape, the cameras were not on it was only a mic.
And I wonder if they even knew that the mic was on.
Then when asked if she s ever heard her husband speak like that, she said: No.
No, that s why I was surprised, because I said like I don t know that person that would talk that way, and that he would say that kind of stuff in private.
Melania seems to either be in complete denial that her husband does, in fact, speak that way, or she s been instructed by her husband and his campaign to shift blame to Billy Bush and away from Donald.
Either way, it s very, very bizarre.In a statement after the tapes were released, Melania had said: The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me.
But now she s making excuses for them.
Who knows what the hell is going on, really?
Yet, what we do know is that Donald Trump said those horrific remarks and needs to be kept as far away from the Oval Office as possible.Watch the video here:Melania thinks Billy egged on Trump into saying dirty and bad stuff, like these two are school boys at recess.
