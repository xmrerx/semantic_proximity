( reuters ) - the interior department ’ s bureau of land management on friday announced its plans to update 30-year-old rules for oil and gas production on federal land to limit the “ wasteful release ” of natural gas and curb methane emissions .
the effort is part of president barack obama ’ s broader climate change strategy based on executive actions , which includes a goal to reduce oil and gas sector methane emissions by up to 45 percent from 2012 levels by 2025 .
the rule also comes one week after the agency announced its first major review of the country ’ s coal program in three decades , including a pause on issuing coal-mining leases on federal land .
“ by asking operators to take simple , common-sense actions to reduce waste , like swapping out old equipment and checking for leaks , we expect to cut this waste almost in half , ” blm director neil kornze said .
between 2009 and 2014 , oil and gas producers on public and indian lands vented , flared and leaked about 375 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of natural gas , the equivalent supply for about 5.1 million households for a year , the blm said .
