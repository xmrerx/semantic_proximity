most leaders , when they give statements on atrocities happening elsewhere in the world , use the opportunity to condemn those atrocities and pledge some kind of help or solidarity .
not trump .
as he has done in the past , he used a devastating attack in syria as an opportunity to slam his imaginary enemies in this case , president obama .
when he was done with that , he decided to tack a condemnation onto his statement .
the whole thing reads : trump statement on syria chemical attack brings up obama s red line pic.twitter.com/wul3gpeyco bradd jaffy ( @ braddjaffy ) april 4 , 2017the problem is that trump repeatedly urged obama not to engage in syria at all .
he said obama should focus on our many problems , on our country , and forget syria .
he said things of this nature at least four times : president obama , do not attack syria .
there is no upside and tremendous downside .
save your powder for another ( and more important ) day !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) september 7 , 2013if syria was forced to use obamacare they would self-destruct without a shot being fired .
obama should sell them that idea !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) september 6 , 2013obama must now start focusing on our country , jobs , healthcare and all of our many problems .
forget syria and make america great again !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) september 11 , 2013again , to our very foolish leader , do not attack syria if you do many very bad things will happen & from that fight the u.s. gets nothing !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) september 5 , 2013so what was obama supposed to have done ?
attack and cause a problem , or not attack and cause a problem ?
twitter s having a field day with this : @ braddjaffy trump mentions the red line .
well guess what @ realdonaldtrump , you re in charge now .
you get to do something about it .
or not .
choose wisely lawhawk ( @ lawhawk ) april 4 , 2017 @ braddjaffy does trump even realize that he is actually the president now ?
trumpstaxes ( @ trumpstaxes ) april 4 , 2017 @ mikemayoral @ braddjaffy yeah i just don t know how bad this exposure is and he just pretends he didn t say this lol .
used to be a day where you owned up to things ti dog true 4k ( @ beastfiretimdog ) april 4 , 2017 @ braddjaffy kind of makes you wonder whether trump was in cahoots w/ russia back in 2013 .
scott ( @ moodonthepitch ) april 4 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump this didn t age well andrea ( @ catlady_andrea ) april 4 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump # thisdidntagewell bob kennedy ( @ rfkjunior ) april 4 , 2017 @ braddjaffy that was before he told us that he knew more than the generals .
he was correct being wrong because he hadn t known he knew more @ the time .
ted hogbin ( @ tedomega ) april 4 , 2017 @ braddjaffy @ ktumulty how do u spell flip flop james baxter ( @ jamesbaxt ) april 4 , 2017no , trump s tweets do not age well in a lot of cases .
a foolish leader called a previous leader foolish for wanting to go into syria , and then blames his lack of action there for today s attack .
