please listen to this incredibly offensive commercial from josh gottheimer who attacks his opponent for being divisive by attacking another state and demeaning everyone in alabama as a racist .
on a personal note , i m from georgia and find that people from the south are stereotyped like crazy !
how offensive is this ?
the people of new jersey should send this goofball packing for his idiotic commercial !
gottheimer was a former speechwriter for bill clinton which explains everything !
