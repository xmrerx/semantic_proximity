columbia , s.c. ( reuters ) - republican presidential candidate jeb bush said on saturday he was suspending his campaign after a disappointing finish in the south carolina primary .
bush , who also fared poorly in earlier contests in iowa and new hampshire , said the race had been “ hard fought ” but that voters of those three states had spoken .
in what appeared to be a jab at republican frontrunner donald trump , whom bush has accused of lacking ideas , the former florida governor said , “ ideas matter , policy matters. ” bush , the son of former president george h.w .
bush and brother to former president george w. bush , entered the 2016 campaign as the favorite , but was unable to convert a sizable fundraising advantage into success at the polls .
