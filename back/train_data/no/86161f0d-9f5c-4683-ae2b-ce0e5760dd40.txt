get off my fracking land ! an irate farmer sprayed raw sewage at oscar winning star emma thompson and her sister sophie after they flouted a court injunction protecting a fracking site.the stars were filming a great british bake off parody for greenpeace when the owner of the field they trespassed on drove his muck spreader in circles around the demonstrators .
a group of protesters were hit by the manure but the actresses remained dry in their tent , complete with bake off-inspired bunting.police were also called and also spoke to the actresses , who climbed over a gate and set up camp on land earmarked for gas exploration in fylde , lancashire.emma and sophie , who won celebrity masterchef , filmed a pastiche episode of the great british bake off called frack free bake off to voice their opposition to the fracking plans .
but this afternoon the landowner , who leases the contested patch of land to fracking company cuadrilla , drove his muck spreader in circles around the demonstrating group.after a couple of circles around the group , who were shouting for him to stop it , the farmer drove off.protesters are banned from the site , near preston , after company cuadrilla applied for an injunction in 2014 .
it is not clear if the fracking company will now take civil action but it appears unlikely .
