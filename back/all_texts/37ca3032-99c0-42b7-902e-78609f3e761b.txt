And now a message of peace and unity from one of our neighbors to the South: We, Mexicans, have to kill Donald J. Trump before he becomes President.
He is a threat to every single one of us.
There are many Mexican Americans living in the U.S. right now and I m asking them to kill Donald Trump before he becomes President.
The one in Mexico who have the means, I m asking you to cross the border and go and kill Donald Trump, and as many of his supporters as possible.
Anywhere he goes just try to bomb the place, shoot up the place, do something.
B..b but he looked like such a nice boy.
Don t call him illegal he just wanted a better life he s just a victim This punk isn t the only one threatening the life of Trump.
Watch this video that exposes the truth about how the media ignores these threats:
