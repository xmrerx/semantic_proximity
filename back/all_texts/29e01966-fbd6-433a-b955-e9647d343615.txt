Is The Donald really this oblivious to the entire world?
And history?
And, well, everything?
Two and a half months after embarrassing himself by implying that Frederick Douglass was still alive, he embarrasses himself by dropping the name of yet another famous person who has passed away Luciano Pavarotti.
He didn t just imply that Pavarotti is still living today (he died of pancreatic cancer ten years ago).
While he and Italy s prime minister held a joint press conference, he must have decided to praise Italy for the gift of Pavarotti (or rather, he decided to use Pavarotti to puff himself up and appear more superior) by saying: Pavarotti, friend of mine, great friend of mine.
First off, as stated before, Pavarotti is no longer gracing the world with his amazing tenor voice.
Twitter made a point of reminding Trump of that:@kylegriffin1 @colattesipper @MSNBC Which is when I wish that Trump had died, instead of Pavarotti.
Since at least Pavarotti could sing, and Trump can t do anything ..sad!

Maybe he ll invite Pavarotti and Frederick Douglass to attend a WH dinner.
Gail Stein (@gailstein) April 20, 2017@kylegriffin1 @jefferyrhenry @MSNBC Is Trump inviting Frederick Douglass and Pavarotti for unbelievable chocolate cake?
Leticia (@ColinLeti) April 20, 2017@ALT_uscis We re still at zero for the number of days he hasn t been an embarrassment to this country.

Anybody s Guess (@boxcarbrenda) April 20, 2017@kylegriffin1 @MSNBC Since Trump and Pavarotti are such great friends I m sure he ll be saddened to hear of his passing #LobCitySoldier (@RealAnthony14) April 20, 2017Trump & Pavarotti were great friends.
They d get together & wear each other s sports bras.
Good DAY, Sir!
(@xISaidGoodDAY) April 20, 2017Little known fact: Trump still gets together every weekend with Joe Paterno and Luciano Pavarotti for Trump s Little Italy club.
https://t.co/h5z6faw64l Joe Bob #721 (@JHowieJr) April 20, 2017Trump should have asked Pavarotti to sing at his inauguration.
William Peace ??
(@WilliamPeace81) April 20, 2017@sddphoto @ntned I know who Pavarotti is, but I don t know why Trump thinks he is still alive.
sara caudell (@CaudellSara) April 20, 2017Don t worry, guys.
Pavarotti told Marcello Mastroianni we should keep acting as if Trump s normal, and Marcello told me.
Suzanne Munshower (@expatina) April 20, 2017@IMPL0RABLE @teka21bat Trump s presser with Italian PM is so cringe worthy, his good friend Pavarotti can t even stand to watch it.
(((Shelley Rivlin))) (@srivlin) April 20, 2017But it s also not likely that Pavarotti was any friend of Trump s at all.
Trump repeatedly used a recording of him singing Puccini s Nessun Dorma during his campaign, and his family asked Trump to stop.
Nessun Dorma means None Shall Sleep, and Pavarotti s rendition has a climax where he sings Vincero three times, which means I will win.
We all know how Trump likes to win.
The family issued a statement that said: As members of his immediate family, we would like to recall that the values of brotherhood and solidarity which Luciano Pavarotti expressed throughout the course of his artistic career are entirely incompatible with the world view offered by the candidate Donald Trump.
Trump may well have met Pavarotti at some point, but one would think that, if they had been great friends, he would have at least been able to act like he knew Pavarotti was gone.
The family may also have taken that into account regarding the use of Pavarotti s aria at rallies if it were true.So not only did he again demonstrate that he doesn t know a damn thing about anything that goes on, and he likely lied about being great friends with that man.
Pavarotti was a great man.
Trump is an insecure, pathetic fraction of a man.Watch below:Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images
