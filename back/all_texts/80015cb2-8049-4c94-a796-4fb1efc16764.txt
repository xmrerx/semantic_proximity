The South lost the Civil War but some white guys still refuse to let go of the Confederate flag and think it s okay to threaten black people with lynching.That s what white asshole Rodney Blomberg and three of his buddies did last month when they approached a black man living in their neighborhood near Eugene, Oregon.They drove up in two vehicles with a Confederate flag attached to the truck and literally bullied a black man simply because they didn t want him living there.According to KEZI, the men hurled racial epithets at him and threatened to lynch him.
We hang black people in these parts, Blomberg reportedly said.Law enforcement later arrested Blomberg and put his racist ass in jail.
But he is out after paying his $2,000 bond.
He is being charged with second-degree intimidation and faces another court appearance later this year.Here s the video via KEZI:This kind of racism no longer belongs in our society.
And the Confederate flag should no longer be flown anywhere on American soil.
It is a flag of racists as Blomberg perfectly demonstrates.People like Blomberg are a serious threat to public safety in this country, especially since conservatives across the country are inciting violence against Black Lives Matter in the wake of five Dallas police officers being shot and killed earlier this month, even though the killer was unaffiliated with the organization.The Confederate flag has been controversial for years but the controversy reached fever-pitch last year after Dylann Roof murdered nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina in a mass shooting that rocked the country and caused a national outcry because South Carolina continued to fly the Confederate flag outside the statehouse.
It was soon taken down after decades because Roof was a big fan of the Confederate flag.And just like the Confederate flag should be taken down, racism needs to be taken down as well.Featured Image: Screenshot
