tripoli ( reuters ) - gunmen fatally shot the mayor of libya s third-largest city , misrata , late on sunday , ambushing his car inside the city , security officials said .
the north african oil producer has been in chaos since the 2011 uprising that unseated muammar gaddafi , but misrata , libya s biggest port , had been relative peaceful until now .
gunmen chased the car of mayor mohamed eshtewi after he left misrata airport following his arrival on a plane from turkey , a security official said , adding it was unclear who was behind it .
in october , a bomb exploded at the city s court , killing about four people and wounding 40 others in an attack claimed by islamic state .
misrata , almost 200 km ( 125 miles ) east of tripoli , is the gateway for food and other imports into libya and the country s only tax-free zone .
it is one of the few places still frequented by foreign business people fearing poor security elsewhere .
