Have a listen and I know you ll be shaking your head like I was:Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx told a crowd in North Carolina Tuesday that only 49% of low-income neighborhoods have sidewalks while more affluent areas have near 90%.
In order to have a society where everyone has a shot at the American Dream, than it s imperative that we acknowledge these challenges.
Foxx made the comments to the Charlotte Rotary Club where he discussed the ways that infrastructure should connect people to opportunity.During his speech, Foxx referenced a map of Atlanta that showed areas of pedestrian and bicycle accidents.
The grey areas represent communities of concentrated poverty.
This is representative of what s occurring nationally, which is not surprising, because only 49% of low-income neighborhoods have sidewalks.
In high-income areas the number is closer to 90%.
So, if we want a society in which everyone has a shot at the American dream, than it is imperative that we acknowledge these challenges, Foxx said.
