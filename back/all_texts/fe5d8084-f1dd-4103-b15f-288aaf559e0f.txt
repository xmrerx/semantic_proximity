(Reuters) - A hack at global accounting firm Deloitte [DLTE.UL] disclosed in September compromised a server with emails of some 350 clients, including U.S. government agencies and large corporations, the Guardian reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources.
Deloitte disputed the story, saying very few clients were affected in a statement emailed to Reuters.
We take any attack on our systems very seriously, the statement said.
We are confident that we know what information was targeted and what the hacker actually did.
