toronto ( reuters ) - canada will expel a venezuelan diplomat and also bar the country s ambassador from returning , foreign minister chrystia freeland said on monday , two days after venezuela booted out canada s envoy for criticizing its rights record .
western nations and latin american neighbors have been increasingly critical of venezuelan president nicolas maduro this year , accusing him of stamping on democracy and human rights .
venezuela says foreign governments are trying to encourage a right-wing coup .
on saturday , it also expelled the brazilian envoy .
venezuela had already withdrawn its ambassador to canada in protest over sanctions against the maduro regime that canada imposed in september .
in a statement , freeland said the ambassador was no longer welcome in canada and that venezuela s charge d affaires is persona non grata .
venezuela s expulsion of the canadian diplomat over the weekend , she said , was typical of the maduro regime , which has consistently undermined all efforts to restore democracy and to help the venezuelan people .
canadians will not stand by as the government of venezuela robs its people of their fundamental democratic and human rights , and denies them access to basic humanitarian assistance , she said in the statement .
canada in september , following a similar move by the united states , imposed targeted sanctions against 40 venezuelan senior officials , including maduro , to punish them for anti-democratic behavior .
the ministers of defense and the interior as well as several supreme court judges were also among those targeted by the measures .
canada is a member of the 12-nation lima group , which is trying to address the venezuelan crisis and which next meets in chile in january .
