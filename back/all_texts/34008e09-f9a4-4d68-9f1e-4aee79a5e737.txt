Amid news of the Russian scandal and Congress dystopian agenda, one fact keeps staring the American people right in the eye and Republicans are choosing to ignore it.
Donald Trump is mentally unfit to be President.
There s even a movement beginning in Congress that would invoke the 25th Amendment to the Constitution to declare Trump mentally unfit and remove him from office.
A video of Trump wandering off of Air Force One and away from his limo won t help his cause.In the video, Trump is seen exiting the airplane, and despite the fact that the limo is adorned with American flags, and despite the fact that it s parked right at the bottom of the steps he just descended, Trump wandered right by and his Secret Service agents had to wrangle the visibly confused 45 back.Here s the video:Twitter users are genuinely concerned that this man is in charge of the country:I swear to God Trump is sundowning.
Here he is, confused, wandering away from his limo.
He had to be redirected.#25thAmendmentNow pic.twitter.com/0ZZOMTMd1k Holly O Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) July 4, 2017Trump was furious when Twitter called him incompetent.
UPDATE: He just got lost walking from his plane to his limo https://t.co/d7zlw0iwiJ The Daily Edge (@TheDailyEdge) July 5, 2017It s comforting that Trump also sees a limo with the presidential seal and thinks, That can t possibly be for Donald Trump.

Here he is, lost and confused, searching for his limo that was right in front of him.

How could anyone miss a limo the size of a tank?
That s incredible.
Something has to be wrong with Trump.

She had the flu.
What s his excuse for this lack of awareness?

Sure, Trump wandered away from his limo but it s not like he has a history of this kinda thing.

Trump is a man of great, sometimes debilitating and self-destructive pride, which is why he s so horrible at his current job.
If videos like this keep surfacing, Trump may resign just to save himself the inevitable humiliation of mental deterioration.
It s also important to note that Trump s father had Alzheimer s.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
