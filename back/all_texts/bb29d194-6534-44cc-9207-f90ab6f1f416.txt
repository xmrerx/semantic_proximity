In the last debate, Trump had to answer for the allegations that he d sexually assaulted women, which came out on tape courtesy of David Farenthold at the Washington Post.
He was just asked about it again, and now, not only are all these allegations false, according to The Donald, but Hillary is behind all of it.He thinks Hillary and her campaign are the reason that he s now called a sexual predator.No, really.
We are not even kidding.
He said that during tonight s debate: First of all, the stories have been largely debunked.
Those people, I don t know those people.
I have a feeling how they came I believe it was her campaign that did it.
Did what?
Hillary contacted all of them, coerced them into accusing Trump of sexual assault, and then put it under a spotlight?
Is that what he s saying?He would, no doubt, say no.
However, he also claims that Hillary and Obama paid people to cause violence at his rallies: They hired people.
They paid them fifteen hundred dollars and they re on tape saying be violent cause fights do bad things.
Really?
He extended that to Hillary, and now he seriously thinks Hillary planted people to accuse him of sexual assault to bolster her campaign.
With that nonsense, there s no way to believe anything he says about his victims.Six witnesses from People just came forward, saying they know that Natasha Stoynoff s story is true.
He s on tape saying that he kisses beautiful women without waiting for them to consent.
He said, Grab them by the pussy.
Whatever, when talking about how women let him do whatever he wants because he s a star.And Hillary s responsible for him being branded a sexual predator?
