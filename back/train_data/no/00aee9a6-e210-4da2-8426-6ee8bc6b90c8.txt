port-au-prince ( reuters ) - u.s .
homeland security secretary john kelly on wednesday said he was open to discussing letting more than 50,000 victims of haiti ’ s 2010 earthquake stay in the united states past next january .
kelly met with haitian president jovenel moise during a brief visit to the island and he defended the u.s. decision earlier this month to extend a deadline for temporary protection from deportation for haitians for six months that was set to expire in july .
“ it is not meant to be an open-ended law but a temporary law , ” kelly told journalists .
“ it has been seven years since the earthquake , which was the reason tps ( temporary protected status ) was implemented .
i have committed to the president and the government that we can work together to go forward on any future extensions. ” a 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck near haiti ’ s capital of port-au-prince in january 2010 , killing some 200,000 people .
immigration activists said the extension did not take into account the damage created by hurricane matthew , which killed an estimated 1,000 people when it struck the caribbean nation last year .
some aid groups warned mass deportations could unsettle the country that has long history of political instability .
kelly dismissed critics who said his visit was too short to develop a proper idea of haiti ’ s situation , saying that he visited the country “ no less than 10 , maybe 15 times ” while he was based in miami as the head of u.s. southern command .
“ i would say to people who made those statements , well , they don ’ t know what they ’ re talking about , ” kelly said .
under u.s. law , the department of homeland security can award temporary protected status to citizens of nations devastated by violence , disease or natural disasters .
sudan , somalia , syria , el salvador , nepal and yemen all have been designated for temporary protected status .
