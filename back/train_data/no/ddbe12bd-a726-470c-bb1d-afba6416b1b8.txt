and once again , the snowflakes want to erase parts of history they know nothing about .
and what s more , they attack and penalize those who try to defend it.this week , an atlanta judge was suspended upon posting his thoughts about confederate monuments and so called anti-fascist protesters on facebook .
judge james hinkle wrote , it looks like all of the snowflakes have no concept of history .
it is what it is .
get over it and move on .
he went on to add , the nut cases tearing down monuments are equivalent to isis destroying history .
isis and antifa below- both hate america and deal with conflict by using violence and destruction.he noted that , confederate monuments in virginia have the rear ends of horses facing north .
following these posts , hinkle was told by gwinnett county s chief magistrate that he was suspended .
chief judge kristina blum released the following statement : i have made it clear to all of our judges to conduct themselves in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity , impartiality , and fairness of the judiciary .
i consider any violation of those principles and policies to be a matter of utmost concern .
hinkle , who also served as the mayor of grayson for over twenty years , previously made his views well known on social media when he posted he was proud to be a deplorable infidel .
while many have been calling for his permanent removal , hinkle has stated that he did not see what he did wrong .
but you know , he went on to say , with the way things are going in the world today , i guess everything s controversial .
judge hinkle resigned after telling the truth and being punished for it .
