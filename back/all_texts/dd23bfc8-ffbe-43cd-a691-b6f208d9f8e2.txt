ANKARA (Reuters) - Germany has no right to block a planned update of Turkey s customs union with the European Union, Turkish Economy Minister Nihat Zeybekci said on Thursday, touching on a simmering row between Ankara and Berlin.
Last week German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she did not think it was appropriate to carry out further discussions with Ankara about the customs union.
Speaking to reporters in Ankara, Zeybekci said there were no problems in Turkey s accession negotiations with the EU and that the process continued.
