This proves the need for a recount in Michigan.Donald Trump s team knowingly hired a man who committed election fraud in 2012 when they allowed Brandon Hall to work for the campaign in 2016.On Wednesday, the 27-year-old Trump supporter was convicted on ten counts of felony election fraud stemming from Hall s effort to help elect judicial candidate Chris Houtaling by forging signatures on a petition.
Hall now faces up to five years in prison.The fact that Trump had a person on his team who has committed election fraud in the past spells out the need for a statewide recount and investigation to determine whether election fraud helped Trump win the state s 16 electoral votes.
Donald Trump has made claim after claim calling the integrity of the election into question, but his Michigan campaign had no problem hiring a staff member facing election law charges, Progress Michigan executive director Lonnie Scott said in a statement.
The fact that the Trump campaign and the Michigan Republican Party embraced Brandon Hall is just one more reason to recount and audit the vote in Michigan.
Indeed, Michigan and federal authorities should start an immediate investigation and the Michigan state elections board should order a recount.This election is too important to the future of our nation to ignore the fact that Trump s team included a staffer who committed election fraud.
It also calls into question Trump s ability to actually hire the best people for top jobs in our government, something he has already repeatedly proven that he is incapable of doing.For months, Trump claimed that the election is rigged but the fact is that his campaign hired a person who had prior experience at trying to rig elections.If Trump truly cares about election integrity, he will support a recount.
And if he fights the effort, it only signals that there may be something he doesn t want election officials to discover.Featured Image: Zach Gibson/Getty Images
