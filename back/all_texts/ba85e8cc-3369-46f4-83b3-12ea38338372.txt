BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian Finance Minister Henrique Meirelles said on Monday he would consider his chances of winning before deciding whether to run as a candidate in next year s presidential elections.
Meirelles, who has spearheaded President Michel Temer s unpopular reform platform, has polled in low single digits in recent surveys.
Still, he said current polls do not give a realistic picture of what would happen once the campaign debate unfolds.
