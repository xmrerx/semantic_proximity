donald trump s former mar-a-lago butler backed up the republican nominee for president in denying the billionaire groped a reporter from people magazine .
no , that never happened .
come on , that s just bull crap , said anthony tony senecal.people magazine writer natasha stoynoff wrote an essay this week about how she was groped by trump at mar-a-lago during an interview in the early 2000s .
she is one of four women to make accusations against trump of unwanted sexual advances.the issue has become central to the presidential race since a 2005 hot-mic video surfaced of trump bragging about using his celebrity to grope women .
he has downplayed the incident as locker-room talk .
trump , at his rally in west palm beach on thursday , said he was always in a public place with stoynoff and denied he ever acted inappropriately .
look at her , trump said , apparently referencing the reporter s appearance .
look at her words .
tell me what you think .
i don t think so .
senecal , 85 , said he never saw trump putting the moves on any women at mar-a-lago even when his boss wasn t married .
everybody is just jumping on the train , he said .
i think you re going to see even more of it between now and the election .
but these incidents never happened .
senecal blamed trump s democratic opponent hillary clinton for the reports surfacing as the nov. 8 election nears .
these guys are pushing his back against the wall .
but he s a fighter .
he ll take them on .
he ll take all of them on , senecal said .
