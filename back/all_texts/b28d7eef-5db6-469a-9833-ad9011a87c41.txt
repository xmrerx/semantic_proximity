On March 23, KOIN in Burns, Oregon, got a behind the scenes tour of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge.Parts of the once pristine wildlife sanctuary, which was occupied by a group of federal government-hating, armed militants for 41 days, now look more like a trash refuse site than a site set aside as a refuge for wildlife.Photos and video published by KOIN show the level of damage done both inside and out.Trash, clothing, food and government property litter the buildings.Image credit: US Fish and Wildlife Service via KOINThe filth stretches from one end of the building to the other.Image credit: US Fish and Wildlife Service via KOINEquipment, paid for with taxpayer dollars, was left dismantled and destroyed.Image credit: US Fish and Wildlife Service via KOINThe militiamen, who appointed themselves as appropriate caretakers of Malheur left holes in the walls of the buildings they occupied.Image credit: US Fish and Wildlife Service via KOINAnd that s just the beginning of the destruction they left behind.Outside, trash piles, mounds of broken equipment, even abandoned vehicles are thrown against the severely damaged fencing which borders the sanctuary property.Image credit: US Fish and Wildlife Service via KOINIn this area, the trash and abandoned tents aren t even the biggest problem U.S. wildlife officials have to contend with.
The dozens of tanks of improperly sealed and stored contaminants, some packed inside of a garbage-strewn horse trailer, some left out in the open, present a serious hazard to both animals and people.Image credit: US Fish and Wildlife Service via KOINThey dug pits and filled them with human feces.Image credit: US Fish and Wildlife Services via KOINWorse, KOIN reports that Members of the media on tour were advised to watch their step in certain spots.
After some pipes burst, officials said, militia members defecated everywhere.

)The damage that the Bundy terrorists did at Malheur is beyond disturbing.In just over a month, this gang of armed extremists managed to turn a well-cared for wildlife refuge into a shit-covered garbage dump.Estimated costs to clean up and restore the wildlife refuge range into the millions.Here s more on this story from KOIN.Thus far, various members of the militant group that staged the armed takeover of the refuge have been charged with conspiracy to impede officers of the United States, possession of firearms in a federal facility, use and carry of a firearm in relation to a crime of violence, theft of government property and depredation of government property.Militia member Sean Anderson and another defendant have also been charged with destruction of an archeological site.Let s hope that every single person who participated in this terrorist activity gets the maximum sentence that the law will allow.
