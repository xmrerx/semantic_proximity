washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. congress , rushing to beat a friday midnight deadline , on thursday passed legislation funding the government through dec. 22 .
by a vote of 235-193 , the house of representatives passed the bill and rapidly sent it to the senate , which then approved it 81-14 , sending it to president donald trump for signing into law .
while a saturday shutdown of government agencies was averted , congress and trump will now have to come up with a deal to keep the government operating beyond dec. 22 .
