In the spirit of remaining at a middle school maturity level, Marco Rubio bit back at Donald Trump insulting him by, well, trying to insult him right back.
However, his attempt at doing this was pretty damn pathetic.Rubio, while speaking at a campaign event in Kennesaw, Georgia, asked the crowd, You guys want to have a little fun today?!
Rubio then pulls out his phone and begins to go after Trump.
He said: Last night he was actually pretty calm after I punched him around a little bit.
Sure, if that s what you want to call that dismal debate performance, but please, go on: He s learning how to spell, I guess.
But he s flying around on Hair Force One and tweeting.
So here s the one tweet he put out, he put out a picture of me having makeup put on me at the debate.
Which is amazing me to me, that the guy with the worst spray tan in America is attacking me for putting on makeup.
Okay, here it comes, the line we ve all been waiting for.
The best comeback in the history of comebacks: Donald Trump likes to sue people; he should sue whoever did that to his face.
OR not..@marcorubio slams @realDonaldTrump: He s flying around on Hair Force One and tweeting https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/dDo3Q0EA5B CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) February 27, 2016This comeback is VERY reminiscent of that Seinfeld episode when George was trying to come up with a comeback to someone saying to him, the ocean called, and they re running out of shrimp.
George s comeback was, Well, the jerk store called, they re running out of you.
It just doesn t quite work, and neither does the comeback by Rubio.
I mean, he tried, really hard, and it might even work since the average Republican has the maturity level of a 12-year-old, but no, Rubio should really try harder.
OR be an adult and ignore Trump s juvenile attacks.
One thing is for sure, as scary as the Republican race is, it sure is entertaining.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oApBlWipc2AFeatured image: Twitter
