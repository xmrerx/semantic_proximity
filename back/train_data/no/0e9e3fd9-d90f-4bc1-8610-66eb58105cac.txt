vladivostok , russia ( reuters ) - vladimir putin took a jab at rex tillerson on thursday , joking that the u.s. secretary of state had fallen in with the wrong company since he had awarded him a russian state honor for his contribution to russian-u.s. relations .
hopes of detente in moscow s relations with washington under donald trump , who had praised president putin before winning the white house , have faded as the countries have imposed sanctions and expelled diplomats in recent months .
addressing a u.s. citizen at a plenary session of an economic forum in the far eastern city of vladivostok , putin said : we awarded your compatriot mr. tillerson the order of friendship , but he seems to have fallen in with the wrong company and to be steering in the other direction .
i hope that the wind of cooperation , friendship and reciprocity will eventually put him on the right path , putin added , drawing cheers from the crowd .
in 2013 putin awarded tillerson , then ceo of energy giant exxon mobil , the order of friendship , a russian state honor , for his significant contribution to strengthening cooperation in the energy sector .
russia s relations with the united states deteriorated over its annexation of the black sea peninsula of crimea in 2014 and support for pro-russian separatists in eastern ukraine , prompting washington to impose economic sanctions against moscow .
the kremlin , which has denied u.s. allegations it meddled in the presidential vote , had heaped praise on trump during his election campaign , saying it supported efforts to improve russian-american relations .
but trump , who was faced scrutiny over the alleged ties of his entourage with russia , reluctantly signed into law fresh sanctions against moscow , further straining relations .
