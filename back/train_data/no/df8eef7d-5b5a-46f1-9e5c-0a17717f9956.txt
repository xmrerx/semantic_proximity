calgary , alberta ( reuters ) - the conservative leader in canada s oil-rich alberta , jason kenney , ran in a special election on thursday to obtain a seat in the legislature that could lay the groundwork for his efforts to challenge the ruling party in the 2019 provincial polls .
kenney , 49 , is running in an electoral district in canada s oil capital of calgary , which was vacated by its previous representative so the new party leader could quickly enter the legislature , as is customary .
he is expected to win in the district , which has traditionally voted conservative .
a victory would allow kenney , a former federal politician , to question the ruling party in the legislature and position him to become premier if his faction wins in the 2019 election .
kenney was the architect of a merger this year of splintered right-leaning factions that created the united conservative party ( ucp ) , which will challenge the incumbent , left-leaning new democratic party ( ndp ) .
the ndp capitalized on divisions among conservatives , taking power in 2015 .
alberta , where the conservatives held power for 40 years before the ndp unexpectedly took over , is home to canada s vast oil sands and is the largest exporter of crude oil to the united states .
the province has been struggling with a three-year slump in global oil prices and a c $ 10.3 billion ( $ 8.24 billion ) budget deficit .
kenney , who was elected ucp leader in october , has been eager to develop policies aimed at cutting costs for the oil and gas sector , and is likely to be welcomed by the energy industry .
