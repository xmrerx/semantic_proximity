The one-state wonder sides with the Left on a number of issues from his views on gay marriage, his flip-flopping on gun control to his support for Communist Common Core.
Sheriff Clarke has now unearthed a video showing us the anti-cop side of Governor John Katich.Most of us have been pulled over by law enforcement and many of us have been frustrated after receiving a ticket we didn t think we deserved.
We re not all governor s however, and we don t stand up in front of a crowd where we likely have some influence, and call law enforcement officers idiots.
Too bad this video wasn t exposed before he narrowly won his home state of Ohio.
Have you ever been stopped by a police officer that s an idiot?
He s an idiot!
You just can t act that way.
And what people resent is people who are in the government who don t treat the client (client?)
with respect.
Who knew that the person being pulled over by the police for potentially breaking the law is considered a client?
Here is the original Tweet from the awesome Milwaukee Sheriff David Clarke:https://t.co/LXDIrZtj3r @JohnKasich is anti gun and anti cop and people,say Trump is not conservative?
Seriously?
