WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.
Senator Mike Lee of Utah will endorse Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz on Thursday, becoming the first member of the Senate to back Cruz, BuzzFeed News and Politico reported.
Politico reported the pair would make the announcement later on Thursday at an event in Miami.
Republican front-runner Donald Trump has slammed Cruz on the campaign trail for not having received any endorsements from fellow senators.
