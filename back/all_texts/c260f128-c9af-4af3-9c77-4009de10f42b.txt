What in the hell was Donald Trump doing?
No, I m not talking about his threat to jail his opponent if he is elected, his lackluster explanation for his claim that he walks around sexually assaulting women and getting away with it because he s rich, or any of the many, many things he said and did that virtually ensured that Hillary Clinton will be the next President of the United States I m talking about a video clip posted to Twitter that appears to show Trump well, see for yourself.What exactly is Trump trying to do here while Hillary is answering a question.

He then abruptly lifts his head upward after, well, apparently taking a brief look at the ass of woman who will be curb-stomping him at the polls American History -style (except the Nazis are on his side) in November.Sure, there could be another explanation.
Maybe he saw a penny, thought about picking it up, then realized that pennies are the currency of the poor.
Was there a ball of lint on the former Secretary of State s back he considered picking off, but did not want to explain why he had just touched her abruptly?
Or was he just doing what he does best and being a letch?You might be thinking, This seems a bit far-fetched.
There must be another explanation.
Yeah, well so did feeling up his daughter onstage, but he covered that pretty well during the Republican National Convention and he is, after all, the guy who inspired garage band names everywhere with the phrase grab em by the pussy.
Watch Trump feel up his daughter below, because why the f*ck not at this point?Vote on November 8 and if you need any help deciding for whom you should vote, go for the one who isn t going to court just after the election for the alleged rape of a 13-year-old girl.Featured image via screengrab
