Americans woke up on to a country that will soon have Donald Trump serving as president.
It is a frightening realization.
However, overcome with horror, the irony of the date went largely unnoticed by many.
November 9, the day after Election Day, is the anniversary of the Berlin Wall coming down.On this day in 1989, the spokesman for East Berlin s Communist Party announced that citizens of the GDR would be permitted to freely cross the country s borders.
The scene of East and West Berliners flooding to the site became iconic.
People used hammers and picks to chip away at the wall.
The reunification of East and West Germany was made official on October 3, 1990, almost one year after the fall of the Berlin Wall.
While almost three decades ago this date became synonymous with freedom in the hearts and minds of so many, Americans woke up today to a president-elect that plans to build a wall of his own.
Since the very beginning of his election, Trump has promised to build a wall along the border between Mexico and the United States.
Of course, he still insists that Mexico is going to pay for it.
Anti-immigrant rhetoric served as the foundation of Trump s campaign and the wall was his keystone.Anti-immigrant rhetoric has served as the foundation of Trump s campaign and the wall has been his keystone.
While most of us were simply overwhelmed by the reality of a Trump presidency, some couldn t help but notice the date and point out the irony.The sad irony is that the #berlinwall came down today in 1989 and #PresidentTrump is about to build a new one that will be just as brutal.

It certainly looks as if we have an awful lot to learn.
This is more proof of just how far backward we have to go for Trump to Make America Great Again.
