While Donald Trump may have spent a lot of time dissing President Barack Obama during his presidential campaign, he has definitely changed his tone likely because he knows how incredibly screwed he is if Obama doesn t hold his little orange hands during this transition process.On Wednesday, Trump horrified the entire Republican Party by showering praise on our current president and even said that he thinks so highly of our current Commander in Chief that he has taken some of Obama s advice on his future cabinet.
During an interview on The Today Show, Trump touched on several subjects, but his most shocking statements were his kind words about Obama.
Trump, who rarely takes advice from anyone but himself, said: I take his recommendations very seriously and there are some people that I will be appointing and in one case have appointed where he thought very highly of that person.
I love getting his ideas.
And I may differ in many cases, I differ very greatly.
It s safe to say that the one person Trump says Obama thought very highly of might be another one of Trump s lies, or there might be a small chance that at least one of the people in Trump s cabinet isn t a white supremacist (hopefully).
And Trump continued, as he just couldn t stop gushing about Obama: I really like him.
We have a really good chemistry together.
I ve asked him what he thinks are the biggest problems, greatest assets We have very good dialogue.
We wonder if Obama would say the same.
