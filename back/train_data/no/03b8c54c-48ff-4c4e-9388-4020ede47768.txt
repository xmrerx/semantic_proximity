on thursday , donald trump visited his home state for the first time since he was kinda-sorta elected president by a minority of the population and a system of rules that is in inexplicably still in place to protect slavery ( seriously ) .
let s just say the welcome wasn t the warmest .
i m just here to protest everything trump , protester and real estate broker nina horowitz told the straits times .
it just gets worse and worse and he s just not president material by any stretch of the imagination .
he s an anti-intellectual who s not qualified for the job and i believe he contradicts what america is supposed to be about , said a protest organizer.the crowd collectively had a message for trump : new york hates you .

australia has universal healthcare , a system often derided by republicans who would rather see the poor suffer than pay a single goddamn penny more in taxes.donald trump is a complete embarrassment to our country and the people of his home state know it.this is the response with which trump should be met everywhere he makes an appearance .
