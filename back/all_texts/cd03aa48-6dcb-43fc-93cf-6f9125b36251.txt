Ammon Bundy, the son of the secessionist rancher Cliven Bundy, held a rambling, incoherent press conference on Monday at the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.
The 40-year-old Bundy rancher defended convicted ranchers Dwight and Steven Hammond, even though the Hammonds don t really want help from the Bundy brothers.
Hammond attorney W. Alan Schroeder told reporters, Neither Ammon Bundy nor anyone within his group/organization speak for the Hammond family.
But off he went anyway: We have allowed our federal government to step outside the bounds of the Constitution.
They have come down upon on the people, Ammon Bundy said in a press conference Monday.
They are coming down into the state and taking over the land and the resources, putting the people into duress.
Among other things, Bundy announced the name of his group: Citizens For Constitutional Freedom.Bundy also presented a redress of grievances, read by another member of his group.
The grievances were endorsed by other militia groups, such as (we re not making these up) Oregon Bearded Bastards, the Oregon Oath Keepers and the Central Oregon Constitutional Guard.
I know, I know.
The Oregon Bearded Bastards sound like they could totally annihilate the U.S. government and its pawns in the military.
Look out, Marines!
(Meanwhile, the Central Oregon Constitutional Guard smartly used the word guard instead of the original suggestion, Central Oregon Constitutional Klan or C.O.C.K.
The acronym would ve been problematic.
#Joke)The big takeaway from the press conference is this: the Bundys are clearly milking their 15 minutes by piggybacking their ridiculous agenda onto the Hammond agenda.
Together, it s one big dumb agenda, fueled by fantasies of 1776 as if there s any realistic chance that an armed conflict with the government wouldn t end with these posers in body bags.Featured image via video screen grab.
