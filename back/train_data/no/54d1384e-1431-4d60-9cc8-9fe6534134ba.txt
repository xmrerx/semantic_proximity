hillary shouldn t be on fox news giving interviews she should be in jail !
queen hillary didn t quite get the same treatment from fox news chris wallace as she gets when she visits msnbc s chris matthews ! hillary clinton acknowledges that americans have a legitimate concern about her trustworthiness , particularly related to her email scandal and the benghazi terror attacks , but criticized those who have attempted to undermine her democratic presidential campaign and make a caricature out of her , in an exclusive interview with fox news sunday .
i think that it s fair for americans to have questions , clinton said , in an interview taped saturday .
every time i run for an office , though , oh my goodness , all of these caricatures come out of nowhere .
and people begin to undermine me because when i left office as secretary of state , 66 percent of americans approved of what i do .
fox newshttps : //youtu.be/g0xat7apybslaura ingraham commented on hillary clinton s stunning interview on fox news sunday.ingraham said clinton has an astonishing ability to look into chris wallace s eyes and claim that fbi director jim comey confirmed her statements on her email scandal were truthful .
that comment earned clinton four pinocchios from the washington post s fact-checker.ingraham said clinton s aside about her mother loving fox news was all well and good , but the fact of the matter is , this is about her tenure as secretary of state .
if she didn t know that you couldn t put a government server in your bathroom , then what does hillary clinton really know about basic issues of foreign policy ?
ingraham added that clinton apparently can lie with impunity to most people in the press , other than some of the folks at fox news .
