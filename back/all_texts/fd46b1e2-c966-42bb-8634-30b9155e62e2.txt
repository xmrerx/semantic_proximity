Hey, everything is fair game in this war to win the White House.
The Clintons have their attack dog in John Podesta who s about as radical and devious as they come.
It s pretty interesting that all of a sudden the Democrats are saying you need to keep it clean.
They certainly don t have the moral high ground in anything political.
Podesta must be desperate.
What a putz!A top aide for Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s campaign on Monday ripped attacks on Bill Clinton s past infidelity by GOP rival Donald Trump, saying Trump has gone in the gutter.
Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta also issued a warning to Clinton s Democratic rival Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) to stay away from the topic.
I hope he s not going there, Podesta said of Sanders during an appearance on MSNBC s Andrea Mitchell Reports after the host noted it seems there s some piling on here by Sanders.
He said that he s going to run a positive campaign, that he wasn t going to go in for personal attacks and I take him at his word on that, Podesta continued.
But I hope he s not thinking about going there, because, again, I think what Trump has done to go in the gutter is reprehensible, the Clinton campaign chairman added.
PODESTA ON BRINGING BILL S SEXUAL EXPLOITS INTO THE CAMPAIGN: Sanders fielded a question late Friday at a town hall in Iowa about Bill Clinton s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.
Hillary Clinton is not Bill Clinton.
What Bill Clinton did, I think we can all acknowledge was totally, totally, totally disgraceful and unacceptable.
But I am running against Hillary Clinton.
I am not running against Bill Clinton, Sanders told the questioner, according to The Washington Post.Trump has for several weeks knocked the Clintons over Bill Clinton s sexual history, and on Sunday argued that Hillary was an enabler for her husband.Clinton s campaign manager maintained on Monday that Bill Clinton remains an asset for us.
