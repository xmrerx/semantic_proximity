maiduguri , nigeria ( reuters ) - suspected boko haram militants killed 18 people in northeast nigeria on friday , according to local witnesses and officials , the latest in an escalating number of lethal attacks in the region .
the knife-wielding attackers , moving under cover of night , targeted people in the town of banki , 80 miles ( 130 km ) southeast of the city of maiduguri in borno state , the epicenter of the eight-year conflict with boko haram , said a community leader and a local member of a vigilante group .
the attack on the town , which sits on the border with cameroon , is the latest in a string of deadly boko haram raids and bombings that have undermined the nigerian military s statements that the insurgency is all but defeated .
the frequency of attacks in northeastern nigeria has increased in the last few months , killing at least 172 people since june 1 before friday s attack , according to a reuters tally .
the attack on banki left 18 dead , according to modu perobe , a member of the civilian joint task force , a regional vigilante group .
abor ali , a local ruler , confirmed the death toll .
boko haram s eight-year insurgency has left at least 20,000 dead and sparked one of the largest humanitarian crises in the world , with tens of thousands already in famine-like conditions , according to the united nations .
some 8.5 million people in the worst affected parts of northeast nigeria are now in need of some form of humanitarian assistance , with 5.2 million people lacking secure access to food , the u.n. has said .
