Wanna watch Donald Trump crash and burn in front of his own supporters?The Republican nominee held a rally in Reno, Nevada on Wednesday and took his pompousness to a whole new level by telling the crowd that they are mispronouncing the name of their state.
Heroin overdoses are surging and meth overdoses in Neh-VAH-da, Trump insultingly said.
Neh-VAH-da.
When I came out here I said nobody says it the other way.
It has to be Neh-VAH-da, right?
Wrong.
People in the crowd seemed genuinely confused and many were not happy about being lectured about how to pronounce the name of the state they live in, but that s exactly what Trump did and he was the one who was pronouncing it incorrectly.
Trump even went so far as to jokingly claim that a friend of his was killed for pronouncing it the other way.Here s the video via YouTube.But the other way is exactly how it is supposed to be pronouned.
It s Neh-VAD-ah, not Neh-VAH-da.Trump is hardly the first presidential candidate to make this mistake but he s the only one who did it in an insulting way while pompously lecturing the audience about how they say it wrong.And seeing as how Hillary Clinton is leading in Nevada right now it s not exactly the best time to be insulting the intelligence of Nevada residents, especially since Nevada is a battleground state that Republicans are desperate to win in November.Fox 11 anchor Ryan Kern couldn t believe what he was hearing.
@realDonaldTrump tells a group of Nevadans how to pronounce their state correctly and it s the wrong way.
Ryan Kern (@RyanKernKRNV) October 5, 2016And Nevada National Guard State Historian Emerson Marcus also pointed out that Trump was wrong.Wait.
Did @realDonaldTrump just claim he pronounced Nevada correctly by mispronouncing it five times?
