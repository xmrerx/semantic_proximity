president trump spoke to a huge and enthusiastic crowd tonight in phoenix , az .
it wouldn t be donald j. trump if he didn t call out our dishonest and very fake news media .
trump told the crowd , media doesn t want to report that i spoke out against violence and bigotry in reference to his comments following the horrible clashes in charlottesville , va , where in the aftermath , trump blamed both sides .
the media quickly condemned him and tried to twist his words to make it appear as though he refused to condemn the kkk , simply because he wasn t willing to let the violent george soros , anti-american group antifa or the violent domestic terror group , black lives matter off the hook for their part in the violent conflict.president trump : `` media does n't want to report that i spoke out against bigotry and violence . ''
