yuck !
it s bad enough that china had a dog meat festival last week but now this !
the usda just removed the country of origin off of meat but it needs to come back asap !
if there s meat smuggling going on you really don t know where it originated , but if it s china i would like to make the informed choice not to buy their meat for this reason : chinese authorities have seized more than 100,000 tonnes of smuggled meat some of it more than 40 years old , according to state media.the frozen meat , estimated to be worth about 300 million ( 3bn yuan ; $ 483m ) , was seized in a nationwide crackdown .
it was smelly and i nearly threw up when i opened the door , an official from hunan province , where 800 tonnes were seized , told the afp news agency .
poor standards have made food safety a major concern in china .
according to state newspaper the china daily , officials from guangxi , a southern region bordering vietnam , found meat dating back to the 1970s .
thawed several times some of the meat seized in hunan province was found to have been refrozen after thawing out while in transit , according to the reports .
yang bo , an anti-smuggling official in hunan province , was quoted as saying food was often transported in ordinary rather than refrigerated vehicles to save money .
so the meat has often thawed out several times before reaching customers , he said .
the hunan province haul reportedly included beef , chicken feet and duck necks .
authorities believe meat is smuggled into china via neighbouring hong kong and vietnam , from countries such as brazil and india , to sidestep import restrictions.read more : bbc
