President Obama, due to his unique position, is able to use the global stage to draw attention to issues unlike any other leader foreign or domestic.
On Wednesday, speaking at a joint summit with the Prime Minister of Canada and the President of Mexico, the topic of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump came up.In the course of discussing Trump s foot-stamping about economic issues, the President took a second to dissect the media narrative that has described Trump as a populist for months on end.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gGdIiAO5Pdo Somebody who has never shown any regard for workers, has never fought on behalf of social justice issues or making sure that poor kids are getting a decent shot at life or have health care, does not meet the definition, Obama said.
They don t suddenly become a populist because they say something controversial in order to win votes.
That s not the measure of populism.
That s nativism, or xenophobia.
Or worse.
Or it s just cynicism, he said.The media has used the reaction of white, blue collar audiences to Trump as evidence that he is a populist speaking to the masses.
But the reality TV star is not a man of the people.
He has actually made a lot of his money swindling some of those same sorts of people with his fraudulent enterprises like Trump University.As President Obama made clear in just a few seconds, Trump is simply posturing as if he were a populist, but a short glance at his language and his habit of practicing demagoguery destroys his posturing pretty quickly.Trump launched his campaign attacking Latinos as criminals and rapists, he has blamed all immigrants especially Muslims for terrorism, and he has also denigrated blacks and women throughout his career.A populist stands up for the little guy, he doesn t turn him upside down and try to suck the money out of his pockets.Featured image via YouTube
