Nancy Pelosi attempted to offer her (incoherent) thoughts on the Democrat inspired shooting of US Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) that took place yesterday at the hands of 66 yr. old Bernie Sanders supporter and Trump hater in Alexandria, VA.
In case anyone hasn t noticed, Nancy seems to be living in an alternate world lately.
She s frequently confused and regularly makes nonsensical remarks, but referring to a fellow congressional member who s in critical condition in the hospital as deceased?
Really Nancy?Watch:https://twitter.com/joshdcaplan/status/875413158600613889When will Nancy s voters begin to demand she take a competency test or step aside for the good of the nation?Here are just a few of Nancy s latest and best missteps.
They would almost be humorous if she wasn t working as a public servant with a great deal of responsibility.On April 26, 2017, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi appeared on Meet the Press and gave a completely incoherent response to a question about the border wall.
For the second time in a matter of weeks, progressive leftist Democrat Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi displayed what many believe can only be accredited to having a severe case of Trump Derangement Syndrome.
While speaking to ABC s Jonathan Karl, Nancy confused the presidency of Donald Trump with George W. Bush for the second time since President Trump s inauguration.During two public appearances in March 2017, Nancy confused Iran with Iraq, pronounced words strangely, and claimed Republicans are offering a Mini Me or Mickey Mouse budget.
Ends her very strange press conference by saying, I don t know.
But there s no there there .
We re beginning to wonder if Nancy is still there ?Is Nancy so flustered and panicked by Trump s presidency and her diminished role in Congress that she is no longer able to speak in public?
Or, is it possible (all kidding aside) that she needs to be examined by a medical professional?You be the judge
