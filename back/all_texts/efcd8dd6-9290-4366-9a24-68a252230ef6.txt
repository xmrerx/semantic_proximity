A Quincy, Il, man was shot in the hourly hours of Thursday morning and then right after, did an interview while smoking a cigarette, in what appears to be one of the most interesting interviews of the year.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y_wMhAFL188]The Quincy man, Devon, was in the room, kicking like I usually do, drinking, when someone fired bullets through his apartment, striking him in the chest.Despite the danger, Devon said that he wasn t trippin, it was a petty wound and sh*t. The first thing he thought about wasn t his wound though.
His main concern was to get his son out of the way.
Luckily, his son wasn t hurt.During the interview, Devon lifted his shirt to show his bandages from the wound, casually shrugging off the event, saying some people probably want [him] dead and are on some other stuff.
One can t help but notice how unaffected, calm, and desensitized Devon seems to be, at least while conducting the interview.
Even the journalist, Reyna Harvey, who was interviewing him is calm, which lead Chad Douglas a broadcaster at the studio to lament that the entire event was incredible.
While the event is indeed incredible, there seems to be something quite eerie about the desensitization of all involved in this almost tragic event.
Let s hope that Devon makes a full recovery from his wounds.Feature Image Via YouTube Screenshot
