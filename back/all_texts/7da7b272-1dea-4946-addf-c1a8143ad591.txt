People have all kinds of ways of supporting their favorite candidates.
Some go to rallies, knock on doors, or donate and raise money.
However, others get more creative, and that is just what two Hillary Clinton supporters from Missouri.Social entrepreneur Antonio French tweeted the best video ever of a tribute song written by the two ladies.
The lyrics are uplifting and the setting is some sort of Hillary support site.
In the introduction, the ladies say the following about their little project: We wanted to write a jingle that we thought would address all the issues she represents.
Certainly, the little ditty does that, as its chorus says:She s proven and she s tried, she s on the people s side!Oh, Hillary, she ll get the job done, Oh Hillary, she ll get the job done!Here is the tweet, with the video:These ladies wrote a song for @HillaryClinton ?
and it's been stuck in my head for days.
