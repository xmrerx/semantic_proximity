berlin ( reuters ) - germany welcomed on wednesday a suggestion by russian president vladimir putin that armed u.n. peacekeepers could be deployed to eastern ukraine to help protect ceasefire monitors , but said any prospect of lifting sanctions was still a way off .
putin said on tuesday that russia intended to draft a u.n. security council resolution to this end , saying it would help resolve the problem in eastern ukraine , though he also said preconditions would have to be met before any deployment .
german government spokeswoman ulrike demmer said any deployment would have to be across the whole area of conflict , not just on the contact line between the ukrainian army and pro-russian separatists .
the war between the two sides has killed more than 10,000 people in three years .
the president s suggestion is a step , said demmer , adding many further steps were needed before sanctions could be lifted .
for a complete lifting of sanctions to be discussed , there would need to be the full implementation of the minsk ceasefire agreement , she added .
ukraine believes external peacekeepers from the organization for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) should be deployed throughout separatist-held territory and on the sections of the ukraine-russia border that are not under kiev s control .
kiev accuses moscow of sending troops and heavy weapons to the region , which russia denies .
putin also said on tuesday that any decision by the united states to supply defensive weapons to ukraine would fuel the conflict .
