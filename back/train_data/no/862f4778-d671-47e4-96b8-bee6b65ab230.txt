obama didn t appear to be very pleased when cnn ally , jim acosta confronted him on his feckless role as commander in chief an international stage during the g2 summit .
acosta first mocked him about his reference to isis as jayvee team then lobbed some friendly fire : why can t we take out these bastards ?
obama s answer is arrogant , condescending and makes no sense whatsoever .
his behavior is so predictable and completely unbecoming as the leader of our nation .
this is exactly what we ve come to expect however , from this dangerous commander in chief .
