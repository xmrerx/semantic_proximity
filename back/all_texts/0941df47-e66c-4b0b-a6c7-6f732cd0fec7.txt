PLEASE TAKE ACTION TODAY!
You will find out this week if Speaker Ryan and Senate Majority Leader McConnell put your safety first!
We have no obligation to invite unvetted third world refugees to your towns to live off of your hard work (your tax dollars).
Yes, you pay for this!ACTION ALERT: DEMAND CONGRESS STOP FUNDING REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT WITH OUR TAX DOLLARS In the wake of the horrific terror attacks in San Bernardino and Paris, the FBI said it lacks the funds to stay ahead of the escalating terror threats right here in America.
So why would we want to divert any of our tax dollars, which should be directed to reinforcing our nation s security and intelligence apparatus to protect our families and our nation, to opening the gates to refugees from terror-supporting nations whom we CAN NOT vet and whose ranks ISIS and other terror organizations target to infiltrate?This Monday (today!)
and Tuesday, we must flood the offices of our US Representatives and Senators with calls (US Capitol Switchboard: 202-224-3121) urging them to vigorously oppose Refugee Resettlement Funding contained in the Omnibus Spending Bill that will be voted on by 12-11-15!Then make 4 more calls to insist the same:1.
Speaker Paul Ryan/Phone: 202.225.3031 2.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell/Phone: 202.224.2541 3.
Rep. Hal Rogers, Chair, Appropriations Committee/Phone: 202.225.4601 4.
Sen. Thad Cochran, Chair, Senate Appropriations /Phone: 202.224.7257Tell your Members of Congress IN NO UNCERTAIN TERMS THAT YOU WANT THEM TO SUSPEND REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT FUNDING IMMEDIATELY.Read Sen. Jeff Sessions statement on this: OMNIBUS EXPECTED TO FUND OBAMA S ENTIRE IMMIGRATION AGENDAUS Rep. Candice Miller of MI, Vice Chair of the Homeland Security Committee, said: I support Governor Snyder s decision to suspend efforts to relocate Syrian refugees to Michigan, and have cautioned against the Administration s decision to increase the number being admitted into the U.S. terrorist organizations like ISIS are looking for any and every opportunity to exploit a nation s hospitality to carry out their barbaric attacks against the innocent.
Anyone who says we can adequately and safely vet these refugees is wrong because there is no database in Syria and no way to identify who s who.
THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE OF OUR TIME.
If you don t want unvettable refugees from terror-supporting countries in your neighborhood, you must raise your voices NOW.
The immigration industry is a powerful lobby and private resettlement contractors have the authority to send refugees to any town, city, neighborhood or location without public notification and local consent.REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT MONITOR MICHIGANWe have been telling you over the last week or so (here, here and here) that those (mostly the religious Left ) who want to bring in massive numbers of Muslim migrants and other refugees are pulling out all the stops to pressure Congress (yesterday we learned that even the Quakers are against you).
They have never (in 35 years!)
been so challenged!
You must counter them!Next week there will be much to do locally and statewide, but this week, you must make this a priority!READ MORE: REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT WATCH
