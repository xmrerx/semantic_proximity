manchester , england ( reuters ) - prime minister theresa may s top ministers are all frustrated by the slow pace of brexit negotiations , but her team owes her its loyalty as she negotiates britain s departure from the european union , finance minister philip hammond said on monday .
at the conservative party s conference in manchester , northern england , hammond played down the importance of four new red lines set down by foreign minister boris johnson in a british newspaper that underlined the rifts in cabinet .
we re all frustrated by the slow progress that we ve made over the last few months with the european union negotiations , that s why the prime minister went to florence 10 days ago and made a key speech which was designed specifically to unstick the logjam in the negotiations and move them forward , he told itv television .
boris position on these issues are well known .
i back the prime minister in what is a very complex and delicate negotiation with our european union partners to deliver britain s exit in the way the british people have mandated us to do .
