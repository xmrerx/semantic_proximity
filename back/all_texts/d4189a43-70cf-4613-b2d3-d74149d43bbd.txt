UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - North Korea s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho told the United Nations on Saturday that U.S. President Donald Trump had made our rockets visit to the entire U.S. mainland inevitable by calling North Korean leader Kim Jong Un rocket man .
Through such a prolonged and arduous struggle, now we are finally only a few steps away from the final gate of completion of the state nuclear force, Ri told the annual gathering of world leaders for the United Nations General Assembly.
It is only a forlorn hope to consider any chance that the DPRK (North Korea) would be shaken an inch or change its stance due to the harsher sanctions by the hostile forces, he said.
