we have a weak leader in our white house who s willing to be pushed around after leaving a vacuum in the middle east for chaos .
putin has decided he s in it for the long term and wants to have his presence strengthened in the middle east since the u.s. has been so absent in the area .
remember the red line ?
that was a big turning point in our president s effectiveness in the area .
obama has done nothing and continues to let putin bring in his military mite to take over dominance .
so it s a win for russia and putin s desire to be the dominant big gun in the middle east .
obama has officially surrendered influence in the middle east and assad is staying .
checkmate !
fox news : russian warplanes have begun bombarding syrian opposition targets in the war torn nation s north , working on behalf of dictator bashar al assad , according to a senior military official.the official said airstrikes targeted fighters in the vicinity of homs , located roughly 60 miles east of a russian naval facility in tartus , and were carried out by a couple of russian bombers .
it was not clear if the strikes targeted isis , al qaeda or other forces opposed to assad , who moscow is aiding .
according to a twitter handle belonging to the syrian government , the russian strikes were initiated at the request of assad.the development came after pentagon officials brushed aside an official request from russia to clear air space over northern syria , where moscow intends to conduct airstrikes against isis on behalf of syrian dictator bashar al-assad , according to sources who spoke to fox news.the request was made by a russian three-star general who spoke with u.s. officials at the american embassy in baghdad , sources said .
the general , who was not identified , used the word please when delivering the verbal request , known as a demarche , according to the written transcript of the exchange .
