the takeaway from the first debate is that the fox news moderators tried to pose gotcha questions and should have asked more substantive questions about the issues facing america .
it was disappointing to watch megyn kelly and chris wallace attack certain candidates and play favorites to others ( rino s ) .
if we didn t know better , we d almost believe fox news had an agenda last night .
hmmm what do you think ?
