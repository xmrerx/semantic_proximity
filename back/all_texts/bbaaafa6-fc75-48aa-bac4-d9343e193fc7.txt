Anyone who has been to grade school is fully aware that Andrew Jackson died before a certain bloody conflict in which southerners fought their countrymen (former countrymen if you consider the Confederacy to be legitimate like many Trump supporters do) over the right to own other human beings, but Donald Trump has his own alternative facts about swashbuckler Jackson.Trump says he learned during a recent visit to Tennessee that they love Andrew Jackson down there, questioning whether Jackson, who owned 150 men, women, and children when he died in 1845, could have stopped the Civil War, which began in 1861, if he had been a little bit later.
I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little bit later you wouldn t have had the Civil War.
He was a very tough person, but he had a big heart, Trump told the Washington Post s Salena Zito.
He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, There s no reason for this.'
Yes, according to Trump, slave owner Andrew Jackson was angry about a war that began long after his death and totally would have acted against his own self-interest (slavery was the source of all of his money) to stop it if he hadn t been so dead.
But he was mad.
Then Trump wondered why the Civil War happened in the first place a question appropriate coming from someone who thinks a hardcore slave owner would have stopped it: People don t ask that question, but why was there the Civil War?
Why could that one not have been worked out?
Fortunately, Crooked Hillary s daughter stepped up to provide him with the answer in a manner Trump may understand: under 140 characters:1 word answer: Slavery.
Longer: When Andrew Jackson died in 1845 (16 yrs before the Civil War began), he owned 150 men, women and children.

Worth visiting.
Doesn't shy away from Jackson's slave-owning history.
https://t.co/L8WZkqifJZ Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) May 1, 2017Trump also visited Jackson s home but apparently failed to learn that no president has done more to expand slavery in the United States than he did.
Appropriately, The Donald told Zito that his campaign was a lot like that of Jackson, who also called for severe penalties for the circulation of incendiary publications.
Trump, who is exploring suing journalists for stories he does not like, just says FAKE NEWS because he s nowhere near as intelligent as the slave-owning former president he thinks would have stopped the Civil War.Naturally, Twitter loved watching Trump get dragged by the former First Daughter:@ChelseaClinton @IndependentlyE If you think Andrew Jackson was mad about the Civil War, you should have heard his thoughts on Vietnam.
Not good!
Ben Hooper (@BenHooperWrites) May 1, 2017@ChelseaClinton Guess he missed all his history classes.
Unbelievable.
Beth Woodworth (@bwoodwor) May 1, 2017@ChelseaClinton @MarcDrummond I learned about this in high school.
In Norway.
How is the US President this ignorant of his own country s history?
MortenRandHendriksen (@mor10) May 1, 2017@ChelseaClinton But Trump would have prevented Civil War by giving each slave 3/5 of a Pepsi Drain The Trumps (@DrainTheTrumps) May 1, 2017@ChelseaClinton Can Trump for the love of god pick up a damn history book!
Google ANYTHING!?!?
Saba (@SabaSmw) May 1, 2017@ChelseaClinton @realDonaldTrump Did you sleep through American history?
You realize your statements reflect your racism?
Sad, born too late to own humans?
Laurie Johnson (@lauriejohnson12) May 1, 2017@ChelseaClinton Gee, maybe if someone spoke to him for 10 minutes about slavery ?

#trailoftears damon musha (@damon_musha) May 1, 2017Donald Trump is a complete embarrassment, and it is baffling that our country contains so many stupid people that a minority of them were able to put him in office with the help of the Electoral College a system set up to protect Jackson s favorite thing, slavery.Listen to Trump s remarks below:Here's the audio on that Trump answer: "Why was there the Civil War?
Why could that one not have been worked out?"
