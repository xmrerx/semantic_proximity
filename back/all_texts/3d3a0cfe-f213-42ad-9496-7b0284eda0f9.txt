CBS journalist Sopan Deb was covering Donald Trump s scheduled University of Illinois rally on March 11, when he was assaulted and arrested by Chicago police.Just moments after Deb captured video of a Black man, presumably an anti-Trump protester, lying in a pool of his own blood on the pavement, the CBS reporter says that he was grabbed from behind by police.According to CBS, Deb states that he was thrown to the ground without warning.As his camera continued rolling, police can be heard shouting, Put your hands behind your back!
The journalist reports that one of the officers placed a boot on his neck, before slapping a pair of handcuffs on his wrists.Deb was placed into a police van and hauled off to the police station.He is charged with resisting arrest, although video of the incident shows that the reporter did not resist the officers in any way.The same video shows that Deb identified himself as a credentialed member of the press, but that didn t stop the cops from making the unconstitutional arrest.Here s video of the assault and arrest, from CBS News.
Trump, who has repeatedly promised to get rid of constitutionally protected freedom of the press if he is elected, must be very proud of the way the Chicago Police Department handled this reporter.Although he claims his presidency would be full of transparency, Trump has repeatedly waged war on the rights of the press, going so far as to say that under a Trump presidency the media would not be protected.Typical of fascist dictators, Trump hates the fact that in the U.S. the media has the right to report negative things about him.
He says he would put an end to all that if he wins in the general election.Still, as on March 12, 2016, under the U.S. Constitution, the press is protected from the kind of harassment and interference the Chicago police engaged in at UIC.There s more than enough video evidence to show that CBS journalist Sopan Deb was assaulted by Chicago police, arrested under false pretenses and charged with a crime he didn t commit.
