At some point, Republicans learned that they can just lie and get away with it.
No matter how many times that the lie is debunked, people still believe it.That was the topic for a hilarious segment of Real Time with Bill Maher.
In the segment, Maher takes on Republican zombie lies.
This is a topic that Maher has covered before, but given the amount of lying and half-truths that candidates riding in the GOP clown car have fired off it s definitely worth reexamining.
Especially when you consider, as Maher puts it, Republicans have gone beyond even the zombie lie to just making sh*t up.
Maher blames a lot of the problem on the internet.
It today s age, conservatives are oftentimes locked into their own bubble where facts simply do not matter.
It isn t even a problem where they are taking in biased information, it s just stuff that has been made up by Republicans, that RWNJ s latch on to.Last year, a poll found that 49% of Republicans believe that President Obama is a Muslim.
Overall, 29% of people said that they think he is a Muslim.
That s a lot of people who believe something that is just not true, even in the slightest.
It s something that is extremely easy to fact check.
There should be no reason for any reasonable person to believe that Obama is a Muslim.Maher cites a recent example involving Carly Fiorina who said that she saw a Planned Parenthood video that featured a fully formed fetus on the table, its heart, its legs kicking, while someone says We have to keep it alive to harvest its brain.
Which is absolutely pure bullsh*t.Just take a look at Politifact s records on the Republican presidential candidates, versus their record on the Democratic candidates.
The difference is very clear.You can watch the full segment of the show, below.Featured Image Credit: Video Screenshot via YouTube
