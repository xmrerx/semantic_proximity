In his nearly-incoherent ravings about his Muslim ban getting shut down, Donald Trump said something that will haunt him until the end of his disaster of a presidency.
Big increase in traffic into our country from certain areas, while our people are far more vulnerable, Trump said, adding the good part: as we wait for what should be EASY D!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017We can probably assume that Trump meant easy defense, but phrasing, man!
Twitter immediately lit up with people razzing him for his hilariously unintentional search for a big, all-caps, EASY D and the jokes kind of just wrote themselves from that point.
@realDonaldTrump @realDonaldTrump I heard you can get "EASY D" by answering Craigslist Casual Encounters ads.

Next question."

That a euphemism for something Steve Bannon-related?

@realDonaldTrump Who doesn't love waiting for some EASY D?
Pornhub ARIA (@Pornhub) February 8, 2017 .and by an adult toy maker, who offers some of the easiest D in existence since it comes straight to your door:The folks at gay dating app Grindr just seemed confused that Trump thinks he has to wait to get some D :?
https://t.co/6s674G6h6i Grindr (@Grindr) February 8, 2017Being President can be hard (just ask Steve Bannon), and easy D can be hard to find (unless you re on Craigslist when the RNC comes to town), but no matter what kind of D Trump wants, there are better ways to get it than banning Muslims from entering the country.The only way any of us are going to get easy D is if we get Trump out of the White House so we can begin to rebuild our relationships with everyone.
