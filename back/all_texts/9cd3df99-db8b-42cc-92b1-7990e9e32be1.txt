Wow!
Talk about clueless!
Austen Fletcher approaches anti-Trump protesters and gets clueless answers on why they re against Trump:Thought you might enjoy this @PrisonPlanet @allidoisowen @JackPosobiec pic.twitter.com/kdYm2WlfdB austen fletcher (@fleccas) July 17, 2017One individual in a Spiderman mask crouching on the floor begins rambling semi-incoherantly, stating, No Trump says no to racism.
Let s have a color-filled America, a melting pot, like America was supposed to be built on, he adds.
The man is then asked by Fletcher, What about the diversity you re seeing on the Trump side?
There s blacks, Hispanics, gays for Trump, there s a lot of different people that support Trump?
