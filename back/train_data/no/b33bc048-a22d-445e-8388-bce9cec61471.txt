what do you think of these comments made by donald in december , 2011 ?
does it even matter to trump followers when these clips surface of donald contradicting his current positions ?
is he the only candidate in american history who is immune to criticism by his followers ?
or are americans so desperate to elect a non-politician who isn t beholden to the major donor class that they just don t care ? here is donald telling the media the reason he won t agree to do fox news debate today : https : //youtu.be/wjkvlvlgs3mwatch donald s interesting response to megyn kelly in december , 2011 , when she asks him : do you really think that you re a better moderator than i am ?
