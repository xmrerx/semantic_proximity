unidentified man helping to organize protests in suburbs tells mark barber of wsoc : we need to go where the immediate threat is at .
whether it s a threat or not , i just want us to go to the area where the gentleman lives , so we can actually have the people with the money be concerned about the people without the money .
reporter : so you plan to protest in the suburbs ?
man being interviewed : yes .
cuz i figure if we go hit them in their area , then they ll be more potent ( ? )
to what s going on in our area .
listen | protesters say this is n't the end .
they plan to take protests to wealthy areas of charlotte next .
