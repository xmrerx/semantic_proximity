istanbul ( reuters ) - a turkish court has issued detention warrants for two people including a former opposition lawmaker for allegedly providing fake evidence and documents to a court case in the united states , private broadcaster cnn turk said on tuesday .
cnn turk identified the two wanted individuals as former republican people s party ( chp ) lawmaker aykan erdemir and banking auditor osman zeki canitez , both of whom it said were named in a witness list presented for the u.s. trial of former halkbank executive mehmet hakan atilla .
the media relations office at the istanbul prosecutor s office said they did not have any information regarding the detention warrants .
u.s. authorities charged turkish-iranian gold trader reza zarrab and eight other people , including turkey s former economy minister and three executives of turkish state-owned halkbank , with engaging in transactions worth hundreds of millions of dollars for iran s government and iranian entities from 2010 to 2015 in a scheme to evade u.s. sanctions .
mehmet hakan atilla , who pleaded not guilty , will be the only person on trial in the u.s. case .
u.s. district judge richard berman told potential jurots on monday that zarrab , who has been the focus of the case , will not go on trial this week .
atilla and zarrab are the only two defendants who were arrested by u.s. authorities .
turkish authorities have said that some evidence presented by prosecutors was fabricated for political motives , and state media said two weeks ago authorities had launched an investigation into the prosecutors who initiated the u.s. case .
halkbank and turkish officials have said all the bank s transactions have been fully compliant with national and international regulations , but investors are worried .
at 1100 gmt , shares in turkey s state-owned lender halkbank were trading 4.47 percent lower at 8.97 lira .
