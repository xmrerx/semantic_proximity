After Ellen Pompeo viewed yet other shooting of an unarmed black man by police, who was even on his back with his hands up as he was trying to help a patient with autism, she took to Twitter and said: To all of you obsessed with all lives matter We can do this all day long we get a new video everyday..do you?

So, this racist dingbat said this to try to turn the narrative around: Black people commit more violent crimes towards other black people than cops do.
Wheres ur outrage Ellen?
@JCapedia @EllenPompeo @ShaunKing Black people commit more violent crimes towards other black people than cops do.

Max Headroom (@WoobysToyBox) July 21, 2016But Pompeo was NOT about to put up with that idiotic and racist reply, and came straight back with a hard dose of the truth in a mic drop felt around the world.
She said: My outrage is alive and well because black on black crime is a byproduct of centuries systemic racism you fool.

Especially by those who continue on with their All lives matter bullsh*t, because clearly they don t think all lives matter if they re mad black people want to be treated with the same dignity and respect as everyone else.Featured Photo by Mark Davis/Getty Images for TV Land
