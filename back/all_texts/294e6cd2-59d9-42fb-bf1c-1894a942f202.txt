At this point, the arguments against the #AllLivesMatter crowd s rebuttal against the #BlackLivesMatter movement have been well documented.
The point that Just because someone says Save the rainforest does not mean that they are saying F*ck all other forests should have ended the debate.
However, the debate continues.
One person on twitter saw the connection between the #AllLivesMatter and the recent sale of the gun George Zimmerman used to kill Trayvon Martin.Here s the tweet:It should be noted that the gun actually sold for $250,000 dollars but that does not change the point at all.There have been no major systemic changes to the institutions that have racism built into their core.
Since the beginning of the Black Lives Matter movement, it has been proven again and again just how much it is needed.Many people have claimed that the gun is a piece of history and that s why people are willing to pay so much money for it.
I have to wonder if the person who bought the gun would also be willing to pay a quarter of a million dollars for the hoodie that Trayvon Martin was wearing the night he was killed by Zimmerman.
I highly doubt that they or most of the people who put serious bids in for the weapon would be willing to do so.
Especially when it is taken into account that at least part of the money Zimmerman will receive, will be donated to groups that fight the Black Lives Matter movement.That s because the gun isn t just a piece of history.
It is a trophy for white supremacists.
It is a symbol that a grown man can kill an unarmed black teenager, be protected by the state s legal system, and then go on to make a fortune off of the tragedy that person has caused.Featured Image Photo by Joe Burbank-Pool/Getty Images
