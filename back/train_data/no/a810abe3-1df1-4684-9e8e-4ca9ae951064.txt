( reuters ) - u.s. republican presidential candidate ben carson said he intends to continue campaigning through the republican national convention in july after a report on thursday said he planned a major downsizing of his flagging campaign .
the washington post reported that carson planned to eliminate 50 staff positions , or nearly one-half his staff .
carson , in an appearance on the fox news channel , said the cuts have been months in the making after an examination found “ inefficiencies ” in his campaign .
“ it ’ s the same kind of thing i would do as president , ” the retired neurosurgeon said .
“ there is a lot of money being wasted , a lot of inefficiency in government and just because you have the funds to continue that inefficiency doesn ’ t mean that you should do it. ” the bulk of the cuts will come from his field offices and headquarters in virginia , the washington post said , citing an internal memo and campaign officials .
carson will also reduce salaries for campaign workers , it said .
carson finished fourth among republican presidential hopefuls in the iowa caucuses on monday with less than 10 percent of the vote .
the newspaper said other cost-saving measures included possibly using commercial flights instead of private planes and limiting carson ’ s travel team to a select few advisers .
“ we will be able to continue the campaign right until cleveland , ” carson said , referring to the convention .
“ but obviously you always make appropriate adjustments to make sure you can accomplish your goal. ” his most senior staffers will remain on the campaign team , according to the post .
