amsterdam ( reuters ) - the international criminal court on tuesday said judges had ordered former ivory coast president laurent gbagbo to remain in detention during his war crimes trial .
judges said gbagbo presented a flight risk and has a network of supporters that could obstruct or endanger trial proceedings if he were released .
gbagbo s defense team had requested provisional release but judges said they failed to propose concrete and solid conditions that would ensure gbagbo s continued presence at the trial .
gbagbo is accused of four counts of crimes against humanity , including murder , rape , persecution and other inhumane acts allegedly committed during post-electoral violence in ivory coast between 16 december 2010 and 12 april 2011 when gbagbo refused to accept defeat by rival alassane ouattara .
his trial began in january 2016 .
this week prosecutors called former army chief philippe mangou to give evidence .
