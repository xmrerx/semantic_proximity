Monday, August 29, happens to be the 53rd anniversary of the Civil Rights March on Washington, in which civil rights icon Martin Luther King, Jr. made his iconic I Have a Dream speech.
It is a landmark point in the history of Black Americans gaining legal civil rights.
Therefore, the last person who should be speaking out on this event is the racist Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.
But, speak out he did, and he actually had the unabashed gall to try and pretend he cares about equality.
Here is the tweet:Today is the 53rd anniversary of the March on Washington today we honor the enduring fight for justice, equality and opportunity.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 28, 2016Now, you must understand, Donald Trump has a long and well-documented history of racism.
Here are just a few of those instances:I could go on, but you get the picture.
This guy is a dyed in the wool, bona fide racist.
He DARES to try and say he cares about equality and justice for minorities, but clearly, he doesn t just look at his actions, the bigoted nature of his campaign, as well as the people he surrounds himself with.
Further, his so-called outreach is only Trump s attempt to be a white whisperer to those white people who are too uncomfortable to vote for him if they sincerely believe him to be a racist.
Newsflash, folks: Donald Trump IS a racist.
His history and the nature of his campaign shows it.
He s only pandering for votes because he knows he cannot win in November with only white people.
Do not be fooled Trump is a racist demagogue, and no amount of attempting to pander and change his language changes that.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images
