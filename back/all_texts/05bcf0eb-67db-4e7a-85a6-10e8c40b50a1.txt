If there is one political ideology that every American should despise, it s Nazism.
But conservatives don t seem to mind it one bit.On inauguration day last month, Nazi Richard Spencer got punched in the face by a protester during an interview.Spencer, along with others of his ilk, support Donald Trump and hail his presidency as a new era of white nationalism where fascism and racism flourish.It s no secret, of course.
Conservatives have been moving further to the extreme right for decades and the end of that side of the political spectrum is Nazism.Rather than run away from Nazism and people like Spencer who advocate in favor of it, conservatives decided to give Spencer credentials to attend their annual CPAC conference.Spencer attended on Thursday, and he had a lot to say to reporters as supporters flocked to him like moths to a flame.When asked how he feels about being at CPAC, Spencer said he feels welcome.
Richard Spencer, at CPAC: I feel very welcome here.
Nobody s punching me yet.

Said he didn t endorse Richard Spencer s ideas but won t kick him out of the conference.
fake Matt Pearce (@mattdpearce) February 23, 2017But then it appears someone felt that Spencer was getting too much adulation at CPAC so they had him escorted out by security.Here s the video via YouTube.Richard Spencer should never have been approved to get credentials to CPAC in the first place, especially if conservatives really don t agree with Nazism.But the fact that Spencer was allowed to attend makes it pretty clear that conservatives are more okay with Nazis than they would like us to believe.
And that s an insult to the millions of Americans who fought to stop the Nazis and their evil agenda during World War II.Featured image via YouTube
