This sounds exactly like what a dictator would do to humiliate his opponents.Because according to former Apprentice star and director of Trump s pathetic African-American Outreach effort Omarosa Manigault, Trump has plans for dealing with those who have criticized or opposed him should he become president.In a promo for PBS upcoming Frontline documentary that examines the lives of the Republican nominee and Hillary Clinton, Manigault makes an appearance to sing the praises of her boss and to fire a warning shot towards his detractors.
Donald Trump is running for president because he believes that he can help turn the nation around, Manigault said.
More importantly, every critic, every detractor will have to bow down to President Trump.
Here s the video via YouTube.This is just another sign that Donald Trump intends to rule like a dictator rather than a leader who gets his power by virtue of the people.
America is NOT a monarchy.
People do not bow down to the president.
But that is apparently what Trump has in mind for anyone who has ever criticized him, insulted him, crossed him, or stood in his way.And that makes his close ties to Russian president Vladamir Putin all the more alarming, which is why legendary ballet dancer Mikhail Baryshnikov has warned that Trump is acting an awful lot like a Soviet dictator.
And he would know since he defected from the Soviet Union 42 years ago precisely because of the kinds of policies Trump is advocating for now such as oppression of people based on race and religion, building walls, and being a psychopath in general.Trump has even called for gun nuts to assassinate Hillary Clinton and has encouraged his supporters to chant in favor of locking her in prison.
Assassination and imprisonment are exactly what dictators do to their political opponents.This is why Americans must exercise their right to vote this November because if Trump comes to power that right may not exist much longer.Featured image via screen capture
