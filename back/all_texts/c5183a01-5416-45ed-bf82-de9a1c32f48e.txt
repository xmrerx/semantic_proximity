Yeah, well about that.Crazed Congresswoman Maxine Waters found an unusual venue to spew her hatred for President Trump over the weekend, viciously smearing the dishonorable President while delivering a eulogy at a friend s funeral.Waters speech went off the rails at the funeral of comedian Dick Gregory, where the firebrand liberal suddenly screamed, I m cleaning out the White House, and bizarrely claimed that the KKK had infiltrated Trump s cabinet.
I m cleaning out the White House.
We re going to sanitize the White House.
We re not going to take what is happening in this country, said Waters.
And then comes along this person.
This person who does not respect you.
This dishonorable human being who cheats everybody!
This dishonorable human being who will lie at the drop of a hat, she wailed.
This dishonorable human being who has the alt-right, and the KKK and everybody else inside his Cabinet!
When I get through with Donald Trump, he s going to wish he had been impeached!
she added.
Hannity.comWatch Maxine honor her deceased friend by going off the rails at the mere mention of President Trump s name:Just imagine how much wealthier Trump would be if he could find a way to be compensated for living inside so many liberals heads rent-free.
