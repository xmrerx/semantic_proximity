As a poll challenger who has witnessed unbelievable blatant voter fraud by Democrats, I can only imagine what this poll worker might have done to cross this Democrat chairman.The chairman of the Essex County Democratic Committee in New Jersey is accused of punching a blind Army veteran following an argument at a polling location during East Orange s council primary last month.Video was released purportedly showing Leroy Jones punching 75-year-old Bill Graves, who was volunteering as a poll worker during the incident on primary day, June 2.
I hear this rumbling, Where the blank is Bill Graves?
I m gonna kick his butt!
Mr. Graves told a local ABC affiliate.
You can see on the tape it was intentional.
The suspect, identified by Essex County Prosecutors as Mr. Jones, is seen throwing several punches at Mr. Graves following what appears to be a heated confrontation.Mr.
Graves and his friends said Mr. Jones attacked him because he was backing a political candidate that Mr. Jones did not support, ABC reported.Mr.
Jones, however, said he was defending his wife, who was also working at the polls.
Mr. Jones said the veteran got aggressive with his wife during an argument, and she called her husband for help, a local CBS affiliate reported.
This man threatened my wife.
This man assaulted my wife.
This man charged at my wife, Mr. Jones said.Mr.
Jones has been charged with simple assault, reports said.
Mr. Graves was not charged.Mr.
Graves, who is completely blind in one eye and legally blind in the other, said his vision has gotten worse since the attack.
Angry, disgusted, because why should I have to run back and forth to the doctor because someone decided to hit me, he told ABC.
It s not good, that s all I can say.
I m smiling, but I m not laughing.
