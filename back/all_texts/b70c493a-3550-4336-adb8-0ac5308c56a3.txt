It s also being reported that John Kelly is a key player in the removal (see below).
Scaramucci was only on the job for three days but caused a stir when he unloaded a crude verbal tirade against other senior members of the president s senior staff.#BreakingNews: @POTUS removing @Scaramucci as Communications Director via @nytimes pic.twitter.com/8J0W6UDkcu FOX Business (@FoxBusiness) July 31, 2017Mr.
Scaramucci s abrupt removal came just 10 days after the wealthy New York financier was brought on to the West Wing staff, a move that convulsed an already chaotic White House and led to the departures of Sean Spicer, the former press secretary, and Reince Priebus, the president s first chief of staff.The decision to remove Mr. Scaramucci, who had boasted about reporting directly to the president not the chief of staff, John F. Kelly, came at Mr. Kelly s request, the people said.
Mr. Kelly made clear to members of the White House staff at a meeting Monday morning that he is in charge.It was not clear whether Mr. Scaramucci will remain employed at the White House in another position or will leave altogether.Via: Bloomberg News
