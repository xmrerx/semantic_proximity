With respect to the President s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration, I have no information that supports those tweets, and we have looked carefully inside the FBI.
The chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence said Monday that he doesn t believe Trump Tower was wiretapped, but left open the idea that there was other surveillance against President Trump by the Obama administration.
Let me be clear, I ve been saying this for several weeks, we know there was not a physical wiretap of Trump Tower.
However, it s still possible that other surveillance activities were used against President Trump and his associates, Chairman Devin Nunes, R-Calif., said during Monday s hearing on Russia s meddling in the U.S. election.Trump has said he was surveilled somehow, but has left it to Congress to discover how, and has declined to offer Congress evidence for his claim.
Trump has instead cited press reports that discussed the idea of surveillance against him.More broadly, Nunes said the failure of the U.S. intelligence community to get a handle on Russia has marked a large failure for the intelligence community and committee.
The fact that Russia hacked U.S. election-related databases comes as no shock to this committee, said Nunes.
We ve been closely monitoring Russia s aggression for years.
A year ago, I publicly stated that our inability to predict Putin s regime plans and intentions has been the biggest intelligence failure that we ve seen since 9/11, and that remains my view today.
