Never mind that a new poll shows Americans oppose bringing Syrian Refugees to America by a 2-1 margin!
Carry on King Barry to hell with the American people For five days a coordinated DC Media has been attacking as racists anyone opposed to President Obama s plan to resettle thousands of Syrians refugees here in America.
A new poll shows that the emotional blackmail being hurled by both Obama and his DC Media allies has failed miserably.
By nearly 2-to-1 (53% to 28%), Americans oppose the resettlement program.The Obama administration launched a hashtag last night to promote the concept of welcoming Syrian refugees into the United States after a growing number of governors proposed halting the program after the terrorist attacks in Paris.The White House debuted a hashtag on their Facebook page last night: #RefugeesWelcome Even as we intensify our efforts in coordination with our partners to take out ISIL, we cannot turn our backs on those most threatened by the terrorist group, the message on the White House page read.A video on the page insisted that U.S. law enforcement officials were vetting each of the refugees before allowing them to settle in the United States.On the White House website, Deputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security Amy Pope denounced Republicans for calling to block refugees in the country.
The Administration rejects the flawed view that we can t ensure our own safety while also welcoming refugees desperately seeking their own safety, she wrote.
The truth is: America can and must do both.
