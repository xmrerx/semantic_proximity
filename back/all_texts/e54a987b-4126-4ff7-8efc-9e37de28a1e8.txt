WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday defended a one-page analysis by the Treasury Department that asserted a tax plan pushed by the Republican-led Congress would pay for itself in 10 years.
“I think that estimate makes a lot of sense.
...
I do believe the Treasury when they say that this is going to unleash a lot of economic growth, which will accrue more revenues,” Ryan told reporters.
Chuck Schumer, the Senate Democratic leader, called the estimate “fake math” on Monday.
