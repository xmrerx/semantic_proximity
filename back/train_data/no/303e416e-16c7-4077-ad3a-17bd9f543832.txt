yep hillary s now a champion of lesbians and gay marriage .
or is she ?
it s hard to tell exactly what hillary stands for .
she seemed pretty adamant in the videos below that she was committed to preserving the sanctity of marriage between a man and woman .

her entire career has been a road map to get her to this moment and she has earned my respect and my vote to become the next president of the united states of america .
i am honored to join lpac and help lead our effort to elect hillary clinton in 2016 .
king , who was outed as a lesbian in 1981 , was a leader of the group women for hillary in 2008 , as well.but wait what about this video showing hillary s unyielding support for traditional marriage ? in the video released yesterday announcing clinton s candidacy for president , two gay couples were included .
among them , two lesbians who look lovingly into each other s eyes.however , in her 2008 campaign , clinton did not support gay marriage .
it took her five years to publicly say that she supported gay marriage .
