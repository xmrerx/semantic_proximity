Since the moment word got out about the firing of FBI Director James Comey, Democrats and their allies in the leftist media have been falling all over themselves to spew their hatred towards Trump and his unfair firing of James Comey.
Even though for months, Democrats and the leftist media have been outraged at Comey for the reopening of the FBI investigation into Hillary s e-mails just prior to the election, all is forgiven now.
It s time for the media and the Democrats to come together, regroup and focus on the real target President Trump.But now, FBI Director James Comey has made a statement about the firing, and it s not exactly what the media was hoping for.
Comey took the high road when he sent a letter on Wednesday to agents and friends regarding President Trump s firing of him the day before.
I have long believed that a President can fire an FBI director for any reason, or for no reason at all, he wrote, according to CNN.
I m not going to spend time on the decision or the way it was executed, Comey added.
I hope you won t either.
It is done, and I will be fine, although I will miss you and the mission deeply.
