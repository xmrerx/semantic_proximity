bill bennett has been the voice of reason for conservatives so it was incredibly important when he finally spoke out against the # nevertrump crowd .
bennett is like the quiet uncle who doesn t say much but when he does everyone listens because we know it s gon na be meaningful and right on target this statement is no exception : there are a lot of people in the middle and there are still undecided people .
he does not need to speak to the # nevertrumpers , some of my friends and maybe former friends who suffer from the terrible case of moral superiority and put their own vanity and taste before the interest of the country .
but he can speak to the middle and he can speak to the problems .
