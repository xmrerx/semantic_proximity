kabul ( reuters ) - a u.s. service member was killed in eastern afghanistan on saturday , the military said , without giving details of his identity or the circumstances of his death , which occurred as american forces have stepped up operations against the taliban .
a statement from u.s .
forces afghanistan command in kabul said the service member had died of wounds sustained during operations in logar , the eastern province where another service member was killed last week after a helicopter crash .
despite this tragic event , we remain steadfast in our commitment to the afghan people and to support them in our mutual fight against terrorism , gen. john nicholson , the top u.s. commander in afghanistan said in the statement .
the latest death comes after president donald trump ordered a boost in the number of u.s. troops assisting afghan forces against the taliban as part of a new strategy to try to break the stalemate with the insurgents .
although most u.s. troops are not in combat , the new strategy will give them greater authority to engage the taliban and will involve some acting as advisers at brigade and battalion level , bringing them much closer to the front line .
up to aug 23 , 10 u.s. service members had been killed in afghanistan this year , according to figures published last week by the congressional watchdog sigar , more than double the number killed in the same periods in 2015 and 2016 .
separately , the u.s. military said it was investigating reports of civilian casualties caused during a combined operation in the northern city of kunduz on friday and was assessing the facts surrounding the incident .
