Dunham interviewed Clinton in 2015 and the topic of Kravitz s wardrobe malfunction during a Stockholm concert, viewable here, came up.
Did you see the footage when his pants split?
Dunham asked Clinton.
No, I missed that, she replied.
I mean, his stuff fell out of his pants, Dunham said.
Yeah, you think I could get that, Clinton said, with Dunham adding, You can get that on YouTube.
It s on YouTube?
Good, I ll look for that, Clinton said.If Donald Trump had said something similar on camera, wouldn t it be considered locker room talk, if not more?
