quito ( reuters ) - an ecuadorean judge on monday ordered pre-trial detention for vice president jorge glas as part of an investigation into brazilian construction company odebrecht s corruption scandal .
glas , a 48-year-old electrical engineer , has been accused by senior members of the government of former president rafael correa of corruption while serving as a minister and vice president during seven years of correa s government .
judge miguel jurado approved a prosecutor s request for preventative detention on the grounds that glas allegedly accepted bribes , and also agreed to freeze his assets .
glas said the accusations lack evidence and are part of a politicized campaign against him .
don t worry , you don t have to search for me , i m where i always am , glas said via twitter .
i m not going to escape .
those who are innocent never flee .
fallout from the massive odebrecht corruption scandal has continued to sweep latin america .
the company , which has admitted to paying bribes to win contracts in a number of countries , has already paid $ 3.5 billion in settlements in the united states , brazil and switzerland .
a close ally of leftist ex-president rafael correa , glas served as correa s vice president from 2013 and retained the position under current president lenin moreno .
in august he was suspended from his duties by moreno , who accused him of not being a team player .
