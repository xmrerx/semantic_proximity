cape town ( reuters ) - south africa s main opposition party walked out of parliament on thursday , saying president jacob zuma was refusing to answer questions on how much the state had spent on legal fees fighting corruption allegations against him .
the walkout was led by democratic alliance leader mmusi maimane who asked how much had been spent since 1 may 2009 to defend 783 corruption charges against zuma that were dropped by the national prosecuting authority .
the charges were reinstated by the high court last year .
zuma lost an appeal to have the charges dropped and is still trying to prevent the npa from filing the charges .
