Ever since Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was forced to leave the 9/11 memorial in New York City yesterday due to health concerns (she was diagnosed with pneumonia), conservatives have been giddy and going insane with accusations that the former Secretary of State is in no condition to be president.MSNBC host Thomas Roberts had the perfect response to all the hype about Clinton s health on Monday when he had Republican National Committee (RNC) Communications Director Sean Spicer on his show and it s going to make the GOP furious while the rest of us laugh.
During the live interview with Spicer, Roberts suggested that the Republican might have pneumonia because he coughed a nod to the obsession conservative media has had with Clinton s health ever since she recently had a coughing fit during a rally.Roberts had been questioning Spicer about Republican nominee Donald Trump s charity work when Spicer coughed and cleared his throat.
Without skipping a beat, Roberts jumped in and asked, Is that pneumonia?
Spicer insisted that it was just a cough and Roberts moved on, asking Spicer if Trump would ever dare to release his taxes.
Roberts asked, So before election day, yes or no, do you think we ll get them?
Spicer replied, That s up to him to decide, and Roberts followed up by asking the RNC official, Do you care?
Spicer gave basically the same response Trump did several days ago, by saying, I don t think that s really top of mind for the American people right now even though it definitely is.
Even Trump s own supporters have been begging him to release his tax returns!Robert wrapped up the interview with yet another subtle dig at the GOP.
He said, Alright, Sean, good to have you with me.
I m glad that the cough is just that: a cough.
