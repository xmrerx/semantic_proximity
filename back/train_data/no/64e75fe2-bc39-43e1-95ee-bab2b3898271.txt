milan ( reuters ) - north korea s ambassador to italy will be expelled from the country in protest over pyongyang s recent nuclear and ballistic missile tests , italian foreign minister angelino alfano was quoted on sunday as saying .
however , alfano also told italian daily la repubblica that italy would not sever its diplomatic relations with north korea because he said it was useful to maintain a channel of communication .
the ambassador will have to leave italy , alfano said .
we want to impress on pyongyang that isolation is inevitable if they don t change tack .
the minister added that spain had similarly declared the north korean ambassador in madrid persona non grata , while portugal had severed diplomatic relations with pyongyang .
north korea is fast advancing toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland .
it conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on sept. 3 and has threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the pacific .
on saturday the united states said it was directly communicating with north korea on its nuclear and missile programs but that pyongyang had shown no interest in dialogue .
