msnbc s casey hunt was interviewing war-hawk and rino senator lindsey graham ( r-sc ) about the meeting donald trump jr. on capitol hill .
senator lindsey graham appeared to be concerned about trump s decision to meet with the russian lawyer who ended up only wanting to talk about adoptions .
graham inferred that trump jr. made a rookie mistake saying , on it s face , this is very problematic .
we can not allow foreign governments to reach out to anybody s campaign and say we d like to help you .
that is a non-starter .
i know that donald trump jr. is new to politics , i know that jared kushner is new to politics , but , um this is gon na require a lot of uh questions to be asked and answered .
msnbc was delighted to hear lindsey graham questioning trump jr. s judgement in agreeing to take the meeting .
graham continued to express his feelings about the meeting , suggesting that trump jr. should have to testify about what transpired in the alleged meeting .
graham was then asked by the msnbc reporter , do you think the white house has been truthful about the version of events that happened and their meetings that occurred between their associates and the russians ?
graham responded , it s been very frustrating to find out every couple of weeks about a new meeting .
i m sure they met with a lot of people during the campaign .
i m sure the clintons met with and just like magic , as soon as hillary s name was mentioned , graham s mic was cut ! and just like that boom !
mic cut .
msnbc had no issues with their sound while lindsey graham ( who got less than 1 % of support from voters against donald trump in a crowded field of gop candidates during the primaries ) was feigning concern over donald trump jr. s meeting with the russian lawyer , but mention hillary clinton , and boom the interview with msnbc is suddenly over.watch :
