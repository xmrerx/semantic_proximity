paris ( reuters ) - britain s oxford university said one of its professors , the prominent swiss muslim intellectual tariq ramadan , had taken a leave of absence after two women filed complaints against him in france alleging rape .
the university has consistently acknowledged the gravity of the allegations against professor ramadan , while emphasising the importance of fairness and the principles of justice and due process , oxford university said in a statement .
an agreed leave of absence implies no presumption or acceptance of guilt and allows professor ramadan to address the extremely serious allegations made against him , all of which he categorically denies , it added .
the geneva-born academic , the grandson of hasan al-banna , an islamist thinker and activist who founded the muslim brotherhood , has denied allegations made by the two women , including author henda ayari , who said he raped her at a muslim convention in 2012 .
the paris prosecutor last month opened a preliminary probe over the accusations following ayari s complaint .
ramadan filed a complaint for slander against her .
on tuesday ramadan published on his facebook page , in french , the same statement as oxford university , adding that he welcomed the university s handling of the situation .
separately , prosecutors on monday opened an investigation into death threats on twitter against satirical weekly charlie hebdo for a front page cover it published over the rape accusations targetting ramadan .
twelve people were killed at the magazine s headquarters in january 2015 , the first of a wave of militant attacks that has left more than 240 dead over the past two and a half years .
