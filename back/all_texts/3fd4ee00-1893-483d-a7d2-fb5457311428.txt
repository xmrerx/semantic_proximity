A longtime Republican Party donor based in Florida vowed not to contribute any more money to candidates or electioneering groups until they pass legislation banning the sale of assault weapons to civilians.Al Hoffman Jr., a real estate developer and former ambassador to Portugal, has donated millions to Republicans over the years.
On Saturday he sent an email to a half-dozen Republican donors, encouraging them to boycott candidates who oppose new gun legislation, the New York Times reported.
FOX The New York Times reports that Hoffman made this announcement via an email that he sent to Jeb Bush and Gov.
Rick Scott (R), among others.
Hoffman was a major contributor to the George W. Bush presidential campaign.
He also donated more than $1 million to a PAC supporting Jeb Bush s failed presidential campaign bid.Hoffman wrote, For how many years now have we been doing this having these experiences of terrorism, mass killings and how many years has it been that nothing s been done?
It s the end of the road for me.
He added, I will not write another check unless they all support a ban on assault weapons.
Enough is enough!
Predictably, the leftist media has now embraced the mega-Republican Party donor.
CNN s Ana Navaro tweeted her praise for Hoffman s ultimatum.
Navarro went as far as to call Republica Hoffman a friend : Very proud of my friend, Al Hoffman, for taking a stand.
He s a West Point grad.
He s a veteran.
Has served in many capacities.
He is a Republica.
A father.
A husband.

It must be noted that the Democrat ban did not ban the rifles, only the cosmetic features.
Is that what Hoffman has in mind?
