If Ivanka Trump really believes in religious tolerance she should tell her dad instead of the Twitterverse.Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly attacked Muslims in this country, and his immigration ban targets Muslims from 7 countries just because they happen to practice Islam.Furthermore, Trump has wide support from white nationalists, who also tend to be anti-Semitic.
Even Trump s top adviser Steve Bannon has been accused of being anti-Semitic.
Hate crimes against Jews are on the rise, yet Trump can barely bring himself to condemn anti-Semitism.So Trump has been unsympathetic to Jews and Muslims alike, all while giving special treatment to conservative Christians.And that s precisely why his daughter Ivanka got her ass handed to her after she tweeted her support of religious tolerance on Monday.America is a nation built on the principle of religious tolerance.
We must protect our houses of worship & religious centers.
#JCC Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) February 20, 2017Indeed, religious tolerance is a cornerstone of the foundation of America.
The question is, does she believe that applies to ALL religions?
If so, she should send a memo to her dad and tell him to stop attacking Muslims and condemn his anti-Semitic supporters and stop turning conservative Christian hatred into policy.
@IvankaTrump I wish there was someone else in your family who could get this message to a wider audience.

Have your dad to tell all his nazi/klan supporters to eff off.
Alex Leo (@AlexMLeo) February 21, 2017@IvankaTrump like white supremacist terrorists massacring houses of worship in Oak Creek & Charleston, which your father never condemned?

Stephen Falk (@stephenfalk) February 21, 2017@IvankaTrump Please talk to your father then.
If you want to stop being reviled, you can actually do some good.

@IvankaTrump Seriously #Ivanka?
Are you so tone-deaf, or drowning in hubris, that u don t realize how disingenuous & ironic this tweet is?
Andy Ostroy (@AndyOstroy) February 21, 2017@IvankaTrump you have your father muted on Twitter, don t you?
