Ted Nugent hits the nail on the head Ted Nugent and David Crosby are in the midst of a social-media spat over Nugent s claim that political correctness is keeping him out of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Crosby has dismissed the Motor City Madman s work as not good enough, while Nugent called the former Byrds star a bloated chemical repository in response.Nugent fired the first shot last week when he accused Hall of Fame boss Jann Wenner of hating the Second Amendment and the NRA, of which Nugent is a board member.
That s the only reason I m not in, Nugent said.
And until they get their heads out of their ass, I m more than happy to do what I do and do it with all the vim and vigor that I do it every night.
However, asked if he d like to be inducted, he replied, Hell, yes.
Crosby got involved on Monday, when he was asked via Twitter whether he agreed with Nugent s assessment, and replied: No, the a hole just isn t good enough.
When it was later suggested that the classic track Cat Scratch Fever alone might earn Nugent an induction, Crosby said: Nope.
No the asshole just isn't good enough https://t.co/tiJ4rJaX4S David Crosby (@thedavidcrosby) August 14, 2017Nugent fired back on Tuesday, taking to Facebook to say: Everybody knows that David Crosby is an evil rotten soulless punk that has criminally poisoned his bloated carcass his entire vapid life.
I couldn t be more proud that such an uncaring dirtbag hates me, while he competes with Michael Moore to see who can go the longest without hygiene.
Let s all pray he can form a syllable before his borrowed liver fails.
I laugh at his pathetic slovenliness.
