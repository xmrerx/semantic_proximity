jakarta ( reuters ) - six police were wounded and one killed in shootings that police alleged on monday were carried out by a separatist group that aims to disrupt operations at the grasberg copper and gold mine in indonesia s eastern-most province of papua .
four of the shootings took place on monday , while police were already investigating incidents that occurred over the weekend , including the fatal shooting of an officer in timika on sunday afternoon .
the armed group police say is behind the shootings has up to 30 separatist members led by a man named sabinus waker .
the group has carried out earlier shootings in the mine area as well , papua police spokesman suryadi diaz told reuters .
it s clear they want to disrupt operations at freeport , diaz said .
diaz said the group is demanding justice from the local unit of freeport-mcmoran inc , which operates the grasberg mine , although it was not clear what that might entail .
freeport is rich ( and ) has a big company .
the population are poor , diaz said .
it was not immediately possible to contact waker , and it is not known if the group that police say is led by him has a spokesman or other representative .
a spokesman for freeport s indonesian unit said the recent shootings have had no impact on output from grasberg , the world s second-biggest copper mine , but he declined to comment further .
pro-independence rebels in papua have waged a low-level conflict for decades , raising major concerns over security at grasberg .
between 2009 and 2015 , shootings within the mine project area killed 20 people and wounded 59 .
to protect workers and infrastructure , freeport contributed $ 21 million toward government-provided security in 2015 .
freeport has been grappling with labor problems at grasberg and a lengthy dispute with indonesia over rights to the giant mine that has cost both sides hundreds of millions of dollars .
