Sen. Bernie Sanders (I., Vt.) could not say on Wednesday where he got the information that thousands will die if Obamacare is repealed.Sanders made the claim while speaking with CNN s Jake Tapper but could not provide any specific sources that backed his assertion, instead referring to studies that have been done.
You ve said if this repeal and replace plan goes forward that thousands of Americans will die, Tapper said to Sanders.
Where do you get that estimate from?
I get that estimate from the fact that studies have been done that people who do not have health insurance, who do not go to the doctor when they should, who do not go to the hospital when they need to go, in fact die, Sanders said.
And thousands of people die every year because they don t have health insurance.
And if you throw 24 million people off of health insurance, there is no doubt that many thousands of people will die.
Jake Tapper then goes on to ask Bernie Sanders about the disastrous results of Obamacare, making insurance unaffordable for so many Americans.
Tapper tells Sanders, In many states Obamacare is in dire straights.
The governor of Minnesota, a liberal Democrat said the Affordable Care Act is unaffordable .
To his credit, Tapper continues with his line of questioning and actually shocks Sanders when he asks him, Don t the Democrats own this bill that in so many states is failing?
No, I think what the American, look, what you re saying is true, Sanders replied.
No one, certainly not me, that the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare, has many serious problems.
Deductibles are too high, premiums are too high, we still have too many people who don t have any health insurance, Sanders said.
It s too complicated, it s too bureaucratic.
WFBYEAH Okay Bernie whatever you say Watch:
