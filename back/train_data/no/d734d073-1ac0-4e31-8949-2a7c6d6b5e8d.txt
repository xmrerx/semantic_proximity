( reuters ) - virginia governor terry mcauliffe on wednesday vetoed a bill that would have allowed ministers and others refuse to marry gay couples because of their religious beliefs .
mcauliffe , a democrat , said the measure approved by the republican-controlled legislature was unconstitutional and would drive business away from the state .
“ although couched as a ‘ religious freedom ’ bill , this legislation is nothing more than an attempt to stigmatize , ” he said in a statement .
the republicans do not have enough votes in the state ’ s general assembly to override the veto .
the bill would have granted ministers and others empowered to wed people the right to deny marriage services to same-sex couples if performing them would violate their religious beliefs .
mcauliffe ’ s move comes just days after georgia ’ s republican governor said he would veto a similar bill after the measure drew national criticism ..
similar measures in states such as indiana and arkansas sparked criticism last year , forcing many lawmakers to retreat .
north carolina is also seeing protests over anew law that bars transgender people from choosing bathrooms consistent with their gender identity .
