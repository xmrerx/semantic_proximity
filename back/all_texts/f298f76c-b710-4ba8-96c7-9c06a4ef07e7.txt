Donald Trump s presidential campaign appears to be very worried about the prospect that a third-party campaign could eat into his votes, delivering the election victory to Hillary Clinton.Conservative writer and activist Bill Kristol has been trying to recruit a candidate to run against Trump and Clinton, for those on the right who have aligned themselves with the #NeverTrump movement.
The #NeverTrump crowd opposes Trump s campaign but can t bring themselves to support the Democratic nominee.
Kristol recently tried to stir up support for writer David French to get on the ballot, and that s when Team Trump freaked out.It was enough, apparently, to spook the Trump campaign.
Sources say that on Wednesday, influential supporters of the campaign, prompted by the campaign itself, began reaching out to the Republican National Committee, to Kristol, and to French attempting to quash the bid.
One Trump operative reached French s wife s family in Tennessee and told them, according to French, that he was instructed to call and deliver a message that the race would be very difficult for me.
It was a pretty big assault that really put pressure on David that this not happen, says a source familiar with the communications.As recent stories have indicated, it is highly likely that this thuggish maneuver came directly from Trump himself at the top.
He has shown an intense interest in micromanaging his campaign, while at the same time a paranoia about anyone who would oppose him (he recently speculated that his phone may be bugged).Eventually, French decided not to run, and #NeverTrump continues to flail as the Republican establishment backs Trump even with his insistence on running a racist presidential campaign.But now it is known that if someone decides to challenge Trump, especially directly from the right in a way that could hurt his already problematic campaign, he won t hesitate to reach out to their families for some old fashioned intimidation.Featured image via YouTube
