sydney ( reuters ) - a damaged pipeline that resulted in a fuel shortage across new zealand and grounded hundreds of flights will be restarted on sunday after repairs were completed , officials said .
this is a significant milestone , new zealand refining co ltd said in a statement on its website on saturday .
it said it expected to be delivering jet fuel to auckland airport between monday and wednesday .
repairs were completed late on friday .
more than 100 flights were canceled over the past three days and many more delayed , disrupting the plans of thousands of travelers .
the government called in the military to help truck in supplies of fuel just days before a general election .
damage to the 170 km ( 105 miles ) fuel line , which supplies almost all of the fuel for new zealand s largest city , was believed to have been caused by a digger .
refining nz chief executive sjoerd post later told new zealand media that full capacity would probably not return until early next year .
we are in a start-up process ... so we re going carefully , post told fairfax media .
he said the pipeline would operate at 80 per cent capacity until further tests were carried out over the next few months .
the new zealand government set up a commission to oversee the response to the crisis amid concerns raised by tourism industry officials about the impact on the international reputation of the south pacific island nation .
tourism has soared to record levels of more than 3.4 million visitors a year to new zealand .
