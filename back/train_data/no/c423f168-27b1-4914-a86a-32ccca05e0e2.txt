berlin ( reuters ) - german chancellor angela merkel said on friday that she wanted european union sanctions against russia lifted , but only once peaceful conditions had been achieved in eastern ukraine .
speaking at an election campaign rally in the eastern town of strasburg , merkel said russia s grave violations of international law made sanctions necessary .
i spend much of my time working to achieve reasonable , good relations with russia , merkel said , adding that she was trying , along with france , to achieve peaceful conditions in eastern ukraine , where moscow-backed separatists are fighting a war against the kiev government .
the moment we get that , we will also lift the sanctions , she said , adding that russia s annexation of the crimean peninsula from ukraine and its backing for separatists were against the principles that we have had in place since world war two .
if russia s actions were allowed to stand , there was a risk they would be repeated , merkel said .
