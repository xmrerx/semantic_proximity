rome ( reuters ) - russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said on friday that a u.s. threat to destroy north korea in the event of a war was a bloodthirsty tirade and military action against pyongyang would be a big mistake .
speaking on a visit to italy , lavrov strongly condemned comments made by u.s .
ambassador to the united nations nikki haley , who earlier this week warned north korea s leadership it would be utterly destroyed if war were to break out after pyongyang test fired its most advanced missile .
if someone really wants to use force to , as the u.s. representative to the united nations put it , destroy north korea ... then i think that is playing with fire and a big mistake , lavrov told reporters .
he called haley s speech on north korea , which she made at an emergency u.n. security council meeting , a really bloodthirsty tirade .
we will do everything to ensure that ( the use of force ) doesn t happen so that the problem is decided only using peaceful and political-diplomatic means , said lavrov .
later , addressing a rome conference , lavrov said russia and the united states both wanted north korea to disarm , but said washington would send a bad message if it walked away from a 2015 nuclear deal with iran .
u.s. president donald trump said in october he would not certify that tehran was complying with the 2015 deal and warned he might ultimately terminate it , accusing iran of not living up to the spirit of the accord .
if the united states drops out of this deal , it won t be very credible in the eyes of those who are now requested to drop their ( own ) nuclear program like north korea , lavrov said .
he added that most serious analysts ... and many officials in washington understood this .
