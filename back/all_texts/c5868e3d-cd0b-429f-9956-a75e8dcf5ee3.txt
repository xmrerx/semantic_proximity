BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - An abnormal sound detected in the South Atlantic ocean around the time that an Argentine navy submarine sent its last signal last week was consistent with an explosion, a navy spokesman said on Thursday.
Spokesman Enrique Balbi described the blast in the morning of Nov. 15 as abnormal, singular, short, violent and non-nuclear.
A huge sea and air hunt is being conducted for the ARA San Juan, which went missing with 44 crew on board.
