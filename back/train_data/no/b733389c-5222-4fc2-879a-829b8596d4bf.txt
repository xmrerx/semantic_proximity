beirut ( reuters ) - syrian rebels in a pocket of land near where the syrian , lebanese and israeli borders meet are negotiating a deal with the government to leave for other insurgent-held areas , rebel officials there said .
the syrian army , backed by russian air power , shi ite militias supported by iran and local fighters from the druze sect have besieged the rebel enclave around beit jin for weeks .
in recent days it captured various positions , leaving the rebels trapped inside the town itself .
there is now negotiation on the departure of fighters and those who wish to leave with them , said abu kanaan , an official in a local rebel group .
the militias are trying to convince them to evacuate to idlib ...
there has been no agreement reached yet , said ibrahim al-jebawi , an official with a free syrian army faction familiar with the situation .
syria s army and its allies have increasingly pushed for such evacuation deals for rebel enclaves near big cities or in other strategic locations after long periods of siege and bombardment .
the area around beit jin is sensitive because of its location next to the israel-controlled golan heights .
israel wants to keep lebanon s hezbollah , the most powerful of the iran-backed militias aiding syrian president bashar al-assad against the rebel groups , far away from its border with syria .
it has repeatedly targeted military positions in syria near the border after stray projectiles crossed into israeli-controlled areas , and it has struck hezbollah convoys and weapons caches inside syria .
