chicago ( reuters ) - a federal judge on thursday postponed until april the sentencing date for dennis hastert , convicted last year of a financial crime , because the former u.s. house speaker was still recovering from a stroke and life-threatening infection .
hastert pleaded guilty in october to a federal charge of “ structuring ” - evading bank reporting rules by withdrawing large amounts of cash in smaller increments - in a hush-money case stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct .
the 74-year-old , once one of the country ’ s most powerful politicians , went to the hospital in early november after a fall , his attorney , john gallo , told u.s. district judge thomas durkin .
hastert was treated for a spinal infection requiring surgery , a severe blood infection and suffered a stroke , nearly dying , gallo said .
durkin reset hastert ’ s sentencing for april 8 , from feb. 29 .
hastert currently requires 24-hour care .
he is able to feed himself and is articulate , but a doctor has said he should not leave his home except to go to the hospital .
gallo said hastert can still help prepare for his sentencing , and his doctors would know better about his prognosis in a month .
hastert faces up to five years in prison but prosecutors have recommended a sentence of six months or less , in exchange for his guilty plea .
hastert admitted to paying $ 1.7 million in cash to an individual he had known for decades to buy that person ’ s silence and compensate for past misconduct toward that individual .
prosecutors did not spell out the misconduct , but unnamed law enforcement officials have told media that it was sexual and involved someone hastert knew when he was a high school teacher and coach in his hometown of yorkville , illinois , in the 1960s and 1970s .
