a group called people s action just held their big gathering in washington , dc yesterday .
they had the usual suspects like keith ellison and socialist bernie sanders speak at the meeting .
they were protesting against cuts from the budget the bottom line is the radicals don t want any cuts to big government because they want to keep the cradle to grave freebies going .
socialist bernie sanders was ready to fill their minds with visions of freebies from big government.earlier today , the group decided to hit heritage foundation headquarters by storming the offices with 200 thugs.here s what they said : we re shutting it down at @ heritage because it continues to be @ realdonaldtrump s think tank .
