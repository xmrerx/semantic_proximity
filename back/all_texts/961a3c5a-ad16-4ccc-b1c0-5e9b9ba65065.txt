Donald Trump hasn t even been in office for a day and he is already declaring that gay people and people of color don t matter.Despite saying that he will work for all Americans during his inaugural address, his actions speak much louder than his words.As soon as he took control of the White House s website on Friday after the inauguration, Trump immediately removed pages from the issues section that deal with civil rights, the LGBT community, climate change, and healthcare.Here are some images grabbed by The Daily Beast.Trump replaced the Civil Rights page with a page supporting law enforcement that calls for more police officers and libels inner cities as crime-ridden and black people as criminals.
In our nation s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent, the site claims, which is a lie that the Daily Beast pointed out, saying, homicides in Washington, D.C. were down in 2016 over 2015.
Apparently, Trump s idea of civil rights for black people is hiring more racist police officers to execute them.Looking for some of these pages now redirects people to a page where Trump can send his gullible supporters bullshit propaganda.Clearly, Donald Trump intends to ignore civil rights and the LGBT community for the next four years as Republicans rush to legalize discrimination.This is especially frightening since Trump nominated the very racist Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions as his Attorney General, and has already decided to slash funding for the Civil Rights Division of the Justice Department.This is how quick democracy is dying in America.
Trump hasn t even been in charge for a day and he is already attacking civil rights and the LGBT community.
By removing both issues from the White House website, Trump just announced that he doesn t care about either.America is under attack from within and we can t afford to wait until 2018 to do something about it.Featured image via the Daily Beast
