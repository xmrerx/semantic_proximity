The majority of America has been wondering who actually is supporting Donald Trump.
He s been rejected in Chicago and protests have been a theme at his rallies throughout the country.
Yet, he does have support as evidenced by his trouncing of other GOP hopefuls who are just as crazy as he is but are prone to show it less.
So, who are Trump s supporters exactly?
This video shows us who these people are and how they think:Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiFMts60ZIQ]One man believed that the government is after Trump, turning the volatile and nasty Republican candidate into a victim or even a martyr of sorts.
I m for Trump cause he s being bullied by the government and they need to be together, the man said.
And when asked about the frequent counter-protests against Trump, he defended the Republican candidate.
I m not racist and I don t think he s racist, though he admitted Trump should have denounced the KKK.Another man believes in Trump s honesty and thinks Bernie will control his every move: I think Trump is honest.
We don t need a Barack in office no more, because he s a liar.
He can t be direct.
Hillary Clinton is a criminal.
Bernie Sanders is a socialist.
He believes in taking away all our freedoms.
He ll control the way we eat, the way we sleep, the way we live.
These remarks border on paranoia and misinformation.
If these people just looked a little closer and deeper at who they re voting for, they would see a racist, a demagogue, and someone who s already done damage to this country.
One can only imagine the damage he would do should he become president.
