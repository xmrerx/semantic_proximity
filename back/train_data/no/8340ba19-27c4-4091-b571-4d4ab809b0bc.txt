the hague ( reuters ) - appeals judges at the yugoslav war crimes tribunal upheld on wednesday the convictions of six bosnian croats found guilty of war crimes and crimes against humanity during the 1990s , in the court s last verdict before it closes next month .
the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia ( icty ) , established by the united nations in 1993 , is due to close when its mandate expires at the end of the year .
the six former high-level politicians and defense officials were convicted in 2013 of participating in an ethnic cleansing campaign against bosnian muslims .
they include jadranko prlic , a former defense minister , whose 25 year jail sentence was upheld on wednesday .
he had been found guilty of being part of a criminal enterprise by the wartime croatian government of late president franjo tudjman , to create an ethnically pure state .
zagreb , which maintained it had clean hands in the bloody 1992-95 war in bosnia , had wanted that finding overturned .
however the appeals chamber concluded that it was not shown that the earlier judges had misinterpreted relevant evidence of tudjman and zagreb s confirmed croatia s role in the bosnian conflict .
several convictions for specific crimes for prlic and the five others were reversed in the appeal , but president judge carmel agius said all six remain convicted of numerous and very serious crimes .
