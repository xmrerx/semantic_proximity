harare ( reuters ) - zimbabwe s first lady grace mugabe hit the campaign trail with her husband robert on friday , urging discipline in his party two weeks after she faced assault charges in south africa .
grace , who is seen as a possible successor to her 93-year-old husband , was accused of assaulting a model at an upmarket johannesburg hotel , but flew home after a minister granted her immunity .
the first lady did not refer to the incident in her first speech since returning , instead telling a zanu-pf party rally that supporters should stand behind africa s oldest leader in the build-up to next year s elections .
we have a very unique position in zimbabwe where we have our president who will soon be 94 years because that is what god decreed .
no man of flesh can stop that , grace said in the speech broadcast on state television .
south africa s main opposition democratic alliance ( da ) party is challenging the international relations minister s decision to give her immunity - a move that could in theory affect any future plans to travel to the country .
twenty-year-old model gabriella engels accused grace mugabe of whipping her with an electric extension cable as she waited with two friends in a luxury hotel suite to meet one of the mugabes adult sons .
