islamabad ( reuters ) - the family of a former director of the turkish pakturk schools in pakistan has been abducted by authorities in the eastern city of lahore , the human rights commission of pakistan ( hrcp ) said , less than a year after pakistan sought to deport them .
pakistan has forged close ties with turkey in recent years and president tayyip erdogan , who opposes the pakturk schools , has made several state visits to islamabad .
turkey has accused the schools of alleged links to turkish cleric fethullah gulen , or his hizmet movement , which erdogan says was behind a failed coup attempt in turkey last year .
pakturk schools deny such links but in november last year pakistan ordered their turkish teachers to leave the country .
hrcp said mesut kacmaz , former director of the pakturk international schools and colleges , was picked up on wednesday by 20 armed individuals , according to their turkish neighbor who spoke to the rights group .
kacmaz , his wife , and two daughters were , roughed-up , hooded , handcuffed and taken in a wagon to a furnished house where several other interrogators were also present , hrcp , a non-governmental organization , said in a statement late on wednesday .
hrcp urges the government to immediately release the kacmaz family and desist from deporting them .
there are credible reports of other turkish educationists being arrested upon their arrival in turkey and their subsequent torture .
the punjab province s police department did not respond to requests for comment .
hrcp said the family has been living in pakistan for the past year on a valid united nations asylum seeker certificate .
the schools educate more than 10,000 students in pakistan .
