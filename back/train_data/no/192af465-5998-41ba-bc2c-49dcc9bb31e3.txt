pay close attention to the 1:01 mark , where he rubs his left index finger into the corner of his eye ( exactly like he did last week ) pauses , ( like he did last week ) puts his head down and pauses a bit longer ( waiting for the menthol to work ) and then ( exactly like last week ) he lifts his head and exposes the tears flowing , but only from the eye he put his finger in before tears ever began flowing : this is a character issue .
whether you disagree or agree with his gun control agenda is not the issue here .
the point is , if the elected leader of the greatest nation on earth is willing to stand in front of millions and place menthol in his eye in order to make himself cry fake tears , to persuade americans we need gun control , why should americans believe anything he has to say ?
