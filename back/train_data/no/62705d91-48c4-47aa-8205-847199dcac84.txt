washington it sits on the corsica river along the eastern shore , a 45-acre russian compound known as the washington dacha to those who use it.when it was closed on thursday as part of the white house s response to what it called russian interference during the presidential election , questions began to swirl around what took place at the estate in queen anne s county .
the main reason it was used was to get rid of spy gear , and to possibly have private conversations , said pete earley , author of the book comrade j : the untold secrets of russia s master spy in america after the end of the cold war .
the property in centreville , maryland , consists of two georgian-style mansions , six guest cottages , a pool and tennis court .
it was mainly a retreat for russian diplomats stationed in washington according to earley and wasn t used as a site for spying activities.the site , however , did play a small role in russian espionage , earley said.as the story goes , according to earley , russian generals at the compound wanted a speed boat to use on the water , but the only one docked there was for diplomats .
