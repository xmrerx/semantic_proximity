The left believes they are winning this war.
Radical organizations funded by George Soros and other radical leftists are paying protesters to join anarchists in the war against America.
This is a must watch debate with two conservative men who are unafraid to take on one of the mouthpieces of the left and call them out on their agenda.Steve Malzberg from NewsMax TV and Nomiki Konst, the radical executive director of the Accountability Project, joined Jim Hoft of Gateway Pundit to discuss the Ferguson mobs and myths and Barack Obama s stellar record on race relations.Nomiki is a committed leftist and accused Donald Trump of being a racist.
Steve Malzberg let her have it.
We ended with a discussion on how Barack Obama destroyed race relations in this country.
