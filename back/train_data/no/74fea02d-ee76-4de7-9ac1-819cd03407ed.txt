it seems that donald trump is often incapable of avoiding really stupid , but public , mistakes on twitter .
oftentimes those are spelling errors , and sometimes they re factual errors , but sometimes they re just bizarre .
april 26 is melania s birthday , and to look like a good husband , he tweeted a happy birthday message to her .
across the bottom of the image is a banner that reads , first lady melania trump 4.26.2017 , with an american flag.happy birthday to our @ flotus , melania !
https : //t.co/ryyp51mxdq pic.twitter.com/np7kyhglsv donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) april 26 , 2017see the problem ?
the flag on that banner there never existed .
it only has 39 stars the u.s. has never had a 39-star flag .
in 1889 , flag makers were making 39-star flags in anticipation of north and south dakota becoming states , but they thought that they would be admitted as one state , not two .
in addition , three other states were added to the union in 1890 .
we went from 38 states to 43 , which made the 39-star flag useless before it was even official.as is always the case , twitter locked onto the fact that the man in the white house , who holds the highest office in the land , tweeted a fake flag : @ christinawilkie @ chrislhayes @ flotus @ eventsforgood how soon before we find out a 39-star american flag is some sort of alt-right meme ?

someone on your staff needs to purge his computer , since this is 2nd time this has happened lewis shatzer ( @ shatzer667192 ) april 27 , 2017maybe the 39-star flag is the last one that russia recognizes .
