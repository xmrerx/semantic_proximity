Justin Timberlake gave a speech at the 2016 iHeartRadio Music Awards Sunday night, and he took a few shots and made a couple of jokes about Republican frontrunner Donald Trump.
In a speech dedicated to Taylor Swift who won the Best Tour award, Timberlake said that Swift breaks down walls and others build them.In a clear reference to Donald Trump, Timberlake said, Some people are out here to build walls.
We ain t naming no names That was a political joke.
The crowd then broke into laughter.
He then told the largely underage audience, Shut up!
You can t even vote.
Taylor chooses to knock down walls and invites everyone to be on her #squad, Timberlake continued.One would have to ask the question of why this would even be a story.
However, Timberlake clearly realizes that he has a very important and rare platform.
He s someone who has the potential to both reach and influence tens of millions of people, many of whom both idolize him and at the same time can vote.His words have the potential to resonate to many out there to go out and vote and make the right choice when voting.
That choice is clearly not Donald Trump or Ted Cruz.Watch video here:https://youtu.be/p0CZJO3hzfo Featured image via video screenshot.
