How much more depraved does a so-called pastor have to get before people acknowledge that he is not a real Christian?Because one would think that conservative Christians of all people would be absolutely opposed to Donald Trump after his lewd comments about groping women came to light on Friday.But evangelical leaders are willing to abandon their own supposed values and continue supporting Trump as long as it means Hillary Clinton does not become president.Family Research Council head Tony Perkins made that clear on Saturday when he STILL voiced support for Trump despite his grab them by the p*ssy remark.
My personal support for Donald Trump has never been based upon shared values, it is based upon shared concerns about issues such as: justices on the Supreme Court that ignore the Constitution, America s continued vulnerability to Islamic terrorists and the systematic attack on religious liberty that we ve seen in the last 7 1/2 years, Perkins said.Ralph Reed of Faith and Freedom Coalition basically said the same thing.
Voters of faith are voting on issues like who will protect unborn life, defend religious freedom, create jobs, and oppose the Iran nuclear deal.
Ten-year-old tapes of private conversation with a television talk show host rank very low on their hierarchy of concerns.
In other words, Trump could sexually assault all the women he wants and still be supported by conservative Christian leaders.And that includes 700 Club preacher Pat Robertson, who called Trump s behavior macho while continuing to endorse him for president.
A guy does something 11 years ago, it was a conversation in Hollywood where he s trying to look like he s macho, Robertson said on Monday.
And 11 years after that they surface it from The Washington Post or whatever, bring it out within 30 days or so of the election and this is supposed to be the death blow and everybody writes him off, Okay, he s dead, now you ve got to get out of the way and let Mike Pence run the campaign.
Robertson proceeded to declare Trump the winner of Sunday night s debate and called him a Phoenix rising from the ashes of an imploded campaign.Here s the video via YouTube.These hypocrites have been whining for years about how America needs a president who shares their so-called biblical values, but now they couldn t care less about those values as long as they can put a puppet in the White House who will rubber stamp their extreme religious agenda and force it upon the nation, even if the candidate they want is totally unfit for the office.
These people are NOT Christians.
They merely used religion to gain power and wealth and if conservatives actually had spines they would toss these pretenders out on their asses for disgracing the church.Featured Image: Screenshot
