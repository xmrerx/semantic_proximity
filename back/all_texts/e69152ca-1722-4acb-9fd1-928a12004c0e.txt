Donald Trump has shown his true colors time and time again while running for the Republican nomination for the presidency.
Thus far we ve discovered that he advocates for violence at his rallies, he has racist tendencies, and he says many creepy things about women, including his own daughter.
While all of these factors have put a dent in his possible nomination, he still has a comfortable delegate lead and he polls well in upcoming contests.
Despite the overwhelming evidence that Trump is a certified douche bag, there are voters out there who find his insanity appealing.
Now comes another video that the hacker collective Anonymous posted that proves just how absurd it would be to elect this man as the representative of our country and the symbol of our nation.Watch video here:The clip was taken in 2007 at Wrestlemania, and it shows Donald Trump tackling professional wrestling promoter Vince McMahon and then beating him to the ground.
Trump then triumphantly pumps his fists in the air.
A disgruntled McMahon is then tied to a chair and Trump is shown shaving his head as the crowd cheers him on.While this video is quite entertaining, it s very hard to imagine that the guy we just watched clotheline and shave Vince McMahon s head could be the leader of our military, the planner of our economy, and the guy who represents America to the world.Let s hope that Donald Trump running for president is just a short and funny clip in America s history and nothing more.
