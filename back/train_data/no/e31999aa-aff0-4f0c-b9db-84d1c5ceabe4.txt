baghdad ( reuters ) - islamic state militants holed up west of baghdad launched their biggest attack on iraqi troops in months on wednesday , security sources said , killing at least seven soldiers before being forced to retreat .
the fighting , near the city of ramadi in anbar province , continued for several hours after the militants attacked with suicide car bombs , mortars and machine guns , the sources said .
bolstered by reinforcements , iraqi forces killed 16 militants , state tv said , citing military commanders .
warplanes chased those who fled , it said .
according to a preliminary toll from security sources , the attack killed at least seven soldiers and wounded 16 , making it one of the biggest since government troops recaptured ramadi from islamic state in december 2015 .
a low-intensity guerrilla war has continued in the region .
the jihadist group remains in control of a pocket north of baghdad , hawija , and a stretch of land across the syrian-iraqi border , where iraqi forces launched offensives this month supported by a u.s.-led international coalition .
the caliphate that islamic state declared over parts of iraq and syria effectively collapsed in july , when iraqi forces captured its de facto capital mosul .
