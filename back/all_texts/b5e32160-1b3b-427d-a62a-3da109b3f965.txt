Rush Limbaugh praised Donald Trump s insanely embarrassing press conference, so now he is referring to Limbaugh as real news.It s clear that Trump is going to continue calling any media outlets who criticize him fake news.
Trump even demanded during his press conference on Thursday that the media should take him at his word at all times and that he should get to decide when the media can write bad stories about him.The public is you know, they read newspapers, they see television, they watch.
They don t know if it s true or false.
Because they are not involved.
I m involved.
I ve been involved with the stuff all my life.
But I m involved.
I know when you are telling the truth or when you are not I know when I should get good and when I should get bad.
And sometimes I say, wow, that s going to be a great story, and I ll get killed.
I know what s good and bad, I d be a good reporter, but not as good as you.
I know what s good.
I know what s bad.
And when they change it, and make it really bad, something that should be very positive, they ll make it okay.
They ll even make it negative.
I understand it.
So because I m there.
I know what was said.
I know who is saying it.
I m there.In other words, Trump wants to lie his ass off and he wants the media to be his propaganda machine.Rush Limbaugh is apparently fine with that and Trump praised him for it on Friday on Twitter.Thank you for all of the nice statements on the Press Conference yesterday.
Rush Limbaugh said one of greatest ever.
Fake media not happy!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017Trump literally just called his critics fake media while suggesting that Limbaugh is real news because he said nice things about him.The Internet showed no mercy.
@realDonaldTrump Rush eats 30 Percocets before breakfast, so he thought you were an orange dancer at the Bongo Gentlemen s Club in Orlando.
Jeffrey Grubb (@JeffGrubb) February 17, 2017@realDonaldTrump I know you only listen to people who tell you that you are great, but your performance was an embarrassment to the country.

(@Stareagle) February 17, 2017@realDonaldTrump You re worryingly delusional.
The conference was a complete shambles.
You were extremely rude to attending journalists.

It was comedy gold.
The Black Caucus, Uranium, really fake news you gave SNL material for years!

#laughingstock Bill Shapiro (@Bill_Shapiro) February 17, 2017@realDonaldTrump, Rush Limbaugh isn t news.
On the other hand, even @FoxNews criticized your one-man show as crazy https://t.co/f8gDPFuWcy Joseph Amodeo (@josephamodeo) February 17, 2017@realDonaldTrump That press conference was a national disgrace of historic proportion.

(@VeeVee) February 17, 2017Donald Trump is pathetic.
Rush Limbaugh is a proven liar, racist, and sexist who will say anything to get attention.
In short, it looks like Trump found his new BFF.Featured image via screenshot
