hilarious and spot-on conservative , social-media giant , paul joseph watson announced on twitter that he was done !
.
after waking up to discover that facebook banned him for a parody video that made fun of feminism that he posted over 18 months ago , watson had had enough ! youtube has been banning pro-trump videos .
watson mentioned the dynamic pro-trump duo diamond and silk and how they re talking about filing a class-action suit against youtube for demonetizing their videos because all of their advertisers may not agree with their ( pro-trump ) views .
watson claims youtube has demonetized every single video he s made that criticized islam.watson says he needs to seriously think about whether it s worth investing hundreds and hundreds of hours my time every year into something that could completely disappear when i wake up tomorrow morning .
i ll probably ride it until the wheels fall off , but this is it for now .
we defeated hillary .
we hit a million subscribers .
we had a good run .
better to burn out than to fade away watch :
