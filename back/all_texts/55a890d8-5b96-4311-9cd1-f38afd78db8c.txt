WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The majority leader of the U.S. Senate, Republican Mitch McConnell, said on Tuesday he was still considering a bill that would allow U.S. citizens to sue the Saudi Arabian government over the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks and had not set a date for debating the legislation.
“I’m still looking at it,” McConnell told reporters.
