WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday declined to rule out the possibility of additional prisoners being transferred from the U.S. naval facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, before President Barack Obama leaves office on Friday.
White House spokesman Josh Earnest said he could not rule out such a move while speaking to reporters at a daily news briefing, one day after Oman announced that it had taken in 10 prisoners released from the facility.
