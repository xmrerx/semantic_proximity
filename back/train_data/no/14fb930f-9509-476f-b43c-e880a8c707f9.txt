say what ? the iranian parliament has rejected the formal , legal text of president barack obama s nuclear deal , negotiated in july by the u.s. , u.k. , france , germany , russia , china and the tehran regime.instead , the majilis approved their own version of the joint comprehensive plan of action ( jcpoa ) , creating a situation where the iranian government simply hasn t signed on to the accord that obama and democratic senators obligated the united states to uphold.western media incorrectly reported that the majilis approved the actual text of the jcpoa , according to experts.new york post columnist amir taheri has explained in a series of social media posts that iran s version of the deal calls for the cancellation of sanctions against the regime in tehran.he also noted that iran s version of the nuke deal calls for the dismantling of israel s nuclear weapons program , citing iranian parliamentarian kazem jalali.the middle east media research center ( memri ) , a regional watchdog organization , has confirmed that iran did not pass the deal agreed upon in july .
they instead voted to pass the amended version by a vote of 161-59.iranian lawmakers tried to unilaterally amend the deal to strip the united states ability to snapback sanctions should the tehran regime cheat the agreement .
they also replaced the language to ensure that the deal will cancel sanctions forever , instead of suspending them , memri reported.the middle east monitoring group added that the decision to amend the deal unilaterally came at the behest of iran s dictator , ali khamenei , who on september 3 promised not to honor the agreement with obama.moreover , the american enterprise institute s iran tracker site noted that iran considered its unilateral amendments to the deal as four minor changes .
separately , as iranian regime parliamentarians were voting on their own version of the nuke deal , its military was testing a precision-guided ballistic missile in direct violation of united nations security resolution 1929.the iranian government has ramped up its regional aggression in the past few months , as iran is set to soon receive tens of billions of dollars in unfrozen assets.tehran s military is now deeply involved in the ongoing civil war in syria , with some estimates stating that there are 7,000 soldiers in syria attempting to prop up bashar al-assad s dictatorial rule .
iran has also continued to provide aid and arms to terror groups hamas and hezbollah , and has assisted the houthi insurgents in yemen .
multiple gulf states have also accused the regime of backing terrorist movements that seek to overthrow their governments .
