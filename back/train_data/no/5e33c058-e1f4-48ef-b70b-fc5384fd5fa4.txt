istanbul ( reuters ) - a turkish court has freed on bail a british citizen facing charges of joining a terrorist organization , turkey s ihlas news agency said on friday .
joseph robinson , a former british soldier , is accused of fighting with the syrian kurdish ypg milita .
he was arrested in july while on holiday in the southwestern turkish town of didim , ihlas said .
robinson denies the charge and said during his defense at an initial hearing that he went to syria to help provide medical assistance to victims of the civil war there , ihlas said .
turkey considers the ypg to be an extension of the kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) , which has waged a three-decade insurgency in turkey s southeast and is designated a terrorist organization by the united states and the european union as well as turkey .
robinson faces a jail sentence of up to 10 years if found guilty , local media said .
his bulgarian fiance , who is accused of terrorist propaganda in the same case , was released before the start of the trial but imposed with a travel ban .
the next hearing in the case is set for march 12 .
