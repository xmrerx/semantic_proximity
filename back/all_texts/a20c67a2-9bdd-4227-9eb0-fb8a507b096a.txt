Hayley Geftman-Gold, a professional, a wife, and a mother of 3 young children, is a perfect example of someone most people would tend to think has it all, but in reality, she is the poster child, for all that is wrong with the intolerant, and hate-filled left today CBS has parted ways with one of the company s top lawyers after she said she is not even sympathetic to victims of the Las Vegas shooting because country music fans often are Republican, when discussing the tragic mass shooting that occurred in Las Vegas late Sunday night.
This individual, who was with us for approximately one year, violated the standards of our company and is no longer an employee of CBS.
Her views as expressed on social media are deeply unacceptable to all of us at CBS.
Our hearts go out to the victims in Las Vegas and their families, a CBS spokeswoman told Fox News.Hayley Geftman-Gold, the network s now-former vice president, and senior counsel took to Facebook after a gunman opened fire at the Route 91 Harvest Music Festival in Las Vegas, killing at least 58 people and sending more than 520 others to hospitals.
If they wouldn t do anything when children were murdered I have no hope that Repugs [sic] will ever do the right thing, Geftman-Gold wrote in a now-deleted message that was first reported and captured by The Daily Caller.Geftman-Gold continued: I m actually not even sympathetic bc [sic] country music fans often are Republican gun toters [sic].
