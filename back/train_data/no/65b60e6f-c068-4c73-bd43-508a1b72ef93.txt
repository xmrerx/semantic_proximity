bangkok ( reuters ) - a thai court issued arrest warrants against five people on thursday over the discovery of a cache of weapons , including figures with links to the red shirt followers of former prime minister thaksin shinawatra .
police said they found the cache in a swamp south of bangkok and believed the weapons were hidden during the instability that led up to a coup in 2014 .
among those named in the arrest warrants was exiled dissident jakrapob penkair , 50 , who served as thaksin s spokesman from 2003 to 2005 and then as a minister in a later government backed by thaksin .
police said another of the five , retired lieutenant general manas paolik , 68 , had given himself up .
he had served as commander for thailand s third army under thaksin , he faces charges including illegal procession of weapons and ammunition as well as organized crime , said police colonel suwat sangnoom , deputy head of the crime suppression division .
thailand s longstanding political divide is between a populist movement led by thaksin , who was overthrown in 2006 , and the yellow shirt supporters of a conservative bangkok-based establishment .
the army seized power in 2014 in the name of ending street protests against thaksin s sister , yingluck , who was prime minister at the time .
both shinawatras fled into exile .
thailand s ruling junta has said intelligence reports show groups plotting against the government , citing that as a reason to maintain a ban on political activity .
it has promised to hold elections in a year s time .
critics of the government accuse it of using the alleged plots as a pretext to prolong military rule .
the junta had initially promised to hold elections in 2015 .
