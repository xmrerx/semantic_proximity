Sen. Jefferson Beauregard Sessions III, Donald Trump s friendly but fierce Alabama ally, has a message for Republicans still queasy about their party s nominee: Tide s about to roll over you.
Sessions, a 69-year-old former state attorney general who famously donned the Make America Great Again trucker s cap at a massive rally in Mobile last August, thinks Trump is more a movement than a man.
And this sprightly son of country preachers and teachers is on a mission to evangelize maybe-Trumpers like House Speaker Paul Ryan on the Gospel According to Donald with a sermon on self-preservation.
My advice is to listen and accept the will of the American people, the Republican voters the Republican Party is the Republican voters, he added a pointed reference to Ryan s suggestion that he, and not the presumptive party nominee, represents authentic conservative values.
Give me a break!
A lot of our drift within our party has gotten away from the will of the voters.
I think the leaders in all parties tend to adjust to reality.
They just have to or they won t remain in office.
Already many are sensing it.
