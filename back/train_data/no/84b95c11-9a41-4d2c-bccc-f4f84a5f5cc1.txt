president trump was right again !
he said mob rule of removing statues is a slippery slope .
where does it end ?
a great example of the problem is the latest statue to be vandalized : on top of people calling for the removal of george washington s statue and the jefferson memorial , vandals in california have pointed their crosshairs at recently-canonized st. junipero serra.according to a cbs local report , a photo circulating the rounds on facebook shows that a statue of junipero serra alongside a native american boy in a park across from mission san fernando was vandalized with red paint and the word murder written in white .
the native american boy had a swastika painted across his chest.city officials could not confirm the photo s authenticity .
however , when investigators went to the site , they did indeed see red paint on serra s arm and a swastika painted on the child next to him , which means the neighboring catholic mission apparently cleaned the statue as best they could to avoid drawing controversy.that would make perfect sense , considering that whenever the left gets their hands on controversy like this , they always show up to get their inner bolshevik on.some of the people interviewed by cbs expressed disapproval of the statue s presence , falsely claiming that st. junipero serra sought the destruction of native american culture.read more : daily wire
