pittsfield , new hampshire is an unlikely place for something like an isis flag to show up .
that s why neighbors were shocked when the terrorist flag appeared in a local neighborhood hanging from a fence near the town dam and river .
police immediately removed the flag from the fence which was on state property.just an fyi : in the past 5 months , the state department has settled 290 muslim refugees in new hampshire.pittsfield , nh has been designated a welcoming city which is code for bring on the refugees !
if you want to know the number of refugees who have come to your town in the past 5 months , please go here : wrapsnetauthorities are working with the fbi and have questioned a person of interest in this effort to flaunt a terrorist symbol .
the local authorities are now working with the fbi to determine if a crime was actually committed this chart is ridiculous !
why are these people still here ?
why should americans have to put up with having isis anywhere near us ?
the pittsfield police chief had this to say about the flag : giving what that flag represents , it understandably caused public alarm and concern .
the flag itself is probably going to be protected under freedom of speech .
the response from neighbors is great : neighbors are responding by flying american flags outside of their own homes.so what re we supposed to do about this person of interest ?
will they now be on a watch list ?
it would be great to know more about this individual and their background.read more : wgme
