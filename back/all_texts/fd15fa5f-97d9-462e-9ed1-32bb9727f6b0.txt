President Obama has shown he s a human being with compassion time and again.
Most recently, he met a 12-year old boy with severe cerebral palsy who had just been at a Trump rally the day before.
What happened to him at the rally is exactly why Trump fans are deplorable, but Obama showed them how to act like humans, even if they aren t capable of it.J.J.
Holmes braved one of Trump s rallies in order to protest the way that Trump makes fun of people with disabilities.
Since he was a protester, he was very unwelcome already, but when Trump identified him and started saying, Get them out, security began trying to usher them away while Trump s deplorables pushed and kicked his wheelchair, according to J.J. s mother, Alison.Alison spoke to a pool reporter from the White House, saying, We were put out by security, and The crowd started chanting U-S-A and pushing his wheelchair.
As she said that, her son kept saying, I hate Donald Trump, I hate Donald Trump, through his vocalization device.The Trumpkins proved beyond any doubt that they have a black abyss where their hearts should be with that vile act.Trump has come under fire before for mocking disabled people, most specifically when he made fun of Serge Kovalesky, who works for The New York Times and suffers from a chronic condition that s immobilized his right arm.
Of course, he denied he was making fun of anyone, let alone someone with a disability, but that s par for the course for Trump.He and his loyal subjects literally care nothing about anyone but themselves.
And his fans are deluded he ll hurt them as much as he ll hurt the rest of the country in his quest to prove his legitimacy and gather power.
Would Trump ever do this?Yesterday, this young man was kicked out of a Trump rally.
As he was leaving, people kicked at his wheelchair.
Today, he met his President.
