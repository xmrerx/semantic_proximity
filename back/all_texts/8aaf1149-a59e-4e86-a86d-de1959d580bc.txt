Trump just can t stop embroiling himself in scandal, and his week-old accusation that the Obama administration wiretapped his tower is just getting bigger and bigger.
Congress is demanding his evidence.
Various House Republicans have said they have no evidence.
FBI Director James Comey has publicly denied the claims.
And now it seems that stupid attempt to make Obama look like a criminal may, in fact, make him guilty of obstruction of justice.
That is an impeachable offense.Back in November, a right-leaning website, Heat Street, reported on the existence of a FISA warrant that would allow the FBI to monitor two Russian banks that were communicating with a server in Trump Tower.
That s all reporter Louise Mensch didn t say that any wiretaps actually existed.In talking to MSNBC today, Mensch dropped a bombshell on Trump s claims.
She flat said: For once, I think it s possible the president does not have a fake news problem.
I think he may have a real news problem, being that, what if there really is a wiretap at Trump Tower?
The problem the president has then is that I didn t report that, and neither did any other journalist, which means that if he tweeted evidence in an ongoing, top-secret case, then he obstructed justice, and that s an impeachable offense.
She goes on to say that she believes the reason the White House has more or less gone silent is not the possibility that the wiretap claims are fake it s the possibility that they re real.
Trump could have gotten himself in a world of shit with those tweets.She also says that the White House s desperation to find a member of the press who reported the wiretaps before Trump did is because they re terrified that he committed obstruction of justice.
Nobody in the press ever said there was a wiretap.
The press reported on his accusations and the FISA warrant.
