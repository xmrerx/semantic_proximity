moscow ( reuters ) - a russian court sentenced opposition leader alexei navalny to his third jail term this year on monday , disrupting plans by the long-time kremlin critic to campaign before russia s coming election .
russia holds a presidential election in march next year .
the incumbent vladimir putin has yet to announce his candidacy but is widely expected to do so and to win .
navalny hopes to run , even though russia s central election commission declared him ineligible because of a suspended prison sentence , which he says was politically motivated .
he was detained by police on friday as he left his moscow home to attend a pre-election rally in a provincial town and later charged with repeatedly violating laws governing the organisation of public meetings and rallies .
a court sentenced him to 20 days in jail on monday , a term which means he will miss a campaign rally planned in putin s hometown of st petersburg on oct. 7 - the russian leader s birthday .
old man putin is so scared of our meetings in the regions that he decided to make himself happy with a small gift for his jubilee , navalny said on twitter after his sentencing .
navalny has been jailed twice already this year after organising rallies and protests against government corruption .
russian opposition activists say they are coming under increased pressure as the election approaches , with authorities frequently turning a blind eye to violent attacks .
