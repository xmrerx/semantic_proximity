Another conservative Christian pastor is praising the killing of 49 people who were shot at an Orlando gay nightclub last weekend.In response to Sacramento Pastor Roger Jimenez lamenting that the Orlando shooter didn t kill every last person in the club that night and calling for the government to line every gay person in America against a wall and execute them via firing squad, Fort Worth Pastor Donnie Romero of the Stedfast Baptist Church applauded the hateful sermon and added his sickening two cents.Romero claimed that all gay people are pedophiles even though that s a complete and utter lie, and he asked God to finish the job and kill any of the wounded victims who are still in the hospital.
These 50 Sodomites were all perverts and pedophiles and they are the scum of the earth and the earth is a little bit better place now, and I ll even take it a little further I heard on the news today that there are still several dozen of these q****s in ICU and I will pray that God will finish the job that that man started, that he will end their lives and by tomorrow morning they will all be burning in hell so that they don t get any more opportunities to go out and hurt little children.
Here s the video of the full sermon via YouTube if you can stomach it.
The remarks above are at the beginning of the video.Romero was also echoing Arizona pastor Steven Anderson, who also had no sympathy or compassion for his fellow human beings and also called for all gays people to be executed.In an interview with Fox 4 about his hateful remarks, Romero showed no regret whatsoever.
The Bible teaches they are predators, and I believe that every Sodomite is a pedophile and is a predator, Romero said.But Fox 4 also consulted a Bible scholar, who made it clear that Romero knows nothing about the book or Christianity.
No Christian who has any formal understanding of the interaction between the Old and the New Testament would say such a thing, said theologian Steve Kellmeyer, He s just one more in a long list of people who don t get what it means to be Christian.
It s disgusting how so-called men of God have been reacting to this tragedy all week long since it happened.
The way they are cheering this loss of life makes them no better than ISIS, whose leaders we all know must be praising this attack just as fervently.
These people who dare to call themselves Christians have thrown in with the terrorists against American citizens and that should not go unpunished.
Each of these churches should lose their tax exemptions and be shut down for inciting hate crimes against the LGBT community.And if conservatives are still wondering why more people are rejecting religion today, they should look no further than these fundamentalist pastors they have allowed to lace Christianity with hate and violence.Featured image via screen capture
