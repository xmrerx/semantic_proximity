we ve reported on the lines for food and shortages of things like toilet paper in venezuela but this is really sad .
the people of the chavez lead socialist country are suffering so much that they say that christmas is dead to them .
they worry more about food than giving presents ah , socialism caracas ( afp ) christmas is dead , says elise belisario , who , like many venezuelans , can t afford to hang decorations or make a traditional holiday meal this year.and 2016 augurs bleak times too in this staggering oil giant , where the new year looks set to bring political power struggles and little respite from a crippling economic crisis.belisario lives in the sprawling slum of petare , on the outskirts of caracas , which is suffering this holiday season from the shortages and triple-digit inflation gripping venezuela the twin tribulations of the once high-flying economy s demise.where christmases past brought exuberant decorations and balconies drenched in lights , this year petare s streets are drab and dark .
there s just not enough money .
we ve switched off christmas , said belisario , a 28-year-old with two kids who recently lost her job.when the oil money was flowing , christmas was a consumer bonanza in venezuela , a predominantly catholic country with a flair for celebrations.a woman paints stairs with christmas colors at the jose felix ribas community in low-income petare n but that has changed as oil prices have plunged , and the opulent days under late leftist firebrand hugo chavez ( 1999-2013 ) have given way to the malaise plaguing his less charmed successor , nicolas maduro .
we were rich and we didn t even know it , said belisario.at a nearby shop , cashier olga gonzalez , 50 , dejectedly picks up the nearly empty piggy bank she has dressed up in a little santa claus suit in hopes of getting some traditional christmas tips.but there are no customers to leave them .
people are more worried about buying food than giving gifts this year , she said.exasperated with empty supermarket shelves , runaway prices and violent crime , venezuelans gave the opposition a landslide victory in legislative elections this month , ending the chavez movement s 16-year monopoly on power.via : yahoo
