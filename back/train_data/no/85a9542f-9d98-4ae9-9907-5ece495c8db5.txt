while this election was undeniably ( from one side ) meaner and more divisive than perhaps ever before , most elections do become mean and divisive , but the winning party usually calls for unity while the losing party licks its wounds.non-trump voting americans are licking their wounds in their constitutionally ( for now ) protected way , by protesting .
the media , of course , generally only reports on the worst of the protesters , while less attention has been paid to the rising violence and hate crimes from trump supporters.trump had this to say about the protests : just had a very open and successful presidential election .
now professional protesters , incited by the media , are protesting .
very unfair !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) november 11 , 2016one trump supporter ( and perhaps the worst person in the entire f * cking world ) has strong opinions about the protests .
instead of blaming them on the usual suspects , like those who have darker skin , ann coulter is blaming the protests on fat girls .
yes , really.without fat girls , there would be no protests .
