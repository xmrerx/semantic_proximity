shanghai ( reuters ) - china has proposed a three-phase plan for resolving the rohingya crisis , starting with a ceasefire , that has won the support of myanmar and bangladesh , the foreign ministry said .
more than 600,000 muslim rohingya have fled to bangladesh since late august driven out by a military clearance operation in buddhist majority myanmar s rakhine state .
the rohingyas suffering has caused an international outcry .
visiting the myanmar capital naypyitaw , chinese foreign minister wang yi said china believed that the issue could be addressed by a solution acceptable to neighbors myanmar and bangladesh through consultations .
a ceasefire should be followed by bilateral dialogue to find a workable solution , the ministry website reported late on sunday .
the third and final phase should be to work toward a long-term solution .
wang said a ceasefire was basically in place already , and the key now was to prevent a flare-up .
he hoped the two sides could soon sign and implement an agreement already reached on repatriation .
the international community and the united nations security council should give encouragement and support to both countries to create the necessary conditions and a good environment , it quoted wang as saying at a joint press conference with aung san suu kyi , myanmar s de facto leader .
myanmar was supportive of the chinese plan , as was bangladesh , where wang visited earlier in the weekend .
