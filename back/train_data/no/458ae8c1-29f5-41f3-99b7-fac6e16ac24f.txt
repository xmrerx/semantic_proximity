benghazi , libya ( reuters ) - benghazi s commercial port officially reopened on sunday after a three-year closure due to fighting between rival factions in the east libyan city .
to mark the opening abdullah al-thinni , prime minister of a government based in the east , arrived on board a tanker sent from the eastern city of tobruk .
the port does not export oil , but imports gas and some petroleum products as well as general cargo , and local costs for these would be reduced by the port s reopening , port spokesman nasser al-maghrabi said .
today benghazi port opened and a tanker from tobruk entered as a message to the world that the port is safe and we are ready to receive tankers , port manager abdulazim al-abbar said by telephone .
until now we have not received notification of tankers arriving for exports and imports - for now we are starting up and waiting .
like benghazi s airport , the port had been closed since 2014 because of a conflict between forces loyal to eastern-based commander khalifa haftar and an alliance of islamists and other opponents .
haftar declared victory in early july , though isolated skirmishes continued .
benghazi airport reopened in mid-july .
