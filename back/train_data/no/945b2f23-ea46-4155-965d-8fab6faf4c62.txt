beirut ( reuters ) - lebanon s foreign minister may not attend an arab league meeting in cairo on sunday and a final decision will be taken in the morning , a senior lebanese official told reuters on saturday .
the official said foreign minister gebran bassil wanted to avoid an anticipated confrontation at the meeting with saudi arabia and its arab allies over the regional role of the iran-backed lebanese shi ite group hezbollah .
the emergency arab foreign ministers meeting is being convened at the request of saudi arabia with support from the uae , bahrain , and kuwait to discuss means of confronting iranian intervention in the internal affairs of arab states , the egyptian state news agency mena said .
hezbollah is part of the lebanese government and a political ally of lebanese president michel aoun .
the sunni muslim monarchy of saudi arabia and shi ite islamist iran are at loggerheads across the region , and tensions between them have recently escalated in both lebanon and yemen .
lebanon was thrust to the forefront of the regional struggle when saad al-hariri resigned as prime minister on nov. 4 in a surprise announcement from riyadh .
aoun has accused saudi arabia of holding hariri hostage .
senior lebanese politicians close to hariri have also said he had been held in saudi arabia against his will and coerced into resigning .
saudi arabia and hariri both deny this .
after french intervention , hariri flew to france overnight and met french president emmanuel macron in paris on saturday .
hariri , speaking in paris , said he would clarify his position when he returns to beirut in the coming days .
he said he would take part in lebanese independence day celebrations , which are scheduled for wednesday .
hariri , long a political ally of saudi arabia , cited fear of assassination and accused iran and hezbollah of sowing strife in the arab world during his resignation speech .
