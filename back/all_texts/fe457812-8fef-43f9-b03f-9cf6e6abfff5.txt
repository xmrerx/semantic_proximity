Senator Cory Booker (D-New Jersey) has about had it with Donald Trump trying to mislead the American people with conspiracy theories, crazy tweets, and outright lies.
Appearing on CNN s OutFront with Erin Burnett, Senator Booker lit into Trump and his staff s habit of blatantly lying to the American public.
Booker told the host: A week in office and we have seen the President of the United States and his officials repeatedly lying to the American public and pushing out what could be called what we ve seen in other regimes throughout history what can be called propaganda to mislead the public.
He needs to be called out on it, and we, as an American public, should not accept a president that routinely lies, blatantly, to the American people.
When Burnett asked if Senator Booker felt the same way as Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vermont) that Trump is actually delusional, Booker didn t hedge at all, and called Trump a liar: I don t know his mental state.
What I do know is he a liar, repeatedly so.
Senator Booker also said that he thinks that Trump s message and actions are championing an agenda that is not in concert with honor or with the facts.
Senator Booker is correct.
This is the same kind of thing that autocrats do everywhere.
They lie to the public, sow discord, division, and fear, and do all they can to discredit any and all other sources of information that do not support their narrative.
If we want to survive a Trump presidency with our democracy in tact, we must continue to call Trump and his team out for the lying propagandists that they are.Thank you Senator Booker, for doing what is right.
Don t worry about Trump attacking you on Twitter because we, the members of The Resistance, have your back.Watch the video of Senator Booker s comments below:.
