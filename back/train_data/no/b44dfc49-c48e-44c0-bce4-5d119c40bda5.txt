madrid ( reuters ) - the spanish government s official representative in catalonia apologized on friday for the violent response by spanish police to protesters who were attempting to vote in a banned independence referendum in the region on sunday .
when i see these images , and more so when i know people have been hit , pushed and even one person who hospitalized , i can t help but regret it and apologize on behalf of the officers that intervened , enric millo said in a television interview .
it was the first apology by a madrid government official over the clashes and could be seen as a conciliatory gesture to catalan leaders who plan a unilateral declaration of independence of the region from spain .
the police action , which according to catalan health authorities around 900 injured , has been widely condemned by human rights groups as excessive force on a civilian population .
