After suffering debilitating losses in five northeastern states Maryland, Delaware, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania and his alliance with John Kasich crumbling after only two days, Ted Cruz needed to find a way to stop GOP frontrunner Donald Trump.And he found the way at least he thinks he does.The Cruz campaign announced Wednesday afternoon that failed CEO, failed Senate candidate, failed presidential candidate and largely disliked Carly Fiorina will be the Texas Senator s VP running mate.Simply put, this is Ted Cruz sad, pathetic attempt at a hail Mary to pander to female GOP voters (who loath Trump).
And what s even sadder is Cruz only picked Fiorina out of sheer logistics not because he necessarily likes her or thinks she would be a good Vice President.
According to Politico:The hope within the campaign is that Fiorina will help Cruz in California, which will award 172 delegates on June 7.
Fiorina is scheduled to give the keynote address at this weekend s California Republican Party convention, speaking hours after Cruz takes the stage.The move comes at a time of growing desperation within Cruz circles.
Some in the campaign worry that the Texas senator will lose Indiana on Tuesday and lose other key states in May, paving the way for a Trump nomination.Yes, the women who helped dent Silicon Valley and lost a statewide election to Barbara Boxer by 10 percent is the perfect choice for Cruz s California comeback.
As it becomes increasingly clear that Trump s negative image will spell certain doom for the GOP in November, Cruz has literally taken it upon himself to pull a John McCain circa 2008.
Only this time America knows who Fiorina is, and they don t like her very much.Fiorina suspended her campaign after poor showings in Iowa and New Hampshire and subsequently endorsed Cruz, traveling he country as a surrogate for his campaign.The decision was two weeks in the making as reports surfaced the Cruz campaign was heavily vetting the former CEO, and placed her at the top of a serious contender list for V.P.
Never before has a losing candidate pulled such a desperate maneuver to save their campaign.
Hopefully this comes back to bite them both in the behind.
