WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is particularly hopeful it can reach a bipartisan tax deal when it comes overhauling laws for business taxes, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday.
“We are hopeful that we can find common ground, particularly on the issue of making our business taxes competitive,” Mnuchin told a Senate panel.
