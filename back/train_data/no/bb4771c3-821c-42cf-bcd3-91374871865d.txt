kuala lumpur ( reuters ) - malaysia on thursday banned citizens from traveling to north korea , scotching yet again its soccer team s participation in an asian cup qualifying match , as tension rises on the korean peninsula over missile and nuclear development by pyongyang .
malaysia is one of the handful of countries that still has friendly diplomatic ties with north korea , but relations have been strained since the murder of kim jong un s half brother at the airport in the malaysian capital this year .
the travel ban will be reviewed once the situation has returned to normal , the malaysian foreign ministry said in a statement .
the ban also covers the malaysian soccer team s trip to pyongyang for an oct 5 match , deputy foreign minister rizal merican naina merican said .
the travel ban covers all malaysians , and as malaysians , the malaysian national football team is included too , reezal told reuters .
the news led to the match being postponed for a third time , with the asian football confederation saying in a brief statement the situation would be referred to the appropriate committees to decide on the future status of this match .
the regional body said it decided to postpone the match after the football association of malaysia told it of the travel ban .
the match had been postponed to june 8 from its original date of march 28 , but both dates were scrapped because of malaysia s fears for its players safety .
last week , north korea granted the president of the regional body , malaysian royal tunku ismail sultan ibrahim , access to its airspace anytime he wants , as pyongyang prepared to host the asian cup tie .
