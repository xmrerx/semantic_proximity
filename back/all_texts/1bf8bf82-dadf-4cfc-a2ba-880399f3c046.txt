PARIS (Reuters) - France has offered Belgium a deal to purchase Dassault Aviation s Rafale war planes, the French Defence ministry said on Thursday, as Brussels seeks to replace 34 of its Lockheed Martin s F-16 planes.
The Defence minister, Florence Parly, has offered the Belgian Defence minister to setup an in-depth partnership between our two countries in order to respond to the need expressed by the Belgian air force, the ministry said.
Dassault Aviation had no immediate comment.
