Sounds like someone can t handle the truth.In her new book, Fox News host Megyn Kelly claimed that pro-Trump hosts would arrange with Trump in advance to ask him certain critical questions or do certain hits on him so they would appear to have some credibility.
In other words, they were pretending to ask tough questions on the spot but Trump was able to form an answer in advance, thereby making himself look good.Kelly did not name names but one pro-Trump host is already objecting.Naturally, fellow Fox host Sean Hannity went on the defensive on Twitter and demonstrated that he has never heard the old quote in Hamlet about protesting too much.Hannity demanded to know which hosts Kelly was talking about and strenuously insisted that he isn t one of them.No idea who @megynkelly is talking about.
When I asked ?
s about Justices, The wall, Refugees, Obamacare, economy etc I wanted real answers!
https://t.co/AZxax2rpur Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 20, 2016I would love to know who was Acting .
https://t.co/AZxax2rpur Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 20, 2016I never asked a question from a TelePrompTer in my life.
I cannot speak for others.
https://t.co/OSs0sO9tDS Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 20, 2016Curious who she was referring to.
I am transparent, I want to defeat Isis, protect the homeland and get people out of poverty and working!
https://t.co/tranPp7y2k Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 20, 2016I m just curious.
All year long I talked about the number of people not working in poverty on food stamps I wanted real answers and got them https://t.co/62F0etYnxS Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 20, 2016Twitter users had fun mocking Hannity for pretending he was tough on Trump.
@seanhannity, you sir are no journalist.
You are a Trump surrogate, or more accurately, a puppet.
Period.
@JohnJHarwood @megynkelly Joseph Amodeo (@josephamodeo) November 20, 2016@seanhannity @JohnJHarwood @megynkelly Guilty conscience?

You probably have access to her.

@seanhannity @megynkelly @Mediaite Have you ever watched your show, Sean?
Tweets by Collin (@TweetsByCollin) November 21, 2016Megyn Kelly also claimed that some of these pro-Trump hosts received gifts for going easy on him.Of course, Hannity claimed he never received any gifts from Trump.I would also like to know what people were offered by DT, I was never offered a thing.
Never stayed at a DT property played a DT golf course https://t.co/62F0etYnxS Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 20, 2016Never played a DT golf course.
To be clear.
https://t.co/62F0eufYpq Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 20, 2016That led to this spectacular takedown by a Twitter user.
@seanhannity Trump didn t offer you anything because he knows your love is unconditional like a good lapdog.
Eric Koeller (@BasicKoell) November 20, 2016And that caused Hannity to complain.Nice cheap shot.
I agree with his plans for the economy, energy, vetting, the wall, Ct Justices, Obamacare, education, and foreign policy.
https://t.co/toN8PRsjQu Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) November 21, 2016As we all know, Sean Hannity was Donald Trump s chief propagandist throughout the 2016 campaign.
Trump could always count on Hannity to deliver the softball interviews he demanded but didn t get from real journalists.That being said, Hannity is lying when he says that he was tough on Trump.
BUt it s probably true that he received nothing in return.
After all, there s no need to bribe someone whose lip prints are already firmly embedded on your ass.Featured Image: Screenshot
