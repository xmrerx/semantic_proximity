donald trump just unleashed an attack on any and all americans who have a problem with his cozy relationship with putin .
sure , russia in an effort directly spearheaded by the russian dictator hacked our election with the intent of effectively installing donald trump in the oval office .
sure , this has been confirmed by more than a baker s dozen intelligence agencies .
sure , trump , who very publicly asked russia to hack his opponents , has been informed of this himself .
but according to him , all that matters is that we kiss vladdy poot s ( we imagine this to be his cute little nickname for his russian sugar daddy ) ring and you re stupid if you feel otherwise .
having a good relationship with russia is a good thing , not a bad thing .
only stupid people , or fools , would think that it is bad !
we .. trump tweeted , still failing to grasp the intracacies of the use of ellipses ( it s three dots , not four or twelve , donald !
) , have enough problems around the world without yet another one .
when i am president , russia will respect us far more than they do now and .
he added in a third tweet , both countries will , perhaps , work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the world !

donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 7 , 2017of course , one of the world s problems is that russia directly interfered with a sovereign nation s election at an unprecedented level , according to the report trump received .
naturally , americans who have a problem with a foreign power interfering especially at this level in our election don t exactly enjoy the president-elect calling them stupid for caring about the integrity of the electoral process : @ realdonaldtrump russia just made a mockery of the us election .
only a `` fool '' would think that 's the sign of a good relationship .
letters of note ( @ lettersofnote ) january 7 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump so now you are calling americans stupid .

tony posnanski ( @ tonyposnanski ) january 7 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump only someone without real friends ( you ! ! ! )

@ realdonaldtrump do two countries have `` a good relationship '' when one country tries to influence the free and fair elections in the other ?
simon hedlin ( @ simonhedlin ) january 7 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump most of my good relationships do n't involve the other person hacking into my private data and sabotaging my fucking life .
pic.twitter.com/dvfi8rbhha kristina wong ( @ mskristinawong ) january 7 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump lets see , who else might applaud the idea that americans who stand up for their sovereignty are `` stupid '' people or fools ?
pic.twitter.com/fedrxi8keb don moynihan ( @ donmoyn ) january 7 , 2017look , we get it .
your love for russia and disdain for our intelligence agencies is clear .
but why constantly reminded us ?
@ realdonaldtrump big lee ? ?
( @ rejecttrump ) january 7 , 2017 .
@ realdonaldtrump they interfered in our election .
why would we want 2 have a good relationship w/them ?
kelly herself ?
( @ kelly_herself ) january 7 , 2017 .
@ realdonaldtrump also , calling americans who disagree with you `` stupid '' is not awesome .
kelly herself ?
( @ kelly_herself ) january 7 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump we want a good relationship with russia , you idiot .
part of that is them not interfering in our elections !
tom coates ( @ tomcoates ) january 7 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump the russians interfering with our election defines a terrible relationship .
only a fool fails to see this .

and my fellow patriots .
# maga @ realdonaldtrump greg laden ( @ gregladen ) january 7 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump you want to get in bed w/ putin a murderous thug ?

not maureen dowd ( @ maureendowdtwit ) january 7 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump there 's a difference between diplomacy and sleeping with the enemy !
you 're still in putin 's bed .
auntie b ( @ b_auntie ) january 7 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump you sure are working hard clutching your ankles for putin .
shameful traitor .
kay ( @ karleenflem ) january 7 , 2017yes , ideally , we should want a good relationship with every country , but trump somehow doesn t consider it a problem that putin directly ordered an interference in our election that likely helped him win .
to trump , his personal benefit is more important than the good of our nation .
and we re stupid , right ? featured image via getty images ( drew angerer ) /screengrab
