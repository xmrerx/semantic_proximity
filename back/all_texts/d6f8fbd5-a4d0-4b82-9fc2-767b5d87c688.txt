When a celebrity is given a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, it stays there forever.
So, it was surprising to hear that Donald Trump s star may be removed, but the reason why is absolutely hilarious.Over the weekend, there were reports that the Hollywood Historic Trust is weighing whether or not to remove Trump s star because people won t stop vandalizing it.Here are a few of the things tourists have done to it:A picture I took of Donald Trump s star on the Walk of Fame in LA a few months ago pic.twitter.com/FnuKhRY7n4 Khalid (@WorldOfK_) March 10, 2016 Somebody has defaced Donald Trump s Hollywood star and people aren t sure whether it was a supporter or a protester pic.twitter.com/LRRFNA6zuH Rhoda Sharp (@So2012Trust) March 25, 2016My friend s service dog accidentally took a shit on Donald Trump s Hollywood star.

As a matter of fact, when they were asked if they planned on removing Bill Cosby s star, President Leron Gubler said: The answer is no.
Once a star has been added to the Walk, it is considered a part of the historic fabric of the Hollywood Walk of Fame.
Trump is an absolutely vile human being.
He has made a name for himself in politics on the backs of others.
He incites violence, treats women like garbage, promotes xenophobic and Islamophobic hate and feels no remorse for any of it.
While I understand that the Chamber of Commerce s point of view, I disagree with it.
Hopefully, the rumors are true and the Hollywood Trust is actually considering the possibility of removing it and can put pressure on the Chamber.
We should not honor the Trumps and Cosbys of the world, they certainly do not deserve it.Featured image via Twitter
