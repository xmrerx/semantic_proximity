Did Bruce Ohr get cold feet?
Demoted Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee today.
The testimony never happened .
These people feel so entitled and above the law that they just don t show up to testify.
This really implies guilt on his part for not showing up What s he afraid of if he s above board?Could it be that questions might come up about his wife working for the opposition research firm Fusion GPS.
Yes, that s certainly a conflict of interest!Demoted Deputy Attorney General Bruce Ohr was set to testify before the Senate Intelligence Committee today.
