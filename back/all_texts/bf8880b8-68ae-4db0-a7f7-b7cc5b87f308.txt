Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders is popular with individuals with a social justice mindset.
He s also packed stadiums with young supporters around the country who see him as the candidate who can help them secure a batter future.
The senator from Vermont got even more popular last night during a Late Show appearance after admitting to smoking weed saying, I ve done marijuana twice in my life when I was very young.
Host Stephen Colbert had lots of fun last night on his show with Sanders unsurprising and candid admission.
He said: I don t think this admission is on brand for Bernie.
Senator, you do know who your supporters are.
I will tell you this much: They have smoked marijuana twice since I started this sentence [Bernie] recorded a reggae cover of a socialist anthem and expects us to believe he only smoked pot twice?
Was one of those times for ten years, Senator?
Colbert went on to imagine Bernie saying: If we pass the dutchie on the left hand side, the bottom 10% of the people are getting 80% less dutchie than the elite 1% on the left hand side, I promise that in my administration, there will be equal redistribution of dee dutchie.
Sanders, who is running a competitive campaign for the Democratic nomination for the presidency, may smoke again for the third time in his life to celebrate a presidential victory in November.Watch Video Here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnSbHaIG4j4] Featured image via video screen capture.
