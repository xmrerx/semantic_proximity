dubai ( reuters ) - yemen s ex-president ali abdullah saleh has had a successful operation at a sanaa hospital after a russian medical team was flown in to perform it , government sources said on saturday .
the russian team arrived in sanaa two days ago and operated on saleh on friday for wounds he sustained in an assassination attempt in 2011 .
saleh s general people s congress party said the procedure was successful , and that his condition was stable .
saleh was severely wounded in an attack on the presidential palace in sanaa in june 2011 .
he went to the united states for treatment on one occasion , before a travel ban was imposed .
the united nations security council imposed sanctions on saleh in 2014 , accusing him of threatening peace and obstructing yemen s political process , subjecting him to a global travel ban and an asset freeze .
government sources told reuters the russian team had arrived with approval from the saudi-led arab alliance but did not reveal the precise nature of the surgery .
saleh ruled yemen for 34 years , but was forced from power after pro-democracy protests in 2012 .
forming a surprise alliance with the houthi movement when they seized sanaa in 2014 , saleh s army loyalists and houthi fighters have weathered thousands of air strikes by the saudi-led military coalition in more than two years of war .
