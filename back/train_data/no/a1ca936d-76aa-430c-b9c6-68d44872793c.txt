there are startling accusations against a norman teacher.a student said the premise of his lecture stated all white people are racist.the norman north student said the teacher was lecturing on how to heal the racial divide .
she was stunned by what was being taught , so she pulled out her phone and started recording.in the audio , you can hear the teacher say to be white is to be racist , period .
the student said she was instantly offended .
half of my family is hispanic , so i just felt like , you know , him calling me racist just because i m white i mean , where s your proof in that , she said.the words that followed were even more shocking to her.in the recording you hear the teacher ask am i racist ?
and , i say yeah .
i don t want to be .
it s not like i choose to be racist , but do i do things because of the way i was raised ?
i felt like he was encouraging people to kind of pick on people for being white , the student said .
why is it okay to demonize one race to children that you are supposed to be teaching a curriculum to , her dad asked.norman public schools released the following statement regarding the issue : racism is an important topic that we discuss in our schools .
while discussing a variety of philosophical perspectives on culture , race and ethics , a teacher was attempting to convey to students in an elective philosophy course a perspective that had been shared at a university lecture he had attended .
we regret that the discussion was poorly handled .
when the district was notified of this concern it was immediately addressed .
we are committed to ensuring inclusiveness in our schools .
dr. joe siano , superintendent of norman public schools you start telling someone something over and over again that s an opinion , and they start taking it as fact , the student said .
so , i wanted him to apologize and make it obvious and apparent to everyone that was his opinion .
