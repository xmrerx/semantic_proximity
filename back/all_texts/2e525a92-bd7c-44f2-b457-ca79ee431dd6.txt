WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday condemned President Barack Obama’s visit to Cuba, saying the trip legitimizes the “tyrannical dictatorship” of Cuban President Raul Castro.
Ryan made his remarks to reporters in Washington as Obama was wrapping up his historic visit to Havana - a trip that was marked by clashes between the American and Cuban leaders over human rights abuses.
