Comedian and actor Will Ferrell has been cast as former President Ronald Reagan in an upcoming movie.
The former Saturday Night Live cast member is known to be a liberal, and was a supporter of President Obama.
Now he will be portraying arguably the biggest icon of the conservative movement.Sources tell Variety Ferrell is attached to star as President Ronald Reagan in the Black List script Reagan.
Penned by Mike Rosolio, the story begins at the start of the ex-president s second term when he falls into dementia and an ambitious intern is tasked with convincing the commander-in-chief that he is an actor playing the president in a movie.The script was so popular following its announcement on the Black List, an annual catalog of the top unproduced scripts in Hollywood, that a live read was done recently done in March starring Lena Dunham and John Cho.Ferrell s iconic portrayal of George W. Bush on SNL was a key part of the cultural zeitgeist, cementing the image of Bush as a slow-witted, unintelligent buffoon with large segments of the public.
Ferrell s version of Bush, along with Phil Hartman s interpretations of Reagan and Bill Clinton, is often seen as one of the best such parodies in the show s history.
Ferrell also appeared as Bush on Broadway, in the production You re Welcome, America.
Ferrell has also appeared in several movies that have progressive themes that also lampoon conservatives.
The Other Guys cast Wall Street raiders as the bad guys, ripping off police pensions; The Campaign lampooned right-wing billionaires who meddle in politics, like the Koch Brothers; and Get Hard again showcased the elite 1% as heartless bad guys, while the working class character is the ultimate hero.
Several of Ferrell s films are directed by Big Short director Adam McKay, which of course is another film about the super-rich soaking the rest of America.Ferrell also starred in one of the most popular videos posted on YouTube by the Obama campaign (over 5 million views), where he promised to do anything in exchange for a vote to re-elect the president:Featured image via YouTube
