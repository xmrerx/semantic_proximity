WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder said on Friday the state would hold a special election on Nov. 6, 2018, to replace Representative John Conyers, the Democrat who resigned this week amid accusations of sexual misconduct.
“Having ample time for candidates to make a decision about running for office and file their paperwork gives people more options,” Snyder said in a statement.
