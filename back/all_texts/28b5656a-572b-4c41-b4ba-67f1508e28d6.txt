LIMA (Reuters) - A congresswoman in Peru said embattled President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski survived a vote in Congress to oust him by promising some opposition lawmakers that he would pardon the country s jailed former authoritarian leader, Alberto Fujimori.
Cecilia Chacon, a lawmaker with the opposition party Popular Force, said the 10 abstentions by a faction in her party had helped defeat its bid to oust Kuczynski in the wake of a graft scandal, and that some of them had mentioned the promise.
That s what they told us, Chacon said in broadcast comments.
Earlier on Thursday, Kuczynski s government denied it was negotiating a possible pardon for Fujimori in exchange for votes to save him.
Kuczynski pulled off a surprise victory after the motion in Congress to oust him fell eight votes short of the 87 needed to pass.
Fujimori is serving a 25-year prison sentence for graft and human rights crimes during his 1990-2000 government.
