It s somewhat terrifying listening to how some of how our young people praise Donald Trump and how he d like to govern the country.
It s also more than disconcerting when you hear them just parrot talking points that have no basis in reality.
Such as, Conservative values are ensuring that the government doesn t get too involved in people s lives.
They ve apparently never witnessed their conservative legislators trying to dictate the lives of women and the LGBT community.
Maybe they mean their lives other people, well, that s different.You ll also hear these kids talk about the standard catch phrases like family values, which has been code for hating gays for a very long time, as well as limited government which is code for limited regulations on business.
Because as aforementioned, they have no problem making sure government gets involved in the lives of those they don t agree with.These young cons even had the audacity to say: The worst Republican is better than the best Democrat.
Really?
Where the hell did you hear that?
And most of these young conservatives would actually vote for Donald Trump if he were to become the nominee.
However, not all of them have fallen for The Donald s schtick.You really need to witness the insanity for yourself.
Caution, you ll be left wondering where our society went wrong.// < !
