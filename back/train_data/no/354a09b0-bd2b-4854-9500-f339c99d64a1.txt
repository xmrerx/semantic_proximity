strasbourg ( reuters ) - british prime minister theresa may should address the european parliament when she visits the eu legislature to clarify britain s plans for its divorce from the european union , the parliament s brexit coordinator said on tuesday .
on brexit , i m very pleased that mrs. may has accepted the invitation of the european parliament to come to the european parliament , guy verhofstadt told a news conference at the parliament in strasbourg .
may had accepted an invitation from the parliament to speak at a meeting of the heads of party groupings , he said .
but my proposal is that instead of only addressing the conference of presidents , i would encourage her to address the full house , verhofstadt said .
verhofstadt said a may address would be very helpful because the parliament had to give its approval to a brexit agreement between the eu and britain , notably on the question of citizens rights , a divorce bill and the future ireland/northern ireland border .
so in the future , all this , i think needs to be debated in an open dialogue between mrs. may and all members , verhofstadt said , adding he did not know when may planned to visit .
verhofstadt pointed out that other leaders had done so in the past .
they have included former u.s. president ronald reagan , former french president nicolas sarkozy , as well as britain s queen elizabeth in 1992 and two popes .
the parliament s brexit coordinator also said that , for the moment , negotiations had not made sufficient progress on the divorce issues to allow talks to move to the issue of future trade relations between britain and the bloc .
he added that the parliament would debate a motion in early october on whether enough progress had been made .
