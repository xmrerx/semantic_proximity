beirut ( reuters ) - the u.s.-backed syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) has taken the national hospital in raqqa , one of islamic state s last remaining bastions in its former syrian capital , a militia spokesman said on tuesday .
the sdf , an alliance of kurdish and arab militias , is now fighting islamic state in the area around raqqa stadium , said the spokesman mostafa bali in a message .
during these clashes , the national hospital was liberated and cleared from the daesh mercenaries , and 22 of these foreign mercenaries were killed there , said bali .
the stadium is the last major position held by islamic state after four months of battle in raqqa and the departure of some of its fighters under a deal on sunday , leaving only foreign jihadists .
islamic state has lost swathes of its territory in syria and iraq this year , including its most prized possession mosul , and in syria it has been forced back into a strip of the euphrates valley and surrounding areas of desert .
the sdf has been supported by a u.s.-led international coalition with air strikes and special forces operating on the ground since it started the fight for raqqa in early june .
