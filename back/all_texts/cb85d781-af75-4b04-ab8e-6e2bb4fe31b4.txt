Bernie Sanders just won the New Hampshire primary race.
The candidate that was once written off as a protest candidate, that would only be successful in pushing Hillary Clinton to the left, has won one of the first primary elections in the nation.
At the time this was written, Bernie Sanders has 57.9 percent of the vote with Clinton at 40 percent.
That isn t particularly surprising, seeing as Sanders has long held a massive lead in the polls over Clinton in that state.This comes after a close caucus election in Iowa.
Bernie Sanders ultimately lost that election, though it was virtually a tie.https://www.facebook.com/berniesanders/photos/a.324119347643076.89553.124955570892789/977514378970233/?type=3&theaterSanders supporters should be Feeling the Bern harder than they ever have at this moment.
Though that feeling must ultimately transform into action, if they wish to bypass Clinton s firewall that is the Nevada caucus and South Carolina primary.
The only thing for sure at this point is that the Democratic primary battle is going to be a long, tight race.On the Republican side, Donald Trump has won the New Hampshire primary.
I guess racism and sexism still sells in parts of New England.
What is somewhat interesting, is that John Kasich, a man whose candidacy has been anything but interesting, appears to have taken second place, with the anemic Jeb Bush taking third.
Cruz, the winner of the Iowa caucus took fourth place.
The Rubiobot seems to be malfunctioning, as he took fifth place.Trump may be riding high now though it remains to be seen if he can maintain his momentum.
One thing is for sure, should he be the eventual Republican nominee, it will be fun to watch Sanders or Clinton mop the floor with him in the general election.
Then again, that is true for any of the other GOP candidates.Featured image from Phil Roeder via Flickr
