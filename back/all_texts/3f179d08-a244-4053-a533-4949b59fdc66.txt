ZAGREB (Reuters) - Croatia s opposition parties on Thursday demanded a no-confidence vote in the government over its handling of a crisis at the country s largest company, Agrokor, but analysts said the ruling coalition would likely survive.
The government intervened in April because Agrokor [AGROK.UL], the largest employer in the Balkans, faced a debt and liquidity crisis.
Given its importance, the crisis could have destabilized the economy.
The opposition led by Social Democrats says a liquidity loan agreed this summer with creditors including foreign investment funds to finance Agrokor s operations through a 15-month period of restructuring lacked transparency and favored some creditors.
The SDP has a responsibility to expose corrupt activities, the SDP leader Davor Bernardic told reporters.
The government and Agrokor s crisis manager Ante Ramljak rejected the opposition charge and said it achieved the best possible loan terms in the circumstances.
A debate and vote must take place by early December and the conservative-led coalition has a small but firm parliamentary majority.
I don t think this is a particularly wise move for the top opposition party (Social Democrats) as they are likely to achieve little.
I see it rather as an effort to divert attention from political weaknesses within their own ranks, said political analyst Davor Gjenero.
