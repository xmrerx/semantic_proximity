For many of us, electing President Obama into office was an amazing thing to be a part of, spectacular to witness, and will go down in history.
However, what if you were born with this already amazing president in office where you know no difference.
You wouldn t be able to comprehend a world without him as president.
Most of us know that presidents come and go every four to eight years, but what if you re only six and Obama is all you know?
It could end up be emotionally traumatic, which is exactly what happened with young Kameria whose video regarding Obama leaving, and her subsequent letter went viral.Well, guess what?
President Obama saw Kameria s video and received her letter and she just got to meet her hero in person.In one of the most heartwarming meet and greets ever, please witness Kameria meeting President Obama.
Grab your tissues.
