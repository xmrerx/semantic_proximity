ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethnic clashes killed 11 people this week in Ethiopia s Oromiya region, a regional government official said on Sunday, the latest unrest in a province that was wracked by violence in 2015 and 2016.
Nearly 700 people died last year during one period of the violence in Ethiopia s largest region and other areas, according to a parliament-mandated investigation.
The unrest forced the government to impose a nine-month state of emergency that was finally lifted in August.
Sporadic protests have taken place since then.
Violence broke out this week in two districts in the province s west after protests led to clashes between ethnic Oromos and Amharas, the spokesman for the region s administration said on Sunday.
Eight Oromos and three Amharas died, spokesman Addisu Arega Kitessa said in a statement.
The previous unrest was provoked by a development scheme for the capital, Addis Ababa, that dissidents said amounted to land grabs.
Broader anti-government demonstrations followed, over politics and human rights abuses.
The violence included attacks on businesses, many of them foreign-owned, including farms growing flowers for export.
Separately, clashes along the border between the country s Oromiya and Somali regions last month also displaced hundreds of thousands of people.
The area has been plagued by sporadic violence for decades.
A referendum held in 2004 to determine the status of disputed settlements failed to ease tensions.
Those clashes have fueled fears about security in Ethiopia, the region s biggest economy and a staunch Western ally.
