you can probably expect donald trump to roll out some new rules regarding photographers and helicopters soon after a photo someone snapped of him boarding one.today was the last day photography will be allowed near trump and helicopters i suspect .

# creepy rebelalliance ( @ cybersaur1 ) january 27 , 2017recently , trump threw a tantrum because a news organization used a photograph he felt made him look fat .
politico reported in november : the source said the meeting started with a typical trump complaint about the dishonest media , and that he specifically singled out cnn and nbc news for example as the worst .
trump turned to nbc news president deborah turness at one point , the source said , and told her the network won t run a nice picture of him , instead choosing this picture of me , as he made a face with a double chin .
turness replied that they had a very nice picture of him on their website at the moment.we can almost assuredly expect yet another meltdown from president pussygrabber .
after all , his ego is all that matters to him.featured image via twitter
