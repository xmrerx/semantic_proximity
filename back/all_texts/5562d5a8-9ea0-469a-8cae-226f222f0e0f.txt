Republican front-runner Donald Trump does a pretty amazing job making himself look like a complete moron, but he s given us so much material that impersonating such a ridiculous candidate has never been more fun.Trump s a character that almost seems too insane to be real.
From his accent to his hand gestures and facial expressions, we ve never had a more animated presidential candidate and that might not be a good thing.
He s become loathed by not only every logically thinking American, but by nearly every politician even members of the Republican party!Because of his distinct (and revolting) personality, Trump has been impersonated by comedians, talk show hosts and more.
Mimicking this candidate is so entertaining that even politicians his own rivals can t help but get in on it!
Here are some epic impersonations that have been done by the other candidates, at Trump s expense:Hillary Clinton (starting at the 3:00 mark)We think Clinton took the prize here, doing a dead-on impersonation of the annoying yet unforgettable way Trump speaks.
She even got some of the facial expressions right!Following Clinton are the impressions done by Trump s GOP rivals, who are understandably less charismatic and less intelligent than Clinton, but they still deserve some credit for trying even if you end up laughing at them instead.Ted Cruz (at the 1:00 mark)Ted Cruz is creepy as ever, but he does a good job at summing up what Trump does during debates while at the same time mocking him for skipping one.Jeb Bush (at the 1:00 mark)You can tell that Jeb Bush, who recently dropped out of the presidential race, isn t used to being funny but even he could barely contain his laughter as he tried to capture Trump s personality in a few seconds for Stephen Colbert.Rand Paul (at the :40 mark)Ex-candidate Rand Paul actually tried to mimic Trump s voice, and it was pretty disastrous.
However, he did a great job reflecting Trump s misogynistic attitude toward women, as well as the front runner s inflated ego.Chris Christie Another former candidate, Chris Christie, takes a stab at Trump s voice as he bashes him during a speech.
Interestingly enough, Christie has now endorsed Trump and was recently embarrassed tremendously by the business mogul probably for this horrible impression.While these politicians should have probably left the impersonations to the comedians, we can t blame them for wanting to make fun of everyone s least favorite person.
We can only imagine what it s like to work so closely with someone as irritatingly awful as Trump so these candidates can blast him all they want.
But in closing, we ll leave you with this epic Trump impersonation from Jimmy Fallon, who absolutely nailed it:Featured image is a screenshot
