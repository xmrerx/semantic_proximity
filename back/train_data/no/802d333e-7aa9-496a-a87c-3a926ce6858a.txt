hanoi ( reuters ) - vietnam s state-run news agency apologized on saturday for issuing what it said was a false report that two more officials of state energy firm petrovietnam were to be prosecuted over financial losses .
the original report had also been carried on the government s official website .
vietnam news agency said in a statement that it had apologized to phung dinh thuc and do van hau over the false report .
it also apologized to their families and to police .
the news agency said it had failed to verify its information carefully enough before publication .
petrovietnam is at the heart of a sweeping high-level corruption crackdown in the communist state .
former petrovietnam chairman dinh la thang , 56 , was arrested on friday .
the former member of vietnam s politburo is the most senior executive arrested so far .
thang s brother , dinh manh thang , former chairman of a petrovietnam unit , was also arrested on allegations of violating state regulations on economic management .
government critics have voiced suspicions that the corruption crackdown is politically motivated , at least in part , and aimed against those close to former prime minister nguyen tan dung , who lost out in an internal power struggle in 2016 .
the corruption crackdown made global headlines in august when germany accused vietnam of kidnapping former executive trinh xuan thanh in berlin to face trial over a separate case .
