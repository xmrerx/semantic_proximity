one short trip on a boat and this could be all yours !
no papers required a group of local citizens from the italian island of sicily have denounced a recent political decision to turn a 4-star seaside resort into the latest migrant welcome center , near the historic city of agrigento .
the hotel capo rossello realmonte is located just a short distance from the scala dei turchi , or turkish steps , an unusual white , rocky cliff popular with tourists that has also been proposed for the unesco heritage list.the region of sicily , led by governor rosario crocetta of the democratic party , has decided to transform the hotel into a hub where asylum-seekers will be accommodated , theoretically just for 48 hours for registration purposes before being transferred to other centers or possible repatriation .
critics have noted that the migrants and refugees will actually be staying considerably longer , judging from the way such centers work elsewhere in italy.the local city council of realmonte , chaired by mayor calogero zicari has joined a local citizens movement in collecting signatures protesting the plan to convert the hotel into a migrant center.the mayor told local media that since the area depends on tourism , the proposal would have a major impact on the economy , recalling that the arrival of large groups of migrants in other areas has destroyed investments that had been developed over years .
we are angry and worried by this latest irresponsible decision , said angelo attaguile , the local leader of the noi con salvini populist political party .
some people forget that we are talking about a site with enormous touristic value , which was recently nominated as a unesco heritage site , and which could be jeopardizes by this foolish decision , attaguile said .
we can not accept that top-tier hotel facilities , close to the sea and tourist destinations like the scala dei turchi , continue to be turned into reception centers , he added.another political operative from the noi con salvini party , giuseppe di rosa , has accused politicians in office of reaping economic benefits from public funds coming in for the construction and operation of refugee centers .
they are transforming our land into a mega hotel that houses refugees of all kinds without any sanitary control of the territory , he said .
