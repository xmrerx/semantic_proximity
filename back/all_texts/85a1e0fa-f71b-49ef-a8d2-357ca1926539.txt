We are blessed to be joined tonight by Carryn Owens, the widow of a U.S. Navy special operator, Senior Chief William Ryan Owens.
Ryan died as he lived: a warrior, and a hero battling against terrorism and securing our nation.
I just spoke to General Mattis, who reconfirmed that, and I quote, Ryan was a part of a highly successful raid that generated large amounts of vital intelligence that will lead to many more victories in the future against our enemies.
Ryan s legacy is etched into eternity.
For as the Bible teaches us, there is no greater act of love than to lay down one s life for one s friends.
Ryan laid down his life for his friends, for his country and for our freedom we will never forget him.
