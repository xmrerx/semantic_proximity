Russia interfered in the 2016 U.S. presidential election in order to help Donald Trump become president of the United States, according to a CIA report the Washington Post has obtained.The CIA has concluded in a secret assessment that Russia intervened in the 2016 election to help Donald Trump win the presidency, rather than just to undermine confidence in the U.S. electoral system, according to officials briefed on the matter.Intelligence agencies have identified individuals with connections to the Russian government who provided WikiLeaks with thousands of hacked emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, including Hillary Clinton s campaign chairman, according to U.S. officials.
Those officials described the individuals as actors known to the intelligence community and part of a wider Russian operation to boost Trump and hurt Clinton s chances.A senior official told the Post, It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected.
Not only does this report show that Russia got its desired result in 2016, but it also shows how the mainstream media who reported on Clinton s emails and ignored or downplayed hundreds of major stories about Trump s business dealings and ties to Russia was an accomplice in its actions.Other governments are now on full alert for possible Russian interference, most notably in Germany where spy agencies have already made public announcements about Russian attempts to tilt the scales against Angela Merkel, one of the last liberal leaders who isn t under Putin s influence and control.America has never had a president so in debt to a foreign government, let alone the only other nuclear power in the world.
It will now fall to the American people, and not its incoming president, to safeguard against Vladimir Putin and his avalanche of propaganda.Featured image via Flickr
