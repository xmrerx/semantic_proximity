The game plan for Republicans isn t exactly difficult to figure out.
They control their uninformed base through fear.
If you re a Republican, it s because you re afraid.
Afraid someone will take your paycheck and give it to someone who chooses not to work.
Afraid that the economy is about to crash because teenagers working for minimum wage might get a raise.
Afraid that ISIS lives in your neighborhood, that the Obama administration put them there and any minute now they ll be pounding on your door to take away your guns.The fear is, quite simply, ridiculous.
Terrorists rule through fear.
They use it to control people.
Is it really any wonder that when some right-winger goes nutty and starts shooting people indiscriminately that we call them terrorists?
They are born of the party of fear.The latest sleazy tactic of Republicans comes from their fundraising committee.
Rather than send out the kinds of mailers that you may see from the DNC that tell a story and ask for a donation, the RNC is sending out a fundraiser that looks like a bill, obviously aimed at swindling the elderly and uninformed.
The mailer comes in an envelope with a giant red NOTICE OF DELINQUENCY on the front.
Inside, the chairman of the RNC himself notifies the addressee that they have funds past due and if they know what s good for them they ll pay.It s a tactic that may be legal; that doesn t make it any less despicable.
For Reince Priebus to allow his name to be printed on the bottom of this trash right along with hiss signature proves that the GOP cares only about the money.
Rachel Maddow does a great job of exposing this travesty, which was sent to her watchdog site, sendittorachel.com, by a concerned citizen.
