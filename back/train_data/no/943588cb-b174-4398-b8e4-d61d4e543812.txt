cairo ( reuters ) - egyptian police arrested seven people on monday after they were seen raising a rainbow flag at a concert , security sources said , in a rare public show of support for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender rights in the conservative muslim country .
security sources said the seven were arrested for promoting sexual deviancy , a euphemism in egypt for homosexuality , after they were seen on camera raising the rainbow flag at a mashrou leila concert , a popular lebanese alternative rock band whose lead singer is openly gay .
egyptian public prosecutor nabil sadek ordered the state security prosecution to immediately investigate the incident , state news agency mena reported .
the public prosecutor has not yet announced a decision on whether formal charges will be filed and a case brought to court .
although homosexuality is not specifically outlawed in egypt , it is a conservative society and discrimination is rife .
gay men are frequently arrested and typically charged with debauchery , immorality or blasphemy .
the largest crackdown on homosexuals in egypt took place in 2001 , when police raided a floating disco called the queen boat .
fifty-two men were tried in the case , which drew widespread criticism from human rights groups and western governments .
