This bombshell just in is more evidence of the swamp trying to bring down President Trump using unlawful conduct .
Please note that GSA career staff aka swamp dwellers gave the Trump documents to the special counsel s office Fox News reports:A lawyer for the Trump presidential transition team is accusing Special Counsel Robert Mueller s office of inappropriately obtaining transition documents as part of its Russia probe, including confidential attorney-client communications and privileged communications.In a letter obtained by Fox News and sent to House and Senate committees on Saturday, the transition team s attorney alleges unlawful conduct by the career staff at the General Services Administration in handing over transition documents to the special counsel s office.Kory Langhofer, the counsel to Trump for America, wrote in the letter that the special counsel s office is aware that the GSA did not own or control the records in question.
But, Langhofer says, Mueller s team has extensively used the materials in question, including portions that are susceptible to claims of privilege.
The Trump transition team lawyer argued the actions impair the ability of future presidential transition teams to candidly discuss policy and internal matters that benefit the country as a whole.
Langhofer requests in the letter that Congress act immediately to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives.
