Hillary doesn t care about anyone but Hillary I m not Voting for Clinton.It has nothing to do with her views.
It really doesn t even matter about all the laws she broke.It s because She actually talked to me once.
Almost a sentence.
But first, some background.Being a K9 handler in the Military I got to do a few details involving Distinguished Visitors.
Mostly Generals, DOD Officials, and Secretaries of Defense.
I was lucky enough to pull two awesome details.
George W Bush, and Obama.GW looked at me, said Man, who d you piss off high fived me, and continued on.
I was climbing down from a catwalk I stood on for 4 hours with nothing but Dust and a radio to keep me company.
The radio died early on.
It was pretty sweet.Obama, as he was walking out to his plane in Turkey, said What the hell kind of dog is that?!
In reference to Suli.One of my Last details was for Hillary when she was Secretary of State.
She was in Turkey for whatever reason.
I helped with sweeps of her DV Quarters and staff vehicles.
Her words to me?
Get that Fucking dog away from me.
Then she turns to her Security Detail and berates them up and down about why that animal was in her quarters.
For the next 20 minutes while I sit there waiting to be released she lays into her detail, slamming the door in their faces when she s done.
The Detail lead walks over apologizes and releases me.
I apologize to him for getting him in trouble.
His words Happens every day, Brother Hillary doesn t care about anyone but Hillary.Here is the actual Facebook post:
