I know there are only 60 days left to make our case and don t get complacent, don t see the latest outrageous, offensive, inappropriate comment and think well he s done now.
We are living in a volatile political environment.
You know, just to be grossly generalist, you could put half of Trump s supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
The racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic you name it.
And unfortunately there are people like that.
And he has lifted them up.
He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people now have 11 million.
He tweets and retweets their offensive, hateful, mean-spirited rhetoric.
Now some of these folks, they are irredeemable, but thankfully they are not America.
But the other basket and I know this because I see friends from all over America here I see friends from Florida and Georgia and South Carolina and Texas as well as, you know, New York and California but that other basket of people are people who feel that the government has let them down, the economy has let them down, nobody cares about them, nobody worries about what happens to their lives and their futures, and they re just desperate for change.
It doesn t really even matter where it comes from.
They don t buy everything he says, but he seems to hold out some hope that their lives will be different.
They won t wake up and see their jobs disappear, lose a kid to heroin, feel like they re in a dead end.
Those are people we have to understand and empathize with as well.
