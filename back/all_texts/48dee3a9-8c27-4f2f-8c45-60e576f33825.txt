And it has gone on too long.
This bloodshed must end.

President Trump spoke of Abraham Lincoln and Ford s Theatre with heartfelt fondness.Ford s Theatre is administered and maintained by the National Park Service as a historic landmark, but it is also a working theater operated by the Ford s Theatre Society.
The gala is a fundraising event for the FTS, whose purpose is to secure private financing for much of the theater s programming.
It dates back to the Carter Administration.Traditionally, the President has hosted a pre-gala reception at the White House.
However, the Obamas chose not to attend in 2015 or 2016, citing the death of Beau Biden and scheduling conflicts as reasons.
This led to a complete cancellation of last year s gala.
