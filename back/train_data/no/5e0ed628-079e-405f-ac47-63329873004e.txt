the good news is , now that obama s released all the criminals from jail , there should be plenty of room for hillary , eric holder , loretta lynch , lois lerner , barack obama and his tax cheat buddy , al sharpton even though he s just a presidential hopeful , donald trump has wasted no time telling america his top pick is for attorney general .
and , if you were somehow involved in the benghazi scandal or hillary clinton s email debacle , you d better watch out.in a tuesday tweet , trump said that he would pick south carolina representative and chairman of the house select committee on benghazi trey gowdy as his attorney general , were he to be elected president .
@ hillaryclinton s toast .
dems had better get the b team off the bench .
@ tgowdysc ( trey gowdy s twitter username ) for attorney general under president trump , trump tweeted.rep .
gowdy , whose tenacious manner with liberals and obama administration officials has earned him the nickname the bulldog , has been a conservative favorite for quite some time now .
in fact , before the 2014 republican sweep of congress , political action group the tea party leadership fund endorsed gowdy to take over john boehner s position as speaker of the house.while gowdy didn t get that job , it might be even more satisfying seeing the south carolina bulldog at eric holder s old desk , prosecuting all of those democrats let slide during the obama administration.via : conservative tribune
