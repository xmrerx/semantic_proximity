vienna ( reuters ) - austrian conservative leader sebastian kurz said on monday he has yet to decide which party he plans to start coalition talks with , though he was still widely expected to turn to the far-right freedom party within days .
having won last week s parliamentary election with 31.5 percent of the vote , kurz s party is well short of a majority , needing a coalition partner to gain control of parliament and form a stable government .
only two parties have enough seats to do that with the social democrats and the freedom party .
it has yet to be decided with whom we want to start negotiations .
i will clarify that in the coming hours or days , kurz told reporters after a meeting with president alexander van der bellen that many expected to be followed by an announcement on who coalition talks would be held with .
there are certain issues that i would like to discuss again informally or clear up before i start negotiations , he added , declining to specify what those issues were .
