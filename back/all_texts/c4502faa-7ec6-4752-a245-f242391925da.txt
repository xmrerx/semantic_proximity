Like moths to a lamp bam!The terror suspect who allegedly helped orchestrate the shootout at an anti-Islam event in Texas had aspirations to join Islamic State and attack the Super Bowl, authorities say.Abdul Malik Abdul Kareem, 43, was described as off-the-charts dangerous by officials as they outlined the evidence against him.
He was arrested last week on charges related to the shootout at a Prophet Muhammad cartoon contest, which led to the deaths of two roommates from Phoenix, Arizona.An indictment filed in federal court in Phoenix says Kareem hosted the gunmen in his home from January and also provided the guns they used in the May 3 shooting in Garland.At a hearing in federal court, FBI special agent Dina McCarthy described how a witness and a confidential informant reportedly learned about Kareem s interest in the Islamic State, including watching the terror group s videos with Texas shooters Elton Simpson and Nadir Soofi.McCarthy said a 2012 investigation into Kareem determined he had a terrorism training document on his computer.She claimed he wanted to attack the Super Bowl when it was in Arizona this year but she provided no specifics about how serious he was.The magistrate denied bail for Kareem, who is charged with conspiracy, making false statements and interstate transportation of firearms with intent to commit a felony.
This is an individual who is apt to incite violence, prosecutor Kristen Brook said.
This defendant, based on all these facts, is dangerous he is off-the-charts dangerous.
Defense lawyer Daniel Maynard called it a trumped-up case based largely on an unreliable confidential informant charged with kidnapping and sex trafficking.
This is your typical jailhouse snitch, Maynard said adding that there was no proof Kareem purchased any of the guns used in the Texas shooting.Via: UK Daily Mail
