Most Americans are perplexed that the frontrunner of a major party for president of the United States is a guy like Donald Trump, with the even less impressive and quite creepy Ted Cruz coming in at second.
These last few months have also left much of the world questioning how America, which has historically stood for many good things, can have someone like Donald Trump on the cusp of the Republican nomination.
Yet, despite the fact that Trump has truly shown the ugly side of America, there s also a wonderful and inspiring side, with great values that are inherent in a great people.That was all on display in a powerful message that New York voters, who will be going to the polls on April 19th, sent to Donald Trump, America, and the world.
Simply stated, the message was that Donald Trump s values are not the values of America.Watch video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPY1vQoT5wU] While it s true that America has many problems to overcome like racism, income equality, we are a society that dehumanizes women, and our politicians religiously support apartheid and racism in Israel, we are a work in progress and we can be better and many of us truly work to be better.Donald Trump and the rest of the GOP clowns running for the nomination are all that s ugly in America.
It s an America that the majority of us try to improve.
Having one of these people as president would not only normalize this ugliness, but it will make it worse.
That s why it s vital that the majority of the American people, who actually reject these clowns, go out and vote come November.
