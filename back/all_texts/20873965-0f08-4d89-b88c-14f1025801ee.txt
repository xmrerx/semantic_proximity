Hillary Clinton s corruption is on a scale we have never seen before.
We must not let her take her criminal scheme into the Oval Office.
I have great respect for the fact that the FBI and the DOJ are now willing to have the courage to right the horrible mistake that they made.
This was a grave miscarriage of justice that the American people fully understood, and it is everybody s hope, that it is about to be corrected.
MUST WATCH!!
