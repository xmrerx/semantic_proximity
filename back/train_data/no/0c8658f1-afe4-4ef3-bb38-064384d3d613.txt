caracas ( reuters ) - venezuela s opposition blamed president nicolas maduro s government on monday for the death of a sick activist in detention , saying he was framed and then denied medical help .
carlos garcia , a local legislator in western apure state , suffered a stroke in august after being arrested in late 2016 during protests and having money planted on him , his party said .
two days before his death on sunday , garcia was granted house arrest but was never transported home , the justice first party added in a statement , saying the accusations were invented and he was never allowed adequate medical help .
he should never have been in prison and should never have died at the hands of a repressive government whose hands today more than ever are stained with blood , said the party s secretary general , tomas guanipa .
venezuela s opposition parties accuse maduro , the 54-year-old successor of hugo chavez , of being a dictator and maintaining hundreds of political prisoners on trumped-up charges .
he denies that , saying all activists behind bars are there on legitimate charges , including for terrorism and coup-plotting against his socialist government .
venezuela s supreme court said garcia had been detained on suspicion of theft , instigation of disorder , and arson .
he had received appropriate medical attention in hospital for a condition of immuno-deficient infectious disease , which may have led to the fatal brain problem , it added in a statement .
we request the nation s political leaders to abstain from giving irresponsible opinions with false information intended to cause alarm in the population .
on the contrary , we must give christian respect to this venezuelan citizen s memory .
