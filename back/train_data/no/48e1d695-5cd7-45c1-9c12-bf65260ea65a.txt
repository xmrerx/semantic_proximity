edinburgh ( reuters ) - a poll has found that 51 percent of britons would now keep european union membership while 41 percent want to leave the bloc , a near reversal of last year s referendum result .
the bmg poll of 1,400 people for the independent published on the newspaper s website on saturday came as britain moves into a second phase of negotiations on exiting the eu , which will focus on trade .
the independent said the lead for remain over leave was the biggest in any poll so far since the vote in june 2016 .
but the head of polling at bmg , quoted in the independent , said that the reason for the change was a shift in opinion among those who did not vote in last year s referendum , while around nine in 10 leave and remain voters were unchanged in their views .
the survey was carried out from december 5 to 8 .
in the referendum last year , 52 percent of britons voted to leave the eu and 48 percent voted to remain .
mike smithson , an election analyst who runs the www.politicalbetting.com website who is also a former liberal democrat politician , said on twitter it was the biggest lead for remain since ( the eu referendum ) .
prime minister theresa may this week secured an agreement with the eu to move brexit talks on to trade and a transition pact , but some european leaders warned that negotiations , which have been arduous so far , could now become tougher .
