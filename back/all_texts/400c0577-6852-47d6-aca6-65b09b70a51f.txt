Over the weekend Donald Trump has been bashing Civil Rights icon Rep. John Lewis, even going so far as to say he hasn t done anything.Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results.
All talk, talk, talk no action or results.
Sad!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017Congressman John Lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S.
I can use all the help I can get!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017You see, Trump and his fragile ego couldn t handle Lewis calling him an illegitimate president because of all the intelligence revealing Russia helped him get elected.If you recall, John Lewis marched alongside Martin Luther King, Jr., throughout the Civil Rights movement, even speaking at the same memorable event where King uttered his brilliant I have a dream speech.Needless to say, when Trump dared to tweet out a wickedly generic tweet about Martin Luther King, Jr. on Monday morning, it was not received well at all.Trump tweeted: Celebrate Martin Luther King Day and all of the many wonderful things that he stood for.
Honor him for being the great man that he was!

@realDonaldTrump As you wish we stand against the tyranny, injustice, and racism you represent, and which MLK worked his life to rid.

@realDonaldTrump Birtherism, housing discrimination, dishonoring John Lewis, calling inner cities hellscapes, The Wall, Jeff Sessions Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) January 16, 2017Those actions are the opposite of everything MLK fought for.
So many Americans will honor #MLKDAY by recommitting to fight your agenda.

@realDonaldTrump Will I be seeing you at the Museum of African American History today?
Oh no, cause you canceled that.
Right.
Kris Sanchez (@KrisSanchez) January 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump Honor him by respecting John Lewis's 50 year record fight for human rights.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 16, 2017Yes, why don't you?
https://t.co/HIDspTVn9g Sarah Wood (@SarahWoodwriter) January 16, 2017Morning, @realDonaldTrump, do you find it odd attacking John Lewis one day and praising MLK the next?
Curious.

Scott A. Jones (@chachaman) January 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump We will celebrate MLK Jr by standing with John Lewis pic.twitter.com/sMBgzG2vs9 Matthew A. Cherry (@MatthewACherry) January 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump political correctness ~ you can't truly appreciate and honor what Martin Luther King Jr stood for but step on @repjohnlewis Slade Douglas (@SladeDouglas) January 16, 2017JFK White House in '63 @realDonaldTrump: here's King standing & working for civil & voting rights.
That's John Lewis right there behind him.

One side shows how absolutely vile he is, and the other how he tries to manipulate the fools who are desperate to believe him.If Trump wants to honor MLK, he could start by first honoring America by not pretending to actually care when he doesn t.Featured Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images
