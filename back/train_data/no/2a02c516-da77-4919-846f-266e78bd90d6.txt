lusaka ( reuters ) - the emergency powers invoked by zambian president edgar lungu three months ago will expire with effect from midnight on wednesday , the nation s justice minister said .
lungu on july 5 invoked emergency powers to deal with acts of sabotage by his political opponents .
the declaration will duly expire at midnight tonight .
i wish to state , however , that the expiration should not be misconstrued as an invitation to break the law , as other laws stay in place , justice minister given lubinda told parliament .
lubinda said the police were still investigating some cases of suspected sabotage but did not give further details .
under state of emergency laws , police can prohibit public meetings , detain suspects longer than usual , search without a warrant , close roads , impose curfews and restrict movements .
zambia s main opposition party , the united party for national development ( upnd ) , said the decision to invoke emergency powers had dented zambia s image .
upnd spokesman charles kakoma said the government only used the decree to intimidate opposition supporters who were detained and later released without any charges .
there was no need to for the state of emergency and that is why the government has not given us any serious update on people arrested for sabotage , kakoma told reuters .
