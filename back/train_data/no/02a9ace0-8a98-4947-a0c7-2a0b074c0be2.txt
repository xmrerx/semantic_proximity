in case you haven t heard , donald trump is due in federal court next month just after he may be elected president to answer charges that he raped a 13-year-old girl in 1994 and threatened to harm her and her family if she told anyone about it.the victim , jane doe , is seeking $ 75,000 in damages .
the lawsuit was originally filed in california but was thrown out because the original complaint did not state any specific civil rights violations .
she refiled in new york in june , dropping some of the harder-to-prove claims and replacing them with two new witnesses .
both witnesses claim they worked as party planners for trump s pedophile friend jeffrey epstein , who threw them some cash to attract adolescent women to the billionaire s mansion.one witness says she lured jane doe to a party by promising her cash and modeling contracts but instead the 13-year-old child was forced to have sex with trump and epstein , both of whom knew how young she was .
i personally witnessed four sexual encounters that the plaintiff was forced to have with mr. trump during this period , including the fourth of these encounters where mr. trump forcibly raped her despite her pleas to stop , tiffany doe says , adding that she also witnessed doe and a 12-year-old girl named maria being forced to perform oral sex on trump , with the 2016 gop nominee physically abusing both children afterward all of this as part of her job duties that required her to personally witness and supervise encounters between the underage girls that mr. epstein hired and his guests .
both trump and epstein threatened to hurt doe if she told anyone about the horrific assaults , with trump adding a very trump-like threat : i personally witnessed defendant trump telling the plaintiff that she shouldn t ever say anything if she didn t want to disappear like the 12-year-old female maria , and that he was capable of having her whole family killed .
epstein was convicted in 2008 of soliciting an underage girl for prostitution and served 13 months in prison but trump went on to find himself one goose-step away from being the leader of the free world.while this might seem unbelievable , trump hasn t exactly hidden his lust for children over the years , going on about how hot paris hilton was when she was 12 , creeping on underage models in their dressing rooms , and repeatedly talking about how much he wants to have sex with his daughter , ivanka.you can read the allegations below : donald trump & jeffrey epstein rape lawsuit and affidavits by davidbix on scribdfeatured image via getty images/win mcnamee
