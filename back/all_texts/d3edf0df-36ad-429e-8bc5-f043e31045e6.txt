The Wisconsin Department of Justice just released an email that was exchanged between members of the Scott Walker administration that is so outrageous it has to be read to be believed.The document was sent by Wisconsin s former corrections secretary Ed Wall, to Scott Walker aide Rich Zipperer.Wall is currently on paid leave, as the FBI and state attorney general s office conduct a massive investigation into allegations of abuse inside Wisconsin s juvenile prison system.According to the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel, Wall is just one of many members of Walker s administration implicated in the juvenile sex abuse scandal.The Journal Sentinel reports, State officials at the highest levels have known of attacks and sexual assaults at the prison without either contacting or fully disclosing the details to county officials, family members of victims and even law enforcement, since at least February 2012.The paper goes on to say: The pattern of not sharing glaring problems continued for years, and meaningful change came only after the public learned late last year of the probe into Lincoln Hills and the sister facility on its campus, Copper Lake School for Girls.
The email exchanged between Wall and Walker s aide sheds a light on what might have been going on in Walker s administration, which would impede the sharing of information.Details of the email, published by the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel here, indicate that these Walker officials would do just about anything to avoid transparency.Wall wrote: I know that you didn t want me sending this electronically or to the office because of the (open) records issue, so I elected instead to send it to your home in writing and would ask that you feel free to shred it once you ve looked it over.
Nobody will know that I sent it and this is strictly between you and me.
I understand the concern the administration has over creating records, Rich, but I can t let that harm me or my family worse that we ve already been harmed.
Wall asked that he be reinstated to his old job, and went on to say that he didn t want to have to get a lawyer to make it happen.
He also implied that the governor himself was on his side in the matter.In a statement to the Milwaukee-Wisconsin Journal Sentinel, Wall s attorney referred to the statements in the email as an unfortunate use of language.
Meanwhile, Scott Walker spokesperson Laurel Patrick pointed to the fact that the document wasn t shredded, as a way to show how honest and transparent the Walker administration is.If anything, the fact that this email wasn t shredded is just one more indication of how completely incapable Walker officials are of doing anything right.For once though, the bungling of Walker staffers might actually help the citizens of Wisconsin, instead of hurting them.Now that Wall s email has been inadvertently exposed to the public, the people of Wisconsin have a better idea of what they re fighting against.
Beyond that, federal and state investigators now have a better idea of what it will take to shut Walker s criminal enterprise down once and for all.Featured image via Wikipedia
