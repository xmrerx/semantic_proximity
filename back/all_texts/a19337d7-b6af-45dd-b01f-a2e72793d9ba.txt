Senator Pat Toomey is a staunch Republican caught in a close re-election race against Kate McGinty in Pennsylvania, and he ll apparently do anything to hold on to his seat in that key swing state including pretending to support the President.Here is the ad currently being run in Pennsylvania, showing Toomey allying himself with Obama:Not surprisingly, President Obama who has endorsed McGinty and campaigned on her behalf did not take too kindly to Sen. Toomey s attempt to fool voters.
Pat Toomey may have done the right thing on one vote, but courage is telling Pennsylvania voters where you stand on the tough issues, not just the easy ones like background checks, Obama said in a statement Saturday afternoon.
Pat Toomey won t tell Pennsylvania voters where he stands on Donald Trump, trying instead to have it both ways by telling different people what he thinks they want to hear.
That s not courage.
Voting to shut down the government and against bills to close the terrorist gun loophole isn t courage.
Lauren Passalacqua, of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) described the ad this way: This is among the most disingenuous stunts we ve seen in a cycle full of them.
President Obama is scheduled to campaign in Pennsylvania on Monday, where polls show Hillary Clinton ahead of Trump, but have McGinty and Toomey in a neck-and-neck contest.The President is almost sure to make some reference to Toomey s sad campaign ad, and tweak him over the desperate nature of the attempt.Democrats believe that Toomey s seat is key to their strategy to take back the majority of seats in the Senate.
Currently, online prediction models show the party with a slightly over 60% likelihood of doing so.
Having a Democratic Senate with Clinton in the White House would be key to nominating a Supreme Court justice, maintaining the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and getting some of Clinton s proposed legislative agenda made into actual law.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
