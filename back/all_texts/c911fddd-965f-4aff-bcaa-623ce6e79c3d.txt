Potentially billions of dollars of damage has been done by the CIA to tech companies, Assange said, adding trust has been damaged by the revelations, in both the US government and US exports.
He later added that some of the fixes to devices exposed as vulnerable by the leak would be quickly fixed but others, including smart TVs, would be more difficult and take longer to fix.
WikiLeaks has a lot more information, Assange said, adding that we have decided to work with them, to give them some exclusive access to some of the technical details we have, so that fixes can be pushed out.
