divisions over may s future burst into the open on friday after her conference speech was ruined by a comedian , coughing fit and even letters falling off the slogans behind her on stage .
shapps told bbc radio that there was a broad range of lawmakers urging may to step down .
these are remainers , they are brexiteers .
they would never automatically agree on a single candidate and this is not about promoting an individual , he said .
