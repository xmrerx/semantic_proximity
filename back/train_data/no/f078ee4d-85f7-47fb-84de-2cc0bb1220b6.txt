jerusalem ( reuters ) - the israeli military said on sunday it destroyed an outpost belonging to the islamist group hamas in the gaza strip on sunday after gaza militants fired a rocket toward israel .
the rocket set off air raid sirens in southern israel but fell short , landing inside palestinian territory , the israeli military said in a statement .
in response , an ( israeli ) tank targeted and destroyed a hamas outpost in the southern gaza strip , it said .
officials in gaza said no one was injured when the tank shell struck a hamas observation post near the border with israel .
there was no immediate claim of responsibility for the palestinian rocket fire .
israel said that it holds hamas accountable for what happens in the territory .
the group has observed a de-facto ceasefire with israel since a 2014 war , but small armed cells of jihadist salafis have continued to occasionally launch rockets at israel .
when those attacks occur , hamas usually orders its fighters to vacate potential targets for israeli retaliation .
