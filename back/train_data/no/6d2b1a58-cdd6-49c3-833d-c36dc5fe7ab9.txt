lusaka ( reuters ) - zambian president edgar lungu has warned constitutional court judges not to stop him running for another term in office , state media reported , drawing a rebuke from a top legal body .
lungu told supporters on thursday the judges could plunge the southern african country into chaos if they made any adventurous rulings , the zambia daily mail and times of zambia reported .
allies of lungu s patriotic front party have asked the supreme court to confirm that he will be eligible to stand again in presidential elections scheduled for 2021 .
opponents say that would break the constitution which bars leaders from standing for three terms .
he argues his first period in office doesn t count as he took over after the death of the last leader without an election .
lungu told a political meeting in the northwestern town of solwezi that he had information that the judges were thinking of barring him from standing again , the newspapers said .
to my colleagues in the judiciary , i am just warning you because i have information that some of you want to be adventurous , your adventure should not plunge us into chaos please , lungu was quoted as saying .
he said they should not follow the example of kenya s supreme court , which annulled the result of a presidential vote in august .
there was no immediate comment from zambia s supreme court , which is due to meet to consider the election case on nov. 16 .
the law association of zambia asked lungu on friday to withdraw his warning saying it served to undermine the authority of the judiciary and erode public confidence in the institution .
there was no immediate response from the presidency .
lungu invoked emergency powers on july 5 to deal with acts of sabotage by his political opponents .
the state of emergency expired on oct. 11 .
