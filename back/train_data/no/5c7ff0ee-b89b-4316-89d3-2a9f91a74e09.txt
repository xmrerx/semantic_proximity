there are plenty of news items without this type of story even making it on the news .
this is also a huge reason why americans and people around the world are turning to the new media with twitter , facebook and blogs that report what the news doesn t or won t. if you d like to speak up against this particular news station here s the contact information to e-mail or call : wtkrnorfolk , virginia ( scroll down for video ) a woman in virginia was arrested tuesday after having sex with her unconscious boyfriend in the parking lot of a shopping center.36-year-old kimberly m. jackson told wtkr : i was in the mood , and that s basically what happened .
once police arrived , they found jackson and her boyfriend , earl palmer , in the parking lot .
