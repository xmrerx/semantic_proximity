mexico city ( reuters ) - the powerful former leader of mexico s largest teacher s union , elba esther gordillo , will be let out of jail under house arrest more than four years after her detention on embezzlement charges , government and judicial sources said on friday .
gordillo , 72 , was unexpectedly arrested in 2013 in the first year of president enrique pena nieto s government , in what appeared to show the ruling institutional revolutionary party ( pri ) taking a stand against corruption .
but the attorney general ( pgr ) this week stopped fighting gordillo s lawyer s attempts to get her out of prison , and a tribunal approved , said the sources , who spoke on condition of anonymity .
the judicial source said that in a matter of hours or days she would be allowed to go home .
the decision to let gordillo see out her trial under house arrest came as the political party she founded , the new political alliance party ( panal ) , said it would back the pri in the 2018 election .
