we love sarah huckabee !
she is a no-nonsense spokesperson for president trump !
the video below is a classic !
hold on jonathan , i let you finish and read off every single one of those statements .
so , unless you want to trade places i think it s my turn now .
the president is the only person that can fire the director of the fbi .
he serves at the pleasure of the president , the president made the decision , it was the right decision .
the people that are in the dark today are the democrats .
they want to come out and talk about how they love comey and how great he was , look at the facts in washington we finally had something that i think we should have all been able to agree on , and that was that director comey shouldn t have been at the fbi , but the democrats want to play partisan games sarah huckabee sanders : the people who are in the dark today are the democrats https : //t.co/cia8zzz5ek daniella diaz ( @ daniellamicaela ) may 11 , 2017please go to the 23:26 point for the entire back and forth between sarah and jonathan carl : boom !
