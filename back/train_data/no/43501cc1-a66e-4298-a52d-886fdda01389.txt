berlin ( reuters ) - chancellor angela merkel s conservatives secured a fourth consecutive term in office on sunday in an election that brought a far-right party into the german parliament for the first time in more than half a century , exit polls indicated .
after shock results last year , from britain s vote to leave the european union to the election of u.s. president donald trump , many look to merkel to rally a bruised liberal western order and lead a post-brexit europe .
merkel s conservative bloc - her christian democrats ( cdu ) and their bavarian allies , the christian social union ( csu ) - won 32.5 percent of the vote , making them by far the largest parliamentary group , according to an exit poll for the broadcaster ard .
their closest rivals , the center-left social democrats ( spd ) , slumped to 20.0 percent - a new post-war low .
the far-right alternative for germany ( afd ) stunned the establishment by finishing third and entering parliament for the first time with 13.5 percent .
merkel , europe s longest-serving leader , joins the late helmut kohl , her mentor who reunified germany , and konrad adenauer , who led germany s rebirth after world war two , as the only post-war chancellors to win four national elections .
she must now form a coalition government - an arduous process that could take months as all potential partners are unsure whether they really want to share power with her .
