tripoli ( reuters ) - libya s coastal guard has rescued more than 250 illegal migrants trying to leave the north african country in small boats bound for italy , officials said on saturday .
libya s western shores are the main departure point for migrants mainly from sub-saharan countries fleeing poverty and conflict trying to reach europe .
arrivals to italy have fallen by two-thirds since july from the same period last year after officials working for the u.n.-backed government in tripoli , italy s partner , managed to cut back human smuggling in the city of sabratha west of the capital .
that has pushed the trade further east , with the coast guard intercepting several boats off the coast near qaraboulli and zliten , two towns located east of tripoli .
the naval forces ibn ouf vessel rescued ( on friday ) illegal migrants including women , children and men ... they are from different sub-saharan and arab countries , coast guard captain abdulhadi fakhal told reuters .
they were rescued off qaraboulli and zliten towns ... and they are about 250 to 270 persons , fakhal said .
libya has plunged into chaos since the 2011 overthrow of muammar gaddafi in a nato-backed uprising .
a u.n.-backed government of national accord in tripoli has been trying to gain control of territory .
