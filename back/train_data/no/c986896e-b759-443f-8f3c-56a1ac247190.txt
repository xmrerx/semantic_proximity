perhaps this young girl aspires to be the first lady someday .
is it really fair to fire her for making racist remarks on social media when our president and first lady have been on a hate/blame the white man media tour since they entered the white house ?
meet illinois resident shana poohpooh latrice , a brookfield zoo employee who made the mistake of sharing an instagram photo on facebook with the caption , at work serving these rude ass white people : she made the even bigger mistake of tagging the photo as having been taken at the zoo.as a result , brookfield zoo got bombarded with a litany of complaints from pissed-off zoo visitors who found her comments to be clearly hateful and racist .
some even demanded that latrice be fired for her mistake , and judging by what spokeswoman sondra katzen told reporters , that s exactly what s going to happen .
this employee s statements in social media are in violation of our policies and do not reflect our institution s values , she said .
we have zero tolerance for these kinds of divisive behaviors .
we treat all employment matters confidentially , but rest assured that we have taken prompt action to remedy the situation .
