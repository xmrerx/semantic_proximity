Students at George Mason University overwhelmingly thought Ahmed Mohamed s homemade clock looked like a bomb, according to a new video published online.Dan Joseph, with the conservative Media Research Center, visited the campus just outside D.C. and showed students a photo of the controversial clock.
He then asked them what they thought it looked like.
I m going to show you this and you tell me what you think it is the first thing that pops in your head, Joseph told the students.No it doesn t resemble a bomb it s actually a ticket to the White House, a job offer at Twitter and Facebook, an MIT education, a reason for an online fundraiser and instant celebrity with more interview offers than this innocent Muslim boy of an activist Muslim father can schedule
