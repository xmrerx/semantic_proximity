A successful business man has launched a political campaign against Paul Ryan.
We love what he s doing even though it s unconventional.
Paul Nehlen put up billboards this week that are devastating to the Republican Speaker:Following last night s historic Brexit vote, House Speaker Paul Ryan s primary challenger, Wisconsin businessman Paul Nehlen, seems to have taken a page from the playbook of the U.K.
Independence Party (UKIP) with the launch of a new billboard campaign.On Friday morning, Nehlen s campaign went live with a new billboard in Ryan s hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin that is reminiscent of the distinctive UKIP-style campaign.The ad reads: Radical Islam Kills Americans.
Vote YES for Immigration Control.
Vote NO for Paul Ryan.
The billboard then directs viewers to Nehlen s campaign website, ElectNehlen.com.UKIP s national billboard campaign is distinctive for its clear, straight-forward manner of describing the effects of large-scale migration and its impact on workers and Western culture.
