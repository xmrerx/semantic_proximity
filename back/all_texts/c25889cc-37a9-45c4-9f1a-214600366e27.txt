Judge Napolitano explains what s going on as only he can do He does a great job!
The Senate has a rule they can force the senate to raise the majority to 60 that s called a filibuster.
Napolitano goes on the explain that the Dems are furious because Obama s pick for the court wasn t given his day.
They also obviously feel Gorsuch is too conservative.
The hypocrisy of the Democrats and Chuck Schumer is exposed when a video of past approval for Gorsuch is shown.
Schumer, Blumenthal and Nelson are voting no.
Democrats who are up for reelection are voting yes.Orrin Hatch on Democrats: They re politicizing this whole process.
This is a guy who is a mainstream conservative, which they hate.
They don t like that.
And of course, they are still upset about my other friend, Merrick Garland.
But the Republicans had every right to delay that within a presidential election year.
I can t go back in time and show you any case where in a presidential election year they allowed a Supreme Court justice to be nominated unless both sides agreed.
And both sides didn t agree.
