paris ( reuters ) - forty people were arrested and 500 people rescued after a swoop on human trafficking across west africa , international police organization interpol said on thursday .
the interpol-led action comes amid a global outcry sparked by footage of africans being solved as slaves in libya , often the final transit for migrants wanting to reach europe .
in a statement , interpol said that some 500 people , including 236 minors , had been rescued in simultaneous operations across chad , mali , mauritania , niger and senegal .
forty suspected traffickers were arrested .
the results of this operation underline the challenge faced by law enforcement and all stakeholders in addressing human trafficking in the sahel region , said the operation s coordinator innocentia apovo .
the 40 arrested face prosecution for offences including human trafficking , forced labor and child exploitation .
they are accused of forcing victims to engage in activities ranging from begging to prostitution , with little to no regard for working conditions or human life , the statement said .
