( reuters ) - florida s insurance and reinsurance market is well equipped to handle hurricane losses , but irma could strain the state s coverage market depending on the extent it makes landfall in florida , according to rating agencies .
irma , the second major hurricane to approach the united states in two weeks , is expected to make landfall in south florida on sunday morning .
fitch said if the storm were to produce insured losses greater than $ 75 billion , some florida insurers and reinsurers could experience notable financial strain .
irma hit the dominican republic and haiti on friday , heading for cuba and the bahamas .
the projected path and severity of irma creates the potential for economic and insured losses to significantly exceed those experienced in hurricane andrew in 1992 , fitch said .
strong capitalization of the insurance and reinsurance sector will help mitigate the impact of irma , s & p global ratings said .
