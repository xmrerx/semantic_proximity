It appears that Obama ally, Angela Merkel is more popular with Muslim migrant males than the citizens of Germany .German voters turned to the far right in droves yesterday in a damning verdict on Angela Merkel s open door border policy.
In regional elections she was humiliated by the anti-immigrant AfD Alternative for Germany party.Formed just three years ago, it has surged in popularity following Mrs Merkel s decision to roll out the red carpet for more than a million migrants.Analysts said the regional poll in which Mrs Merkel s ruling Christian Democrats lost two out of three states was a worst case scenario for the embattled chancellor ahead of a general election next year.The timing made it a virtual referendum on Germany s refugee policy.
It will also be seen as an indictment of the failure of Europe s ruling classes to acknowledge the public s fears about migration.Mrs Merkel s welcome for arrivals from Syria, other parts of the Middle East and North Africa, has caused chaos across the continent.Initially, the incomers were greeted by crowds of well-wishers.
But, faced with the sheer numbers, public opinion soured.
And there was outrage when gangs of migrant men were involved in organised sex attacks on women in Cologne and other cities on new year s eve.One by one, EU states have thrown up border fences to stop the flow of arrivals leading to the slow collapse of the Schengen passport-free zone.
