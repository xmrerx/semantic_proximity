In a lame effort to score political points for Hillary Clinton, the New York Times published a portion of Donald Trump s 1995 tax return.
They re now promoting the idea that Trump could have not paid taxes for decades.
Could have doesn t mean he did!
Does anyone care that a man with a huge business empire might try and pay less taxes or work the tax system to his advantage?
Isn t that what most people do and it s legal to do it!
I would question Trump s sanity if he begged to pay more taxes!
The front pages of the tax returns themselves are essentially a non-issue, representing the 1995 gross business loss incurred by candidate Donald Trump who operates a massive conglomeration of business entities.The anti-Trump political angle is easily identifiable within the extensive article use of: could have , might be , may have , phrases used throughout the woven narrative.
Journalistic narratives are rarely based on facts.The identified $916 million single year operating income loss is no different than current losses of Amazon, Facebook, Twitter and a host of other corporations and businesses.Actually, Donald Trump s 1995 loss is smaller than the operating loss the New York Times reported when it sold the Boston Globe in 2013 for a net loss of $1.03 billion.The Times purchased the Boston Globe in 93 for $1.1 billion and sold it in 2013 for $70 million, a loss of $1.03 billion.
However, for some reason it s doubtful the Times will publish their own 2013 tax returns.
That doesn t meet the political need.THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN RELEASED THIS STATEMENT:Read more: Conservative Treehouse
