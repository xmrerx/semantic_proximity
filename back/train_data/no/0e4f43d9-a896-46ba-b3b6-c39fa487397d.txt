because it was a joke before it was politically incorrect ? before al franken became a united states senator from minnesota , he had a long career as a comedian ( save for stuart saves his family ) , an original writer on saturday night live , and later as a political radio host on air america.during that time , and when he was writing books like rush limbaugh is a big fat liar and lies and the lying liars who tell them : a fair and balanced look at the right , franken took some shots at his now-fellow senator john mccain s military service .
he also made one joke in a 2000 salon.com essay just as presidential election season started picking up steam .
here s the remark : i have tremendous respect for mccain but i don t buy the war hero thing .
anybody can be captured .
i thought the idea was to capture them .
as far as i m concerned he sat out the war .
before everyone suggests franken need to apologize just like donald trump should , here s why this is different : back in 2000 , franken was not a political figure .
he wasn t a sitting anything or a candidate for anything ; the closest he came to political officialdom was as a revered satirist .
more importantly , he even re-told the joke to mccain s face in 2004 , when the senator was on franken s own radio show.here s how franken s spokesperson commented on the joke : the fact that a statement came so quickly from franken s office demonstrates that he is well-aware it is a terrible thing to say about mccain.on the other hand , trump is not just not apologizing , he s doubling down .
because he knows we ll all keep writing about it.but hey we all need a good clown , even if unintentional .
it s a long presidential race .
