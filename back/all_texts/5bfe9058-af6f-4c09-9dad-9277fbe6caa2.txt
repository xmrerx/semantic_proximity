Robert De Niro gave anti-Donald Trump protesters across the United States his backing Friday as he spoke about how depressed the tycoon s win in the presidential election had made him.The 73-year-old star was on the red carpet at the world premiere of his new film The Comedian in Los Angeles when he was asked how he was coping with Trump s victory over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
How am I doing?
I m very depressed, the famously laconic Raging Bull actor told reporters.
We have to just wait and see how things go and keep our eyes ever vigilant on the new government.
Asked if he thought the protests were an appropriate response to the outcome of Tuesday s election, he replied: Yes, absolutely.
Things aren t being done right.
Demonstrators took to the streets in Miami, Los Angeles, New York and other US cities for a third straight night on Friday.In Manhattan, they held signs reading Your Wall Can t Stand in Our Way a reference to the anti-immigration barrier the billionaire has promised to build on the US border with Mexico.De Niro hasn t minced his words in his criticism of Trump, describing him as a punk, a pig and an idiot.
I d like to punch him in the face, he said before the election.Earlier in the day a town in southern Italy where De Niro s grandparents came from offered the actor a means of escape.
If, after the disappointment of Trump, he wants to take refuge here, we are ready to welcome him, said Antonio Cerio, the mayor of Ferrazzano.
The Comedian, De Niro s passion project which took him eight years to bring to the big screen, was part of this year s program for the American Film Institute s annual AFI Fest in Los Angeles.
