Earlier today, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan dropped a truth bomb that absolutely humiliated Donald Trump and made him look like a moron.After he had a meeting with the undeserving Trump, Ryan was later asked about the calls for a prosecutor to look into Russia s interference in the U.S. election, which the intelligence community has reported extensively on.Trump has denied over and over again that Russia meddled in the U.S. election, and has repeatedly shot down and offended the CIA and other intelligence organizations in order to protect Russia and his favorite tyrant, Vladimir Putin.
So when Ryan responded to the question with the exact opposite stance that Trump has taken, it made the former reality television star look even more foolish than before.
Clearly, this is yet another thing that the Republican Party is divided on right now.Ryan stated very bluntly that Russia without a doubt DID mess with the U.S. election on Trump s behalf, further embarrassing Trump for his ridiculous defense of the country.
Ryan said: We know Russia meddled in the election.
No one is disputing that.
And this last government gave us that information in the first place.
No one is alleging that some American was in on it beforehand.
And yet, there s still a little problem with Ryan s statement the part where he says no one is disputing that.
Let s remind him that just yesterday, Trump tried to convince everyone that all this Russia talk is FAKE NEWS and blamed the Democratic Party and media for being petty and bitter over the election loss.Trump is seriously delusional, and Ryan s statement perfectly illustrates that the Republican Party is splitting from Trump in many ways, unable to agree with his insanity.
Looks like Trump is alone in defending Russia, and the GOP doesn t care if they make him look like an idiot anymore.
