Liz Heron, executive editor at The Huffington Post, tweeted out a photo from their editorial meeting on May 20, and it has Twitter in an absolute uproar.
Can you see why?Notice anything about this @HuffingtonPost editors meeting?

It s diversity, or a lack thereof.
Where s the racial diversity?The editorial staff is primarily white, like most executive staffs at most companies, and Twitter was kind enough to point that out, along with a couple of other problems: An Ed table full of white women, and @HuffingtonPost s 2016 readership is in the toilet.

@lheron it seems that the @HuffingtonPost has a few kinks left in the cloning process?

(@PyramidPorts) May 22, 2016@lheron @HuffingtonPost The fact that you don t notice what apparently half of the people in the world do says a lot about your POV.
All Bass, No Treble (@tiffmc1013) May 22, 2016This next one is needling HuffPo over the fact that it loves painting itself as the liberal answer to conservative media.
However, it behaves like a typical, profit-mongering corporation that would support conservative business policies to enhance its bottom line, and engages in questionable practices to that same end, like having thousands of writers work for free.
@lheron@HuffingtonPost What I notice is that nobody there is more than 3 years out of college.
Ignorant, but cheap as dirt to hire.
Robert Tracinski (@Tracinski) May 20, 2016In going through these tweets, one will see some predictably sexist tweets about how it s just as sexist for a company to have an entirely female leadership staff as it is for them to have an entirely male leadership staff.
That s male privilege talking, though we still live in a man s world here.
Women have it much harder in the workplace, including climbing that vaunted corporate ladder, than men do.An all-female editorial team in a man s world is great.
However, for a supposedly liberal outlet, whatever attempts they re making at racial diversity suck.
We have to wonder whether their HR department screens out resumes of people with black sounding names like many other HR departments do.
We also have to wonder whether they consider black people to automatically be less qualified, like many other companies seem to.Perhaps they re afraid they ll lose readers if their readers know they have black people on their editorial staff.Yes, companies should absolutely put the people they believe to be the best qualified in open positions.
Oftentimes, however, black candidates are judged more harshly than other candidates, especially white candidates, due to racial biases in a variety of areas.
HuffPo, this is extremely disappointing.Image via screen capture from embedded tweet by Liz Heron
