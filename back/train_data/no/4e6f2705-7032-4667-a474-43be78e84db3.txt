have you ever been prevented from attending a rally , protest , or emergency call to action by the lack of a babysitter ? , the site reads .
woke babysitting wants to help .
the site is the hub for a google group , where progressive parents of tots can sign up to become a sort-of child-sharing service , watching each others kids when lawyers , legal observers , and activists may be called upon for urgent action , and don t have time to line up a neighborhood sitter.ostensibly , while you re out rocking your pussy hat on the washington mall or filing emergency stays with the supreme court , your woke babysitter will line up age-appropriate social justice-oriented activities so that your child is raised with all the proper compassion and wokeness required of today s offspring.when you get back from the bar ( or wherever else you happen have your post-protest karmic transfer reiki meeting ) , your children will be waiting with black lives matter signs , subversive art projects , or having heard politically correct bedtime stories.via : heatstreet
