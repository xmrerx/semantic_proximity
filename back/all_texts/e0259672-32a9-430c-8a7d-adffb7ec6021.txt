Wow!
Open threats that government will kill the president had to be clarified by Jake Tapper.
BUT Please listen to this unhinged commentator on CNN and tell us the Deep State doesn t exist:I found the actual for video You guys decide if this is okay or not.
Change agents=threats.
Words like this on National TV is not right.
pic.twitter.com/dQKksW47ef Bobby Axelrod (@SirBobbyAxelrod) August 10, 2017These CNN commentators were discussing the fact that Putin fired embassy employees in Russia.
We reported (see video below) that President Trump said it s fine that Putin fired the employees because it saves the U.S. money.
These loose cannons went ballistic and said that government will kill him.
Even if it s not literally to kill, it s still a very threatening message!
The entire commentary is disturbing!Here s what the panel was referring to: This is priceless!
President Trump just gave the best response ever to a reporter s question!
He said he wanted to thank Russian President Vladimir Putin for reducing his payroll by firing U.S. embassy staff in Moscow.
Hysterical and so quick!
Watch how Trump doesn t skip a beat with his response:After Sanctions on Russia were put in place in July, Putin ordered 755 embassy personnel out of Russia.President Trump was asked today during a press conference what he thought of the firing.
His response was quick and decisive.
He said he wanted to thank Putin for the firing: No.
I want to thank him, because we re trying to cut down on payroll.
And as far as I m concerned, I m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll.
He continued: There s no real reason for them to go back.
So I greatly appreciate the fact that they have been able to cut our payroll for the United States.
We ll save a lot of money.
THE TRUTH IS THAT THE CNN PANEL KNOWS NOTHING!
THE TRUTH IS THAT MOST OF THESE EMPLOYEES ARE RUSSIAN!SOURCE: BBC
