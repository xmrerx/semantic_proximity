berlin ( reuters ) - german police detained a 29-year-old man suspected of trading narcotic drugs internationally over the internet through anonymous websites and sending them by mail to customers in germany , police said on wednesday .
in cooperation with dutch authorities , police seized 400,000 euros ( $ 470,840 ) and 75 kg ( 165 lb ) of ecstasy , marijuana , cocaine , amphetamine and heroin at the apartments of the suspect and at his mother in the netherlands .
the dealer and his partners , using the pseudonyms mr. drug commander and drugs squad , were receiving orders mostly from german customers on black market websites such as hansa market and dream market , federal criminal police said .
the man , who was not identified , was arrested on nov. 9 while entering germany to mail 34 shipments of drugs .
a day earlier , in ingolstadt in bavaria , police had arrested a man who had ordered marijuana and amphetamines .
dutch authorities are still looking for other gang members .
police said online drug shops are boosting drug consumption and trafficking , requiring a shift in approach by german authorities .
the supposedly anonymous ordering on the internet motivates more young people to buy , consume or even sell drugs for profit , said federal criminal police in a statement .
police said the investigation began in august , leading to the initial arrest in october of six people in the bavarian town of coburg , which in turn helped identified 12 other buyers .
german customs police in july said they expected far more cocaine to flood into europe in the future , and had seized nearly five tonnes of the drug in northern sea ports so far this year , more than three times their total in 2016 .
