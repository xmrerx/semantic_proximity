Most leaders, when they give statements on atrocities happening elsewhere in the world, use the opportunity to condemn those atrocities and pledge some kind of help or solidarity.
Not Trump.
As he has done in the past, he used a devastating attack in Syria as an opportunity to slam his imaginary enemies in this case, President Obama.
When he was done with that, he decided to tack a condemnation onto his statement.
The whole thing reads:Trump statement on Syria chemical attack brings up Obama s red line pic.twitter.com/WUl3GPeYCo Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) April 4, 2017The problem is that Trump repeatedly urged Obama not to engage in Syria at all.
He said Obama should focus on our many problems, on our country, and forget Syria.
He said things of this nature at least four times:President Obama, do not attack Syria.
There is no upside and tremendous downside.
Save your powder for another (and more important) day!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 7, 2013If Syria was forced to use Obamacare they would self-destruct without a shot being fired.
Obama should sell them that idea!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 6, 2013Obama must now start focusing on OUR COUNTRY, jobs, healthcare and all of our many problems.
Forget Syria and make America great again!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 11, 2013AGAIN, TO OUR VERY FOOLISH LEADER, DO NOT ATTACK SYRIA IF YOU DO MANY VERY BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN & FROM THAT FIGHT THE U.S. GETS NOTHING!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 5, 2013So what was Obama supposed to have done?
Attack and cause a problem, or not attack and cause a problem?
Twitter s having a field day with this:@BraddJaffy Trump mentions the red line.
Well guess what @realDonaldTrump, you re in charge now.
You get to do something about it.
Or not.
Choose wisely lawhawk (@lawhawk) April 4, 2017@BraddJaffy Does Trump even realize that HE is actually the President now?
TrumpsTaxes (@TrumpsTaxes) April 4, 2017@MikeMayoral @BraddJaffy Yeah I just don t know how bad this exposure is and he just pretends he didn t say this lol.
Used to be a day where you owned up to things Ti Dog True 4K (@BeastFireTimdog) April 4, 2017@BraddJaffy Kind of makes you wonder whether Trump was in cahoots w/ Russia back in 2013.

He was correct being wrong because he hadn t known he knew more @ the time.
Ted Hogbin (@tedomega) April 4, 2017@BraddJaffy @ktumulty How do u spell FLIP FLOP JAMES BAXTER (@JAMESBAXT) April 4, 2017No, Trump s tweets do not age well in a lot of cases.
A foolish leader called a previous leader foolish for wanting to go into Syria, and then blames his lack of action there for today s attack.
