WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan welcomed Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s choice of Mike Pence as a running mate on Friday, saying the Indiana governor comes from “the heart of the conservative movement.” “I can think of no better choice for our vice-presidential candidate.
We need someone who is steady and secure in his principles, someone who can cut through the noise and make a compelling case for conservatism.
Mike Pence is that man,” Ryan said in a statement.
