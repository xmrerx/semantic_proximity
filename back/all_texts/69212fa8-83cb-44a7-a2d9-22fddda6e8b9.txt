For the last nine or so months, we ve all had to witness Donald Trump try to foray himself into our lives as a possible contender for Commander-in-Chief.
He s pretty much on every news cycle 24/7, and there s absolutely no escaping.
If you don t watch television, he will be on the internet.
If you don t go on the internet, he will be in your newspaper.
If you don t read the newspaper, you re probably a Trump supporter.Well, during Trump s most recent town hall appearance on MSNBC with Chris Matthews, Trump said his most Trumpian things, and we all watched and listened in horror as he said women should be punished for getting an abortion.However, it was during one moment, probably around the time you started to tune him out and stare at your phone, that Trump was asked a question by Matthews and the girl sitting visibly in the camera shot just couldn t hold her straight face any longer.She, in essence, is all of us:You can t really tell if she s going to laugh or cry, but she s definitely sitting there in utter disbelief.
It is, most certainly, how we all feel every day regarding the likes of Donald Trump.Kudos, to you, young lady.
We do not know your name, but you are a hero.
