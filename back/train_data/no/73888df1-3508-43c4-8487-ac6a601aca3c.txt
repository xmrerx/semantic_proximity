berlin ( reuters ) - a german federal judge issued an arrest warrant on wednesday against a 19-year-old syrian man detained on suspicion of planning a bombing attack , the public prosecutor s office ( gba ) said in a statement .
police detained the man , identified only as yamen a. under german privacy laws , on tuesday and prosecutors said they believe he had planned an islamist-motivated bomb attack with the aim of killing as many people as possible .
he had been in contact online with jihadists including one who described himself as a soldier of the caliphate , a spokeswoman for the federal prosecutor s office said .
yamen a. was arrested in the northeastern town of schwerin .
police searched his home and also those of other people not suspected of being directly involved .
the arrest comes one month before the first anniversary of an attack in berlin by a failed tunisian asylum seeker who killed 12 people by plowing a truck into a christmas market .
concrete blocks have been installed around christmas markets at several central squares in the capital this year before the festive season opens in a couple of weeks .
