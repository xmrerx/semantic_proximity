harare ( reuters ) - the head of the youth wing of zimbabwe s ruling party on wednesday publicly apologized on state television to the military , which has seized power saying it aims to isolate criminals in president robert mugabe s entourage .
kudzai chipanga , whose powerful zanu-pf youth wing has been a strong supporter of mugabe and his wife grace , said he had voluntarily given his statement apologizing for denigrating defense forces chief general constantino chiwenga .
it was an abrupt about-face for chipanga , who on tuesday accused the army chief of subverting the constitution .
defending the revolution and our leader and president is an ideal we live for and if need be it is a principle we are prepared to die for , chipanga had said at the party s headquarters in harare .
