Just another solider in Obama s Race War against Americans Funny I don t recall innocent people being shot because one of Obama s angry soldiers was upset about the multiple murders of young blacks in Chicago each and every week.A Tennessee man who fired on a motel and shot at passing cars on a highway was upset over recent police shootings, officials said Friday.Lakeem Keon Scott, 37, killed one person and wounded three others, including a police officer, when he opened fire early Thursday outside a Days Inn in Bristol, according to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation.Investigators believe Scott wanted to harm police officers and others because he was angered by high-profile encounters between the police and black people across the country.
Scott is black and all four of the shooting victims are white, according to the TBI.
The work to investigate the motivation for this incident remains active and ongoing, TBI said in a statement Friday.
Preliminarily, the investigation reveals Scott may have targeted individuals and officers after being troubled by recent incidents involving African-Americans and law enforcement officers in other parts of the country.
