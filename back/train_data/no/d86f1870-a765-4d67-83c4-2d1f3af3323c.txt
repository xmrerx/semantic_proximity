if obama had a communist friend he d be this poor victim raul castro the champion of human rights and justice what a dog and pony show.cuban leader raul castro used his first speech before the united nations general assembly to lash out at the international body , saying monday that member states have failed to produce much beyond an illusion of the human rights , justice and development promised in the charter.castro made scant mention of last summer s landmark restoration of ties with the united states after a five-decade break , instead delivering a searing indictment of world superpowers for allowing millions to remain hungry , illiterate and at risk of death by curable illnesses while annual military expenses worldwide amount to more than $ 1.7 trillion .
barely a fraction of that figure could resolve the most pressing problems afflicting humanity , castro said.castro received warm applause and scattered cheers when he made his u.n. debut , and several latin american and african leaders gave him a standing ovation at the end of his remarks , in apparent approval of his narrative that western colonialism and imperialism are at the roots of today s conflicts .
he didn t name names , but his allusions to the united states and its allies were clear as he criticized invasions and overthrows , the selective and discriminatory approach to human rights , and the threat of climate change stemming from an irrational and unsustainable consumerism .
there have constantly been wars of aggression and interference in the internal affairs of the states , the ousting of sovereign governments by force , the so-called soft coups and the recolonization of territories , castro said.via : mcclatchydc
