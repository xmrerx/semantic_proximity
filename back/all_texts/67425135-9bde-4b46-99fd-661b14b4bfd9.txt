I don t think there are too many people who would disagree with that sentiment, given Obama s obvious desire to make Americans believe Islam has nothing to do with Islamic terror.
In the wake of yet another attack on American soil by a radicalized Muslin gunman, actor Scott Baio questioned whether President Barack Obama wants to eliminate the United States as it was created.
Appearing on Fox Business, the former Happy Days star was asked if the president is reluctant to say Islamic terror.
He s absolutely reluctant, Baio replied.
I can t tell, Lester, if he s dumb, he s a Muslim or he s a Muslim sympathizer.
And I don t think he s dumb.
WATCH here:Baio, an ardent supporter of Donald Trump, was asked to explain Obama s actions.
I have no idea, the actor replied.
Like I said, either he s a sympathizer, a Muslim sympathizer or he s a Muslim to allow this to keep happening.
He insisted that Trump is the only person who wants to do something about these attacks by Islamic extremists.Borrowing from Obama s 2008 promise of fundamentally transforming the United States of America, Baio speculated on what may be the end game for liberals like Obama and Hillary Clinton.
Is it to totally eliminate the United States as it was created and founded and the way it is now?
he asked.The actor went on to say he is baffled by the inaction from Obama and Clinton, saying the only time they get angry is at Republicans.
