The applications for White House interns just took a sharp nose-dive Former President Bill Clinton could practically serve an unconstitutional third term as president if Hillary Clinton becomes sick in office if elected, given the previous first ladies who acted as presidents on behalf of their sick husbands.Former First Ladies Nancy Reagan, Mamie Eisenhower and Lady Edith Galt Wilson all made presidential decisions while their husbands were ill in office.Galt Wilson in particular acted as the de facto president when President Woodrow Wilson suffered a stroke in 1919 to prevent Vice President Thomas Marshall from assuming the presidency because Marshall was too friendly to Wilson s political rival in Congress.
If a President Hillary Clinton s health were to decline, it is a certainty that former President Bill Clinton would emulate Galt and act in his wife s stead as president, said investigative journalist Wayne Madsen.
Senator Tim Kaine was chosen as Mrs. Clinton s running mate because he, as was Marshall, is a milquetoast politician who would not seek to become acting president of the United States in the event of the incapacitation of the president.
For Bill Clinton, serving as the de facto president would be an effective third term as president, something barred by the U.S. Constitution.
Additionally, Woodrow Wilson s personal physician concealed the president s stroke from the public, which of course draws comparisons to how the Hillary campaign is downplaying concerns over Hillary s health, despite 71% of doctors stating her problems could be disqualifying.
Both physicians and other voters think that health concerns are relevant when choosing a presidential candidate, stated Jane M. Orient, M.D., the executive director of the Associations of American Physicians and Surgeons.Via: InfoWars
