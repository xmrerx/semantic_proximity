In the middle of a Twitter tantrum directed toward Mitch McConnell, James Clapper, Democrats and the fake news, Donald Trump retweeted a bit of light hearted boasting in the form of a meme that shows Trump eclipsing President Obama.In the meme, Trump s beaming color-filled picture eclipses a dour black and white photo of Obama.pic.twitter.com/6XJxEg1gSs Jerry Travone ?

In the meme, Obama is compared to the sun, which literally sustains all life.
Trump is portrayed as a rock that temporarily blocks the light.This is actually correct.
The Darkness of Trump has overtaken the brightness of Obama.
The Sun is what gives us life and energy!
Ed Krassenstein (@EdKrassen) August 24, 2017If so, we are left in the darkness of corruption, collusion, dishonesty, bigotry, and sheer stupidity.
#Resist so the sun can shine again!
Lorraine Devon Wilke (@LorraineDWilke) August 24, 2017The orange sun does not eclipse the moon.
The moon eclipses the sun.
In the case of dt, he will forever be OVERSHADOWED by OBAMA!
She Speaks (@Words_Echo) August 24, 2017Eclipses are supposed to go away quickly so can you resign already so we can have the beautiful sun back?
Matthew Luis (@AgtMluis) August 24, 2017so you re saying Obama is a star like the sun and you re a lifeless rock that s MOMENTARILY blotting out his light.
FINALLY A truthful tweet A Silver Tongue (@asilvertongue) August 24, 2017Other s simply noted Trump s pathological obsession with his far superior predecessor.He ll never measure up to Obama and he HATES it his insecurity/psychopathy renders him beyond unfit for office Mouth of Sauron (@simon_lindsell) August 24, 2017dt is eaten up w/envy of @POTUS44.
dt has no hope of being even an INTH of the MAN or President that OBAMA is.
And, learn your science 1/ She Speaks (@Words_Echo) August 24, 2017 Hey, who is that awesome black guy up there whom I want to be just like!
