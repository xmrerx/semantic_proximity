Idiots!
That s the first comment at Yale Alumni magazine on twitter under the proud announcement of the removal of a musket from a stone carving We couldn t agree more with the commenter Idiots for sure!Check out the comments There s hope!
Yale Alumni Magazine provided a blurb entitled Disarmament to explain why they felt it necessary to remove/hide/disfigure a stone carving of a Puritan pointing a musket at a Native American: Was not Appropriate YALE ALUMNI MAGAZINE:If you were especially observant during your years on campus, you may have noticed a stone carving by the York Street entrance to Sterling Memorial Library that depict a hostile encounter: a Puritan pointing a musket at a Native American (top).
When the library decided to reopen the long-disused entrance as the front door of the new Center for Teaching and Learning, says head librarian Susan Gibbons, she and the university s Committee on Art in Public Spaces decided the carving s presence at a major entrance to Sterling was not appropriate.
The Puritan s musket was covered over with a layer of stone (bottom) that Gibbons says can be removed in the future without damaging the original carving.At the York Street entrance to @yalelibrary, a Puritan has been disarmed.
