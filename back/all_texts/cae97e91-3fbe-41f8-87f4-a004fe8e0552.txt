Anyone who uses a driving service such as Uber or Lyft takes on the risk that their driver might be completely unhinged.
While on the way to a Bernie Sanders rally in Salt Lake City, Utah, one man, named Samuel Grenny, and his girlfriend experienced the horror of being passengers in a Lyft car driven by a racist Donald trump supporter.The young couple s ride quickly became a progressive s nightmare after they told the driver where they were going.
I explained where we were going and what it was for, and very quickly he seemed to tense up about it, Grenny told Fox 13.
He started to say that Muslims categorically are terrorists.
And then he proceeded to call Muslims pieces of crap, but a much unkinder word than that.
At that point my girlfriend started videotaping, she was very shaken.
The verbal exchange was recorded.
In the video, the conversation between the driver and the couple went like this:Grenny: You told me, in a cab that I m paying for, that Muslims are pieces of [expletive].
Driver: Muslims are pieces of [expletive].
Grenny: Oh good, please tell me some more about how you feel man.
Driver: Why don t you pull your head out of your [expletive] [expletive]?
Grenny: Why don t you pick up a freaking book, man.
You are literally what is wrong with this country, and you re trying to blame minorities.
Driver: No you are the one that s wrong with this [expletive] country.
Driver: Get the [expletive] out you piece of [expletive].
Grenny: Good luck buddy.
Driver: [Expletive] get out of my car.
At that point, the couple is forced to leave the car before they reach their destination.Grenny contacted Lyft and complained about the driver.
Lyft gave Grenny a full refund and an apology.
Lyft also fired the driver.
As Grenny notes, the service industry is no place for a person like that to be working in.Here is the video footage of the incident and the Fox 13 news report on the story below.Report: Recording:Featured Image from video screenshot
