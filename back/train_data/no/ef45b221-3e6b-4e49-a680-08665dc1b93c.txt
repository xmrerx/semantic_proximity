dublin ( reuters ) - the irish government is hopeful northern ireland s political parties will make a fresh attempt at restoring their devolved power-sharing government in the next few weeks , foreign minister simon coveney said on thursday .
the latest efforts to break a near year-long stalemate collapsed at the start of this month , prompting britain to begin setting a budget for the province , a major step toward imposing direct rule from london for the first time in a decade .
many in northern ireland fear direct rule would further destabilize a political balance between pro-british unionists and irish nationalists that has already been upset by britain s vote to leave the european union .
i hope in the next few weeks we will be able to get back around the table .
i think it is fair to say the parties are trying to move this forward and i hope the governments will be able to facilitate an agreement , coveney told parliament .
coveney helped facilitate the talks as ireland is a co-guarantor of the 1998 good friday agreement which ended 30 years of sectarian violence that killed 3,600 people .
he said he still believes a deal is achievable .
irish nationalists sinn fein and the pro-british democratic unionist party ( dup ) shared power for a decade until sinn fein pulled out of government in january , complaining it was not being treated as an equal partner .
dup leader arlene foster has said she hopes talks can resume soon while sinn fein has called for greater intervention from the governments in dublin and london .
analysts say a fresh round of talks is unlikely to be contemplated before the dup s annual conference on nov. 25 .
