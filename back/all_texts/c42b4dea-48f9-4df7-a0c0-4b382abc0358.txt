The hosts of a racist, white nationalist radio show say that they were given official press credentials by Donald Trump s presidential campaign.
Even worse, the show says that they were given access to Donald Trump, Jr. and recorded a 20 minute interview with him.The program is called The Political Cesspool, and has a considerable history and record of promoting white supremacist ideas and concepts.Political Cesspool radio host James Edwards wrote on his blog that he attended a Donald Trump rally in Memphis on Saturday night as a fully credentialed member of the media and enjoyed the unique experience of being able to air a live broadcast of The Political Cesspool Radio Program from inside the press pen while the event was in full swing.
The host said that the interview with the younger Trump will be posted on their website on Saturday.He also bragged that Trump is the first Republican nominee he plans to vote for.
After getting an official press pass, the white nationalists were given access to the press area of Trump s campaign rally.
Edwards wrote, After getting my start in politics with Pat Buchanan in 2000, Donald Trump will be the first Republican nominee that I have ever voted for.
Buchanan was a man ahead of the times and Trump is his vindicator.
Pat Buchanan is of course the former Nixon operative and NBC contributor who has written books excusing the Holocaust and praising Hitler.The Political Cesspool radio show has in the past argued that interracial sex is white genocide and slavery is the greatest thing that ever happened to black people.Trump recently triggered a national outcry by refusing to disavow or deny an endorsement from white nationalist and former Ku Klux Klansman David Duke in an interview with CNN host Jake Tapper.
After being slammed for the failure to distance himself from a notorious racist, Trump concocted the claim that he was having problems with his earpiece and didn t hear the question.He made no such indication during the interview, and in fact repeated the terms David Duke and white supremacist.
