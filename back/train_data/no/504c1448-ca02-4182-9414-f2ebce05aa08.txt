after general powell s email server was hacked it seems that hillary and trump were not the only ones he attacked with insults and nasty rhetoric.powell went after retired lt. gen. michael flynn , a top trump military adviser .
powell called flynn a jerk who is unchained and a right-wing nutty .
powell however had to admit once called on the insults that he has actually never even met flynn nor did he ever serve with him.he responded by stating , talking to people in the know , his real problem was leadership and management issues at dia .
senior staff was in incipient revolt .
he has been over the top in his comments , conduct unbecoming .
but he is unchained .
he continues by saying , pattern of behavior which is why he was fired .
real question is how he got that far in the army .
flynn did respond during an interview on the kelly file .
i ve actually been called worse things by my little sister .
he went on to say , colin powell , he s an amazing guy , amazing service , but he s actually , you know , as a footnote in history , he s going to be always struggling for his credibility because of the statement that he made to the united nations that brought us into the war in iraq .
after the disparaging remarks towards hillary , trump , flynn and a even a few other service members were highlighted as having been said by powell , flynn did caution that prominent individuals need to be more careful about what they send electronically.h/t [ fox ]
