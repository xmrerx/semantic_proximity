For many people, Jon Stewart s The Daily Show was a welcome antidote to anything that happened during each day of the George W. Bush presidency.
Now that we are 114 days into the era of President Donald Trump, it is needed more than ever.
Luckily, Jon Stewart, Samantha Bee, Ed Helms and Rob Corddry were brought together by Stephen Colbert to give the country the next best thing; a Daily Show reunion.The group of funny people chatted about their experiences on the show, clips were played and they did one sketch.
Watching the group talking about the sketches they had done and then looking at the sketches themselves was a good way to remember why we loved that show just so much.It is sometimes hard to imagine how the events that are currently happening in Washington, DC could possibly be satirized but it would be great to watch these talented people give it a try.Part one:Part two:Stephen Colbert s last day at the Daily Show.
