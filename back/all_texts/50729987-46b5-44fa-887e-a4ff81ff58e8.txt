As much as Jeronimo Yanez, the police officer who killed Philando Castile, wants to claim he didn t pull over Castile s vehicle because of race, audio from police dispatch that night tells a very different story.According to Castile s girlfriend Diamond Reynolds, in the livestream video she took that night, they were pulled over because of broken tail light.
However, after revealing that he was legally carrying a firearm, but then reaching for his wallet to show identification, the officer panicked and shot Castile several times.The St. Anthony Police Officer claims that he shot Castile because of the presence of that gun and the display of that gun, which still has yet to be determined, but why the car was pulled over in the first place seems a lot more clear after listening to the audio from dispatch.Officer Yanez says: I m gonna stop a car.
I m gonna check IDs.
I have reason to pull it over.
Then he says: The two occupants just look like people that were involved in a robbery.
The driver looks more like one of our suspects, just cause of the wide set nose.
It was a minute and a half later when shots rang out and Castile died from his injuries in front of his girlfriend and his girlfriend s daughter.
All because Castile looks a certain way according to the cop who killed him.This isn t okay, and justice needs to be served.Listen to the police dispatch audio here:Here s a portion of the #PhilandoCastile dispatch call released by #KARE11 pic.twitter.com/4J5TzVcLUk BallerAlert (@balleralert) July 10, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
