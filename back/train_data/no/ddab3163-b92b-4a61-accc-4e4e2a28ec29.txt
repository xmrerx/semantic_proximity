berlin ( reuters ) - the number of turks seeking asylum in germany is up sharply this year and has been rising steadily since last year s failed military coup in turkey , german government data showed on monday .
germany got 4,408 asylum applications from turkish citizens between january and august , compared with 2,836 in the same period of 2016 , an increase of 55.4 percent , according the federal office for migration and refugees ( bamf ) .
there is an increase in asylum applications by turkish applicants .
however , i can not give the reasons for that because we do not make statistical surveys of why people flee , a spokeswoman of the german interior ministry said .
in april , the interior ministry said at least 262 turkish diplomats and army personnel have applied for asylum in germany since the failed coup on july 15 last year .
following the coup attempt , turkey has arrested more than 40,000 people and sacked or suspended more than 100,000 in the military , civil service and private sector .
germany s mainstream parties have been outspoken critics of turkey s crackdown turkish defense minister fikri isik urged germany in january to reject asylum applications from 40 mostly high-ranking former soldiers suspected by ankara of having links to the coup .
less than a quarter of turkish asylum seekers have been granted protection in germany since the beginning of 2017 , although that is almost triple last year s 8.2 percent .
