The hypocrisy of our media is astounding!
What about Hillary s major corporate donors like GE for example, that have been working the loopholes in our tax system for decades?
Does anyone care that Hillary has been taking money from some of America s biggest corporate tax dodgers for several years?
Bernie Sanders recently outed the 10 biggest multinational corporations that paid no federal taxes for at least one year between 2008 and 2012.
Sanders has made reining in corporate tax dodgers a key point of his presidential platform.
In a recent press release, the Sanders campaign laid out the Vermont senator s plans to force multinational corporations to pay their fair share in taxes:As it turns out, all ten of those same companies are some of Hillary Clinton s biggest donors, whether to her campaign or to her family foundation.1.
GENERAL ELECTRIC According to data from the nonpartisan group Citizens for Tax Justice (CTJ), GE posted $33.9 billion in U.S. profits, yet somehow got $2.9 billion in refunds in that same time period.

And as Zaid Jilani reported in Alternet last year, Hillary Clinton is the favored candidate of numerous Verizon executives, many of whom have given the maximum donation to her 2016 effort:Verizon vice-presidents Lydia Pulley, Kathleen Grillo, and Donna Epps each gave $2,700 to Hillary for America.
Verizon senior vice-president Thomas Edwards and vice-president Chris Debosier pitched in $1,000.
Leecia Eve, a former Hillary staffer who today is a lobbyist for Verizon gave $2,700.
