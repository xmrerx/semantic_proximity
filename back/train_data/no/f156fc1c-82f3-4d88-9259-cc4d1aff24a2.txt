the left wants to change hurtful words to whatever they deem to be ok but they got some push back with the order to keep the word illegal alien in the library of congress in a victory against political correctness , the house voted to order the library of congress to continue referring to illegal aliens rather than change the designation to noncitizen .
the party line vote had democrats fuming , claiming the term was pejorative and that liberal doublespeak can never be repealed once it s in use.well that s not exactly what one democrat said .
texas democrat rep. joaquin castro told the house , the words illegal alien will be retired .
this will change , whether it s now or six months from now or 10 years from now .
for the first time in history , conservatives hijacked a legislative appropriations bill to stop the library of congress from abandoning the term illegal alien from how it catalogs the 162 million-item collection it manages .
texas congressman joaquin castro attempted to make an amendment to the legislation allowing the library of congress to make the change , but it failed to gain traction in the republican-dominated house .
each year , the library of congress makes thousands of changes to its subject headings ; in 2015 alone , it added 4,934 new subject headings .
never before has congress weighed in on the library of congress subject headings in any way , let alone legislated on the issue , castro said in a statement.via : pj media
