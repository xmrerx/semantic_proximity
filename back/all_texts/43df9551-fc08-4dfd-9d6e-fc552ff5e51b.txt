Meanwhile, the Obama s jet off to Hawaii every year well before Christmas.
When you read the reason why the Bush s wait in DC until after Christmas day, you ll see why its really all about putting others before yourself Like many Americans, U.S. presidents often take time off around the holidays.However, according to journalist Joseph Curl, who previously covered the White House, former President George W. Bush went on Christmas vacation in a way that stands in direct contrast to President Barack Obama.
[H]ere s the thing: In December, we never left Washington, D.C., until the day after Christmas.
Never.
Mr. Bush and his wife, Laura, would always depart the White House a few days before the holiday and hunker down at Camp David, the presidential retreat in Maryland, Curl wrote in a 2013 column that was republished Thursday.After a few years, curiosity finally got to the former Washington Times reporter and he asked a low-level administration official why.
I still remember what she said, Curl wrote.
So all of us can be with our families on Christmas.
Who was us ?
Hundreds and hundreds of people, that s who.
Sure, the reporters who covered the president, but also dozens and dozens on his staff, 100 Secret Service agents, maybe more, and all of those city cops required whenever the president s on the move in D.C., Curl added in his column.However, things seemingly changed when Obama took office.
[T]his president would never delay his trip to his island getaway.
He s off every year well before Christmas.
Hundreds and hundreds head off with him, leaving family behind, Curl wrote.
No Christmas at home, he added.
Instead, the Hawaiian Village Waikiki Beach Resort.
Nice, but not exactly home.
