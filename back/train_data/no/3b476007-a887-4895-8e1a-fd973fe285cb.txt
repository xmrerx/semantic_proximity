like megyn kelly , who lost her supporters when she became obsessed with destroying donald trump , it s time for shepard smith to go .
let s face it , he would be much better suited for the small audiences of liberal viewers on cnn or mnsbc.it s time to go shep and today s rant is a perfect example of why : clip : @ shepnewsteam sticks up for cnn 's jim @ acosta & went further pic.twitter.com/iitxqazxxf johnny dollar ( @ johnnydollar01 ) february 16 , 2017remember the time shepard smith cut off his guest s mic when they attempted to tie black lives matter to the kidnapping and torture of the young special needs white man by 4 young black thugs ? it s not the first time hillary supporter shepard smith went off on an anti-trump tangent .
watch him go off on trump here and tell him what he needs to do to win the election .
great advice shep .
i guess it s pretty clear trump didn t need your advice .
