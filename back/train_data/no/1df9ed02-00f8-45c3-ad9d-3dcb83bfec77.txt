karachi , pakistan ( reuters ) - a pakistani peace activist has been reported missing over the weekend from eastern city of lahore , police and one of his friends said on tuesday .
raza mehmood khan , 40 , a member of aghaz-i-dosti ( start of friendship ) , a group that works on peace building between arch-rivals pakistan and india , hasn t been heard from since he left home on sunday , said rahim-ul-haq , a friend and an associate .
he said the group has offices in both countries .
police official shehzad raza said khan s family reported he had been missing since saturday .
no one has been accused in the report , he said .
we re investigating .
several social media activists critical of the army and the country s extremists and militant groups have gone missing in pakistan in recent months .
four of them were released nearly a month after they disappeared early this year .
two of them - ahmad waqas goraya and asim saeed _ later alleged in interviews with bbc and their social media posts that pakistani intelligence abducted and tortured them in custody .
pakistan s army has denied the accusations .
haq said khan spoke at a discussion on saturday on the topic of extremism .
everyone discussed their views and , of course , raza was very critical , he said .
he said that raza s recent facebook posts were critical of pakistani military , especially in view of a recent sit-in protest by hard-liners that paralyzed islamabad for over two weeks .
the extremists won almost all of their demands , including resignation of a minister they accused of blasphemy , in an agreement brokered by the army .
