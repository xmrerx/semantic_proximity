A new parody video shows that the ridiculously juvenile tweets from Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump make perfect sense, as long as they are read by mean teenage girls.The video, produced by Nylon magazine, shows a series of teens reading Trump s tweets verbatim, adding only the snark and derisive tone that can be found in the halls of high schools from coast to coast.One girl reads, Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage.
Another tells us, Get a life Megyn!
That s an actual tweet during one of Trump s many feuds with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly.Trump has, of course, praised the effectiveness of his Twitter account but it s hard to blame him when insults that are 10th grade at best generate headlines in all the major newspapers without Trump having to spend a dime.
He s compared it to owning his own printing press, and while he won t be nominated for a Pulitzer any time soon, his pronouncements of Sad!
have already become a campaign clich .The downside of Twitter and parody videos like this for Trump, however, are that they expose how juvenile and simplistic his campaign and the Republican Party are.
While the dumbing down of America is a very real problem, when it comes to crunch time in the voting booth it is unlikely that most of the 65 percent or so of America that aren t rabid Trump fans will actually decide to vote for an insulter in chief.For the rest of the country, these videos and Trump s own words highlight the intellectual deficit between Trump and his own party, let alone the leading candidates on the Democratic side.If the country is going to elect someone who tweets like a mean girl, why would you go with a pampered billionaire?
Just go ahead and vote for a real mean girl.
