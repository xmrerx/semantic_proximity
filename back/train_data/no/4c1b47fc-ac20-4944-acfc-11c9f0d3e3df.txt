intolerance , hostility , racism and fear have been pushed to the forefront and emotions are running high .
because of this divisiveness , it s now more important than ever to stand up for inclusivity , compassion and respect for all people.lush has always been , and will always be , a safe space for everyone regardless of immigration status , gender , race , age , sexual orientation , religion or political affiliation .
we love and encourage individuality , and our employees and customers are as diverse as the products we create .
