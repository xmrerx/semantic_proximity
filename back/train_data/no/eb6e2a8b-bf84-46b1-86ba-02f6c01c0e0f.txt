helsinki ( reuters ) - a senior politician in finland s euroskeptic finns party said on tuesday he would step down from the leadership of the party , formerly part of a coalition government , after harassing a lawmaker in parliament .
finnish media quoted a female mp from another party as saying that teuvo hakkarainen , a deputy chairman of the nationalist finns party , last week grabbed her neck and kissed her in parliament caf despite her objections .
i am very sorry for what happened , alcohol does not suit me ...
i have hurt ( her ) , hakkarainen said in his facebook page .
i will step down from the position of the party s second deputy chairman .
finns party s lawmakers issued a warning to hakkarainen over the incident , saying any harassment was unacceptable .
hakkarainen will remain a member of the finns party parliamentary group .
hakkarainen was part of a new hard-line leadership nominated by the party in june , a development that led to it being kicked out of the government by prime minister juha sipila .
more than half of its lawmakers subsequently left the party and formed a new group to keep their government seats .
the finns party , formerly called true finns , rose from obscurity during the euro zone debt crisis with an anti-eu platform , complicating the bloc s bailout talks with troubled states .
hakkarainen was fined earlier this year for a facebook post calling for a muslim-free finland which a district court said amounted to agitation against an ethnic group .
the party currently has polling support of about eight percent , down from 18 percent in 2015 general election .
