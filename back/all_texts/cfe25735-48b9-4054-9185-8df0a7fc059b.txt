The email incorrectly contained the suggestion that extra credit be offered for attendance, Miksch wrote.
The school does not allow this practice.
That language was to have been removed from the communication before it was sent, but was not.
The controversy comes at a politically sensitive time for the University of Pittsburgh and academic institutions across the nation.
This as protests, arrests and even accusations of hate crimes continue to roil campuses on the heels of president-elect Donald Trump s victory.On Thursday, 2 were arrested when a Pitt protest aimed at Trump and other social issues saw clashes between the demonstrators and police.
