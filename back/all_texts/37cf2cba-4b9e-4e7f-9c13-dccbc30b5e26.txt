Donald Trump may deny that he hired some Russian prostitutes to empty their bladders for him, but an exchange from The Howard Stern Show in 2001 really makes it seem like that s the sort of thing he s into.
During a backhanded catfight with gossip columnist A.J.
Benza over a woman they had both slept with, Benza hit Trump with a pointed jab about his preference for Russian women as well as a quote that may have seemed meaningless then but takes on special meaning in light of his golden showers fiasco.After Trump bragged that he took Benza s girlfriend, this happened:Trump: I assume A.J.
s clean.
I hope he s clean.Benza: Meanwhile, he bangs Russian people Stern: Russian people?Trump: Who are you talking about, Russian people, A.J.?
I don t know anything.Benza: He used to call me when I was a columnist and say, I was just in Russia, the girls have no morals, you gotta get out there.
[Trump s] out of his mind.Trump did not deny making the statement.On Wednesday, a British news anchor revealed that there are not one but multiple sources confirming that Donald Trump has been caught in compromising situations with Russian women.
In fact, there may be more information than we know (including video and audio).
I saw the report, compiled by the former British intelligence officer, back in October, BBC correspondent Paul Wood said.
He is not, and this is the crucial thing, the only source for this.
Wood said that he reached out to the U.S. intelligence community and got a message back from a contact that there is more than one tape, not just video, but audio as well, on more than one date, in more than one place, in both Moscow and St. Petersburg.
For his part, Trump has basically spent the past two days typing FAKE NEWS in all-caps, occasionally yelling the phrase whenever he is confronted by anyone representing a news agency who reported on it.You can hear the Stern clip for yourself below:Featured image via Getty Images/Jamie Squire
