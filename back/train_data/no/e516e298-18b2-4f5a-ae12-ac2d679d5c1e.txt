sofia ( reuters ) - plans by bulgaria to buy eight fighter jets are on hold after lawmakers on wednesday questioned if all bidders for the contract had been treated equally .
the nato and eu member state , which is looking to replace its aging soviet-designed mig-29s , said in june it would start talks to buy new gripen warplanes from swedish manufacturer saab in a deal estimated at 1.5 billion levs ( $ 920 million ) .
but a parliamentary committee set up to investigate the bid process , part of which was handled by a previous interim government , requested a defense ministry review after uncovering what it called disturbing facts .
the most important thing is to treat all participants equally , said committee chairman emil hristov .
hours earlier , slovakia s defense minister said it was deferring a planned fighter jet purchase also to replace mig-29s - pending a broader upgrade of its armed forces .
on monday , bulgarian prime minister boyko borissov voiced doubt that gripen was the best choice for the new fighter jet for the black sea state s air force .
he had initially told his swedish counterpart that negotiations on a gripen acquisition would proceed within weeks .
bulgaria also received offers from portugal for secondhand u.s. f-16s and from italy for secondhand eurofighter typhoons .
the question of which warplanes bulgaria should buy has been vexing successive governments for more than a decade .
the country has said it wants to upgrade between 2018 and 2022 to bring its fighter jet fleet closer into compliance with nato standards .
bulgaria joined the atlantic alliance in 2004 and the european union three years later .
