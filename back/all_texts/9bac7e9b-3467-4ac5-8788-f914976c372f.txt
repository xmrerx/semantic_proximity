Liberty University President Jerry Falwell, Jr. was not taking Hillary s lying sitting down.
Falwell made comments about how the students should arm themselves against terror attacks like the one in California.
Hillary twisted his words int a complete lie.
Here s his response: I ll tell you what s deplorable.
Hillary s a liar.
That s not what I said.
I went on to say those Muslims referring specifically to those part of my comments to the community center incident in California.
