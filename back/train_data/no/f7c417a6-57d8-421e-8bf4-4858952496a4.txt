washington ( reuters ) - former u.s. republican presidential candidate marco rubio said on thursday he would not be anybody ’ s running-mate in the nov. 8 presidential election , slamming down rumors that he was seeking the vice presidential nod from former rivals .
“ no , i ’ m not going to be anybody ’ s vice president ... i ’ m not interested in being vice president , ” rubio told reporters on capitol hill .
rubio also ruled out both seeking re-election to the u.s. senate and a run for the florida governorship , which was speculated as a potential next step for the first-term u.s. senator from florida .
“ i ’ m going to finish out my term in the senate over the next 10 months ... and then i ’ ll be a private citizen in january , ” he said .
throughout his 2016 bid for the white house , rubio repeatedly stated he was uninterested in returning to the senate , instead focusing his campaign efforts solely on the republican party ’ s nomination .
asked whether he would rule out a run for a political office in the future , rubio said : “ i ’ m not running for governor , i ’ m not running for re-election to the senate .
beyond that , who knows ? ” rubio , once seen as the establishment favorite for the party ’ s nomination , suspended his campaign efforts on tuesday following a loss in his home-state of florida to party front-runner and political upstart donald trump .
