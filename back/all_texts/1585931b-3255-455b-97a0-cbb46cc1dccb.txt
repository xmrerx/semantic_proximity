If there s one thing Senator Ted Cruz will go down in history for, it s being a smarmy liar.
He says whatever he can to make himself look good, and gives all politicians a bad name.
What he seems to hate more than anything is being call out on his bullshit, and Wednesday when asked a question about how he mislead Carson voters in to thinking the candidate was suspending his campaign, thus trying to make voters believe they should vote for Cruz, he went directly after CNN, saying: Is it a dirty trick to pass on your news stories?
You re in the business!
Would you think it was a dirty trick if I was forwarding an ABC story?
Or is it just a dirty trick to pass on a CNN story?
Basically, he was pissed CNN was reporting facts.
So CNN anchor Brooke Baldwin, while speaking with Cruz surrogate Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), said: Just so we re all crystal clear here, when Sen. Cruz, with all due respect, tries to throw my network under the bus, let me stand up for my colleagues and my journalists here in terms of this CNN report Cruz keeps quoting.
We reported it accurately and here are the facts.
She then went on to say: Dr. Carson s staff told us that he would return home to Florida to, quote, unquote, take a breath from the campaign before resuming his activities on the campaign trail.
That accurate report was disseminated on television and CNN digital and that was that.
That was that.
Then finished off with: Forgive me.
When someone tries to take down the media and misreport something it gets me fired up.
Then when Meadows tried to twist the conversation away from the subject, Baldwin brings him back to reality by saying: Congressman, forgive me, but I m going to call out B.S.
if I hear B.S.
And that was B.S.
Cruz was purposefully trying to blame the media for his actions taken against the Carson campaign.
It s lame, it s wrong, and Baldwin was perfectly spot-on calling him out on it.
Well done.
