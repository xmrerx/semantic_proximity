my wife and i went into town and visited a shop.when we came out , there was a cop writing out a parking ticket.we went up to him and i said , come on man , how about giving a senior citizen a break ?
he just ignored us and continued writing the ticket .
i called him an a * * hole .
he glared at me and started writing another ticket for having worn-out tires .
so shirley ( my wife ) called him a s * ithead .
he finished the second ticket and put it on the windshield with the first .
then he started writing more tickets.this went on for about 20 minutes.the more we abused him , the more tickets he wrote.he finally finished , sneered at us and walked away.just then our bus arrived , and we got on it and went home.we always look for cars with obama stickers.we try to have a little fun each day now that we re retired .
its so important at our age ! !
