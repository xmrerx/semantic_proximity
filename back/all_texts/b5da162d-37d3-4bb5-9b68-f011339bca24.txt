WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi urged Republicans to establish a process to move forward on improvements to Obamacare on Friday after their healthcare reform effort failed in the Senate.
“We call upon the speaker to establish a process - we can go right to the committees - and have the discussion on how we keep America healthy,” Pelosi said at a news conference at which Democrats called for a bipartisan effort on healthcare reform.
