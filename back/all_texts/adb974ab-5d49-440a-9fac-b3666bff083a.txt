A group of extremely wealthy white men are pretending to be black in order to help elect right-wing Republicans.
The Black Americans for a Better Future Super PAC sounds like a political pressure group operated by African-Americans interested in politics, but documents filed with the Federal Elections Commission (FEC) show that all the money behind the group comes from white men.According to new Federal Election Commission (FEC) filings, the only people who donated to BABF last year (or at all it was created in 2014) were super, super white.
In fact, of the $417,250 in donations the super-pac received, $400,000 was from Robert Mercer, the hedge-fund CEO also known as Ted Cruz s sugar daddy.According to the Intercept, BABF exists solely for the benefit of Raynard Jackson, a Republican African-American political consultant based in Washington, D.C.Jackson is reportedly using the money pumped into the PAC in order to host events encouraging blacks to join the Republican Party.
They need the help.In 2012, only 6% of black voters supported the Republican Party, while 93% of those voters supported President Obama s re-election campaign.
The performance among Latino voters was not inspiring either.
Only 27% of those voters backed Romney.
And those votes came before many in the party s base had embraced the current party front-runner, Donald Trump.
Trump of course has embraced a white nationalist approach to major issues, arguing that Mexicans are rapists and that Muslim travel to the United States has to be banned.A Super PAC masquerading as black voices while fueled by white dollars is sure to raise the already elevated suspicions of those who believe the conservative movement is disingenuous when it claims that it is interested in reaching out to minority voters.Instead the ploy gives the appearance of yet again another deceptive conservative enterprise, but with the added indignity of a financial minstrel show.Featured image via Flickr
