What a nut job!
A 10th-grade teacher invited radicals into the classroom to brainwash and enlist children to join the radical group BAMN.
A brave student recorded these commies describing stuff that s totally made up.
This is total indoctrination and fear mongering that should never be allowed to take place in school.They re making Trump sound like he s doing something terribly wrong.
Enforcing the law is pretty much a normal thing but we had 8 years of Obama s lawlessness that it s foreign for these people to understand the rule of law.
A California teacher was caught on a cellphone camera having Livier Perez from BAMN, an organization known for promoting and acting upon violence, to speak to and recruit 10th-grade high school students.
Towards the end of the video a student asks them to clarify their policy on immigration you ll love the answer: Open borders for everyone and free healthcare too!
Unbelievable!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENlsl4IDe9AWe re being attacked every day by radials trying to brainwash our kids.
