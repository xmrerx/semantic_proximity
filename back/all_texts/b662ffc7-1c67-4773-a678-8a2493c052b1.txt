WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump invited Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to dine with him on Wednesday night, Democratic sources familiar with the situation said.
The two Democratic leaders will push the Republican president on legislation they want passed to protect youth brought to the United States illegally - a proposal known as the DREAM act, as well as on stabilizing the health care markets, Democratic aides said.
