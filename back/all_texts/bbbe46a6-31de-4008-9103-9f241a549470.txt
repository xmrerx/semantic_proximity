ZURICH (Reuters) - Swiss police declared the U.S. consular office building in Zurich as safe, saying a suspicious object discovered on Monday morning that had prompted a brief evacuation of two buildings was found to be harmless.
A street blockade was lifted and people were allowed to re-enter the buildings, Zurich municipal police said.
