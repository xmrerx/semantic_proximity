Dinesh D Souza s fascinating movie, Hillary s America debuted to rave reviews in theaters across America on July 22nd.
D Souza brilliantly exposes the truth about the Democrat party s history of racism and the way they ve taken advantage of minorities to benefit themselves throughout the history of the United States.
It s pretty safe to say, he is probably the least welcome face at the DNC.
