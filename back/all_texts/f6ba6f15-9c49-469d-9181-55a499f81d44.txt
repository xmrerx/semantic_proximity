ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq s parliament has no right to remove Kirkuk s governor from office, a senior Kurdish official said on Thursday, after parliament voted him out following a request by Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi.
He is an elected governor of the council of Kirkuk, said Hoshyar Zebari, a close adviser to Kurdish President Massoud Barzani.
That is the only body that can remove him.
The decision to remove the governor, Najmaddin Kareem, comes after Kirkuk - an oil-rich province claimed by both the central government in Baghdad and the autonomous Kurdish region in northern Iraq - voted to take part in a referendum set for Sept. 25 on Kurdish independence.
