MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia s High Court on Friday ordered Google to delete an application that it said Catalan separatists were using to spread information about a disputed independence vote this Sunday.
The court said the On Votar 1-Oct application on the Google Play smartphone app store opposed an order in September from Spain s Constitutional Court to suspend the referendum while it determined its legality.
The court also ordered Google to block any future applications developed by the gmail address Onvotar1oct@gmail.com , according to a written ruling.
Nobody at Google in Spain was immediately available to comment.
Catalonia s government said on Friday it was determined to go ahead with the vote which Spain s government calls illegal.
