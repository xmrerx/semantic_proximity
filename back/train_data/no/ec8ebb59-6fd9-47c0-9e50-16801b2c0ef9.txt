in his final act of putting americans dead last , john boehner will stand with democrats in their rabid desire to keep the abortion industry humming .
because government funding for baby part harvesting businesses is exactly where american taxpayers want to see their hard earned money being spent .
well done john .u.s .
house speaker john boehner vowed on sunday that congress will avoid a government shutdown this week and he would push through as much unfinished legislation as possible before leaving at the end of october.speaking on cbs face the nation two days after his surprise resignation , he said the house this week would pass a government funding bill now moving through the senate , which does not meet conservatives demands to cut off money for planned parenthood.asked if passage would require democratic votes , he responded : i m sure it will , but i suspect my democratic colleagues want to keep the government open as much as i do .
boehner resigned amid deep divisions among house republicans over a range of issues including the handling of a sept. 30 deadline to approve new funding for federal agencies and programs from education to national parks.conservative republicans , some of whom have called for his ouster , have insisted on punishing planned parenthood by withholding funds over allegations that the non-profit group improperly sold tissues harvested from aborted fetuses.but boehner and more moderate republicans have argued that such a move would not halt the bulk of the group s $ 500 billion in funding , which comes from reimbursements through the medicaid healthcare program for the poor .
