in order to access the information , the thieves cleared a security screen that required knowledge about the taxpayer , including social security number , date of birth , tax filing status and street address .

the service has been temporarily shut down .
in all , about 200,000 attempts were made from questionable email domains , with more than 100,000 of those attempts successfully clearing authentication hurdles , the agency said .
during this filing season , taxpayers successfully and safely downloaded a total of approximately 23 million transcripts .
