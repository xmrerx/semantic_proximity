dubai ( reuters ) - islamist militant group al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) has condemned the u.s. decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital and called on militants to close ranks to support palestinians .
u.s. president donald trump on wednesday reversed decades of u.s. policy and recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel .
in the statement carried by the u.s. site monitoring group , the yemen-based aqap said trump s decision was the result of what it said were normalization steps between some gulf arab countries and israel .
it is also a clear challenge to the muslim world that sees the centrality of the palestinian cause , the group said .
in the face of this serious events , we stand by our people in palestine and support them with all we possess .
addressing islamist militants , the group called on them to close ranks to be ready to support palestinians and urged muslims to help with money and weapons .
if you do not move , god forbid , then tomorrow the holiest of places and the muslims qiblah , mecca , will be sold and you will find then no one to defend it , it said .
the aqap , which was formed in 2009 by the merger of al qaeda s saudi and yemeni branches , is regarded by the united states as one of the most dangerous groups of the network founded by osama bin laden .
the united states has repeatedly carried out drone strikes on members and leaders of the group , which makes remote areas in southern yemen as its main base .
