liberal delaware sen. chris coons caused a stir last week when he indicated during a televised interview that yet-undisclosed transcripts of recorded phone conversations conclusively prove that elements of the trump campaign explicitly colluded with the russian government during the 2016 presidential election .
yet widely-circulated bombshell reports from the new york times and cnn in recent weeks quoted sources who had no choice but to underline that there is no evidence of such coordination , and that the alleged contacts between trump allies and russian officials were not even necessarily unusual in nature .
therefore , it s understandable why this statement from coons a member of the senate foreign relations committee touched off a fresh , feverish round of breathless speculation and rumors .
townhall there are transcripts that provide very helpful , very critical insights into whether or not russian intelligence and senior russian political leaders , including vladimir putin , were cooperating , were colluding with the trump campaign at the highest levels to influence the outcome of our election .
here s the clip : fox news chris wallace interviewed senator chris coons following the msnbc interview ( above ) with the very objective ( cough , cough ) andrea mitchell .
it turns out senator coons doesn t have conclusive proof that the fbi has proof president trump s campaign was in collusion with the russians to influence the outcome of the election .
here s the new and improved version of senator coon s statement on the fbi s proof : what i was trying to make clear , chris , and i appreciate a chance to restate this , is that i don t have and i don t know of any conclusive proof , one way or the other.watch senator coons walk back his statement starting at about the 1:50 mark : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? time_continue=428 & v=xhe6iw7hsum
