munich ( reuters ) - a spokesman for bavaria s christian social union ( csu ) denied a german media report on thursday that horst seehofer is to stand down as state premier and hand over to rival markus soeder , but stay on as head of the christian social union ( csu ) .
broadcaster bayerische rundfunk , citing no sources , had reported the move .
a shakeup has been widely expected as senior csu members meet on thursday .
but a spokesman for the csu said the media report was absolutely wrong .
any changes , which would come as germany struggles to find a way out of a political crisis caused by the collapse of coalition talks on sunday night , could end a longstanding power struggle within the csu , sister party to chancellor angela merkel s christian democrats ( cdu ) .
