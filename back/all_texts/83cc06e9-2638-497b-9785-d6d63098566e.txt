As gossip maven Perez Hilton wrote, Unfortunately, it s a sad (SAD!)
reality that Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, Ivanka Trump, and Jared Kushner top the list of the year s most influential people.

Truth RevoltWhen fans of President Trump heard he made TIME magazine s Top 100 Most Influential People In The World list, they were a surprised that the liberal magazine would risk losing subscribers by including the controversial president on their list.
What was even more surprising, is the person who wrote the glowing review of President Donald Trump that TIME published alongside his name.
