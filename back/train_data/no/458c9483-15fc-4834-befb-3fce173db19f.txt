isis stormed into mosul , iraq last summer .
much of what took 2,000 years to build has been lost in a matter of months .
there are no christians left in mosul surely , our intelligence community warned obama this would happen .
if our president is so concerned about the welfare of muslims ( mostly men ) supposedly escaping persecution by isis , why did he abandon these christians in iraq ? nothing is sacred to these monsters .
christian relics and books from the 1st century have been destroyed by isis .
christian homes in mosul have been marked by isis .
if you are a christian and isis puts their mark on your home , it signifies you are expected to either convert to islam , pay an extortion fee or face the sword .
unfortunately , democracy in iran brought a new wave of persecution for christians .
when the us withdrew from iraq completely , the situation became dire .
the government was not capable of taking care of the christian population and isis moved in to eradicate the christian population and erase any trace of christianity .
where christians have been living for over 1,000 years , there is nothing but silence empty building and homes .
