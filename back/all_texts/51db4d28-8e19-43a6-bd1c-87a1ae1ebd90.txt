Talk radio hosts went nuts with the news of Gore s visit to Trump Tower today.
Michael Savage was very disappointed but Rush Limbaugh gave the best comment: I m gonna tell you something, said Limbaugh.
If Trump goes south on climate change, that is just gonna be deeply disappointing and alarming because of what climate change is to the left.
It s everything, it s everything they want and everything they believe and it s almost everything they can get to achieve it, to accomplish it.
We couldn t agree more with Rush!
It s just upsetting that they would even want to speak with the phony who claims global warming is real Yikes!
