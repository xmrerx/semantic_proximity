I m the only one to separate Siamese twins.
The only one to operate on babies while they were still in their mother s womb.
The only one to take out half of a brain, although you would think if you went to Washington that someone had beat me to it.
But I m very hopeful that I m not the only one who will pick up the torch of freedom.
Because freedom is not free!
