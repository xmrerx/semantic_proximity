When he was running for president, Donald Trump made locking up Hillary Clinton for her criminal behavior a centerpiece of his campaign.
Just the mere mention of her name would send supporters at his massive rallies into a wild chant, as they screamed, LOCK HER UP!
Trump s supporters weren t chanting to be cute.
Trump supporters were chanting because after decades of evading the law, Americans were quite serious about expecting candidate Donald Trump to follow through on his campaign promise to hold her accountable, and make her pay for her crimes, just like any other American would be expected to do.
When we told @realDonaldTrump to LOCK HER UP!
we weren t asking Mr. President, please deliver on your promise.
