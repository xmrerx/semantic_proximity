asuncion ( reuters ) - paraguayan senator mario abdo benitez , a lawmaker with ties to a former paraguayan dictator , won the ruling colorado party s presidential primary on sunday in a sharp rebuke for president horacio cartes , the party s flagbearer .
abdo , the son of former dictator alfredo stroessner s private secretary , beat out ex-finance minister santiago pena , a young economist and cartes hand-picked successor , in a surprise outcome that followed increasing dissatisfaction with cartes , who has been in power since 2013 .
abdo will face lawyer efrain alegre , who won the opposition liberal party s nomination , in the april presidential election in the land-locked nation of 6.8 million , long one of south america s poorest .
the colorado party has governed paraguay for nearly 70 years , including during stroessner s 1954-1989 dictatorship , with a brief interruption when leftist fernando lugo was elected in 2008 and impeached in 2012 .
with over 96 percent of primary votes counted , paraguay s electoral authority said that abdo had received 50.9 percent of the vote .
pena had garnered 43.3 percent .
the arrogant establishment has been defeated today and forever ... we all have scars but are urging unity for the colorados and later , paraguay , abdo told his supporters following his victory .
cartes , a former soft-drink and tobacco executive , has run a low-tax policy that investors credit with spurring one of the fastest economic growth rates in latin america .
but his attempt to change laws enabling him to run for re-election spurred protests and was widely criticized .
abdo , known in paraguay by his nickname marito , has been a harsh critic of cartes , and aligned with the opposition in congress to fight his proposed re-election amendment .
more than one million members of the colorado party voted on sunday , an estimated turnout of 50 percent .
