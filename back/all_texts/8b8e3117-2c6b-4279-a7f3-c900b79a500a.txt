Donald Trump has released a campaign ad detailing his plans for his first day as President of the United States of America.
It is a window into hell.The video was released via Trump s Facebook page and Twitter account on Friday night, and for those hoping for a little more policy detail from Trump, we got it.
Sadly, it is a little worse than we imagined.What would Trump do on his first day, he would rescind every single Executive Order made by President Obama.
Why?
Because he doesn t have to go through Congress.This would mean:Trump took primary aim however, at gun control and immigration.
Trump would revoke the new gun control laws put in place in response to Sandy Hook and the mass shooting epidemic.
He would also remove the protections Obama put in place for the children of undocumented immigrants that would prevent them being deported.
These are people who have been born, or raised for the majority of their lives, in the United States.
But Trump wants these protections removed so he can fulfill on his plans for the forced mass deportation of undocumented migrants and any children living in the United States.He says: I would get rid of the attack on our Second Amendment, because that s what Obama is doing when he does that.I would very, very strongly get rid of the attack on the border.
We have a border that s like a piece of Swiss Cheese.
People are pouring through.
That order will be the single first thing I do.And we will work on all of these Executive Orders, and the bad ones, of which mostly that s what you have, will be terminated immediately my first day in office.
Never mind that the man can t construct a simple sentence without turning it into word soup.
This is what a Trump White House will look like: It would a more cruel, more authoritarian, less safe America.
Eight years of progress disappeared with the swipe of a pen.
