george soros gets ugly with the name calling that s typical of the left .
he praised the united nations representative who called the hungarian pm a racist and xenophobe .
doesn t that sound familiar to anyone here in the us who s opposed to the illegal and legal immigrants flooding our nation ?
threatening the european and american way of life is serious and not to be dismissed by name calling .
we have every right to want to preserve our traditions and culture .
soros has been behind so much of the chaos attributed to the effort to create a new world order and it should be every american s wish to not let that wish come true !
