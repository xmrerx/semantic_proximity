WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Charges brought against President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager and other officials on Monday would not change the White House’s cooperation with the special counsel investigating alleged Russian intervention in the 2016 election, a White House official said.
“The White House continues to cooperate,” the official said.
