jimmy kimmel started out his interview with guest comedian tim allen on the late show thursday night by asking him if he went to trump s inauguration .
allen seemed a bit taken back by kimmel s opening question that put him on the defense , and potentially set the tone for what could ve been a rough interview .
allen responded : you get in this town you got ta be real careful around here , or you ll get beat up if you don t believe what everyone believes .
it s like 30 s germany .
if you re not part of the group , you know what we believe is right ! '
allen was quickly able to change the subject and move away from kimmel s obvious desire to embarrass allen for his support for our president .
that jimmy kimmel he sure is a funny guy no wonder his ratings are in the toilet
