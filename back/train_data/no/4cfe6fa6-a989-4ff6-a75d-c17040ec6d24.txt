you re gon na love this ! the left has been screaming for decades about the government interfering in their right to kill their babies .
because after all , even though it s a human life in its earliest stages of development ; it s growing inside their womb , so the government has no business protecting the innocent life of that baby in their bodies.strangely enough , the left is angry about trump s decision to let the states decide if they will or will not force its citizens to share a bathroom or public shower with a person who claims to be a certain gender contrary to what their genitals say they are .
clearly the hypocritical left can t make up their mind when it s okay , or when it s not okay for the government to tell citizens what they can or can not do
