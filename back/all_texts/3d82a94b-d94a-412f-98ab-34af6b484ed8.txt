Kathy Griffin probably thought this would be great publicity for her.
Nope, not funny not funny at all.
Twitter was abuzz over the photo shoot by shock photographer Tyler Shields of Kathy Griffin holding a beheaded Trump.
Drudge Report called Griffin out on her tasteless photos and even liberals took to twitter to voice their outrage in tweets below.Does anyone at all find that funny?
Nope we didn t think so.
Check out the twitter responses on this photo shoot literally EVERYONE is going after her!
The best tweet so far: TMZ got the scoop on the disgusting photo shoot by edgy photographer Tyler Shields.
It s too bad Harvey Levin didn t refuse to promote this horror.
We hope this gets Griffin a pink slip from CNN.
