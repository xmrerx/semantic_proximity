( reuters ) - president donald trump has given the central intelligence agency new authority to conduct drone attacks against suspected militants , the wall street journal reported on monday , citing u.s. officials .
the move would be a change from the policy of former president barack obama 's administration of limiting the cia 's paramilitary role , the newspaper reported .
( on.wsj.com/2mlgys9 ) the white house , the u.s. department of defense and the cia did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
obama had sought to influence global guidelines for the use of drone strikes as other nations began pursuing their own drone programs .
( reut.rs/2nnaa51 ) the united states was the first to use unmanned aircraft fitted with missiles to kill militant suspects in the years after the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on new york and washington .
strikes by missile-armed predator and reaper drones against oversea targets began under former president george w. bush and were expanded by obama .
critics of the targeted killing program question whether the strikes create more militants than they kill .
they cite the spread of jihadist organizations and militant attacks throughout the world as evidence that targeted killings may be exacerbating the problem .
in july , the u.s. government accepted responsibility for inadvertently killing up to 116 civilians in strikes in countries where america is not at war .
