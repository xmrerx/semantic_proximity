You know how many Trump fans seem to have a sick obsession with their orange-tinged fuhrer?
We may have possibly found the one who is basically the ultimate Donald Trump fanboy, in a 1940 s Germany sort of way.Meet Gene Huber.
Trump pulled Huber up on stage at his first campaign rally in Melbourne, Florida which, once again, happened about a month into his presidency to address the crowd.Huber is already being compared to George W. Bush s living prop Joe The Plumber, who went on to run a functional white supremacist blog after his 15 minutes of fame faded.But who is Huber?
His social media reveals that he is a typical Trump supporter in many ways (and in one hopefully not-so-typical way) right down to Trump nibbling on his ear lobe wait, what?One creepy tweet from Huber claims that Trump kissed his ear lob [sic] in 1970:@WDFx2EU7 @P0TUSTrump Let's see, liar, Thief, racist, corrupt, making fun of Americans!
In 1970 Trump kissed my ear lob!

#MAGA Gene Huber (@Squeakey6) January 18, 2017@CNN @megynkelly he is a Muslim been hearing this crap for a year and a half and Megan I'm sure we will hear it tonite Disgrace #TrumpTrain Gene Huber (@Squeakey6) October 14, 2016According to Facebook, he has visited Trump s properties (and the White House) a lot recently:It is unclear if he met with Trump during any of these visits, but he does say that Fearless Leader called him on Valentine s Day:But what truly makes him special is this totally not creepy thing he does with a cardboard cutout of The Donald.
In an interview with CNN shortly after Trump christened him a star, Huber explained:He also talks to it regularly and prays either for it or to it, depending on how one interprets this:He wasn t lying, either.
He has a cutout of Trump:The Best Vistor I could ever have!President Trump came to Florida to see me!
Wow, never will forget [email protected] @thebestcloser pic.twitter.com/galTF85biz Gene Huber (@Squeakey6) January 9, 2017Let s face it when you confess to talking to your cardboard Donald Trump and saluting it every day, you re kinda asking for the sort of response you get on social media:@Squeakey6 @thebestcloser Talking to a cardboard cut out everyday?
You are nuts.

#Independent J. Canfield (@CreativeBoulder) February 19, 2017I bet if someone shined a blacklight on that cardboard Trump it would light up like the 4th of July with #GeneHuber "samples" (@Cvinciguerra1) February 19, 2017I wish the cardboard cutout of #donaldtrump that #GeneHuber salutes every morning was president instead.
I'd feel much safer #TrumpRally pic.twitter.com/vsl0USJd4o dj (@dljones66) February 19, 2017@Squeakey6 Gene Huber's cardboard Dictator salutes back after he does "this & that."

Emma Sch tzkowski (@emmaschuetz) February 19, 2017Gene Huber's cardboard cutout of Donald Trump is more diplomatic, presidental, and legitimate of a leader than Donald Trump is.
Matthew Cooper (@ILoveMorrigan) February 19, 2017I shudder to think what other things #GeneHuber does to his cardboard Trump ROH (@RealOldHouswife) February 19, 2017Gene Huber salutes a 6 ft. cardboard Donald Trump in his living room every day.
Mmkay.
