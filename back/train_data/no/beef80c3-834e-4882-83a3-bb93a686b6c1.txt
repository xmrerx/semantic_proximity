washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. house of representatives will vote on friday on legislation broadening sanctions against north korea that is expected to pass with overwhelming support , sending the measure to the white house for president barack obama to sign into law .
the house backed the sanctions measure 418-2 in january , but the senate included some new provisions , including cybersecurity measures , in the version of the bill that it passed 96-0 on wednesday , sending it back to the house .
the proposed sanctions come after a satellite launch seen by washington and its allies as cover for development of ballistic missile technology that could be used to deliver a nuclear weapon .
house speaker paul ryan said the house would consider the amended version of the bill this week , and aides said the vote would likely take place on friday morning .
“ we have moved one step closer to a new round of north korea sanctions , ” ryan told reporters in his weekly news conference .
obama is not expected to veto the bill , given its huge support in congress .
ben rhodes , his deputy national security adviser , said the white house would review the measure but does not oppose congress ’ efforts .
“ i think this is an area where we and congress are in the same space and agree on the need for increased sanctions , ” rhodes told an event at the center for american progress on thursday .
