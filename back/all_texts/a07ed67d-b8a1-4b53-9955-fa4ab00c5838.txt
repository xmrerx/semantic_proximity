Slowly but surely our nation will heal.
It will take some time, and there will those who resist, but America is stronger than the hate of a small group of radicals who under Barack Obama s direction, have worked to intentionally divide us.A waitress at a Washington D.C. restaurant received a very generous tip and a warm message on her receipt from three men who were in town for President Donald Trump s inauguration.Rosalynd Harris, who works at Busboys and Poets in the northwest part of the nation s capital, told The Washington Post she was beaming with confidence Monday after taking part in the Women s March over the weekend.A group of men from west Texas entered the restaurant and started to chat with Harris.
One of the men, who said he was a dentist, complimented her on her smile.
Harris, who is black, told the Post she was admittedly a bit prejudice when the men, who were white, told her they were in town to support Trump.However, Harris didn t expect what would come next.After the men had left, Harris picked up their check and found that they left a heartwarming message and a generous tip.
They left Harris a $450 tip on a $72.60 bill.
Their message read:We rise by lifting others.
A lovely act of kindness pic.twitter.com/S01SV3w8ts Busboys and Poets (@busboysandpoets) January 24, 2017 We may come from different cultures and may disagree on certain issues, but if everyone would share their smile and kindness like your beautiful smile, our country will come together as one people.
Not race.
Not gender.
Just American.
God Bless!
