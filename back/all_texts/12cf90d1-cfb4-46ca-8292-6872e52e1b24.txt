John Burton, the outgoing chairman of California s Democratic party, had one final thing to say before he leaves and it was a sentiment we can all relate to.
Speaking at the convention of the California Democratic Party, Burton proudly raised both middle fingers in the air and shouted, Fuck Donald Trump.
The crowd of thousands, who joined in on the mantra, obviously felt the same way.The Sacramento Bee reports:The always foul-mouthed Burton, 84, stood before thousands of Democratic delegates at Saturday s general assembly and as a rallying cry asked the crowd to join in.
He then shoved two fists in the air, flipping the bird.
Across the room at the Sacramento Convention Center, others onstage and in the audience followed suit.Burton was not alone onstage, also present were House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-San Francisco, Rep, Barbara Lee, D-Oakland, and state Sen. Toni Atkins, D-San Diego, among others.While Burton may have been the most direct with his message, just about every lawmaker who spoke at the convention was quick to denounce Trump and his disaster of a presidency.
