baghdad ( reuters ) - the iraqi government will not hold talks with the kurdistan regional government ( krg ) about the results of the unconstitutional referendum on independence held on monday in northern iraq , iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi said .
we are not ready to discuss or have a dialogue about the results of the referendum because it is unconstitutional , abadi said in a speech broadcast on state tv on monday night .
masoud barzani s krg says the referendum is not binding and was meant to be a legitimate mandate to negotiate with baghdad and neighboring countries over the secession of the kurdish-controlled region from iraq .
the vote was expected to deliver a comfortable yes , and final results should be announced in 72 hours .
