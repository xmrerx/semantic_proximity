john kasich is delusional !
he s also full of himself !
it s unbelievable that he came in fourth in a three man race but still insists on continuing his run for president .
give it up !
donald trump and ted cruz should suspend their campaigns and consolidate behind john kasich , john kasich suggested this morning during an appearance on meet the press .
ted cruz s campaign is repeatedly called for you to get out , host chuck todd said .
saying a vote for you is a vote for donald trump .
if you thought your position in this race strengthened trump , would you get out ?
chuck , i m beating hillary by 11 points , kasich replied .
i m the only one that can win in the fall .
and as you noticed the narrative over the last week has been what is wrong with the party .
kasich s the guy that can win the general .
some people have said kasich would be the best president .
get out for what ?
he continued .
if i d gotten out trump would be the nominee , he would have won ohio .
and frankly , we ll win some districts in wisconsin .
we will move to pennsylvania where i m basically in a statistical tie with trump .
and when we go to new york and everywhere else , we re going to pick up delegates , kasich predicted .
it s absurd , it s absurd .
you know , if you really want , let them consolidate behind me because frankly i m the one that can win in the fall .
and i m the one that can get the crossover votes .
