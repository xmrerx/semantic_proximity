LONDON (Reuters) - Britain intends to prevent a hard border in Ireland after leaving the European Union whatever the outcome of talks with the bloc, UK s Brexit minister said on Monday, saying comments that this was not legally enforceable were taken out of context.
Davis on Sunday said that a pledge on the Irish border agreed as part of a divorce settlement was a statement of intent rather than a legally binding move, but said the media had twisted his words.
Of course it s legally enforceable, under the withdrawal agreement, but even if that didn t for some reason, if something went wrong, we would still be seeking to provide a frictionless, invisible border, Davis told LBC radio.
