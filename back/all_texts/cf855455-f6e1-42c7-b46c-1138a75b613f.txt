In yet another morning rant, Donald Trump blamed anyone and anything but himself for the constitutional crisis and global chaos caused by his Muslim ban.On Friday, Trump signed an executive order banning travelers from seven countries where Trump thinks terrorists come from.
However, the countries listed are not responsible for any deaths on American soil, unlike Saudi Arabia, where the 9/11 attackers were from and received their funding.Trump s ban has caused chaos at airports around the world as thousands of people have been detained, even children, the elderly, and permanent American citizens who hold green cards.It s a nightmare that could have been avoided simply by not being racist dick.But Trump took to Twitter on Sunday to defend his ban.Our country needs strong borders and extreme vetting, NOW.
Look what is happening all over Europe and, indeed, the world a horrible mess!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 29, 2017And on Monday, he decided to blame a computer system, protesters, and Senator Chuck Schumer for the chaos and claimed that bad dudes would have rushed into the country had he given the world time to prepare for the order.Only 109 people out of 325,000 were detained and held for questioning.
Big problems at airports were caused by Delta computer outage, .. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017protesters and the tears of Senator Schumer.
Secretary Kelly said that all is going well with very few problems.
MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017There is nothing nice about searching for terrorists before they can enter our country.
This was a big part of my campaign.
Study the world!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017If the ban were announced with a one week notice, the bad would rush into our country during that week.
A lot of bad dudes out there!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017Except that bad dudes would not have been able to rush into our country because our system of vetting is already the best in the world, which is why it can take up to two years for someone to immigrate here.
Also, the bad dudes who committed the mass shootings in Orlando, Ft.
Hood, and San Bernardino that Trump points to in order to justify his ban were all born in America.
So unless Trump is capable of finding out whether babies are bad or good, he has no justification for the ban.Also, blaming machines and other people for the chaos your executive order is causing is very weak.
The Delta computer outage occurred late Sunday, nearly two full days after the executive order was signed.
Protesters and Senator Schumer were not responsible for the many people who were detained or blocked from entering this country to reunite with family.
That included two Christian families from Syria who were sent back to the war-torn country where they face persecution and possible death despite Trump promising that Christian refugees would not be impacted by the ban.Twitter users were quick to pound Trump into oblivion..@realDonaldTrump You re the President, not a Ninja Turtle.

@realDonaldTrump Good lord, Donald!
Bad dudes?
Honey you do not sound like a statesman who knows what he s talking about.
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 30, 2017@realDonaldTrump I think more problems were caused by your racist Muslim ban.
Just a hunch.
kind of a symb-?
(@JustinCaffier) January 30, 2017@realDonaldTrump when all else fails, blame the computers?
You have no idea what you re doing Roland Scahill (@rolandscahill) January 30, 2017@realDonaldTrump The big problem was the ban of people from 7 countries primarily Muslim.
Even with Green Cards.
And one man helped the US Government.
