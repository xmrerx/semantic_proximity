in an email sent on april 15 , 2011 , our upstanding attorney general eric holder wrote : issa and his idiot cronies never gave a damn about this when all that was happening was that thousands of mexicans were being killed with guns from our country .
all they want to do in reality is cripple atf and suck up to the gun lobby .
politics at its worst maybe the media will get it .
holder was also involved in the irs scandal that targeted conservatives and conservative leaning organizations .
he was never held accountable.what s truly shocking however , was holder s involvement in the trayvon martin case in sanford , florida .
while he was acting as our nation s attorney general , he was caught by judicial watch spending our taxpayer dollars to deploy a little-known unit of the department of justice ( doj ) , the community relations service ( crs ) to sanford , fl , following the trayvon martin shooting to help organize and manage rallies and protests against george zimmerman .
holder was also present in ferguson where he did absolutely nothing to stop the rioting and chaos.set up under the civil rights act of 1964 , the doj s crs , the employees of which are required by law to conduct their activities in confidence , reportedly has greatly expanded its role under president barack obama .
though the agency claims to use impartial mediation practices and conflict resolution procedures , press reports along with the documents obtained by judicial watch suggest that the unit deployed to sanford , fl , took an active role in working with those demanding the prosecution of zimmerman.on april 15 , 2012 , during the height of the protests , the orlando sentinel reported , they [ the crs ] helped set up a meeting between the local naacp and elected officials that led to the temporary resignation of police chief bill lee according to turner clayton , seminole county chapter president of the national association for the advancement of colored people .
the paper quoted the rev .
valarie houston , pastor of allen chapel ame church , a focal point for protestors , as saying they were there for us , after a march 20 meeting with crs agents.separately , in response to a florida sunshine law request to the city of sanford , judicial watch also obtained an audio recording of a community meeting held at second shiloh missionary baptist church in sanford on april 19 , 2012 .
the meeting , which led to the ouster of sanford s police chief bill lee , was scheduled after a group of college students calling themselves the dream defenders barricaded the entrance to the police department demanding lee be fired .
according to the orlando sentinel , doj employees with the crs had arranged a 40-mile police escort for the students from daytona beach to sanford.once again , eric holder was never held accountable for this horrendous act that was the catalyst for obama s race war .
the impact eric holder had in dividing our nation by race and the hate he inspired towards our law enforcement , can never be underestimated.for entire story including detailed payments go to : judicial watchas a side note , in 2013 , house members introduced a resolution to impeach eric holder , jr. , attorney general of the united states , for high crimes and misdemeanors : sets forth articles of impeachment stating that holder : ( 1 ) engaged in a pattern of conduct incompatible with the trust and confidence placed in him in that position by refusing to comply with a subpoena issued by the house committee on oversight and government reform on october 12 , 2011 , in connection with a congressional investigation into operation fast and furious by the bureau of alcohol , tobacco , and firearms ( atf ) ; ( 2 ) failed to enforce multiple laws , including the defense of marriage act , the controlled substances act , and the anti-drug abuse act of 1986 ; ( 3 ) failed his oath of office by refusing to prosecute individuals involved in the internal revenue service ( irs ) scandal of unauthorized disclosure of tax records belonging to political donors ; and ( 4 ) testified under oath before congress on may 15 , 2013 , that he was neither involved in nor had heard of a potential prosecution of the press but later confirmed to the house judiciary committee in a letter dated june 19 , 2013 , that he approved of a search warrant on journalist james rosen.of course he was never impeached and as recently as yesterday was threatening americans that obama was going to start becoming more public with his anti-trump rhetoric
