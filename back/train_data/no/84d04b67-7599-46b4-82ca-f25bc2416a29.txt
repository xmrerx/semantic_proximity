madrid ( reuters ) - the board of spanish infrastructure firm abertis will meet on monday to discuss moving its head office out of catalonia as the region s parliament considers unilaterally declaring independence from spain , a source familiar with the matter said .
several big catalan companies have announced plans to move their registered office to other cities in spain after catalonia went ahead with an independence referendum last week which was banned by a spanish court .
