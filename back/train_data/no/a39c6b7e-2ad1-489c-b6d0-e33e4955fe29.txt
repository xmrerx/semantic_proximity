watch : update 1-28-2016 at 11:30pm et : due to public pressure and intense speculation about the events of tuesday evening , and because of the youtube recording of 18 yr old eye witness victoria sharp , the fbi has released the unedited aerial video footage from tuesday evening s incident which took place along highway 395 here .
according to the official fbi statement : we feel that it is necessary to show the whole thing unedited in the interest of transparency .
the fbi video entitled , complete , unedited video of joint fbi and osp operation 01/26/2016 , does show the victim lavoy finicum exiting the truck awkwardly in at least two feet of snow , and he clearly does not charge towards the swat team , and his hands are clearly held high above his head as he exits his truck when confronted by a swat team , before being shot multiple times by marksmen and falling in the snow .
also , the scale and size of this operation is very evident by the footage , and the apprehension of the protesters was not the result of a mere traffic stop as it was wrongly characterized in multiple mainstream media reports .
on its own , this fbi drone footage would appear to support previous government and media claims by cnn , washington post and others that the victim was indeed reaching towards his waistband which gave federal and state police justification to unleash deadly force .
however , it is still not completely clear from this aerial footage whether or not finicum was holstered ( he is said to normally carry a gun on the right hip , but fbi are claiming he had a 9mm gun in his inside left breast pocket ) , but also whether or not he lowered his arms before , or after he was shot multiple times .
for example , if finicum had his hands in the air and was then was shot in the abdomen first , then any man s natural reaction would be to then lower his hand ( s ) and clutch the wound .
additionally , if any shots were fired , even in the vicinity , then confusion could have ensued which might have prompted finicum to reach for his weapon .
either way , it is impossible to make any such a forensic determination without a corresponding audio track which would help to determine if any shots were fired before finicum s hand ( s ) could be seen lowering.warning : the following images depict violence and death which some readers may find disturbing .
