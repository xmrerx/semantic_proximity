berlin ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump is undermining international stability with his decision to recognise jerusalem as israel s capital and move the u.s. embassy there , the leader of germany s social democrats ( spd ) said on wednesday .
affirming his support for a two-state solution for israelis and palestinians , martin schulz said trump s decision , taken despite warnings from a wide range of u.s. allies , risked setting back the peace process in the middle east .
trump is due to announce later on wednesday that the united states recognises jerusalem as the capital of israel and will move its embassy there , breaking with longtime u.s. policy and possibly stirring unrest .
