berlin ( reuters ) - german authorities investigating the delivery of a package containing powerful firecrackers , wires and nails to a pharmacy near a christmas market in the city of potsdam said on sunday it was criminal activity rather than terrorism .
karl-heinz schroeter , interior minister of the state of brandenburg where potsdam is located , told a news conference criminals were behind the package which they had used to try to extort millions of euros from logistics firm dhl , which had delivered the package .
police said it was highly likely that the package could have exploded .
staff at the pharmacy in potsdam , just outside berlin , called the police on friday after they discovered the suspicious package .
the christmas market was evacuated and the package was made safe by a police robot .
dhl warned the public not to open packages if they did not recognize the sender s address or if the sender s address was suspicious .
as we find ourselves approaching christmas , which is not only a time of peace , but also a time when many presents are sent , such an act of extortion is reprehensible , schroeter told the news conference .
he said all efforts were being made to catch those who sent the package .
authorities said the people who sent the package most likely lived in berlin or in the state of brandenburg , which surrounds the german capital .
they did not say how much money they had demanded , but said they had told dhl they would send more packages that could kill or injure if dhl , owned by deutsche post , refused to pay up .
brandenburg police chief hans-juergen moerke said that a qr barcode that can be read using a smart phone was found on a piece of paper inside the package .
the extortion letter addressed to dhl was found in the barcode .
