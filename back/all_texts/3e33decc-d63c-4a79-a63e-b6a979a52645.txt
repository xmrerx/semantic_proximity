Michael Moore made on appearance on the Megyn Kelly s show in time to mock Trump for boycotting the debates scheduled for Thursday night.
Trump has thrown a hissy fit over what he says is Kelly s unfair treatment of him.
What s he afraid of?
I m sitting here, I don t feel any fear, said Moore.
Speaking directly to Trump, Moore said: Donald, come now.
Come sit beside me, I ll hold your hand, she s fine.
She s fine.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VR8s32UCTd4] It was fun watching Moore revel in the glee of Trump and Fox News not getting along.
He also enjoyed watching Kelly get under Trump s skin.
He said: You have done something that Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Rubio, Cruz, none of them have been able to do, which is to essentially frighten him, make him run, shut him down.
Everyone s tried to do this for months and you did it!
This is true.
All of the candidates have been lame in standing up to Trump.
His unprecedented domination of the debates has seen him not only lead the Republican pack for the nomination, but he has at times obliterated his opponents, especially the squirmy Jeb Bush.Yet, he chose to ditch the debates at crunch time.
Moore said: To get elected President in this country, you have to come on this network.
You have to play ball with this network.
Donald Trump today said I m not playing with this network.
That s an historic moment, and it s going to be interesting to see where the real power is.
Trump thinks he doesn t need Fox News.
I think Fox News probably has something else to say about that.
Fox News and Donald Trump make a perfect couple.
Let s hope the marriage made in hell continues to disintegrate.Featured Image Via YouTube Screenshot.
