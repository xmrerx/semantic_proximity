BAGHDAD (Reuters) - An Iraqi army helicopter crashed during a routine flight on Sunday, killing all seven people on board, a military statement and Iraqi air force officers said.
The Russian-made Mi-17 helicopter went down near the southern province of Kut, the statement said.
Two pilots and five army officers were killed, Iraqi air force officers told Reuters.
A technical malfunction caused the crash, the military statement said.
Iraq is slowly rebuilding its air force, once one of the world s largest, after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled Saddam Hussein in 2003.
