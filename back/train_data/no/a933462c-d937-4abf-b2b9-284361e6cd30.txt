the hague ( reuters ) - the dutch government has asked the country s supreme court to overturn a ruling that the netherlands was partly responsible for the death of 300 muslim men killed in the 1995 srebrenica massacres .
the victims were killed after being turned away from a dutch-run united nations base where thousands had sought refuge from attacking bosnian serb forces at the tail-end of the 1992-95 bosnian war .
dutch peacekeepers , out-manned and out-gunned by the bosnian serbs , did little more than look on as the men were separated from women and deported to killing sites .
up to 8,000 muslim men and boys in total were killed at srebrenica in the first genocide in europe since world war two .
we do not share the judge s opinion that dutch u.n. peacemakers acted unlawfully and we do not understand how the court reached that verdict , klaas meijer , defence ministry spokesman , told reuters on wednesday .
he was referring to an appeals court verdict in june confirming a 2014 ruling that said the dutch peacekeepers should have known that the muslim men would be murdered if they were forced to leave the u.n. base .
the supreme court can only overturn an appeal ruling if it finds that the lower court erred in law or procedure .
former bosnian serb leader radovan karadzic has been convicted of genocide and sentenced to 40 years imprisonment .
his chief military commander , general ratko mladic , is currently on trial at the u.n. yugoslav tribunal in the hague .
a verdict in his case is expected in november .
