The parent company for the conservative Fox News forced out the man who created the network, Roger Ailes, over the summer after a sexual harassment scandal grew out of control.
Multiple women across multiple decades broke their silence and made allegations about Ailes behavior.
Their complaints gained currency as a pattern emerged over and over with how Ailes treated them.
The drumbeat reminded many of the slow train wreck surrounding Bill Cosby and the multiple allegations against him.On ABC News, former Fox News booker Laurie Luhn decided to speak in front of cameras for the first time to discuss what Ailes behaved like, allegedly.Luhn said Ailes told her to strip down to her lingerie and dance for him.
Feeling intimidated and worried for her job, she said she did as she was told.
He would have me get down on my knees and tell me, You know what you are, Laurie.
You re my whore.
You re my sex slave.
You re going to do whatever I tell you to do at any time.
Do you understand that?
Luhn said.
And he explained that it was like the military, that if he gave an order I was to follow through.
Luhn said Ailes then instructed her to perform oral sex and she was too stunned to refuse.
I didn t question it, she said.
And that was his big thing, Just don t ever question anything I ever ask you to do, Laurie.
You understand?
Luhn said Ailes kept her in his control for twenty years, employing her at the network while personally using her.
Ailes has denied all her allegations, as well as the claims made against him by other women.The most prominent of the women who have made accusations against Ailes is current Fox News host Megyn Kelly, who details her allegations about Ailes behavior in her new book.
Fellow Fox News host Bill O Reilly has slammed Kelly for speaking out during her book tour.
