president trump arrived like a boss to check out what s going on at the nato headquarters .
they just spent big bucks on a new headquarters trump s probably wondering why they didn t use that money more wisely : nato leaders have arranged an itinerary to appeal to the former real estate magnate : a ribbon-cutting of the alliance s glassy new headquarters , followed by a dinner where leaders will be held to a lightning-round speaking schedule to save time.trump plans to press nato leaders on defense spending , continuing a line of attack he started as a candidate last year , secretary of state rex tillerson said wednesday .
you can expect the president to be very tough on them , tillerson said , saying that he expected trump to tell them : the american people are doing a lot for your security , for our joint security .
you need to make sure you re doing your share for your own security as well .
