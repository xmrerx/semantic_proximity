https://t.co/g4QbtnMqWh unsavoryagents (@unsavoryagents) November 13, 2017If you re not familiar with Sabo, he is a fearless artist whose edgy artwork gets the point across in a BIG way!
The sign below reads: THE DEPLORABLES MAGA 2020Remember the artist, Shepard Fairey, whose optimistic Hope poster of Barack Obama went viral in 2008?
There s no denying that the Fairey poster raised Obama s cool factor a few notches with the artsy LA crowd and the urban hipsters.
We guess you can say that this artist is a little responsible for the HOPELESS 8 YEAR TERM OF OBAMA SABO CRASHES OBAMA ARTIST S NEW EXHIBITION:Well, he was debuting his new exhibition, Damaged, Saturday night in L.A.
According to HuffPost, the show is his largest to date and features printmaking, sculpture, painting, mixed media, collage, and more.For a guy who preaches against capitalism, this Obama artist sure is making lots of dough Sabo even called him out on it in a series of tweets below.
Fairey is milking his Obama-fame for every last drop he can get from the liberal elitists in Hollywood.Fairey reportedly created his We the People series specifically to protest President Trump: The state of our society is damaged, Fairey stated at a press preview of the exhibition on Friday.
I know it sounds pretty dire, but acknowledging that we need to do better is the first step.
Sabo, for one, believes Fairey needs to do better .
MINE WAS THE ONLY REAL PUNK ART THERE, the street artist proclaimed on Twitter Sunday.
He added that his MAGA flag was taken down after about 30 minutes.
SABO SAD, he said.
MAGA MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!
Sabo also tweeted: THERE WERE SO MANY D***** BAGS AT THE SHEPARD FAIREY SHOW LAST NIGHT.
IF YOU HAD DROPPED A BOMB ON THE SHOW 3/4 OF THE YOUNG D***** BAGS IN LA WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED.
Fairey, a critic of the underpinnings of the capitalist machine, admitted to capitalizing off of his art.
I critique capitalism yes, I am selling prints, but yes I am also giving some away, he said at a press event Friday.Via: PJMedia
