Fox News host Sean Hannity flew into a two-day rage desperately trying to defend Donald Trump.As revealed on Friday, Trump said some very vulgar and indefensible things about women in 2005 during an appearance on Access Hollywood.
Trump bragged that he is so famous that he doesn t even wait to kiss beautiful women when he first sees them, even if they have no interest in kissing him.
He also suggested that he commits sexual assault and gets away with it when he said he grabs women by the p*ssy.
The remarks dropped like a bomb on the Republican Party, and many Republicans have been running away from Trump ever since.But Sean Hannity spent Friday and Saturday trying to defend Trump by calling Trump s remarks mere locker room talk, excusing it because some biblical king who lived thousands of years ago had a harem of prostitutes, and attacked Hillary Clinton over Bill Clinton s extramarital activities.So Hillary s lack of outrage over her husbands ACTIONS are irrelevant in this discussion?
Sorry, nice try.
https://t.co/dw6RRS4zE8 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 8, 2016Im not defending his words.
Why are you defending Bills ACTIONS and how Bill and Hillary smeared woman?
https://t.co/IfK1tUwAiX Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 8, 2016Lol.
So you only want to talk about @realDonaldTrump but not @HillaryClinton and her husband.
YOU ARE THE SHILL!
https://t.co/YWgQQ12lhG Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 8, 2016Ross, that was in response to a guest saying these things have gone on since the beginning of time, typical NYT BS https://t.co/t7lOLMMh2S Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 8, 2016Oral sex with an intern in the Oval Office Lies @HillaryClinton refers to Monica as a narcissistic loony toon!
Fair?
https://t.co/pANnv2qP1N Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 8, 2016Never.
The only person I know in this campaign accused of that is @HillaryClinton husband Bill.
https://t.co/COXXSWQRRM Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 8, 2016@realDonaldTrump words are very inappropriate.
Bills BEHAVIOR, and Bill and Hillary smearing of woman is now in play https://t.co/PdOj5esDzW Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 8, 2016Ok I understand how you feel.
So how do you feel about @HillaryClinton and Bill s behavior and treatment of women?
https://t.co/bO45R4a0mA Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 9, 2016Time will tell.
Just 31 days.
I ask again why does @HillaryClinton get a pass on far worse behavior?
https://t.co/uvDetH4MOQ Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 9, 2016What s worse Americans abandoned in Benghazi or locker room talk.
https://t.co/UVXsdZkL13 Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 9, 2016Who wanted to crucify Gennifer Flowers?
Who called Lewinsky a narcissistic loony toon .
Answer @HillaryClinton https://t.co/e8uA9f7Thn Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 9, 20164 Americans are dead after being abandoned by @HillaryClinton and locker room talk offends you more?
https://t.co/KzvZWnCMdg Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 9, 2016As you can see, Hannity escalated his desperation as he went, eventually resorting to screaming about Benghazi even though Hillary Clinton was cleared of any wrongdoing by a Republican witch-hunt which lasted longer than the investigation of 9/11.And while Trump s comments are relevant because he is a candidate in this race, Bill Clinton s behavior as president is not fair play because he is NOT running for president.
Hillary Clinton is.And Hannity s remark about King David keeping concubines is pretty damn pathetic as well since a concubine is defined as a sexual servant who is inferior to a man s wife.
So Hannity just basically called women Trump has chased outside of his marriage inferior sex objects who are supposed to submit to his sexual demands.
That pretty much makes this situation worse for Trump.While most normal people are condemning Trump and withdrawing their support from him, Hannity appears to be Trump s right-hand deplorable who will defend him no matter what he does, which makes one wonder where Trump grabbed Hannity to make him so submissive.Featured image via screenshot
