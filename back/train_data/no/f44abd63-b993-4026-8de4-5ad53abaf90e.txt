erbil iraq ( reuters ) - iraqi forces have entered al-qaim , one of the last remaining territories in the country still held by islamic state militants , the joint operations command said on friday .
units from the iraqi army , counter-terrorism services , sunni tribal and iranian-backed popular mobilisation forces ( pmf ) are participating in an offensive to recapture al-qaim and rawa , two towns which lie on the border area with syria .
iraq s security forces retook a border crossing with syria from the militants , hours after entering al-qaim , according to the joint operations command .
the road runs through al-qaim in iraq and albu-kamal in syria , two towns which are very close to each other on opposite sides of the border in the last important territorial stronghold of islamic state .
welcoming the offensive , the u.s.-led international military coalition , which has run an air campaign against islamic state in both syria and iraq since 2014 , said in a statement that approximately 1,500 islamic state fighters were estimated to remain in the immediate vicinity of al-qaim .
operations to clear the militants from their final strongholds in iraq have continued , despite a concurrent military advance on kurdish-held territory in the north .
iraq s central government launched an offensive on oct. 16 to seize disputed territories , claimed by both baghdad and the kurds , in retaliation for a referendum on kurdish independence held on sept. 25 .
in a lightning strike , central government forces swiftly recaptured large areas , including the oil-rich city of kirkuk , from the kurds , who had seized these areas when islamic state swept across northern iraq in 2014 .
on thursday , iraqi forces threatened to resume military operations against the kurds , accusing them of delaying the handover of control of borders and taking advantage of negotiations to bolster their defenses .
