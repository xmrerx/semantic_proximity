wow !
bernie and hillary have been making hay over the flint water crisis for months now , using the crisis to secure votes from the black community .
leftists have been converging on the city like rats in search of the last peice of cheese on earth and now we have proof that obama s epa knew about the crisis , but didn t think the people of flint were worthy of protecting.an internal environmental protection agency memo showed officials didn t think flint is the community we want to go out on a limb for while residents of the michigan town drank lead-contaminated water.house committee on oversight and government reform chairman jason chaffetz presented an internal memo between the epa official who oversees michigan , a branch manager in the epa s region 5 , the associate director of the water division for region 5 and an epa environmental engineer about the water crisis in flint.in the memo , one of the officials it wasn t clear who based on the screen shown by chaffetz said flint wasn t worth helping .
perhaps she already knows all this , but i m not so sure flint is the community we want to go out on a limb for , the memo stated.chaffetz was incredulous at the memo .
are you kidding me ?
he said , looking at susan hedman , the former director of epa s region 5 , which oversees much of the midwest including michigan .
why isn t flint the community they go to ?
of all the communities , the community having trouble is the one you go all out for , chaffetz said .
