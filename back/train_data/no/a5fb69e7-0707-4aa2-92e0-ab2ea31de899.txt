monrovia ( reuters ) - liberia s ruling party , which came second in a presidential election first round on oct. 10 , has said the poll was marred by irregularities , following similar claims from other parties .
vice president joseph boakai , a member of outgoing president ellen johnson sirleaf s unity party , won 28.8 percent of votes , versus 38.4 percent for former soccer star george weah .
a run-off vote between the two candidates is scheduled for nov. 7. international observers from the european union , the carter center and the national democratic institute have said they saw no major problems with the vote , which was meant to usher in liberia s first democratic transfer of power since 1944 .
the unity party did not say whether it would petition the election committee for a re-run , as did the liberty party of the third-placed candidate , charles brumskine , over what it said were gross irregularities and fraud .
we too have been gathering reports ... pointing to some anomalies and electoral management inefficiencies , which prevented some of our supporters and citizens from exercising their constitutional rights to vote , the unity party said in a statement .
it said it was still deciding what action to take consistent with the laws of liberia .
another candidate , alexander cummings of the alternative national congress , has also said there were problems during the polls , including the theft of ballot boxes , but his party has yet to file a complaint .
the communications director of the election commission , henry flomo , said the commission would respond to the unity party s concerns as quickly as possibly , adding that the party could challenge the commission s findings at the supreme court if it is not satisfied .
