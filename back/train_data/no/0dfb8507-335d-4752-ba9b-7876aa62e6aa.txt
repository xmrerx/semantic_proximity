this video has been going around for a few days and i think it is important to outline the children that will be greatly affected by this upcoming election .
our children are much more in-tune to politics an social going-ons then most of us were at their ages and it s an amazing thing to see.her enthusiasm and knowledge is refreshing that s for sure .
there have been many children at rallies in support and in opposition and we need to really start taking their presence into account .
there is a definite shift in this country and it starts at home.featured image and video courtesy of itv news
