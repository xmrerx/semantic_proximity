helsinki ( reuters ) - finland is planning large-scale military drills with the united states and other allies , its defense minister said on friday , in a region worried by russia s increasing military activity .
jussi niinisto said the exercises would help troops prepare for a crisis , without mentioning a specific threat .
the war games will not take place until 2020 at the earliest and will be similar to neighboring sweden s aurora drill that involved 19,000 troops in september , he added .
the exercise is planned to broadly gather conscripts , reservists and soldiers to practice ... together with our main partners like sweden , the united states and other countries , niinisto told broadcaster mtv .
if there s a crisis , it will be good for us to practice receiving help .
tensions have been rising in the region since russia s 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimea peninsula .
finland , which borders russia , has forged closer ties with nato in recent years , though most finns oppose actually joining the alliance .
in september , russia held its own zapad war games in belarus , the baltic sea , western russia and its kaliningrad outpost .
