donald trump and the people in his administration have precious little to brag about nowadays , but you can t manage to convince them of this fact .
the proof is in the pudding , so they say or in this case , in the tweets.nikki haley , the former governor of south carolina who trump decided to promote to united nations ambassador , took to twitter on wednesday to boast about something that is downright shameful : stripping half a billion dollars from the u.n. s peacekeeping budget .
just 5 months into our time here , we ve cut over half a billion $ $ $ from the un peacekeeping budget & we re only getting started .

only liberal snowflakes care about preventing genocides and atrocities and human rights violations .
