Despite how publicly and widely reported Hillary Clinton s win of the popular vote has been over the last several weeks, President-elect Donald Trump and the majority of the Republican Party still believe it was the other way around.That s right.
Despite the fact that Trump actually lost the popular vote by MILLIONS and was only saved by the grace of the Electoral College, Trump is still claiming he won by a landslide and a recent poll shows that his supporters agree.
According to a new online Qualtrics survey, a startling, mind baffling 52 percent of Republicans actually believe Trump won the popular vote.
According to the Washington Post: Respondents correct understanding of the popular vote depended a great deal on partisanship.
A large fraction of Republicans 52 percent said Trump won the popular vote, compared with only 7 percent of Democrats and 24 percent of independents.
Among Republicans without any college education, the share was even larger: 60 percent, compared with 37 percent of Republicans with a college degree.
Either these people have been living under a rock, the fake news websites that were stating Clinton lost the popular vote had a massive, devastating impact (after all, they appeared in the top results in Google searches), or these morons actually believe every single thing that comes out of Trump s mouth.The truth is that Trump actually LOST the popular vote in a landslide Trump had one of the lowest percentages of the popular vote ever recorded in history.
Yet he has been insisting at all of his Thank You tour rallies that he won tremendously.
This complete unwillingness to pay attention to facts and ignore what is happening in reality means it could be a disastrous four years for America.
Trump and his followers have no concept of what the truth is, and the thing that is even scarier is the fact that they don t care.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images
