one agent gilad azaria has 7 listings in trump buildings , and since the election he s had 4 serious buyers in the $ 3 million range .
he also says 2 of his clients who already live in trump properties want to trade up in the same buildings to more expensive places .
the agents with whom we spoke say the trump properties are top quality , and the brand is now stronger than ever .
celeb agents josh and matt altman say it s a no-brainer living in a building owned by the president is awesome and a super good investment .
