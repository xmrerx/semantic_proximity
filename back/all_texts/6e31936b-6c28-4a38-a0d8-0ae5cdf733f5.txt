Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders is in full campaign mode, and it shows.
He s also having a high old time trolling House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is under a seemingly crippling amount of stress due to his own party s buffoonish nominee, Donald Trump.Earlier in the week, Ryan spoke to a group of young Republicans in his home state of Wisconsin, and had dire warnings regarding what could happen if Democrats take back the Senate: that their worst nightmare would come true, and Bernie would be heading up the Budget Committee.
Ryan said to the University of Wisconsin students: If we lose the Senate, do you know who becomes the chairman of the Senate Budget Committee?
A guy named Bernie Sanders.
You ever heard of him?
Ryan s remarks were not missed by Bernie.
He tweeted: I heard what @SpeakerRyan said: If the GOP loses the Senate, I ll be the Budget chairman.
Sounds like a good idea.
Here is the tweet:I heard what @SpeakerRyan said: If the GOP loses the Senate, I'll be the Budget chairman.

This is entirely possible, since Democrats only need to pick up five seats to take the Senate four if we take the White House, since the Vice President is the tie-breaker in votes.Hopefully, Donald Trump continues to tear the GOP apart, and Paul Ryan s warning becomes a glorious reality for Democrats and assorted left-wingers everywhere.Featured image via Darren McCollester/Getty Images
