north carolina , long seen as the one state in the southeast with a bit of progressive common sense , is now nothing more than a complete embarrassment .
they have passed a law in response to charlotte s city ordinance protecting lgbt people that completely forbids cities , towns , and counties within the the state from putting any protections whatsoever in place for lgbt people .
of course , the internet exploded when gov .
pat mccrory signed the hateful bill into law , giving rise to the hashtag # wearenotthis.of course , most of the fear mongering came due to the so-called bathroom bill part of the protection ordinance , which would allow transgender people to used the public facilities that match their gender identity .
the bigots insisted that men would be using the bathroom to spy on women and all kinds of other nonsense .
a brave transgender man on twitter quickly shot down the absurdity of people who object to trans people in restrooms , though : @ patmccrorync it 's now the law for me to share a restroom with your wife .

pat mccrory and his fellow bigots in the legislature : you can sugar coat it all you want to but you just signed a hate bill .
you should be ashamed .
