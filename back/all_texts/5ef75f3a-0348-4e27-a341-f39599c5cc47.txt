Democratic National Committee chairman Tom Perez is a nasty man.
He s gone out trashing President Trump with disgusting language.
He s also made claims more recently that Trump didn t win because the Electoral College really isn t in the Constitution.
For this reason, we have zero sympathy for Perez.
He s as dirty as they come He tried to dodge an opportunity to address Donna Bazile s Thursday piece in Politico that touted Hillary Clinton s secret takeover of the DNC.
Perez appeared on CNBC today where, after focusing primarily on the GOP tax reform proposal, host Carl Quintinella asked the DNC chairman about Brazile s allegations Ouch!
THE IMPLOSION OF THESE GRIFTERS IS FUN TO WATCH Brazile claimed in the piece that the DNC was put on a starvation diet and became dependent on Clinton s 2016 presidential campaign for survival.HAHA!
HAVE YOU READ THE PIECE?
I can t let you go, Tom, since you re with us, without asking if you ve read Donna Brazile s piece about the DNC that s in Politico today.
Any comment at all?
Quintinella asked.DID YOU NOTICE THE DODGE?
WELL HEY, WE RE MOVING FORWARD Well hey, we re moving forward; we re building, you know.
I ve been asked that question a number of times since I started, Perez started.The DNC chairman continued by talking about the Democrats plans to create a transparent nomination process for 2020.
And, one of my goals here as DNC Chair is to make sure that the nominating process for 2020 is a process that s totally fair and transparent for everybody, Perez said.He continued to avoid addressing the Brazile allegations directly, instead focusing on what the DNC will do moving forward.
We re going to set the primary debate schedule well in advance of when we know who the candidates will be there, he said.
We have to make sure that everything is fair and open, and everybody has a fair shake.
That s what we re going to do.
