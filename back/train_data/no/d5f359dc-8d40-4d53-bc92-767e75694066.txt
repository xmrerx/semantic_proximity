riyadh ( reuters ) - saudi king salman received former lebanese prime minister saad al-hariri in riyadh on monday following his resignation , saudi media reported .
hariri announced his resignation on saturday from riyadh , saying he believed there was an assassination plot against him and accusing iran , saudi arabia s arch-rival , and its lebanese ally hezbollah of sowing strife in the arab world .
king salman met the resigned lebanese prime minister saad al-hariri a short while ago , a presenter on saudi-owned al-arabiya television said .
hariri s resignation toppled a coalition government that included shi ite muslim group hezbollah , thrusting lebanon back into the frontline of the saudi-iranian regional rivalry and risking an open-ended political crisis .
state news agency spa carried pictures of hariri and king salman greeting each other and then sitting together in a palatial setting .
hariri s surprise resignation in a televised speech aired on al-arabiya tv had drawn criticism and was met with controversy in beirut .
some have even questioned whether hariri s resignation was voluntary .
lebanese justice minister salim jreissati said on monday that lebanon s president would not take any steps regarding hariri s resignation before hariri returns from abroad , stressing that the resignation must be voluntary .
president michel aoun said earlier on monday that political leaders had been responsive to calls for calm , strengthening security and national unity after hariri s shock resignation .
