ANKARA (Reuters) - The Kurdish Regional Government s proposal to freeze its push for independence is an important step but does not go far enough, Turkey s Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said on Thursday.
Cavusoglu was speaking a day after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who visited Ankara on Wednesday, insisted that last month s Kurdish independence referendum be declared void.
