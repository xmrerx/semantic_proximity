CAIRO (Reuters) - British authorities have lifted a ban on carry-on electronic devices on planes arriving from Cairo airport, Egypt s Ministry of Civil Aviation said on Friday.
The United States and Britain in March imposed restrictions banning electronic devices from being carried on planes coming from certain airports in Muslim-majority countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
Authorities lifted the ban after confirming that security procedures on Egypt s flights meet the requirements of the British Transportation Security Administration, the ministry said in a statement.
