melbourne ( reuters ) - the man accused of deliberately plowing into christmas shoppers on a busy street in the australian city of melbourne was charged on saturday with 18 counts of attempted murder and one count of conduct endangering life .
the thursday incident was the second serious vehicle attack in australia s second biggest city this year .
police said they had charged the man , former afghanistan refugee saeed noori , after formally interviewing him about the attack that police had earlier described as a deliberate act .
police have said noori , 32 , is known to have mental health problems and to use drugs and they did not believe the attack was terrorism-related .
police suspect noori was behind the wheel of a white suv when he deliberately sped up and drove into dozens of pedestrians crossing the road at one of the busiest intersections in melbourne s central business district .
noori appeared in the magistrates court later on saturday where he was remanded in custody .
he will next appear in court on wednesday .
the court also ordered that noori be assessed by psychologists .
islamist militants have used vehicles to attack people several times in europe and the united states over the past couple of years .
in january , six people were killed in melbourne s central business district when a man used his vehicle to mow them down .
police also ruled out terrorism for that attack .
following the january incident , authorities installed 140 concrete bollards in the city center .
victoria state premier daniel andrews said 12 people remained in hospital , including three who in critical condition .
he said there would be an increased police presence at melbourne events , including the boxing day test cricket , carols and other major sports events .
