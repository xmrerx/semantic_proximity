paris ( reuters ) - president emmanuel macron on monday named award-winning author leila slimani as france s top emissary for promoting the use of the french language .
the appointment of the 36-year old franco-moroccan writer as emissary for francophone affairs follows macron s decision to name a tv presenter and well-known ecologist as environment minister and an olympic fencer as sports minister , opening up government to civil society .
slimani was propelled into the limelight when she won the prestigious prix goncourt last year for her novel chanson douce , which translates as lullaby .
this year , she published a book about sexuality in morocco .
the francophone affairs brief has in the past been a ministerial post or a junior minister position , and had often been occupied by career politicians .
macron , whose upstart centrist party trounced france s traditional political forces in an election earlier this year , has named a series of newcomers to his government .
nicolas hulot was appointed energy and environment minister , while laura flessel-colovic , an olympic gold medalist , is minister for sports .
