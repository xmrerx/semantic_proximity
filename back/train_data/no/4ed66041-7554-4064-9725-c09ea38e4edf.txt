jakarta ( reuters ) - indonesian counter-terrorism police killed two militants suspected of having links with a pro-islamic state network in a shootout on the eastern island of sumbawa , officials said on tuesday .
authorities in the country with the world s largest muslim population are trying to stamp out the spread of radical islamist ideologies .
its elite counter-terrorism unit , detachment 88 or densus 88 , has notched a string of recent successes against jemaah ansharut daulah ( jad ) network , a loose organization of radicals loyal to islamic state .
the two militants killed on sumbawa were suspected members of jad .
police said the shootout occurred when counter-terrorism forces ran into a group of four militants while conducting a surveillance operation in a mountainous area near the city of bima .
the two other militants managed to escape .
they had several weapons , different caliber bullets and survival gear , said national police spokesman setyo wasisto .
militants have been traveling between bima and poso , on sulawesi island .
counter-terrorism operations have decimated the militant group on sulawesi , and police said there were signs that the militants were turning their attention to bima .
there is a strong link between the radical group in poso and bima .
people have been going back and forth and people have received orders to carry out actions in bima , wasisto said .
last week police said eight men were arrested in riau province , on the central eastern coast of sumatra , and one man in south sulawesi province - all of them were suspected of having links to jad .
