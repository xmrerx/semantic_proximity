The party of rape is at it again.Republicans are drunk with power and the impending inauguration of a sexual predator has emboldened them to target the strong campus rape rules that universities have been implementing since 2011.North Carolina GOP Rep. Mark Meadows even wrote a list of 300 rules he wants Donald Trump to repeal in his first 100 days in office, including rules that are designed to push back against rape culture on college campuses.According to USA TODAY,One new entry is an April 2011 guidance document from the Department of Education s Office of Civil Rights setting out standards for how universities should handle sexual harassment and sexual violence complaints.Meadows updated report says the guidance has pressured colleges to spend hundreds of millions of dollars and to create vast campus bureaucracies to investigate sexual assault and date rape the incidence of which may be overstated.
The guidance virtually dictates one-size-fits-all procedures which provide less protection to the accused, the report claims, and denies the rights of the often-innocent accused.
This proves without a shadow of a doubt that Republicans hate women and want to see rape culture flourish on college campuses.Meadows is literally using his time and position to defend rapists instead of the victims these rules are designed to protect.
There is a huge amount of evidence that campus sexual assault is a problem, End Rape on Campus director of education Sofie Karasek said in response to Meadows claims, pointing out that the number of false rape accusations is between 2% and 8% on par with the rate of false accusations for other crimes.
Young women across the country now have to be more concerned about a Trump presidency more than ever before because it is clear that Republicans intend to do more to benefit rapists over the next four years while trying to repeal every protection and right women have gained over the last few decades, including the right to choose.
Let s not forget that Republicans want to force rape victims to have their rapist s baby.Let s also not forget that Republicans have made many offensive statements about rape over the years, with the consensus being that women should just lay back and enjoy being raped.Meadows is certainly making advocates for legal rape happy.
They want Trump to make rape legal across the country, and rolling back these rules would be a step toward that evil goal.One would hope that Ivanka Trump would step up and tell her dad that he should not support such an agenda, but right now, Republicans think they have a puppet in the White House who will do whatever they want him to do, and that makes Trump and the GOP incredibly frightening.Featured Image: Woman s Survival
