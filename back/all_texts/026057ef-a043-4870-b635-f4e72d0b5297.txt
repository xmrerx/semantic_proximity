The super top-secret GOP healthcare bill has been released.
Hidden within all the kerfuffle is a woman s worst nightmare: Planned Parenthood losing its funding.Reported by The Hill, the Senate healthcare bill will defund Planned Parenthood for one year.
The GOP bill follows the same language in the House-passed health care bill that blocks Medicaid reimbursements to Planned Parenthood.If this bill goes through, the beacon of women s health care and abortion services will be gone unless Planned Parenthood can find another viable option for funding.Of course, it s not just women that Planned Parenthood helps.
They provide health care for women, men, young people, while also acting as the U.S. s largest provider of sex education.
All are very crucial services.It s vital that Planned Parenthood retains its funding and we need people and our government to understand that.
Thankfully, two Republican senators, Lisa Murkowski (Ala.) and Susan Collins (Maine), have already suggested they may not support the bill if it defunds Planned Parenthood, The Hill reports.Collins said Wednesday if the bill included defunding language, she and Murkowski would introduce an amendment to strip it out.Planned Parenthood President Cecile Richards released a statement saying: If this is the Senate s idea of a bill with heart, then the women of America should have fear struck in theirs.
Slashing Medicaid and blocking millions of women from getting preventive care at Planned Parenthood is beyond heartless.
One in five women in this country rely on Planned Parenthood for care.
They will not stay silent as politicians vote to take away their care and their rights.
