So much for healthy debate on college campus Instead, liberals deal with conflict by screaming at the top of their lungs in protest.
How mature A shocking new video shows a Western Washington University student screaming for at least two-minutes straight after seeing a Donald Trump sign on campus.According to a video of the incident obtained by Campus Reform, an unknown student reacted to a street preacher s pro-Trump sign by spiraling into a two-minute fit, at some points even splattering paint on the ground in an apparent attempt at artistic protest.At certain points throughout the video, passers-by stop to ask the woman if she s alright, to which she seems to indicate that she s screaming as a form of protest.This woman needs to go back to pre-school to learn how to behave.
Screaming gets NOTHING done it just makes people want to run away from you.
