21st century wire says while the mainstream press can t wait to find out ( or get illegally leaked grand jury details ) about the next target of russian collusion investigator and special counsel robert mueller , lest we forget that back in february 2003 it was mueller who helped w. bush , dick cheney and the rest of the neocon establishment sell the iraq war.in may of this year , just days after the abrupt firing of fbi director james comey , former fbi director mueller was appointed special counsel to the investigation .
the reception was conspicuously enthusiastic and praised across all mainstream media outlets as well as inside the washington , d.c. beltway.this cogent video analysis by tyt politics demonstrates that things may not be what they seem .
in fact , as the evidence is presented here , far from it : recent history , however , suggests that whenever the political media class appears united in praise for anything .there s reason for concern .
