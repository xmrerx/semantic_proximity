This election has been hard for South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham.
After fighting his little Republican heart out in the primaries only to see a reality TV star defeat him and every other more qualified GOPer, Graham continued to be devastated long after Trump became the Republican nominee.Graham s journey through Trump s campaign has been nothing short of an emotional roller coaster, starting with him trashing The Donald and refusing to keep his promise to support the party s nominee regardless of who it was.
Then, Graham eventually decided to support Trump after much hesitance, only to completely disown him in the end after one too many offensive statements and erratic stunts.
Needless to say, Graham is probably one of the most relieved people in the GOP that this election has finally come to an end.On Tuesday, Graham decided to celebrate Election Day with one more final F*ck You to Trump, someone that Graham clearly doesn t think deserves to be anywhere near the White House.
Using his hatred for Trump as the inspiration behind his voting choice, Graham announced who he actually voted for on Twitter, and it s going to break Trump s little black heart:TwitterTwitterTwitterGraham decided that since he can t stand the thought of voting for Trump but didn t want to vote for Hillary Clinton, either, that he would just vote for the next best thing in his mind Evan McMullin, who came into the election late with the simple goal of being an alternative to Trump.Graham is the very first senator to publicly say that he s voting for the conservative independent candidate, and it s a huge slap in the face to Trump.
We expect that many more disgruntled Republicans will be making similar choices, although many may not have the courage to actually admit it.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla and Alex Wong / Getty Images
