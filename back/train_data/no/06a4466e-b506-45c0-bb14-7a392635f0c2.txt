until recently , iowa democrat kim weaver was running a promising campaign against noted white supremacist , gop rep. steve king.weaver raised $ 100,000 in four days following king s racist claim that we can t restore our civilization with somebody else s babies just one of his many , many bigoted outpourings.this , of course , made him very popular with the alt-right ( the modern term for nazis ) .the 15 words : [ c ] ulture and demographics are our destiny .
we ca n't restore our civilization with somebody else 's babies .

https : //t.co/7nzsetoyvy david duke ( @ drdavidduke ) march 12 , 2017since he gained popularity with the worst our society has to offer , it s unsurprising what happened next.weaver received so many death threats from king s nazi followers that she feels she can not continue to run against him : ( function ( d , s , id ) { var js , fjs = d.getelementsbytagname ( s ) [ 0 ] ; if ( d.getelementbyid ( id ) ) return ; js = d.createelement ( s ) ; js.id = id ; js.src = `` //connect.facebook.net/en_us/sdk.js # xfbml=1 & version=v2.3 '' ; fjs.parentnode.insertbefore ( js , fjs ) ; } ( document , 'script ' , 'facebook-jssdk ' ) ) ; over the last several weeks , i have been evaluating personal circumstances along with the political climate regarding posted by kim weaver on saturday , june 3 , 2017 one consideration has been raised again by recent events at my home .
beginning during my 2016 campaign , i have received very alarming acts of intimidation , including death threats , weaver explains on facebook .
while some may say enduring threats are just a part of running for office , my personal safety has increasingly become a concern .
king , almost following a script that seems to be read every single time the right threatens someone into submission , claimed that the death threats likely didn t happen but a fabrication .
i wanted # kimweaver in the race-not out .
democrats drove her out of the race-not r 's .
death threats likely did n't happen but a fabrication .
