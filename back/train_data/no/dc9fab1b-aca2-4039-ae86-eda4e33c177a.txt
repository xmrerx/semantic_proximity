one year later , and donald trump s supporters couldn t be happier with their choice for president .
prepare for liberal heads to explode in 5 4 3 2 1according to a politico/morning consult poll conducted on the eve of the first anniversary of trump s historic election , 82 percent of those who say they supported trump last year would vote for him again if they had to do it over .
that s slightly more than those who say they would vote for democrat hillary clinton again 78 percent if they had the chance.only 7 percent of trump voters and 8 percent of clinton voters say they would vote for a different candidate if they could complete their 2016 ballot again.trump s supporters have largely rallied around the president , despite his poor overall approval ratings , the chaos of his first year in office and the ongoing investigations into russian meddling in the 2016 election.but there are worrying signs for trump that voters are less inclined to give him a second term three years from now if he decides to run for reelection.those red flags go beyond the natural , downward trajectory of most new presidents .
like trump , barack obama and george w. bush saw their parties lose governorships in both new jersey and virginia the year after their first elections as president .
but both obama and bush had job-approval ratings over 50 percent at this point.while most trump voters would back him in a 2016 do-over , some defect when asked whether they will vote for trump or a generic , unnamed democrat in 2020 .
about three-quarters of trump voters , 76 percent , back trump in the 2020 matchup , while 8 percent would support the democrat .
