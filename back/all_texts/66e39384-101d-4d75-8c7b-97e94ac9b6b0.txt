It read Hate cops?
The next time you need help call a crackhead.
Megan Thomas told The Star Press on Sunday that she noticed the sign while walking with her niece.
She said she was offended by the message, which she alleged was vulgar, discriminatory to many different classes of people in our city.

I was very ashamed that something so dividing was present in Muncie, she added.
