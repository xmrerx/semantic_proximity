beijing ( reuters ) - china supports efforts by the myanmar government to protect its national security and opposes recent violent attacks in the country s rakhine state , chinese foreign minister wang yi told u.n. secretary-general ant nio guterres .
the military response to insurgent attacks in the western region of myanmar last month sent more than 410,000 rohingya muslims fleeing to neighboring bangladesh , escaping what the united nations has branded ethnic cleansing .
myanmar s government says about 400 people have been killed in the fighting .
britain , france and australia urged myanmar leader aung san suu kyi on monday to push for an end to military violence against rohingya muslims .
her national security adviser said those who had fled could return but the process had to be discussed .
wang told guterres at a meeting at the united nations on monday china understands and supports myanmar s efforts to protect its security in rakhine and hopes the fire of war can soon be extinguished , china s foreign ministry said in a statement on tuesday .
china expresses sympathy with those who have fled into bangladesh and will send humanitarian aid to bangladesh , wang said .
china advocates myanmar and bangladesh resolving the problem via dialogue and consultation , the foreign ministry cited wang as saying .
china is willing to continue promoting peace talks in its own way , and hopes the international community can play a constructive role to ease the situation and promote dialogue , he said .
china and myanmar have close economic and diplomatic ties and china has defied expectations that democratization in the former burma could lead to weaker relations between the two countries .
about a million rohingya lived in rakhine state until the recent violence .
most face draconian travel restrictions and are denied citizenship in a country where many buddhists regard them as illegal immigrants from bangladesh .
