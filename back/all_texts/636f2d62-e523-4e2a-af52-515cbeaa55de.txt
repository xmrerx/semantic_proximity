Donald Trump s supporters are vicious and violent a fact the incoming President-elect has traditionally refused to acknowledge even after two of his fans beat a Hispanic homeless man (and U.S. citizen) to death s door with a pipe and then urinated on him (Trump called those men passionate gentlemen who want to make America great again ) or when they beat up random African-Americans at his rallies (he offered to pay their legal fees).Yes, The Donald s violent, xenophobic, meth-addled deplorable, racist, mindless followers are all that and more but on Friday at a Florida stop on his ridiculous thank you tour, he made an unpresidented (that s not a typo, just quoting a tweet of his) move: he actually admitted what sort of people flock to him, and it s exactly the sort of terms everyone else has always used to describe his fans: You people were vicious, violent, screaming, Where s the wall?
We want the wall!
Screaming, Prison!
Prison!
Lock her up!
I mean you are going crazy.
I mean, you were nasty and mean and vicious and you wanted to win, right?
But now, you re mellow and you re cool and you re not nearly as vicious or violent, right?
Because we won, right?
But it s terms like vicious and violent (especially deplorables ) that used to set Trump off before he was elected.
The Hill reminds us:I m likely going to need therapy (and strangely an enema for some reason) after saying this phrase, but Trump is right.
Sure, it s not climate change, foreign policy, China, Obamacare, or anything important, but he finally nailed what sort of people back him.That s a start, right?Watch Trump s remarks below:Featured image via screengrab
