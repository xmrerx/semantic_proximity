WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday condemned an alt-right conference in Washington over the weekend where some members performed a Hitler salute and yelled “Hail Trump!” after a speech about white nationalism.
“I condemn them.
I disavow, and I condemn,” Trump said in a New York Times interview in New York, according to a reporter’s Twitter post.
