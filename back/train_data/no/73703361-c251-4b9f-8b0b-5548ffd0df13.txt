looters in texas are boldly walking into businesses affected by the flooding and literally stealing everything off the shelves .
it s hard to fathom that the first thoughts of so many people who have lost everything are to steal as much as they can from others who have also lost everything .
last week , we published a story with a video about one lone , and very brave man who claimed to be a former s.w.a.t .
deputy , standing in the middle of a parking lot defending local store owners from would be looters .
apparently , he s not the only badass in texas who s sick and tired of watching these thugs steal from local business owners.meet sheriff troy nehls of fort bend county who s putting looters in his county on notice .
he s got a message for looters , and he s not mincing words we ve heard of looting around the greater houston area , specifically harris county .
as far as fort bend county , we haven t. i made a comment the other day that we support the second amendment here in fort bend county , and there are many of us that are armed .
i would caution those that want to come and prey on our people here in fort bend county that are suffering so much right now .
you may want to stay out of fort bend county because you could leave this county in a bag .
we support the 2nd amendment i would caution those that want to come & prey on our people here in fort bend county .
watch : sheriff troy nehls : `` we support the 2nd amendment i would caution those that want to come & prey on our people here in fort bend county . ''
