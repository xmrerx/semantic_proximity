when asked why they might have booed , he speculated that it was because glenn was a democrat : he just moved on , said `` maybe they 'll come around . ''
i think context was that glenn was a democrat .
kurt eichenwald ( @ kurteichenwald ) december 9 , 2016outspoken conservative and fox news host tucker carlson confronted kurt eichenwald during his show .
he touched on several subjects , but the one that sticks out the most , is the unfounded claim that eichenwald made about trump being in a mental hospital in 1999 : here s what the very liberal washington post had to say about eichenwald s claim that trump was in a mental hospital kurt eichenwald is an experienced investigative journalist , with a best-selling book to his credit and years of work at the new york times , vanity fair and now newsweek.there s no evidence that trump was ever hospitalized for such a condition , and eichenwald cited none.the tweet was quickly deleted from eichenwald s account , though not before it received hundreds of retweets and likes , spreading it far and wide across the twittersphere.after quite a bit of back and forth with the clearly embarrassed newsweek senior writer , carlson finally let eichenwald have it : you re entirely entitled to your opinion , my only point is that t you should label yourself as you are which is an advocate .
https : //youtu.be/wjcuuu_1tnsfor the record , this is the image eichenwald uses as his profile picture on twitter : seriously ?
is everything about this clown fake ?
even his picture looks fake .
it s time to drain the swamp of these arrogant journalists promoting fake news stories for mainstream sources who are attempting to label all conservative news sources as fake .
