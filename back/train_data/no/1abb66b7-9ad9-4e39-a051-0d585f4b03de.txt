talk radio hosts went nuts with the news of gore s visit to trump tower today .
michael savage was very disappointed but rush limbaugh gave the best comment : i m gon na tell you something , said limbaugh .
if trump goes south on climate change , that is just gon na be deeply disappointing and alarming because of what climate change is to the left .
it s everything , it s everything they want and everything they believe and it s almost everything they can get to achieve it , to accomplish it .
we couldn t agree more with rush !
it s just upsetting that they would even want to speak with the phony who claims global warming is real yikes !
