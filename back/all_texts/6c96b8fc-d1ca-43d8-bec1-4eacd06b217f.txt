Michigan Congressman John Conyers has been in the spotlight recently for being a repeat sexual harasser to women he works with.
He even showed up for a meeting in his underwear!
Yikes!Nancy Pelosi defended Conyers on Meet the Press this morning when she called him an icon She went on to say that he deserves due process .
That s pretty ironic when you think of how the left wants to lock up any Republican right away if they re accused of wrongdoing.
Conyers gets a pass because he s an icon ?
This is just more insanity from Pelosi who needs to retire with Conyers..@NancyPelosi: Accused Congressman Conyers is an "icon" in our country.

John Conyers, D-Detroit, and later ran an ethics watchdog group in the nation s capital confirmed for the Free Press on Thursday that Conyers verbally abused her, criticized her appearance and once showed up to a meeting in his underwear.Melanie Sloan, a well-known Washington lawyer who for three years in the 1990s worked as Democratic counsel on the House Judiciary Committee, where Conyers remains the ranking Democrat, told the Detroit Free Press that Conyers constantly berated her, screaming at her and firing her and then rehiring her several times.She said he criticized her for not wearing stockings on at least one occasion.
On another, she said he ordered her backstage from a committee field hearing on crime she had organized in New York City to babysit one of his children.
Sloan made clear that she did not feel she had ever been sexually harassed, but that she felt mistreated by this guy.
