Donald Trump isn t subtle.
He totally clueless and unaware of the world around him.
He certainly isn t sensitive and he s definitely tone-deaf about pretty much everything.
Take today, when he was speaking to a group of retired veterans, many of whom suffer from PTSD, at a town hall.
While talking to them about veterans care, the terrible suicide rate among vets, and inferior mental health care within the VA system, the clueless, draft-dodging egomaniac actually insulted everyone who s ever seen combat.
When you talk about the mental health problems, when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe what a lot of the folks in this room have seen many times over, and you re strong and you can handle it, but a lot of people can t handle it.
And they see horror stories, and they see events you couldn t see in a movie nobody would believe it.
That s rich coming from someone with five draft deferments.
He s got no idea at all and he doesn t want to learn.
He d rather tell soldiers what he thinks PTSD is and leave it at that.
So soldiers who succumb to PTSD are weak.
On the internet, people are livid and rightfully so.
They ve been quick to hit back at Trump for that on Twitter because he really just hurt all the vets suffering from that awful condition, due entirely to being sent off to fight wars Trump can t even imagine, but would like to fight more of.PTSD does not mean weakness!
