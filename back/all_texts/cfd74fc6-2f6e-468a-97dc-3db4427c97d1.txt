The list of people GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump hasn t insulted keeps getting shorter and shorter.
We know he regularly insults women and Muslims and Latinos and immigrants and African-Americans.
Earlier in the week, he insulted veterans.
He s mocked the disabled, and his latest tactless comment was directed toward literally on their death beds.In a rally in Nevada on Wednesday, Trump begged those who were dying to vote for him.
Yes, those who were dying.I don t care how sick you are.
I don t care if you just came back from the doctor and he gave you the worst possible prognosis, meaning it s over.
You won t be around in two weeks.
Doesn t matter.
Hang out till November 8.
Get out and vote.
Then, Trump said he was kidding/not kidding.Mr Trump added: I say kiddingly, but I mean it.
He also reassured dying people that after they are gone, All we re going to say is: We love you and we will remember you always .Here s the video:People are not happy:One terminally ill person did respond, and it wasn t to support Trump:This one pretty much gets to the heart of it (or the lack of heart of Trump):As deeply offensive as this is, especially for anyone who either is sick or those who take care of the sick, there is a bit of refreshing honesty in Trump s joke/not joke.
I don t care is perhaps the most truthful line he s uttered during his campaign full of lies.
He genuinely doesn t care if people are sick.
He doesn t care if people are suffering.
He doesn t care if people are poor.
He doesn t care about people at all.Donald Trump has a compulsive need for constant validation.
He received fawning validation on the Apprentice.
Now, he s taken his show to the American public and he expects the same from us.
It s easy to imagine that Trump loves the idea of people dragging themselves from their death beds to do one last thing: pull the lever for Donald Trump.
What greater ego validation is there?Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images.
