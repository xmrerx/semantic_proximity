WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will not interfere with the investigation by Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller or try to fire the former FBI director, Trump lawyer Jay Sekulow said on Monday after the indictment of Trump campaign aides.
“The president is not interfering with special counsel Mueller’s position, he’s not firing the special counsel.
He’s said that before,” Sekulow said in an interview with CNN.
