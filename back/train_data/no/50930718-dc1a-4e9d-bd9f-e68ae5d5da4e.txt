( reuters ) - pennsylvania governor tom wolf announced on wednesday that he has a “ treatable form ” of prostate cancer but said it would not interfere with his official duties .
“ i ’ m not going to be incapacitated at all by this , ” wolf told reporters at a news conference alongside his wife , frances .
“ it ’ s eminently treatable. ” the 67-year-old democrat said he would begin a months-long regimen of treatment within the coming weeks .
he would not go into details of the treatment but described it as “ minor ” and “ routine ” and said it would not include chemotherapy .
wolf , a businessman , defeated republican incumbent tom corbett in 2014 .
since his election , the state has been locked in a bitter budget battle .
it still has only a partial spending plan for the current fiscal year , which began more than seven months ago .
illinois , the u.s. state with the country ’ s lowest credit rating , is the only other state without a current budget in place .
wolf and the republican-controlled state legislature have been fighting over whether to implement a severance tax on natural gas producers , among other tax hikes , and use the revenues to increase education spending .
wolf said his doctor found some abnormalities during a routine examination in late november or early december and that further testing had confirmed the cancer .
“ prostate cancer is something that older men get , ” he said .
“ a lot of older men die with prostate cancer ; not a lot die of it. ” he said he hoped his announcement would reinforce the importance of getting annual checkups .
other governors have also continued to work while undergoing treatment for cancer .
maryland governor larry hogan , 59 , a republican , pledged in june 2015 to keep working despite chemotherapy for advanced cancer of the lymph nodes .
california governor jerry brown , 77 , a democrat , kept a full schedule in 2012 while receiving treatment for prostate cancer .
