Trump voters are stupid enough to defend him no matter what he does.
As Trump himself has pointed out, he could shoot someone in public and not lose a single vote.
This is something Monty Python s John Cleese has noticed over the course of the election and on Friday morning he voiced his frustration on Twitter.After watching a loyal Trump voter step in to defend The Donald s comment that he greets women he finds beautiful with a kiss and pussy-grab, he couldn t take it anymore.
True stupidity, he writes.
A Trump supporter,defending his awful taped remarks,said He would never have said that if he d know he was being recorded.
True stupidity a Trump supporter,defending his awful taped remarks,said "He would never have said that if he'd know he was being recorded" John Cleese (@JohnCleese) October 21, 2016No f*cking sh*t. People even Trump generally avoid being recorded saying horrible things.
Naturally, his Twitter followers joined in the mockery:@JohnCleese "I want a president who's only a sexual predator behind closed doors."

@JohnCleese Pretty sure @IvankaTrump said it, too.
They forget that character is how you behave when you think nobody's watching.
Myles Standoffish (@DrSchadNFreude) October 21, 2016@JohnCleese Well of course not, he only says bigoted things out loud in public.
The sexually gross stuff is for persecuting women in private Tesla (@MANX38) October 21, 2016@JohnCleese It implies that there are things Trump would never say in public, which is a mind-boggling thought considering what he does say Henear Kryxerad (@TyphonBaalAmmon) October 21, 2016Cleese has been no stranger to tearing Trump apart, which he has been doing for at least months.
Here are some of his best:If Trump is elected,I shall purchase a house in the US.But after four years,when the property prices have bottomed https://t.co/lhocooUpQ3 John Cleese (@JohnCleese) May 31, 2016Good news !
Trump and the GOP have buried the hatchet..And now, the bad news : They buried it in the skull of the United States of America John Cleese (@JohnCleese) May 13, 2016I learn many of my twits are Trump supporters,who tell me I should hear his speeches So far I've only heard his tapes sorry John Cleese (@JohnCleese) October 14, 2016Trump and the other Republicans panickers are doing exactly what ISIS are hoping for.And they pretend they are being 'tough' No,just stupid John Cleese (@JohnCleese) December 20, 2015Fascinating !
Trump's ego has hit a wall.
Reality has created a tiny crack in his delusional world.
Whatever comes next is going to be good John Cleese (@JohnCleese) August 6, 2016This conspiracy is WORLDWIDE !
The WHOLE PLANET'S media regard Trump as a coarse,narcissistic,bullying,rambling megalomaniacI forgot Putin John Cleese (@JohnCleese) October 16, 2016In a recent interview, Cleese called Trump a complete clown with a dead squirrel adorning his head, saying the billionaire GOP presidential nominee could have been a character on Monty Python.
That confidence that he has which really comes from a lack of awareness that is what people are drawn to, the actor says of Trump.
We have some fairly stupid politicians in England, but we don t approach your scale of stupidity.
I m more relaxed now but if I look at the world, I don t think it s ever been in a worse situation.
I look at what s going on and there isn t much to be cheerful about, Cleese says.
I look at Trump, and I see a narcissist, with no attention span, who doesn t have clear ideas about anything and makes it all up as he goes along.
The actor is exactly right.
Trump and his supporters are terrible but his people will surely be motivated to vote in November.
Make sure you get your butt to the polls.Featured image via Getty Images(Matt Cardy/Spencer Platt)
