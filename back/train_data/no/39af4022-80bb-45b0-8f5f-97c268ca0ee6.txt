tokyo ( reuters ) - popular tokyo governor yuriko koike , whose fledgling party is gaining momentum ahead of an oct. 22 general election , said on thursday at a news conference that she would look into what steps are needed to reduce japan s dependence on nuclear energy to zero by 2030 .
prime minister shinzo abe is calling the snap poll in the hope his liberal democratic party-led coalition can keep its majority in the parliament s lower house , where it now holds two-thirds of the seats .
koike has said she wants japan to abandon nuclear power - a stance likely to resonate with many voters - but had not previously mentioned a target date .
abe s government plans to retain atomic power as part of the energy mix , despite safety worries after the 2011 fukushima crisis .
