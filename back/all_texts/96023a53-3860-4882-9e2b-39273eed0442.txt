The United States just experienced its worst mass shooting in history.
Fifty members of the LGBT community were gunned down in a gay nightclub in Orland0, Florida while 53 more were taken to the hospital, many with life threatening injuries.The assailant, a Muslim man yielding an AR-15 assault rifle, was allegedly (according to his father) incensed after seeing two men kiss, and a rage brewed inside him.And now that the carnage is over, millions have offered their thoughts and prayers.
Included in those thoughts and prayers are the phony and hackneyed prayers from the very people who 99 percent of the time, side with guns over people s lives: Republicans.From Senators to Governors to members of the House (the same people who voted against LGBT equality and for near total gun rights ), Republicans offered their thoughts to the victims and their families.But the deputy director of the Center for American Progress Action Fund, Igor Volsky, reminded the people why the GOP s thoughts and prayers are just that and nothing else:We pray you will have the courage to stand up to @NRA and start national conversation about limiting access to guns https://t.co/aEq1YJw3pd igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) June 12, 2016 Sen @TomCottonAR received $2,581,794 in expenditures from NRA, so he voted against closing terror gap back in Dec https://t.co/XEOVJHjL5d igorvolsky (@igorvolsky) June 12, 2016.

Thoughts and prayers mean nothing if you aren t willing to change the system.Senate Republicans allowed people on terrorist watchlists to have guns.
The Orlando shooter was on such a list.
Republicans cannot be taken seriously and their thoughts are empty and their prayers mean nothing.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images
