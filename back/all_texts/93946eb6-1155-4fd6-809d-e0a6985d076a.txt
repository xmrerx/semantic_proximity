It s no secret that people are furious over the fact that CNN hired Donald Trump s former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, just three days after he was fired from his position in Trump s presidential campaign.
CNN felt the full force of the outrage during a panel discussion on CNN s Reliable Sources.Before the panel discussion began, host Brian Stelter launched into the controversy surrounding Lewandowski s hiring.
Stelter points out that Lewandowski has been consistently hostile to reporters during his job as Trump s campaign manager, he has been accused of battery by former Breitbart reporter Michelle Fields with video evidence to support the claim and the fact that Lewandowski may very well have signed a non-disclosure agreement with Trump.During the discussion, Baltimore Sun media critic David Zurawik did not hold back his feelings about CNN s newest paid commentator.
When asked how he feels about the hiring Zurawik said, I hate it.
We are at this time in history where I think a lot of people feel that the media elites and political elites are in bed together and they re the losers.
The people in America feel they are the losers.
Zurawik says that he thinks that Lewandowski s hiring is particularly troubling to people because he fully embraced the tactics of McCarthyism during his time in the Trump campaign.
The other thing I do want to say about getting information about the process from Lewandowski.
Brian, if the folks at CNN, who I think have the best political reporters on television if you guys need to pay him to tell you what s going on inside the Trump campaign, give your money back, you re not earning your paychecks.
Let s find out the old fashioned way.
By reporting it, not paying weasels to tell you about it.
