sorry tiger , hillary has a lot of influence but it s unlikely she can do anything for your golf game adulterer and former golf star tiger woods donated between $ 25,001 and $ 50,000 to the clinton foundation in the first half of 2015 , records show .
the charitable organization was founded by adulterer and former president bill clinton .
the two men are perhaps the most renowned philanderers in america , yet for whatever reason clinton is far more respected in the public eye , and occasionally wins father of the year awards.woods is one of more than 10,500 individuals and organization who donated to the clinton foundation in the first half of the year .
that s a significant increase from the 8,800 donors who contributed during the same period last year , but it probably has nothing to do with the fact that hillary officially announced her presidential campaign in april , because the clinton foundation is exclusively a charitable organization that does a lot of good in the world and is definitely not a slush fund for influence peddlers.via : wfb
