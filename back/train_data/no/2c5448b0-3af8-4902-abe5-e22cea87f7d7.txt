is this apology too little too late ?
after one year of bashing trump , and with only one week left before the election , does this apology really matter now ? a central florida newspaper has apologized to its readers for the decidedly anti-donald trump coverage that has been published during the election.the daily commercial published an editorial titled the media , the election and bias on oct. 23 that explained the paper is reliant on wire services for much of its election coverage and those reports are weighted heavily against trump .
the daily commercial hasn t done enough to mitigate the anti-trump wave in the pages of this paper , it wrote .
you deserve a more balanced approach to the coverage of elections and other weighty issues .
in what it described as an open letter that it described as part explanation , part reflection and part mea culpa the paper apologized to its readers .
