milan ( reuters ) - pope francis on sunday called on world leaders to work in favor of nuclear disarmament to protect human rights , particularly those of weaker and underprivileged people .
the pontiff said that there was a need to work with determination to build a world without nuclear weapons , speaking from the window of the papal apartment overlooking st. peter s square and citing his 2015 encyclical letter laudato si ( praised be ) .
his remarks came on the day that the group which won this year s nobel peace prize urged nuclear nations to adopt a u.n. treaty banning atomic weapons .
with rising tensions between the united states and north korea , the pope has repeatedly warned against the catastrophic humanitarian and environmental effects of nuclear devices and has called for a third country to mediate the dispute .
at his weekly angelus prayer , pope francis added that men and women in the world had the liberty , the intelligence and the capacity to guide technology , limit their power , at the service of peace and true progress .
speaking aboard the plane back from his trip to myanmar and bangladesh , the pope suggested that some world leaders had an irrational attitude toward nuclear weapons .
last month he appeared to harden the catholic church s teaching against nuclear weapons , saying countries should not stockpile them , even for the purpose of deterrence .
pope francis , a strong defender of environmental protection , also hoped that an upcoming paris summit would adopt efficient decisions to contrast climate change .
