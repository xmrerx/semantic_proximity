i fell in love with him [ trump ] because he really talks about helping african-american black people , and that s why i m here .
got ta give the man his due .
donald trump may be the only person alive equally capable of charming kanye west , jim brown , and mitt romney .
however you may feel about his shtick on the stump , the guy must have a genius-level quotient of personal charisma in private conversation when he feels like summoning it .
i wonder how it ll translate in diplomatic meetings , with leaders from other cultures .
it s hard to imagine trump and merkel hitting it off in the same way it s hard to imagine merkel hitting it off with , say , don king , but nothing would surprise me anymore .
brown sounds like he s ready to sign up for the reelection campaign here .
ha when he goes through what he went through to become the president , he s got my admiration .
because no one game him a chance .
you know they called him names .
ahh people that called him names when he won , he reached back and brought them along with him .
he held no grudges .
