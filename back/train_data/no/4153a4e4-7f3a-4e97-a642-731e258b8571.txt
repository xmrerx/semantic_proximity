kiev ( reuters ) - ukrainian president petro poroshenko has submitted a new draft law to parliament for the creation of an anti-corruption court , the parliamentary website showed late on friday .
slow progress establishing an independent court to deal with corruption cases has been one of the main obstacles to the disbursement of loans under a $ 17.5 billion aid-for-reforms program from the international monetary fund .
a committee will now need to review and approve the bill , before it can be voted on by parliament , the next session of which is in january .
