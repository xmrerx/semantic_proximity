Prisoners of war are routinely subjected to torture.
One form of torture that is regularly used is waterboarding, which is a horrific simulation of drowning.
To survive that sort of thing on behalf of one s country is heroic but not according to Donald Trump, who said that Senator John McCain is not a war hero, since he was caught and tortured.
These facts make what Trump surrogate Jan Brewer (R-AZ) said regarding how her candidate is being treated in the media with regards to sexual assault accusations that have been leveled at him since the discovery of the Access Hollywood tape all the more offensive.Brewer appeared on CNN s State of the Union Sunday morning, and said: He s been waterboarded by these issues.
It seems like it s really been kind of somewhat of a put up oppression of Donald Trump from all of these people lining up.
It s just unbelievable.
These accusations are a result of Trump flat-out denying that he had ever touched a woman inappropriately during the second debate, which came just two days after he bragged on tape about doing just that.
Several of the women said that his denial of what he had done to them was too much, and brought them forward.The thing is, the best witness for these women is Donald Trump himself.
It s not waterboarding, Gov.
Brewer, for people to try to tell the public what they believe to be the truth about a major party presidential candidate.Watch Brewer s offensive remarks below:Former Gov.
