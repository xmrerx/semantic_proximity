Members of the House Intelligence Committee are saying that Donald Trump and his treasonous cronies could find themselves behind bars.
Two Democrats on the committee said today that jail time could very likely be the outcome of the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 election and Trump s possible collusion with them.On Tuesday, Rep. Joaquin Castro told CNN s Wolf Blitzer that he wouldn t be surprised after all of this is said and done, that some people end up in jail.
Blitzer pressed him on whether he meant not just one individual, but people, plural.
The congressman wouldn t point to anyone in particular but did say his impression was that more than one person could find themselves behind bars.
You re confident that at least some Trump associates will wind up in jail?
Blitzer sked.
If I was betting, I would say yes, Castro replied.Congressman Denny Heck, another Democrat on the committee, went a step further than Castro during an interview with MSNBC on Tuesday evening while speaking with Chris Matthews.
I want to respectfully disagree with my dear friend Joaquin Castro, next to whom I sit on the intelligence committee.
He said he would not be surprised if people ended up going to jail.
I will be surprised if people don t end up going to jail, Heck said.Matthews asked about FBI Director James Comey s announcement that a special unit was being formed to handle the investigation of Trump s shady ties with Russia.
Heck replied that he was sure anybody associated with the Trump orbit that was involved in Russia s financial entanglements probably was calling their lawyer today.
