Recently, liberal firebrands like George Clooney and his wife, Amal Alamuddin, have come under heavy fire from the left for their $353,000 per couple fundraising dinner to benefit the candidacy of Hillary Clinton for president.Some people were so incensed they literally threw dollar bills at Clinton.But here s the kicker: the majority of the money raised at the Clooney-Clinton dinners aren t going to Clinton they re going to down ticket candidates to take back the House and the Senate.While appearing on Meet the Press, Clooney, who brushed off the notion that he is a corporate shill as one of the funnier things you could say about me told host Chuck Todd:It s [the money] going to the congressmen and senators to try to take back Congress.
And the reason that s important (is) we need to take the Senate back because we need to confirm the Supreme Court justice, because that fifth vote on the Supreme Court can overturn Citizens United and get this obscene, ridiculous amount of money out so I never have to do a fundraiser again.
And that s why I m doing it.Politifact rated that as Mostly True.
Here s how it goes:So only $2,700 out of $353,000 will go directly to Clinton.
That s approximately 0.0076 percent less than one percent.While leftists threw dollar bills at Clinton, Democrats across the country were getting the support they so need to take back two chambers (possibly three with the Supreme Court) thanks to George Clooney.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
