21st century wire says this has been an ongoing project of the search giant , long in the making , and already underway .
in fact , this website , 21stcenturywire.com , has felt the impact of its content being disappeared in google s search results resulting in a drop of over 50 % in our organic search query traffic since april.it s those kinds of sites like rt , sputnik , 21wire and many others that are targets in the grand plan , as outlined here by robert parry of consortium news : you don t need a huge amount of imagination to see how this combination of mainstream groupthink and artificial intelligence could create an orwellian future in which only one side of a story gets told and the other side simply disappears from view .
rtgoogle will de-rank rt articles to make them harder to find eric schmidteric schmidt , the executive chairman of google s parent company alphabet , says the company will engineer specific algorithms for rt and sputnik to make their articles less prominent on the search engine s news delivery services .
