brussels ( reuters ) - the building that houses eu summits , where toxic fumes forced eu leaders to switch venues last week , will be closed for a further week as investigators seek to resolve the problem .
the fumes leaking from the drains have forced the europa building , also known as the egg , to be evacuated twice this month , including before a summit of eu leaders on thursday and friday .
the new building was opened in january amid controversy over its 321-million-euro ( $ 378 million ) price tag .
staff and meetings will be temporarily transferred to the next door justus lipsius building until the issue is resolved .
about 20 catering staff had to go to hospital on oct. 13 and an unspecified number on wednesday .
an eu official said the council and belgian health and safety agencies believe the two incidents were due to the same source .
