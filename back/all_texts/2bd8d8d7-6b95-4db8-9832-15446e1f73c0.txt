Republican presidential candidate John Kasich is promoting his idea to create a new government agency that would promote Christianity around the world.Kasich touted the idea recently during an interview on NBC News.According to Kasich, the agency s job would be to revive what we used to do when we beamed messages into the former Soviet Union.
Kasich went on to say that his new agency would Beam messages around the world about what it means to have a western ethic, to be part of a Judeo-Christian society.
Kasich has managed to remain under the radar thus far in the presidential primaries, thanks to his undeserved reputation as a moderate republican.
The idea that the Ohio governor is somehow less insane than other GOP candidates competing for the party s nomination is simply absurd.Kasich is clearly just as dangerous and extreme as his republican rivals, maybe more so, given his ability to pass himself off as a middle-of-the-road candidate.
In case you have any doubts, listen to Kasich explain his idea for a government-sponsored propaganda agency, which would promote Christianity not only around the world but right here in the United States, as well.Here s video of the interview, via NBC News.Kasich likes to hype himself as a small government republican.Yet during this interview, Kasich made it clear that he is dead-serious about creating an agency that would not just expand government, it would authorize government to become the official, worldwide distributor of Christian propaganda.In order to keep government from ever getting involved in the distribution of religious propaganda, the First Amendment of the United States Constitution strictly forbids government from passing any law establishing, prohibiting or promoting any religion.Kasich s idea for creating a government agency that would distribute Christian propaganda, at the expense of taxpayers, is exactly the kind of thing the First Amendment was designed to keep the government from doing.While on the surface, there may seem to be a difference between one republican candidate and the next, don t believe it.Every one of these right wing nuts is intent on turning the U.S. government into the distribution and enforcement arm of the Christian church.John Kasich is no less extreme than Ted Cruz, a Christian Dominionist who wants to seize every aspect of society, from government to education to the media, in order to further his own religious beliefs.And Kasich and Cruz are no more extreme than Marco Rubio, who declared in a recent campaign ad that our goal is eternity, before going on to quote a bunch of random Bible verses, which he s obviously sure will help get him elected.While all of the 2016 republican candidates may be well-suited to open their own mega-churches or launch a right wing radio program, not a single one of them is fit to become the next president of the United States.Featured image from video screen capture via NBC News
