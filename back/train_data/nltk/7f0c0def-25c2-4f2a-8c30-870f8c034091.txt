reuters hurricane irma deadly devastate force nature rapidly coalesce lowpressure blip west africa one powerful atlantic storm record follow unhindered atmospheric path feed unusually warm sea
combination many factor expert say friday set stage irma formation help storm achieve full thermodynamic potential create monster tropical cyclone wreak havoc eastern caribbean may inflict widespread damage florida
get lucky say john knaff meteorologist physical scientist national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa
storm goldilocks environment major hurricane
bad luck whoever path go
brian kahn atmospheric scientist cloud specialist nasa jet propulsion laboratory call ocean condition spawn irma absolutely ideal
balmy water temperature along irma trajectory run deep beneath surface slightly higher normal much degree fahrenheit place provide ample fuel storm development scientist say
irma also encounter little interference form wind shear sudden change vertical wind velocity blunt storm intensity advance 10 18 mile per hour ideal pace hurricane
fortuitous path least resistance essentially ordain wellplaced atmospheric ridge high pressure steer storm happenstance caribbean warmest water well area mostly devoid wind shear
result gargantuan storm rapidly grow category 5 top saffirsimpson scale hurricane strength sustained wind 185 mile per hour forceful ever document open atlantic
also rank one five atlantic hurricane know achieve wind speed past 82 year
irma lash cuba bahamas drive toward florida friday hit eastern caribbean treesnapping wind torrential rain pound surf kill least 21 people leave catastrophic destruction wake
friday night irma wind diminish 155 mile per hour 250 kph downgrade category 4 storm though still consider extremely dangerous
tiny island directly cross irma like barbuda st martin little weaken storm intensity could measurably diminish close encounter larger land mass cuba en route u mainland scientist say
powerful irma may end dampen another category 4 storm wake hurricane jose like irma originate west coast africa follow similar course
water already ply irma could leave bit cooler rob jose potential energy outflow irma could produce wind shear jose say scott braun research meteorologist nasa goddard space flight center
knaff say surprise advent irma coincide precise peak atlantic hurricane season
much le certain role global climate humaninduced atmospheric increase heattrapping greenhouse gas scientist say
consensus climate change raise sea level likely exacerbate hurricane storm surge
rise ocean temperature clearly document well
research divide whether global warming make tropical cyclone frequent though data climate modeling suggest higher probability stronger wetter hurricane atlantic occur say tom knutson climate research scientist noaa
think base model simulation climate change effect making storm slightly intense higher rainfall rate change huge yet clearly detect observation say
