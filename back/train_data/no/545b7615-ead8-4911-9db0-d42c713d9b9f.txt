donald trump really should have just apologized or kept his mouth shut.on tuesday , trump told a crowd in north carolina that the only way to stop hillary clinton from nominating judges to the supreme court is for second amendment nuts to gun her down .
hillary wants to abolish , essentially abolish , the second amendment , trump said .
by the way , and if she gets to pick her judges , nothing you can do , folks .
although the second amendment people , maybe there is , i don t know .
the remark was bad enough that even the secret service was forced to respond , which is totally unprecedented.trump has since been roundly criticized for the remarks but actually took to twitter to do some serious spinning , going so far as to claim that he said something else entirely.media desperate to distract from clinton s anti-2a stance .
i said pro-2a citizens must organize and get out vote to save our constitution !
