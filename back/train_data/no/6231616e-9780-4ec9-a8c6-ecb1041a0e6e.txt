it s too bad the darn russians and president-elect trump , who the media insisted would never win the election , are having such a negative impact on such an upstanding charity the foundation has already started reaching out to donors to ask for money , the new york post reports .
clinton foundation chairman bruce lindsey announced in an email to supporters wednesday that former president bill clinton would personally match donations up to $ 200,000 before the end of the year .
as we prepare for a new year , president clinton and chelsea remain dedicated to our work providing everyone a chance to succeed , lindsey wrote in the email .
your contribution before the end of the year is so important that president clinton is personally tripling every gift to the foundation , up to $ 200,000 .
interestingly , hillary s name is nowhere to be found.the fbi is still investigating the clinton foundation for corruption and money laundering .
it was a hot topic during the presidential race ; donald trump repeatedly described the foundation as a criminal enterprise .
emails published by wikileaks exposed questionable behavior at the foundation , such as the qatari government presenting bill clinton with a $ 1 million check for his birthday.in the email to foundation supporters , lindsey dismissed allegations of wrongdoing , describing the foundation as a force for good in this world .
we ll see in the coming months and years if the foundation s sketchy donors were truly committing to saving the world , or if they just saw the foundation as an easy way to purchase influence and access to power .
