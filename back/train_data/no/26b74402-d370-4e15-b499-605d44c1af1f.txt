moscow ( reuters ) - russia will not hand over to montenegro the person wanted by the balkan nation as a suspect in a coup attempt , the ria news agency cited the russian prosecutor general s office as saying on wednesday .
montenegro says a group of serb and russian nationalists had a plan to attack state institutions on the day of an election last year and kill then-prime minister milo djukanovic , who held the post for a total of 21 years .
the kremlin has dismissed the accusation as absurd .
the russian prosecutor-general s office said it had refused to hand over to montenegro the person , who it identified as ananie nikic , because he had earlier been given refugee status by moscow .
