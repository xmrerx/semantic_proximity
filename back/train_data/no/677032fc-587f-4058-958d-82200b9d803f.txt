nairobi ( reuters ) - the united states diplomatic mission in somalia has directed all non-essential staff to leave the capital mogadishu , saying it had received a specific threat against its employees .
the move came a day after washington carried out its first air strikes against islamic state militants in the country , in raids it said killed several terrorists .
due to specific threat information against u.s. personnel on the mogadishu international airport , the u.s. mission to somalia has directed its non-essential u.s. citizen employees to depart mogadishu until further notice , said a statement .
it did not give further details .
islamic state has been gathering recruits in the region , but it remains a small player compared to the al shabaab group .
last month , a group loyal to islamic state seized a small port town in somalia s semi-autonomous puntland region .
al shabaab is linked to islamic state s rival al qaeda and once controlled much of somalia .
the group aims to drive out international peacekeepers , topple somalia s western-backed government and impose its strict version of islam on the horn of africa state .
the united states has occasionally carried out strikes against al shabaab .
more than 350 people were killed in twin bombings in mogadishu last month blamed on the group .
