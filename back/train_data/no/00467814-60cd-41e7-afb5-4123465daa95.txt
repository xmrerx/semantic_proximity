( reuters ) - republican presidential candidate donald trump said on friday he favored the united states reaching trade agreements with individual countries as opposed to multilateral accords like the trans-pacific partnership .
trump , who is leading in the race for the republican nomination for president , has made his opposition to trade deals like the 12-nation tpp and the north american free trade agreement a centerpiece of his campaign toward the nov. 8 vote .
“ to do these deals where they wrap them up and they put 12 countries in one .
tpp is an example .
i want individual trade deals with individual countries , ” trump told a palm beach , florida , news conference ahead of the state ’ s nominating contest on tuesday .
“ some countries treat us better than others .
some are worse , ” he said .
“ china will take advantage of tpp .
it ’ s not in it now but believe me they come through the back door .
they are watching it so closely , ” said trump , a real estate developer .
the deal was reached in october .
trump said he favored free trade but it must be “ fair. ” he said nafta had cost many americans their jobs and tpp , which must be ratified by congress , would do the same .
the united states already has bilateral trade deals with 20 countries , including canada , israel , mexico , peru , singapore and south korea .
