Jimmy Kimmel couldn t stop laughing as Bill Maher repeatedly mocked the GOP.During an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Tuesday night, Real Time host Bill Maher made an appearance to talk about the New Hampshire primary and what he would do if he had no choice but to vote for one Republican candidate in the field.
I d kill myself, Maher simply stated.Maher explained that the United States would be a horrible place to live under Republican control, especially for women.
The nearest abortion clinic will be in London!
he said.Then Maher got the chance to talk about the candidates he doesn t like, and Ted Cruz was at the top of the list.
Ted Cruz is always the worst, Maher said.
He is smart and evil.
The other ones are true dummies, like Rubio, he doesn t know what he s talking about, he just says the words.
But Ted Cruz is diabolical.
He s smart.
This is what I really hate about this and this is what a true cynic is he s smart, but he knows what to say to his dummy base that they will believe.
Maher even gave an example.
Cruz once told his dummy base that he was a fan of classic rock prior to 9/11, but said he leaned more toward country music after the towers fell.
It was a perfect example of Cruz pandering to the stupid rednecks who dominate the conservative base today.Here s the video via YouTube.Maher also reiterated his support of Bernie Sanders, but urged Democrats to vote for Hillary Clinton should she become the nominee because not doing so could send a Republican to the White House, which would doom our nation to at least four years of hell as the GOP passes every policy they ve ever desired to force upon us.
