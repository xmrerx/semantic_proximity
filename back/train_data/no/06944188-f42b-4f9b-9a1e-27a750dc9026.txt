abuja ( reuters ) - nigeria has canceled its weekly cabinet meeting for the second time since president muhammadu buhari returned from three months of medical leave in britain .
information minister lai mohammed said in a statement wednesday s meeting would not take place due to inadequate time to prepare the documents .
buhari canceled the first cabinet meeting following his return on aug. 19 , raising concerns that the president , criticized for inertia by his opponents , was returning to his former ways , when he worked from home and missed ministerial meetings .
but the 74-year-old president , who has been working from home since his return , last week presided over his first cabinet meeting since taking leave for an unspecified ailment .
the refusal to disclose details of his illness has caused speculation about whether he is well enough to run africa s most populous country and biggest economy .
mohammed s statement said a two-day public holiday on friday and monday to mark the islamic eid-el-kabir celebrations had left little time to prepare for the weekly meeting .
