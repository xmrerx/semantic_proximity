Donald Trump has been described by many as sounding like a comic book villain come to life, and now veteran Star Wars icon Mark Hamill just proved it to the entire world.Writer Matt Oswalt (brother of comedian Patton Oswalt) pointed out on Twitter that Trump s weird-sounding New Year s tweet message sounded just like something The Joker would say right before releasing a swarm of killer bees into Gotham.

After playing Luke Skywalker (of course) in the original Star Wars trilogy (A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi), Mark Hamill has for years led a double life as the Joker.
He has appeared in several Batman and DC Comics animated TV shows, movies, and video games voicing the deranged serial killer clown.And now he is using his voiceover magic for something truly useful, mocking Trump.After Oswalt s message, Hamill posted a tweet with an audio clip attached of him reading Trump as if he were the Joker:The Trumpster quote #1#ANewJeersToast https://t.co/qZQEGU18r6 Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) January 8, 2017The hilarious tweet went viral right away, and it scarily shows how much of a matchup there is between the Clown Prince of Crime and the Clownish Politician.
Hamill labeled his audio clip as quote #1 so there will obviously be some clamor for a followup, perhaps even an animated Trump/Joker matchup of some sort?Oswalt also suggested what sounds like a multi-million dollar idea: BILLION DOLLAR IDEA: an App that you can feed every Trump tweet into that plays it back in @HamillHimself Joker voice.
You re welcome.
It s sad that America will have to suffer for at least four years under a leader who clearly would be right at home inside a comic book, but he is already showing us that he will be a boon to comedians and other creatives, to allow us to deal with the havoc he wreaks.
