We all already know that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is a loose cannon, especially when it comes to his Twitter habits.
Tuesday night during the vice presidential debate was no different.Trump began the night by already assuming CNN is against him, so he declared he d turn to the Republican media branch, Fox News.Wow, @CNN is so negative.
Their panel is a joke, biased and very dumb.
I'm turning to @FoxNews where we get a fair shake!
Mike will do great Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2016From there he let everyone know (at least we had a warning this time) that he was about to light up Twitter with his repeated nonsense.I will be live-tweeting the V.P.
Debate.
Very exciting!
MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2016Then, he told us to enjoy his live-tweeting, because of course he did.Here we go Enjoy!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2016Things started decent enough, with Trump even throwing both his running mate Mike Pence and Hillary Clinton s running mate Tim Kaine a compliment.Both are looking good!
Now we begin!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2016Then the sh*t started to hit the screen:"@RoadkingL: @mike_pence Wow, Kaine couldn't go 12 seconds without a lie.
Marines and military are scared of the liar running.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2016Then before the debate was even over:Mike Pence won big.
We should all be proud of Mike!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 5, 2016Let s put it this way, Trump still probably thinks he won his debate with Hillary as well.
And while Pence did as good of a job as he could, staying calm, etc.
while Kaine was feistier, he still couldn t defend Trump s blatant misogyny and racism.
Hell, Pence himself is a misogynist, against the LGBT community, and fiercely anti-worker and anti-immigrant.All in all, this tweetstorm during the VP debate shows us, yet again, how ill-suited Trump is for the office of the presidency and simply isn t fit to lead.Featured Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images, Twitter
