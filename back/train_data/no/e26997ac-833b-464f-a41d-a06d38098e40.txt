jerusalem ( reuters ) - about 20,000 israelis demonstrated in tel aviv on saturday against government corruption and prime minister benjamin netanyahu who is under criminal investigation over allegations of abuse of office .
the demonstration was by far the largest of weekly anti-corruption protests sparked by corruption allegations against netanyahu , who denies any wrongdoing .
the four-term leader is suspected of involvement in two cases .
the first involves receiving gifts from wealthy businessmen and the second involves negotiating a deal with a newspaper owner for better coverage in return for curbs on a rival daily .
saturday s protest was prompted by a draft law expected to be ratified by parliament next week , which would bar police from publishing its findings in two investigations of netanyahu .
a reuters cameraman and israeli media put the number of demonstrators at about 20,000 .
police would not provide an official estimate .
critics say the draft law is a blatant attempt to protect netanyahu and keep the public in the dark about his investigation .
supporters of the legislation say it is meant to protect suspects rights .
netanyahu has said he has no interest in promoting personal legislation but he has not ordered its two sponsors , close confidants in his likud party , to withdraw the bill .
netanyahu has described himself as a victim of a political witch hunt and said of the cases against him : there will be nothing because there is nothing .
if charged , he would come under heavy pressure to resign or could call an election to test whether he still had a mandate .
