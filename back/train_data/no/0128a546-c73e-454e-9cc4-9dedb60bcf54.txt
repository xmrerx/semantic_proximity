budapest ( reuters ) - hungary remains firmly opposed to illegal immigration and the european union should focus efforts on protecting its external borders , foreign minister peter szijjarto said about an estonian compromise proposal on asylum-seekers .
hungary s view on migration is clear and rock steady : we think illegal immigration is dangerous .
because of illegal immigration , europe has never had to face the kind of terror threat it faces now , szijjarto told a news conference with ministers and officials from eastern and southern europe , in response to a question .
under the estonian plan , the executive european commission would determine fair shares of asylum-seekers that countries would be expected to take in at their own borders - largely based on their population and wealth .
but it would trigger an early warning if arrivals looked about to test such levels .
szijjarto said any encouragement for further migrant arrivals was against europe s interests , adding that the only solution acceptable to budapest was that illegal immigration should be stopped , preferably as far outside the eu s borders as possible .
