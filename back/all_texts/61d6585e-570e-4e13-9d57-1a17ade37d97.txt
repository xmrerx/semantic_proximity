Remember when Fox host Sean Hannity directly asked Donald Trump if he would ever accept money from a country like Saudi Arabia that treats women, Christians, and Jews like shit and he said he wouldn t?Hannity began by claiming that the Clinton Foundation accepted $25 million from the Saudi Arabian government and Trump has repeatedly demanded that the charity give the money back.But Trump nor Hannity have any proof of their claim.
And Politifact could not find any evidence that Hillary Clinton personally solicited funds from the Saudis.
Saudi Arabia did donate at least $10 million to the foundation to contribute to the building of the Clinton presidential library, but the Saudis also donated the same amount toward building the George H. W. Bush library.Politifact further noted that the Saudi government never donated any money to the foundation while Hillary Clinton served as Secretary of State, thus undermining Trump s accusations that Hillary was involved in a pay-to-play scheme with Saudi Arabia.But while Trump whined about the Clinton Foundation s relationship with the Saudis, he told Hannity that he wouldn t take money from them.Here s the video via YouTube just to jog your memory.Well, it turns out that Trump lied.Back in 2001, the Republican nominee did big business with Saudi Arabia and had absolutely no problem doing so.According to the New York Daily News,Trump sold the 45th floor of Trump World Tower to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for $4.5 million The five apartments included 10 bedrooms and 13 bathrooms at the time of the sale, and had yearly common charges of $85,585 for building amenities If those common charges remain the same, Trump was paid at least $5.7 million by the Saudi government since 2001.So while Trump attacks Hillary over donations made to the Clinton Foundation, he has literally been doing business with the Saudi government and taking millions of dollars from them since 2001.This is yet another example of how Trump doesn t practice what he preaches to his conservative fans.It s been revealed that Trump tried to do business with Fidel Castro s Cuba in direct violation of the embargo that has been in place for decades in response to Cuba s human rights record.
Trump also does business with China by purchasing steel and other metals from companies there instead of companies in the United States, thus helping China topple American companies while screwing over American workers.
Trump also furnishes his hotels with goods not made in the USA and even offers Qurans to any guest who requests one despite bashing Islam on the campaign trail.In short, Donald Trump is a lying hypocrite as usual.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images
