This is a MUST WATCH and SHARE!If anyone s wondering why the media won t give up their obsession (fantasy) that somehow President Trump colluded with Russia to win the election, you only have to watch this pathetic video montage of reactions by so-called journalists to their worst nightmare coming true on November 8, 2016.There is no lie too big to push, no bar too low to slither under.
The media is in an all-out war with President Trump and anyone who dares to support him, and it all started on this night:Just love watching this still.
These are supposedly all objective, responsible journalists pic.twitter.com/Vmq1CK24ZC James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) August 6, 2017James Woods is not only a brilliant actor, he s also an outspoken conservative who goes out of his way on social media to expose the very people most of his friends in the entertainment business embrace.
Kudos to James Woods for having the courage to take on the left, while living in the shark infested waters of liberal Hollywood
