sydney ( reuters ) - australia s domestic spy chief has warned that universities need to be very conscious of foreign interference in an apparent reference to china s perceived undercover influence on campuses .
australian security intelligence organisation director-general duncan lewis told politicians in canberra late on tuesday that espionage and foreign interference were an insidious threat .
lewis said foreign powers were clandestinely seeking to shape the opinion of the australian public , media organizations and government officials in order to advance their countries own political objectives .
lewis did not specifically name china in his late night testimony to a parliamentary inquiry , but when questioned about china s involvement , he said he strongly identified with comments made by a senior government official this month that universities should protect themselves from chinese influence .
asked last week about the communist party s overseas activities in places like australia , a senior official said chinese people living overseas had to respect the laws of the countries in which they lived .
china is australia s largest trading partner , with business spurred by a wide-ranging china-australia free trade agreement signed in 2015 .
relations between australia and china have been tested in recent months after the united states , japan and australia voiced concerns over beijing s unilateral actions in the disputed south china sea , including continued artificial land building .
