Our White House is currently occupied by someone who s likely certifiably insane, yet for many on both the right and the left, the real travesty is that Trump s predecessor is *gasp* earning a lot of money in speaking fees, just like just about every white male former president in the last 40 years.The news that former President Barack Obama will reportedly accept $400,000 to give a speech to Wall Street investment bank Cantor Fitzgerald has inspired a strange paroxysm of rage from writers on the center-left.
Obama s $400,000 Wall Street speaking fee will undermine everything he believes in, Vox s Matt Yglesias proclaimed.
Obama and Bill Clinton biographer David Maraniss said the 44th president does not need the money and should not accept it.
Others noted the unseemliness of the fee at a time of income inequality and seemingly rampant populism, especially since Barack and Michelle Obama have already struck insanely lucrative book deals.Even Elizabeth Warren was troubled by Obama s speaking fees.
Bernie Sanders called the fees distasteful.
Well, everyone can relax now.
On Wednesday it was announced that the Obamas would be giving that amount and far more to help youth in Obama s adopted hometown of Chicago.
One of the things that we ll be starting this year is Michelle and I are personally going to donate $2 million to our summer jobs programs here in the community, he said at the South Shore Cultural Center.
[It s] so that right away young people can get to work and we can start providing opportunities to all of them.
Obama is expected to use the center as he focuses on issues such as criminal justice reform and education for underprivileged children now that he has left office.
Social media was quick to notice that the Obamas are literally donating five times what he will earn for that one speaking fee.THIS is President Obama.
Compassion & class.
FIVE times his speaking fee.
The @GOP can now shut the hell up.

Crickets.

?liberal bitch?
(@ALiberalLady) May 3, 2017Of course, there s also the fact that President Obama is retired.
He can spend the rest of his days Twitter trolling Donald Trump and passing out Kenyan flags and it would be perfectly within his rights.
But that s not who Obama is.
As this proves, he still has his principles and he s still managing to kick everyone s ass in his game of three-dimensional chess.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images.
