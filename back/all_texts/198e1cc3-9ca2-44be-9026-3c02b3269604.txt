While speaking at the G-7 Summit in Shima, Japan, President Obama directly called Trump out for his shenanigans and let everyone know that world leaders are rattled by Trump s presumptive Republican presidential nomination.Obama also noted Trump s clear priorities, which is that he seems to care more about sending out tweets and Twitter than actually focusing on real-world issues that will have a direct impact on not only the nation, but the entire world.The president said: I think it s fair to say they are surprised by the Republican nominee, they are not sure how seriously to take some of his pronouncements, but they re rattled by him, and for good reason A lot of the proposals that he s made display either ignorance of world affairs or a cavalier attitude or an interest in getting tweets and headlines instead of actually thinking through what it is that s required to keep America safe, secure and prosperous, and what s required to keep the world on an even keel.
The president implying Trump has an ignorance of world affairs is being too nice.
Trump is utterly naive when it comes to foreign policy and diplomacy, and is, quite literally, a liability to overall geopolitics and international security.He also added: Things don t roll together so well if the United States is not making good decisions.
Trump, of course, seemed flattered that the president would say that the world is rattled by is nomination, saying that s good that the world is mortified of him having the potential to be leader of the free world.The last thing the world needs is another bully.Now, more than ever, we as a nation to come together to make sure Donald Trump gets nowhere near the Oval Office.
Not just for us, but for the entire world.
