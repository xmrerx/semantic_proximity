sarah huckabee sanders has taken control of the media and is no longer allowing them to push a false narrative when it comes to president trump and a non-existant russian connection.time and time again , sanders has proven she s no pushover when it comes to the rabid leftist media who would love nothing more than to be able to sabotage her during her press briefings .
yesterday was no exception .
with a smile on her face , sanders called out the media for ignoring the biggest story of the day .
the one day there might have been a question on russia , there wasn t. often , we have a lot of uh , media with russia first , and uh , but today , there was public testimony that further discredited the phony dossier that s been the source of so much of the fake news and conspiracy theories .
and we learned that the firm that produced it was also being paid by the russians .
this is yet the latest piece of evidence that vindicates what the president has said that this is just a witch hunt and a hoax .
and its a shame that the president and the country have had to go through this charade .
the entire russia hoax implodes just as the scandal of the year ( the awan brothers ) breaks .
bad week for fake news !
