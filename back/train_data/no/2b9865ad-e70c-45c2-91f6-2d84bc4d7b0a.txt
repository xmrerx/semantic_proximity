moscow ( reuters ) - vatican secretary of state cardinal pietro parolin said on tuesday that there was positive momentum behind the idea of pope francis visiting russia , but suggested there was more work to be done if it were to happen .
parolin , speaking at a joint news conference in moscow alongside russian foreign minister sergei lavrov , did not give any date for such a possible visit .
the eastern and western branches of christianity split apart in 1054 .
the pope , leader of the world s 1.2 billion catholics , is seeking to improve ties , and last year in cuba held what was the first ever meeting between a roman catholic pope and a russian orthodox patriarch .
parolin said he had also used his talks in the russian capital to also raise certain difficulties faced by the catholic church in russia .
he said that moscow and the vatican disagreed about the plight of christians in certain parts of the world .
he did not elaborate .
parolin , who is due later on tuesday to meet patriarch kirill , the head of the russian orthodox church , said he also believed russia could play an important role when it came to helping solve a crisis in venezuela because of its close relations with caracas .
