helsinki ( reuters ) - lithuania expects nato to reach an agreement next year to shield baltic countries with air defenses , plugging a gap in its security against russia , its defense minister said on tuesday .
since russia annexed the crimea peninsula from ukraine in 2014 and began providing weapons and troops to separatist rebels in eastern ukraine , nato has send more forces to the baltics , eastern poland and around the black sea .
lithuania , which borders the russian region of kaliningrad , wants nato to permanently deploy anti-aircraft weapons in the baltics or poland a move seen by moscow as an unjustified military build-up on its borders .
we expect so , defense minister raimundas karoblis told reuters when asked if he saw an agreement shaping up for the nato summit in 2018 .
air defense is one of the issues which we need to address .
we also need to look at other domains , like nato command structure reform , we need to move forward on all on these aspects , he said , also calling for nato to strengthen maritime defenses in the baltics .
karoblis spoke in helsinki after meeting his counterparts from northern group countries , including the nordic and baltic states , britain , germany , poland and the netherlands .
u.s. secretary of defence jim mattis also joined the meeting .
karoblis said exercises should be considered by nato after russia s zapad war games unnerved the west in september .
mattis told reporters after the meeting that the 12 nations stood together to reaffirm territorial integrity .
it is clear that one nation thinks it holds some kind of a veto or strong influence , over others , that is russia .
the country s name came up repeatedly , over the last 48 hours , he said .
