this is the definition of insanity-doing the same thing over and over .
we just need a congress strong enough to stop the madness.for over 30 years , sovereign nations , particularly in the west have been buying votes by offering social payments in the form of welfare.the ridiculousness of this should not be lost on anyone .
politicians , in order to be elected , promise to allocate taxpayer funds on social programs that will benefit said taxpayers down the road ( we re simply talking about social spending , not infrastructure or other costs ) .the concept that taxpayers might simply just keep the money to begin with never enters the equation .
and because everyone believes that they are somehow spending someone else s money , they play along.when you believe that you are spending someone else s money , it s very easy to write a blank check , which is precisely what western nations have been doing for years , promising everyone a safe and secure retirement without ever bothering to see where the money would come from.when actual bills came due to fund this stuff , governments quickly discovered that current tax revenues couldn t cover it so they issued sovereign debt to make up the difference.and so the bond bubble was created.the large banks , that have a monopoly on managing sovereign debt auctions , were only too happy to play along with this .
the reasons are as follows:1 ) they can use these alleged risk-free assets as collateral to backstop tens of trillions worth of derivatives trades .
a $ 1 million investment in your typical us treasury can backstop over $ 15 million worth of derivatives if not more .
the profits from the derivatives markets remains a primary source of revenue for the banks.2 ) sovereign governments are only too happy to bail out the big banks if the stuff ever hits the fan on the trades that are backstopped by the sovereign debt ( see 2006 onwards ) .
since the banks are the ones holding the sovereign debt , they can always threaten to dump bonds , which would render the whole social welfare ponzi bankrupt ( see what happened in europe when sovereign bonds collapsed in 2011-2012 ) .3 ) in a debt-based financial system such as the current one , sovereign bonds are the senior most assets in the system .
those who own these in bulk are at the top of the financial food chain in terms of financial , economic , and political clout.since it was rarely if ever a problem to issue sovereign debt , governments kept promising future payments that they didn t have until we reach today : the point at which most western nations are sporting debt to gdp ratios well north of 300 % when you consider unfunded liabilities ( the social spending programs mentioned earlier ) .now , cutting social spending is usually considered political suicide ( after all , the voters put you in office in the first place based on you promising to pay them welfare payments down the road ) .
so rather than default on the social contract made with voters , the political class will simply push to issue more debt to finance old debt that is coming due.the us did precisely this in the fourth quarter of 2014 , issuing over $ 1 trillion in new debt simply to pay back old debt that was coming due.read more : zero hedge
