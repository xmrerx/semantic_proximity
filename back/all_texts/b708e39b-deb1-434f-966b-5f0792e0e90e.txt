Donald Trump just met with the Russian ambassador who is at the center of his scandal and made sure no American reporters were there to cover their conversation.If Trump offered the Russians anything in return for helping him win the election, Wednesday s meeting with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak was the prime opportunity to give them their reward.Kislyak, as you may recall, is the Russian official who spoke with Michael Flynn during the transition.
Kislyak also met with Jeff Sessions, who did not disclose the meeting during his confirmation hearing prior to being confirmed as Attorney General.
Sessions has since recused himself from the Russia investigation.Kislyak is the central Russian figure involved in Trump s Russia scandal, yet Trump gladly met with him in private on Wednesday, the day after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey as the FBI continues to investigate Trump s collusion with Russia.
But Trump went a step further by barring American media from covering the meeting, preferring to give Russian state media (also known as Vladimir Putin s propaganda machine) access instead.The Russian Embassy posted a photo of the meeting on Twitter.Ambassador Kislyak and President Trump / .

(@RusEmbUSA) May 10, 2017That s when Washington Post reporter Glenn Kessler pointed out that American media were excluded from the Oval Office meeting.NO US press allowed in with meeting with @potus so we have to rely on images from Russian state media https://t.co/l4KzhHq8s6 Glenn Kessler (@GlennKesslerWP) May 10, 2017So Donald Trump basically held a secret meeting with the Russian official most involved in his Russia scandal and made sure that the media in the United States could not be in the room.
Meanwhile, Russian state media was allowed to be there and take what amounts to propaganda photos.
And we all know that Russian state media won t give us an accurate account of what Trump and Kislyak talked about.They could have talked about the Russia scandal and investigation and no one will ever know about.Trump s disdain for the free press has just reached a new low, and Twitter ripped his throat out for it.

Drew Gibson (@SuppressThis) May 10, 2017@RusEmbUSA How much $$$ did Trump get for firing Comey?
He s got a huge grin on his face, and the only thing that makes him happy is $$$.
