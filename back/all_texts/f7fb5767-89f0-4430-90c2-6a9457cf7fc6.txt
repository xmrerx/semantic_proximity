Just when you thought Kentucky County Clerk Kim Davis would drift off into obscurity (as she should) she reemerges just as hate-filled and full of drivel as ever during an interview with Frank Wright of D. James Kennedy Ministries.
Neither of these people understand how the Constitution works as supreme law of the land.Davis still seems to believe that the laws of the Bible reign supreme over her actions serving the public.She said: I was obeying my law I had couples bring in the whole Supreme Court ruling and I said, You know, I really don t need to see this because that s not a law, that s a ruling [and they d say] Well, why won t you do this?
And so then I go to the Bible and I d tell them, [and they d respond,] Don t be reading me the Bible.
Well, you asked why I couldn t issue you a marriage license and I m explaining to you, I m showing you why I cannot.
They didn t want to hear that though.
They wanted to shove that paper down my throat and make me eat it for my dinner.
Actually, Kim, the Bible has nothing to do with your job and serving the public.
If you re to serve the public as your job requires you to do, you are to abide by the law, including federal law, which in this case is the 14th Amendment of the United States Constitution offering equal protections to all citizens, not just the ones that fit your standard under your religion.
If you don t want to do your job, might I suggest you resign.
You are free to worship as you choose on your own time, but when it comes to restricting others equal protections, you are disobeying the Constitution which was made clear by the Supreme Court.
They re not writing new laws to tell you what to do, they are upholding the ones written upon our nation s founding.
