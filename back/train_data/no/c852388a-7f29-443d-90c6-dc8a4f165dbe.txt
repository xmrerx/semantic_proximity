zagreb ( reuters ) - the croatian government survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote early on saturday that the opposition demanded over the handling of a debt crisis at the country s largest private firm agrokor [ agrok.ul ] .
in the vote , which followed 12 hours of a parliamentary debate , 59 deputies in the 151-seat parliament were in favor of the removal of the conservative-led cabinet , while 78 were opposed to it .
the no-confidence motion came as the opposition led by the social democrats said a liquidity loan agreed in recent months with creditors , including foreign investment funds , to finance agrokor s operations through a 15-month period of restructuring lacked transparency and favored some creditors .
the analysts expected the motion to fail as the center-right cabinet comprising the conservatives and the liberals has a small but firm parliamentary majority .
the government introduced an emergency law last april to step in because food group agrokor , the largest employer in the balkans , faced a debt and liquidity crisis that threatened to destabilize the country s economy .
the opposition said that the loan deal was not transparent and appeared to favor some creditors .
the government and agrokor s crisis manager ante ramljak rejected the accusations .
