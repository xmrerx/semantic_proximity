( reuters ) - detroit mayor mike duggan proposed a $ 2.6 billion fiscal 2017 budget on thursday that he said could be the city ’ s ticket to removing state oversight of its finances .
he said the all-funds budget , which includes $ 1.077 billion of general fund spending , would mark the third-straight balanced budget for the city , which exited the biggest-ever municipal bankruptcy in december 2014 .
a financial review commission was created under michigan law to oversee a post-bankruptcy detroit until it reaches certain benchmarks .
“ if we can finish the 2017 fiscal year with a balanced budget and we ’ re paying our bills and meeting some other conditions that i believe we ’ ll meet , we will be able to get out of the financial review commission control period , ” duggan told the city council .
he added the goal is to shed state oversight by january 2018 .
if the city ends fiscal 2017 with a deficit , the mayor said detroit would have to start a new three-year balanced budget cycle .
detroit chief financial officer john hill said the budget for the fiscal year that begins july 1 is based on conservative revenue estimates that could be hurt if the state cuts revenue sharing to local governments to deal with costs for the ongoing lead-tainted water crisis in flint .
the mayor said he plans to tap $ 50 million in unused , voter-approved bond proceeds dating as far back as 1987 for various projects .
duggan also addressed a $ 490 million increase in the unfunded liability for detroit ’ s two pension funds caused by the use of outdated mortality tables by the city ’ s bankruptcy consultants .
the situation has become “ pretty adversarial ” with the consultants , who have been told by the city not to destroy any of the documents they took with them , according to the mayor .
he cautioned the council that a malpractice lawsuit against the consultants would be difficult to win .
