hour one of the msnbc morning show began typically enough with mika and joe .
the assembled gang could barely contain their glee at the prospect of damning testimony from james comey .
that all set the stage for a typical mika brzezinski tirade that was honestly one of the most disgusting assaults on president trump yet .
it s unhinged hate ! https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=vzouchs22aw i think trump is such a narcissist , it s possible he is mentally ill in a way and this is on the table , i said it months ago and now everyone is starting to say it like it s new , and it s ok to say .
he s not well , she said .
at the very least , he s not well .
and he s so narcissistic he does not believe the rules apply to him , and that s where the ignorance label may apply because this is a man who says he can grab women anywhere because he s famous .
then something very curious happened.scarborough looked off camera and can be heard saying , what s that ?
wow , then willie geist showed him something and the two started laughing .
then a clearly not listening scarborough , banged the table .
stop right there , he laughed i need an eject button .
he posted it ?
scarborough appeared to ask someone else ? brzezinski finally realized that nobody was listening to her and demanded an explanation .
nothing i have said is crazy , she said .
we ll talk about it in the break , said scarborough barely able to get it out through his own laugher.the show soon went to break .
when it returned scarborough joked about keeping it in the guard rails .
brzezinski appeared to offer an explanation of her actions .
i am keeping it in the guard rails .
everything i ve said you all have thought and you know and you ve said in your own way .
you re going to talk to me about a filter ?
she snapped at scarborough .
yes , he said .
