abuja ( reuters ) - a key community leader from nigeria s tense delta oil-producing region called on militants on sunday not to resume their attacks until they had further time to negotiate their demands with the government .
chief edwin clark , who leads the pan niger delta forum ( pandef ) , which has been holding peace talks with the government since last year , called on the niger delta avengers militant group to be patient .
the avengers , whose attacks last year wrought havoc on the nation s oil output , promised on friday a brutish , brutal and bloody return to violence because they said they had lost faith in local leaders to get what they wanted from the government .
this is not the time to resume hostilities , clark said in a statement issued by the presidential amnesty programme .
it is true that the federal government has not been quite serious about the negotiations , but we are asking the niger delta avengers to maintain the peace .
he added that pandef was sending a delegation to meet the group s leaders .
the avengers , like many in the niger delta , say they want a greater share of nigeria s energy wealth to stay in the impoverished swampland region , which produces the bulk of the oil but is largely underdeveloped .
the statement came after a government delegation led by brigadier general paul boroh , special adviser to the president on the niger delta , visited clark at his abuja home on sunday .
clark said boroh assured him that the talks were back on track , and that pandef leaders would meet soon in warri .
the 2016 attacks slashed oil output to close to 1 million barrels per day from roughly 2.2 million bpd .
that along with low oil prices pushed the nation into its first recession in 25 years .
