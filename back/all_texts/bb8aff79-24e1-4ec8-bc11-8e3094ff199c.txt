BEIRUT (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Saturday received members of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri s family in Paris, days after intervening to facilitate Hariri s departure from Saudi Arabia, Hariri s press office said.
Hariri resigned as prime minister in a video broadcast from Riyadh on Nov. 4.
After intervention by France he returned to Lebanon this week and postponed his resignation at the request of Lebanese President Michel Aoun while a dialogue takes place.
Top Lebanese officials have said Riyadh was holding Hariri against his will and forced him to resign.
Saudi Arabia has denied this.
Hariri s office said his wife Lara, daughter Louloua and one of his two sons, Abdelaziz, arrived in France on Thursday for a holiday and will stay in Paris for a few days.
Hariri is a dual Saudi-Lebanese citizen and the two children attend schools in Saudi.
Hariri thanked Macron and his wife on Twitter for inviting them to the Elysee Palace.
