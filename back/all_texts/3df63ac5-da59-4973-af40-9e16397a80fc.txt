As Republicans gather for the first day of their clown show also known as their convention a glaring and telling detail rests in the GOP platform: the preservation of Citizens United and big money in our national politics.On the other side, however, Democrats are committed to overturning the disastrous Supreme Court decision that has allowed a total pollution of our system of politics.
And the party s nominee for President of the United States, Hillary Clinton, is making it priority number one.In a video posted at the progressive gathering Netroots Nation in St. Louis, Missouri, Clinton pledged her support for a constitutional amendment that would overturn the 2010 decision, and will push for such an amendment in her first 30 days should she be elected.The former secretary also promised to enact an executive order that would require all government contractors to disclose their campaign contributions and require the Securities and Exchange Commission to require all publicly traded companies to disclose their contributions as well.The chances of a constitutional amendment overrunning Citizens United are slim should the House and the Senate remain Republican controlled.
But polls show the public overwhelmingly wants money out of politics.
Then again, the overwhelming majority of the public supports common sense gun legislation but that hasn t convinced the Republicans to do anything.One of the biggest arguments in the Democratic Primary was the use of money in politics.
While both candidates, including Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, supported a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, it was Clinton who received major backlash from progressives over hefty Super PAC contributions.
CBS reported last month that her biggest PAC contributor, Priorities USA, had raised over $52 million in June alone, and currently has $150 million stashed away for general ads against Donald Trump.According to OpenSecrets, an independent government watchdog group, of the $314 million that Clinton has raised this election season, 27 percent of that came from Super PAC donations.The bottom line is this: yes, Hillary Clinton used Super PAC money to help fund her campaign and get this far in a very competitive race.
But in the age of Super PACs (and now a billionaire mogul), a candidate needs money to win.
Clinton recognizes this, and is pledging to put an end to the system that pollutes our elections.If anyone thinks a President Trump would end Super PACs, they are blissfully ignorant or totally blind.
