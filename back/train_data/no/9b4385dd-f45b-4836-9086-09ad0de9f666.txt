( reuters ) - a vietnamese student activist was jailed for six years plus four years of probation by a local court on wednesday for conducting propaganda against the state , his lawyer said .
despite sweeping reforms to its economy and growing openness to social change , including gay , lesbian and transgender rights , vietnam s sole communist party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism .
phan kim khanh , 24 , is a student studying international relations and the eldest child of a catholic farming family in a remote area north of capital hanoi .
he had written blogs criticizing the government before he was arrested earlier this year .
the proof used in court against khanh was vague , lawyer ha huy son told reuters , adding he was not certain if khanh wants to appeal .
human rights watch on tuesday called on vietnam to drop all charges and release khanh .
the bogus crime of conducting propaganda against the state is designed to silence peaceful critics of the vietnamese authorities , said brad adams , human rights watch s asia director .
vietnam ought to get rid of these laws and stop persecuting students and ordinary people for just talking about the country s problems on the internet .
