Tom Hanks is definitely voting for Hillary Clinton and he perfectly explained why earlier this week.During an interview with the Press Association to promote his latest film, Hanks was asked about Donald Trump and his remarks about sexually assaulting women.
He was at work, man, Hanks began.
He wasn t in a locker room.
He was at work.
He was showing up to do a thing on camera.
Look I m offended as a man.
I m not offended as a husband or a father.
I m offended as a guy.
That s just not right, I m sorry.
It s not right at work, it s not right in the locker room.
It s wrong, period.
The end.
That s all.
Hanks also talk about why he is voting for Hillary Clinton by comparing this election to a root canal.
It s kind of like if you have a horrible, painful tooth, and you need a root canal.
Who are you going to see?
A guy who says, Oh, I think I can figure that out, how to do a root canal for you.
Lay down.
Or are you going to see somebody who s done 6,000 of them.
Has a degree on the wall and has a great history and expertise when it comes down to it.

Look, if I have an abscessed tooth, and I need to see an oral surgeon, I m not going to go to the guy who says, you know what, I think I can be a pretty good oral surgeon, I m going to go to someone who has been doing it for 30 years and has handled it a million times.
I am voting for Hillary Clinton because she is wildly, wildly qualified to be president of the United States at the same time with dealing after one damn thing after the other that the world has handed her.
When asked what will happen if Donald Trump becomes president, Hanks said it would be a dark day for the planet Earth.
