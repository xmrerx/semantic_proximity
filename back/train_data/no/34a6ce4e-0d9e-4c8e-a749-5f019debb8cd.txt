syrian troops and allied forces regained control of al-qaryatayn town after eliminating terrorist daesh ( islamic state ) groups that had infiltrated it , state media said on saturday .

searches in the area had uncovered 13 bodies on sunday , of whom four had been identified , he said .
barazi said all the civilians who were killed were public employees and pensioners with their families .
earlier this month , the observatory said is fighters had seized the town from government forces , part of a counter-attack by the jihadists whose territory in eastern syria has been whittled down .
at least 83 people were killed in the 48 hours before the syrian army retook the town , the war monitor said , adding that is had accused the civilians of being agents of the regime .
