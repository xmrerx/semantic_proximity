kuala lumpur ( reuters ) - police in malaysia have arrested seven youths in connection with a fire at an islamic boarding school in kuala lumpur that killed at least 23 people , mostly teenagers .
the seven , aged 11 to 18 , were brought to court and remanded for seven days , kuala lumpur police chief amar singh told reporters at a news conference on saturday .
i can assure you now that the case is solved with the arrest of the seven of them , singh said .
it was the most deadly incident of its kind in malaysia in two decades , and has outraged the public , some of whom have called for greater safety and tougher regulation at such religious schools .
the arrested include students from the surrounding neighborhood , and some have tested positive for consuming marijuana .
the police are treating the case as one of murder and mischief by fire .
the blaze erupted early on thursday in a top-floor dormitory at the three-storey boarding school where most of the students were sleeping in bunk beds , with many of the windows covered by metal grilles .
asked if the suspects had planned to kill the victims , singh said : intention was to burn , but it could be because of their age or because of their maturity levels , perhaps they may not have known that it would cause deaths .
two gas cylinders were brought up from the kitchen to the second floor , he said .
