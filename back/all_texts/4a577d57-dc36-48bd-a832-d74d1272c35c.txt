Donald Trump has been making racist comments about the Hispanic population since the beginning of his campaign, and no matter how much heat he gets for it, it s becoming clear that he has absolutely no intention of stopping.
This afternoon, Trump made yet another racist joke about Mexicans, and it s just as disrespectful and disgusting as his comments about Mexican immigrants being rapists and drug dealers.
At his rally in Manchester, New Hampshire, Trump made a truly distasteful joke when his speech was momentarily interrupted by a plane flying overhead.
Trump had just been gushing about how Mexico s leaders were so much smarter than America s (clearly taking a swipe at President Barack Obama) when he was suddenly inspired by the plane.
He began: I respect Mexico, and I respect their leaders.
What they ve done to us is incredible.
Their leaders are so much smarter, so much sharper, and it s incredible.
As the plane went by, Trump pointed up at the plane and joked: In fact, that could be a Mexican plane up there, they re getting ready to attack.
Barely anyone laughed and Trump got on with his speech, having completed his task of assuring America that he will always be a bigot, no matter how much backlash he receives for it.You can watch Trump reignite his love for racism and xenophobia in the video below, via NBC News:Video: Trump sees a plane overhead, says That could be a Mexican plane up there they re getting ready to attack.

Thanks to his racist comments and his offensive border wall (which he insisted Mexico is going to pay for), the former President of Mexico Vicente Fox HATES Trump with a passion and hasn t been shy about it.
Surely, he can t be the only leader in Mexico that feels this way.Featured image via Jeff J Mitchell / Getty Images
