This unbelievable graph should put the question of, Who won the independent vote during the first debate to bed Frank Luntz was tracking real-time views of independent voters reactions to Hillary and Trump during the debate on Monday night.
Watch what happens to Hillary s green line when she speaks vs. Trump s red line when he speaks.This is how undecided American voters really feel:Watch the "undecided" line when Hillary talks vs. when Trump talks.Trump is really winning tonight.
