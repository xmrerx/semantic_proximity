jakarta ( reuters ) - tens of thousands of muslims marched from the main mosque in indonesia s capital to a square in jakarta on sunday to protest against u.s. president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel .
it was the biggest protest in indonesia since trump s controversial move earlier this month to reverse decades of u.s. policy .
police estimated the number attending the rally , organized by various muslim groups , at about 80,000 .
the protest was peaceful but rows of police behind coils of barbed wire held back the crowd outside the u.s. embassy in jakarta .
a police spokesman said 20,000 police and members of the military were deployed to ensure security .
we urge all countries to reject the unilateral and illegal decision of president donald trump to make jerusalem israel s capital , anwar abbas , the secretary general of the indonesian ulema council , told the crowd .
we call on all indonesian people to boycott u.s. and israel products in this country if trump does not revoked his action , abbas said , reading from a petition due to be handed to the u.s. ambassador in indonesia .
many of the protesters were clad in white and waved palestinian flags and held up placards , some reading : peace , love and free palestine .
there have been a series of protests in indonesia over the issue , including some where hardliners burned u.s. and israeli flags .
the status of jerusalem , a city holy to jews , muslims and christians , is one of the biggest barriers to a lasting israeli-palestinian peace .
jerusalem s eastern sector was captured by israel in a 1967war and annexed in a move not recognized internationally .
palestinians claim east jerusalem for the capital of an independent state that they seek , while israel maintains that all of jerusalem is its capital .
