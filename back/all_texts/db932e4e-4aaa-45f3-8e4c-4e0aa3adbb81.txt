MIAMI (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Thursday he was hopeful that the freeing of a kidnapped U.S.-Canadian couple and their three children in Pakistan was a harbinger for closer cooperation in the future.
This is a very positive moment and the Pakistan Army performed well, Mattis told reporters on board a military plane, adding he hoped this would be a harbinger for the future.
We intend to work with Pakistan in a collaborative way in the future to stop terrorism and that includes kidnapping, Mattis added.
He declined to comment on any specifics on how the hostages were freed.
