The only way that Trump can talk about immigration, and immigrants, is in racist terms.
For someone other than, well, someone in a position of power, it d probably be easy to explain his use of the term, bad hombres, as simple ignorance.
Maybe.
With him and his racist tendencies, though,it s not, and he proved that during the final presidential debate.In talking about undocumented immigrants and the crime they re supposedly committing, he said: But we have some bad hombres here that were going to get them out.
Because that s what everyone wants, supposedly.
What he misses isn t just that his border wall and deportation force plans aren t realistic he also misses the fact that saying, bad hombres, is horribly racist.
Why is that?Using a culture s own language to attack them is inherently racist.
Hombre means man, in Spanish, and specifically refers to tough men.
But using it against them like that is to demean the entire race and the entire culture.Trump doesn t care, though.
He has a very long and well-documented history of racism.
He doesn t care what he says, but there he is, up on that stage, calling undocumented immigrants bad hombres, for the purpose of painting Latinos as inherently bad people.That s not a U.S. president.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images
