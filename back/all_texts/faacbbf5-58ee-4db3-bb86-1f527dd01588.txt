WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday that President Donald Trump is playing a constructive role in new health care legislation and helping bridge differences among congressional Republicans.
“This president is getting deeply involved,” Ryan said at a news briefing.
“He is helping bridge gaps in our conference.
He is a constructive force to help us get to a resolution so that we get consensus on how to repeal and replace Obamacare.”
