So when the team went to Washington, D.C., on Friday to get ready for the national competition, they ended up showing their entry to President Donald Trump in the Oval Office.
That s a mean-looking machine, huh?

Simply because it conquers all, one student replied, drawing a handshake from the president and cheers from his classmates.
