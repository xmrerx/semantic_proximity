President-elect Donald Trump made another MAJOR mistake when he had the audacity to trash civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) just two days before Martin Luther King Day.It all started because Lewis said what many Americans were thinking when he stated, I don t believe Donald Trump is a legitimate president , and Trump couldn t hold back his little orange fingers and gigantic temper tantrum.
He tweeted: Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results.
All talk, talk, talk no action or results.
Sad!
The clueless former reality television star got absolutely gutted on Twitter for this, and rightfully so.
Unfortunately, his moronic supporters are defending him one of them being CNN conservative political commentator and radio host Ben Ferguson, who bashed Lewis comments and called them unprecedented.
Ferguson said: I can t imagine the fallout, the backfire that you would have if a Republican ever implied that about Barack Obama or Bill Clinton or JFK or anyone else for that matter.
Anyone in their right mind not only knows that Lewis is right, but that Trump is a moron for criticizing the civil rights hero.
CNN host Poppy Harlow was having none of it, and she immediately tore into Ferguson and the Republican party for complaining about the same things they did to President Barack Obama for the past 8 years.
She said: Ben, Ben, Ben, that s exactly what many Republicans did, including the president-elect for years questioning the legitimacy of the first black president.
Bringing up the fact that Trump was a major voice behind birther conspiracy theories involving Obama, Harlow totally shut Ferguson down by reminding him, The president-elect did that to the sitting president for years.
