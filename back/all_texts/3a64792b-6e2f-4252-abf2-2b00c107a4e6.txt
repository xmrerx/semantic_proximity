The domestic terror group is at it again Watch photographers vie for the best angle while watching an aggressive, hateful group of angry protesters attack a lone man for simply wearing a Trump hat vying hat.
Not one of these men offered to help this person who appears to be by himself.
Meanwhile, cops stand around and allow and innocent man to be assaulted.
What has happened to our America?A young white man wearing one of Donald Trump s red Make America Great Again!

Bratton also served as New York s top cop from 1994 to 1996 and was Chief of the LAPD from 2002 to 2009.During his first tenure as commissioner, under Mayor Rudolph Giuliani in the early 1990s, Bratton was credited with driving down crime with a widely copied, data-driven, crime-fighting strategy before his brash style made him an annoyance to the mayor, who forced him out.Though de Blasio was elected as a sharp critic of a police strategy known as stop-and-frisk which raised concerns over racial profiling and privacy rights he picked Bratton as a sign that he would balance reform and further drive down crime.
When you see a policeman, remember that he is your friend, Bratton said Tuesday.
That s the vision and that s the passion that I ve had for 45 years.
