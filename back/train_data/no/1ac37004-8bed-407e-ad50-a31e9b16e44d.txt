munich ( reuters ) - german police ruled out a political or religious motive behind a knife attack in the city of munich on saturday and said a detained man suspected of injuring eight people had mental health problems .
the arrest of the suspect in his 30s brought calm back to the streets of the bavarian capital after a tense morning .
police had asked residents to stay home until they find the attacker who had fled on a bicycle .
munich police chief hubertus andrae told a news conference that eight people have been lightly injured in the attack and that the suspect was known to police from previous offences , including burglary .
we have no indication of a terrorist , political , or religious motive , andrae said .
i assume it is to do with a psychological disorder of the perpetrator .
police had earlier said they believe the man , who attacked people at several different locations , acted alone .
his victims include a 12-year-old boy and a woman .
