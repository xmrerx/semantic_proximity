london wants to start talks on the future trade deal with the eu as soon as possible to provide clarity for companies based in britain on the terms of business after exiting the eu in march 2019 .
but the eu said it could only start such talks once sufficient progress is made in negotiations on the terms of the divorce - a financial settlement , citizens rights and the border between ireland and northern ireland .
