grab your popcorn and sit down because trump just posted a tweet that proves how delusional he really is.it s been two days since the third presidential debate , and donald trump s campaign continues to roll downhill in flames like a rickety gasoline-soaked wagon on fire.but donald trump , in yet another lie to his supporters , actually claimed on twitter that he won the debate by a unanimous decision .
the results are in on the final debate and it is almost unanimous , i won !
trump wrote .
thank you , these are very exciting times .

donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) october 21 , 2016apparently , donald trump is confused about what winning actually looks like.because not only did most reaction polls indicate that hillary clinton won the debate , the scientific polls indicate she won as well.a cbs news poll found that 49 percent of debate watchers surveyed said clinton won , which is 10 points higher than the 39 percent who say trump won.similarly , clinton was declared the winner 46 percent to 37 percent of those surveyed by an nbc news/surveymonkey poll.also , the cnn/orc poll found that clinton won the debate as well , with 52 percent saying hillary won versus only 39 percent who said trump won.and that s not all .
hillary also beat the hell out of trump in a politico/morning consult poll by 17 points , 43 percent to 26 percent.in other words , trump lost the debate on wednesday night in las vegas just as he lost the first two.twitter users certainly think trump s declaration of victory is a joke .
because they mocked him mercilessly after he posted it .

vaughan ( @ rvaughanw ) october 21 , 2016can you imagine if donald trump declares himself the winner on election day after the popular and electoral vote reveal that hillary won ?
because while it s funny to watch trump call himself the winner of a debate , it won t be very funny if he does the same thing on november 8th even though all of the results clearly show that he is wrong.featured image : justin sullivan/getty images
