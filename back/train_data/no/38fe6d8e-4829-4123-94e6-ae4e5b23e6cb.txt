zurich ( reuters ) - the swiss government urged voters on monday to keep the annual license fee that finances public broadcasters , saying taxpayer money played a crucial role in supporting cultural diversity and political discourse in the media .
its call seeks to defuse support for the no billag initiative that comes to a binding vote on march 4 and which opinion polls show has around 57 percent support .
proponents want to scrap the billag fee that last year raised 1.37 billion swiss francs ( $ 1.38 billion ) as the financial lifeblood for public broadcasters at the federal , regional and local levels .
national broadcaster srg , which operates in the four national languages , gets 75 percent of its budget from the fee .
a varied media offering is important for a small , polyglot country like switzerland with its direct democracy , president doris leuthard said in a statement .
switzerland says it would be the first country in europe to abolish fees for public broadcasting should the measure be adopted .
this would push advertising revenue to mostly foreign-controlled commercial media .
the government is cutting the fee levied on homes with a radio or tv set to 365 francs per private household from 2019 from around 450 now .
businesses will pay up to 35,590 francs a year based on a sliding scale of annual sales .
