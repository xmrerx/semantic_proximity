These kinds of slaps on the wrist should get judges fired.
Period.Wesley Dylan Marshall is probably only going to serve 75 percent of a ridiculous 10 day jail sentence for what he did to a 19-year-old woman this past July.During a stay at the Church Hill Motel with the woman and another man, Marshall became angry and assaulted the woman by literally throwing her off the side of a balcony two stories high because she consented to having sex with the other man and not him in celebration of her birthday.According to the Kingsport Times-News,Aside from the jail time and anger management classes, Marshall was sentenced to 11 months and 29 days of probation, ordered to serve 96 hours of community service, issued fines and fees totaling $1,237 and ordered to have no contact with the victim.It all adds up to yet another light sentence for a white guy who committed violence against a woman, proving once again that the judicial system and the law does not go far enough to protect women from assholes like Marshall.Judges across the country have disgraced themselves by sentencing rapists and abusers to light sentences.In June, Judge Aaron Persky sentenced rapist Brock Turner to only six months in jail, igniting a firestorm of criticism.In August, Colorado Judge Patrick Butler gave a rapist ZERO prison time.A Massachusetts judge did the same thing during the same month and even gave the perpetrator permission to serve his probation in another state so he can attend college.And a Montana judge is facing impeachment for sentencing a man to just 60 days in jail for raping his own daughter.This latest sentencing in Tennessee is just adding to the pattern.Clearly, there are far too many judges in this country who have a frat boy attitude about the way white guys treat women and it s only getting worse.Featured Image: Raw Story
