katie couric took to twitter to call out charlottesville , va protesters who allegedly sprayed urine at two of her producers .
what leftist hack katie couric doesn t mention is that the protesters who sprayed her producers with urine were actually antifa protesters .
by leaving that little factoid out of her tweet , she has clearly attempted to mislead anyone reading her tweet into believing that the offending protesters were part of the white nationalist group .
while we strongly condemn any group that believes they are superior because of their race or skin color , these people actually obtained a permit to protest , and until antifa showed up , their protest was peaceful.two of my producers just got sprayed with urine .
lovely .
hard to keep your cool .
