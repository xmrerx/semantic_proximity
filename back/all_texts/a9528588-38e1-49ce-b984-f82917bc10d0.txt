The first thing that comes to mind when you think of Hillary Clinton s response to the Las Vegas shooting is that she s gone on twitter and removed all doubt that she s clueless when it comes to guns and gun control.
What s even more unbelievable is she wasted no time politicizing this horrific event while asking everyone else not to: We can and must put politics aside, stand up to the NRA, and work together to try to stop this from happening again.
She tweeted out several times just digging herself a deeper hole with her ignorance and lack of compassion for the victims: Her first tweet let us know she s clueless about the particular weapon used in this crime:The second tweet was another dig at the NRA and Clinton has the nerve to say we need to put politics aside when she isn t:Fox News host Christ Stirewalt said what everyone is thinking GO AWAY!
