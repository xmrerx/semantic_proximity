brussels ( reuters ) - former catalan leader carles puigdemont , facing arrest in spain for organising an illegal independence referendum in october , said on tuesday he would stay in belgium for the time being .
spanish authorities dropped an international arrest warrant for him on monday in order to bring his case solely under spanish jurisdiction and avoid a lengthy extradition process through the belgian courts .
for the moment we will stay here , puigdemont said at a press conference in brussels .
puigdemont declared the northeastern region of catalonia an independent republic on oct. 27 , leading madrid to impose direct rule on the regional government and fire the pro-independence administration .
the resulting political uncertainty has led to thousands of companies moving their legal base from catalonia and has dented tourist figures and retail sales in the wealthy mediterranean region .
puigdemont and four ex-cabinet members travelled to brussels shortly after he was sacked by the central government .
his former no .
2 , oriol junqueras , is in custody in a madrid jail while his role in the organisation of the referendum is investigated .
puigdemont faces charges of rebellion , sedition , misuse of public funds , disobedience and breach of trust in spain .
his party , together for catalonia , is campaigning on a pro-independence ticket for dec. 21 elections called by madrid in an effort to resolve the crisis .
the central government hopes the elections will usher in a new administration that favours unity with spain .
puigdemont said he hoped to be able to return to spain if he was elected a member of the catalan parliament , but he was not sure if he would be arrested and put in custody .
we have to carefully consider such a decision before taking it , he said .
