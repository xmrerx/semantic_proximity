One of the first things Donald Trump did after winning the presidential election was to completely crush decades of diplomatic policy with China, by accepting a phone call from the president of Taiwan.
At first, it seemed that China would let Trump s blunder go and chalk it up to his political inexperience.
However, when Trump doubled down on his antics, China decided to fly a bomber into the South China Sea in a show of force against Trump, in order to let him know that the United States had better keep the One China policy or else.After this snafu, Ned Price, speaking for the Obama White House s National Security Council, said: There is no change to our longstanding policy on cross-Strait issues.
Our fundamental interest is in peaceful and stable cross-Strait relations.
Well, now, it seems that Trump is going in that direction again, and is even entertaining the idea of taking a meeting with the Taiwanese president.
When reporters asked him about his plans for diplomatic relations in that direction and whether he d meet the President of Taiwan, Trump said, we ll see.
He insists, however, that the United States will not have a rocky relationship with China under a Trump administration: Hopefully we re going to have great relationships with many countries and that includes China.
Well, I got news for you, Donald Trump.
If you keep flirting with recognizing Taiwan, things with China are gonna go south really, really fast.
Diplomacy is important, as you will soon learn.
Some of these international relationships are tenuous at best, and one wrong move could cause the whole thing to come crashing down like a house of cards built on the softest bed of sand imaginable.
Now that you are the president-elect, your words have consequences.
Don t go bandying about nuclear weapons and undoing years upon years of diplomatic norms.
We ll ALL suffer the consequences if you do.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
