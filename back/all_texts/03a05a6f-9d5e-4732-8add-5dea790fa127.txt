Brown May 20, 1996 August 9, 2014I would like the memory of Michael Brown to be a happy one.
He left an afterglow of smiles when life was done.
He leaves an echo whispering softly down the ways, of happy and loving times times and bright and sunny days.
He d like the tears of those who grieve, to dry before the sun of happy memories that he left behind when life was done.The last video of gentle Michael Brown was taken when he robbed a convenience store and roughed up the owner before his death.https://youtu.be/9Uf5mfE057EGentle Mike Brown was shot dead when he attacked a police officer after the robbery.There was at least one arrest today at the memorial ceremony.pic.twitter.com/mYWCgLGYGw Search4Swag (@search4swag) May 20, 2015Via: Gateway Pundit
