Former NFL player Shannon Sharpe on Tuesday called LaVar Ball s complaints directed at President Donald Trump the dumbest thing he could have said.
Sharpe is usually as anti-Trump as they come but is just smart enough to understand that it s idiotic to diss the president.
Sharpe makes some dumb comments during the rant about LaVar Ball but it s pretty big that he is supportive of President Trump:Sharpe appeared to take Trump s side in the feud and said the president s involvement in China didn t hurt the situation.
I can assure you President Trump mentioning [the detainment] to the Chinese President didn t hurt his situation.
If he [LaVar Ball] felt this strongly, why didn t the hell he say that while they were over there?
This is when he should have been vocal.
Sharpe said.Sharpe also asked why, if Trump didn t help the situation, why did all three players personally thank him?
Why did all three of those guys get up there and say thank President Trump, personally?
Thank the American government, personally?
Sharpe inquired.
I didn t hear one of them mention LaVar Ball s name.
I did hear three President Trumps and three American government.
Now they get back on American soil, he [LaVar Ball] wants to pound his chest.
I see why President Trump used the word ungrateful,' he added.Later in the segment, Sharpe said Trump wouldn t have had to say anything about LiAngelo Ball if he hadn t attempted to steal.
President Trump would have said nothing about the boy.
If your son would have had kept his sticky ass fingers in his pockets, and not take peoples stuff in China, we wouldn t even be having this conversation, Sharpe said, directing his comments to LaVar Ball.In the past, Sharpe has criticized Trump, especially over the president s comments about player protests in the NFL.
