As Donald Trump heads into the general election with virtually no money, little support, and absolutely no dignity, he s pivoting to the group of voters who are already loyal to the Republican Party: evangelicals.Trump has had a hard time gaining traction with the influential, religious voting bloc.
But when push comes to shove, they always vote Republican, and overwhelmingly so.
But Trump s a special kind of candidate.
Everyone seems to hate him, so he ll need all the help he can get.So that help includes another loser Michele Bachmann.
The former Congresswoman and failed 2012 presidential candidate has been appointed, along with two dozen others, to a special evangelical advisory board.In announcing the formation of the board, Trump, who of course issued a gushing, pandering statement:I have such tremendous respect and admiration for this group and I look forward to continuing to talk about the issues important to Evangelicals, and all Americans, and the common sense solutions I will implement when I am President.Bachmann, who based her entire political life off a warped interpretation of God and the Bible, joins Jerry Falwell Jr., Ralph Reed, James Dobson, and a slew of mega church leaders all across the country.Bachmann, who ran as a Tea Party friend of the religious right in 2012, lost the contest in Iowa, a state with a heavy evangelical voting population.
She placed a dismal sixth, while Mike Huckabee won.
Bachmann is so hated by the evangelicals that even Phyllis Schlafly, a hero to the movement, wouldn t even consider Bachmann as her replacement for the ultra-conservative Eagle Forum.Having Bachmann on your advisory council for a demographic that hates her seems pretty counterintuitive, but hey, it s the Trump campaign nothing makes sense.The board, which will meet regularly, will be prepping Trump for upcoming meetings with religious leaders all across the nation.
A few of the individuals, including James Dobson and Richard Land, who are both leaders of churches and religious talk shows, actively campaigned for Ted Cruz and denounced Trump.As stated before, when all is said and done, the evangelicals will come home to the Republicans.
So instead of reaching out to women, Hispanic and Latinos and millenials, Trump is actively spending his time appealing to people who will vote for him no matter what.It looks like the crazy Trump train has added the crazier Michele Bachmann to the mix.
Thanks, Trump, for making this election even more entertaining.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
