WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump, saying that he had predicted attacks on American soil by terrorists, reiterated his call for a ban on foreign-born Muslims entering the country, in a comment posted on Twitter.
“What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning.
Our leadership is weak and ineffective.
I called it and asked for the ban.
Must be tough,” Trump wrote on Twitter.
