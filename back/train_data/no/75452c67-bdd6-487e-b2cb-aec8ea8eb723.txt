what s all the fuss about if there s no there , there ?
is anyone else sickened by the left s efforts to discredit president trump for months when they knew there was nothing there ! feinstein had visited cia headquarters on tuesday and was briefed on the investigation but months before this we all knew the truth it s just that feinstein finally admitted it : not at this time not at this time ? ?
? the democrats owe president trump the biggest apology ! the following comment expresses how america feels about feinstein and her cronies : it s been hundreds of days since the russian smear campaign conducted by msm , democrat operative morons like olbermann and late night comedians , and clintons political cronies and yet still nothing .
nothing .
not a single thing .
a few more months and then they will quietly say case closed and hope and pray that we all forgot .
sorry but we won t and we watch you all very differently now , we see right through you .
our patience is just about out and your time handling our power is up .
feinstein embarrases herself during questioning to neil gorsuch : senator dianne feinstein is no match for supreme court nominee neil gorsuch .
in her questioning today she really made a fool of herself when she tossed out a question that made it clear she hadn t done her homework on gorsuch .
he answered her question by citing numerous specific cases in his legal history .
it s understandable that the democrats are trying to play to their base by dragging out the process of asking ridiculous questions of this perfect nominee for the scotus .
this is embarrassing and we have two more days of it !
it seems this is backfiring on the democrats retire already !
