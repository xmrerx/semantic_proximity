It s the first week of November, so of course, it s time for the annual War on Christmas idiocy to get underway.
Last year, there was a massive brouhaha about Starbucks holiday cups they were plain red, and of course, people were pissed.
Somehow, removing images like snowflakes and what-not from the cups amounted to taking Jesus out of Christmas.
Well, Starbucks just put out a green cup with people on it, and of course, people are pissed.There s just one problem.The green cups aren t Starbucks holiday cups.Starbucks didn t even mention Christmas or the holiday season when they released these cups!They re actually unity cups, designed to help remind people that we re all people, all Americans, during an unprecedentedly divisive election season.
Starbucks holiday cups haven t even come out yet, but they will be red with what looks like white holly leaves and berries on them.
Or one version is the photo was leaked and we can t see whether there are several versions or just that one.Watch Buzzfeed News video about the whole non-controversy below:?
