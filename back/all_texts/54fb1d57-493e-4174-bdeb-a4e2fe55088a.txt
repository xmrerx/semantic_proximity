WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump is expected to nominate a top economic aide, Kenneth Juster, as the next U.S. ambassador to India, two senior White House officials said on Friday.
Juster is a top deputy on the White House National Economic Council.
He is a familiar face among Indian officials, having chaired the U.S.-India High Technology Cooperation Group when Republican George W. Bush was president.
Trump is to play host to Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House on Monday.
