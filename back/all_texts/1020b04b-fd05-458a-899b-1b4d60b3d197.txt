This woman s having trouble entering the Walmart so people go to help her SHE SPITS ON THEM!
Her reasoning for this disgusting behavior is that Americans are pushing us around .
She s arrested BUT what happens next is what s so disturbing.A Saudi Arabian national faces hate crimes charges after allegedly spitting on several people at a Florida Walmart.Nuha Mohammed Al-Doaifi was arrested in Palm Bay after police responded to a 911 call, Florida Today reported Tuesday.The 21-year-old, who was with her 2-year-old son at the time, allegedly admitted to authorities she spat on several people because Americans are pushing us around.
The incident began, police said, when a woman approached Al-Doaifi when she appeared to be having difficulty entering the Walmart.
All I was trying to do was tell her she was coming in through the out door, Terry Rakowski told Florida Today.
She was just ramming (her cart) into the door.
The 39-year-old then claims the woman spat in her face.
She just spit all over me, she said.Al-Doaifi then allegedly did the same thing to several others inside the Walmart.
Her actions were directed at random people based on their ethnicity, and that s according to her own statement, said a spokeswoman for the Palm Bay Police Department.BUT THIS IS WHAT S EVEN MORE DISTURBING:Don t bother trying to hit the link to the original source Florida Today .
As soon as this story started to appear at other websites they yanked the story, scrubbed it completely.
You can t even find the original report by searching for this woman s name, all you get is a 404 page not found.
It s like it never happened and she doesn t exist.Apparently, hate crimes is a one way street, especially when committed by a Muslim against white folks.You have to wonder why she s even here if she hates white Americans so much.
The next question is whether the Obama regime will deport her back to the big sandbox from whence she came.I m gonna say, probably not.VIA: BLUR BRAIN
