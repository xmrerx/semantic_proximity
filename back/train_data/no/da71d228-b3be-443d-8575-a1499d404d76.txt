he also told the catholic trwam television that value added tax revenue would most likely increase by 30 billion zlotys ( $ 8.41 billion ) this year and the nominal increase in public debt in 2017 would be lowest in more than two decades .
we are taking money away from mafias and tax criminals and giving it to the people , morawiecki said .
