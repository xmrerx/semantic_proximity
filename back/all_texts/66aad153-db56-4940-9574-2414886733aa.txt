Saturday Night Live is known for the laughs they give us and they sure gave us plenty when it came to the 2016 election.
This week, there wasn t much to laugh about.
I wasn t sure how SNL would approach the current state of affairs tonight, but they did so much more than I could have hoped.
Instead of making us laugh, they made us cry.
And after making us sob, they made us hope for the future.In tonight s cold opening, Kate McKinnon once again appeared as Hillary Clinton in her trademark white pantsuit.
Alone on the stage, McKinnon sat at a grand piano and sang Hallelujah.
The words of the song and the haunting melody made it all but impossible not to shed a tear.
But then, she reminded us not to give up hope and to continue fighting the good fight to make the future a better place for everyone.This is a tough time for people of color, for women, for the LGBTQ community, for Muslims, and for all of America.
However, we cannot go gentle into that good night.
We must continue to rage against the bigotry and hatred that threaten to consume us.
So go ahead and cry tonight.
Sob uncontrollably.
But tomorrow, wake up and fight like hell.Watch SNL s cold opening here.
See if you can make it through with a dry eye.
I m doubting that you can.
