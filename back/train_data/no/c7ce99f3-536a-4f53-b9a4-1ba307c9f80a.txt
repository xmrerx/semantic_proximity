paris ( reuters ) - france s foreign ministry on friday nuanced comments made earlier by its minister , suggesting that former lebanese prime minister saad al-hariri may not be free and urging that he continue to play his rightful role in the country .
foreign minister jean-yves le drian had told europe 1 radio that as far as france was aware , hariri was free of his movements and that it was important he made his own choices .
however , when asked by reporters in a daily briefing to clarify those comments , a foreign ministry spokesman said france wanted hariri to be free , suggesting he may not be .
we wish that saad al-hariri has all his freedom of movement and be fully able to play the essential role that is his in lebanon , deputy foreign ministry spokesman alexandre georgini said .
he added that france s envoy to saudi arabia had seen hariri after a short-trip to the united arab emirates earlier this week .
french officials said the ministry s latest comments were the most accurate .
france s ambassador to saudi met hariri before president emmanuel macron s unscheduled visit to riyadh to meet crown prince mohammed bin salman on thursday .
paris has close ties with lebanon , a former colony , and with hariri , who has a home in france after spending several years in the country .
macron said in dubai on thursday there had been informal contacts with hariri , but no request to transfer him to france .
two top lebanese government officials said on thursday that riyadh was holding hariri captive and a third told reuters that the saudi authorities had ordered hariri to resign while he was in riyadh last weekend , and put him under house arrest .
le drian is due in saudi arabia on nov. 16 and is scheduled to also travel to iran later in the month .
