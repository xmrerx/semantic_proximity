What does it say to Americans when the head of Homeland Security voices his support for not offending one group over all other Americans.
Since day one at his job as head of Homeland Security, Jeh Johnson has been a smug liar who is protecting the radical agenda of Obama.
He supports Obama s open border policy and lies through his teeth to pretend like he doesn t. I ve listened to him testify before Congress on our open borders and he lies like crazy.
He should never have been sworn in for the job.
Please listen to this jackwagon and you ll understand he s NOT looking out for us: Jeh Johnson We Must Give Voice To The Plight of Muslims In This Country :
