Donald Trump posted his most embarrassing attack on the New York Times yet on Friday.Proving once again that he really should think before he tweets, Trump reacted to a New York Times article that accurately reported that he hadn t spoken to Chinese President Xi Jingping since November 14th.Ever since Trump took a phone call from Taiwan, and basically treated Taiwan like a legitimate nation, China has not been happy.
It has been American policy for decades that the president does not communicate with Taiwan because China considers Taiwan part of the real China.The One China Policy has been a crucial agreement between China and the United States, but Trump blew that all to hell with a single phone call and has been escalating confrontation with China ever since.The New York Times published a story on Thursday before Trump spoke with China s president to end the silence between them.Again, let s be absolutely clear.
The new York Times published this story BEFORE Trump talked to Jingping.
Once the Times learned of Trump s phone call, the story was updated to reflect the new information.
However, it does not change the fact that up to that point, Trump had, indeed, not spoken with Jingping since November.But Donald Trump is not much of a reader, so instead of reading the updated version, he caught the older version of the story and promptly lost his shit on Twitter over it.The failing @nytimes does major FAKE NEWS China story saying Mr.Xi has not spoken to Mr. Trump since Nov.14.
We spoke at length yesterday!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 10, 2017Yeah, this is pretty damn embarrassing and the Internet let Trump know it.

@realDonaldTrump OK, I m actually not sure if this is a blatant lie or reading comprehension issue.

Kelly Scaletta (@KellyScaletta) February 10, 2017@realDonaldTrump @nytimes the only thing that s failing is your presidency.
Ben Rachinger (@BenSRachinger) February 10, 2017Seriously, Trump could done a simple search to find the updated version of the story but he is so petty and thin-skinned that he immediately lashed out instead of getting all the facts.And the fact is that prior to their conversation yesterday, Trump had not spoken to Jinping since November 14th, meaning the New York Times article was accurate and they continued to be accurate when they updated the story.Trump owes the New York Times a public apology.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images
