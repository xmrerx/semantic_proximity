beirut ( reuters ) - the powerful lebanese group hezbollah said on saturday that an iraqi kurdish independence vote marked a first step toward the partition of the middle east , warning that this would lead to internal wars and must be opposed .
sayyed hassan nasrallah , head of the iran-backed group , said events in northern iraq , where kurds overwhelmingly voted for independence on monday , were a threat to the whole region and not just iraq and neighboring states with kurdish populations .
it will open the door to partition , partition , partition , nasrallah said .
he added that partition means taking the region to internal wars whose end and time frame is known only to god .
nasrallah noted that his group s arch enemy israel had come out in support of kurdish statehood and described the referendum as part of a u.s.-israeli plot to carve up the region .
the united states came out in opposition to the vote , along with major european states and neighboring countries turkey and iran .
the government of syria , where kurdish groups have established autonomous regions , also opposed the referendum .
nasrallah was speaking to supporters on the eve of ashura , when shi ites commemorate the slaying of the prophet mohammad s grandson , imam hussein , at kerbala in 680 ad .
hezbollah , a political and military movement , is a major player in the syrian conflict , where it has deployed thousands of fighters in support of president bashar al-assad .
hezbollah fighters are currently fighting along with other iran-backed militias and the syrian army against islamic state militants in eastern syria .
daesh is at its end .
it is a matter of time in iraq and syria , nasrallah said , using an arabic acronym for islamic state .
he said counter attacks mounted by islamic state in eastern syria in the last two days were expected as the group was besieged , adding that it was incapable of recovering ground .
