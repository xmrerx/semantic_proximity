According to the NRA, good guys with guns across the nation are the last line of defense between some unspecified threat that could occur anywhere at any time, and something else.
But who will protect the world from the responsible gun owners who prove themselves to be anything BUT responsible?In the latest instance of responsible gun ownerness, a Utah man found himself beaten to a pulp by people who were leaving a party at his home after he shot his girlfriend.
According to ABC4 Utah, everyone was enjoying the all-night party until the unnamed man began fighting with his significant other.
Overcome by emotion, he responsibly pulled out a handgun and demanded that partygoers leave his home.Obviously, confronted by a presumably drunk individual who thinks a gun is the best way to get people to leave a party, those present quickly left but as they were in the driveway, they heard gunshots.
Unified Police Department spokesperson Lex Bell says that the heroic individuals rushed back inside and pummeled the shooter, who left his victim with gunshot wounds to her ankle and hand, until he was unconscious.In an apparent effort to protect the shooter, the girlfriend told police that she accidentally shot herself while cleaning the gun but law enforcement says that she was likely shot while trying to wrestle the gun away from her violent and crazy significant other.
A friend who drove her to the hospital confirmed that her story was false.
Fortunately, her injuries are not serious, though she may need surgery on her hand.According to area residents, the couple recently moved into the neighborhood and after learning about their new neighbors, they are a bit concerned.
One man, identified as Dan, called the incident troublesome because he has a family whose safety is placed at risk by the new responsible gun owners in the neighborhood.No charges have yet been filed, but Bell says that those who rushed in and heroically beat the living hell out of the shooter were likely, legally, justified.Watch a report on the attack below:Featured image via screengrab
