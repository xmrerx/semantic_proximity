The best part of the 60 Minutes interview was when Trump told the dumb@@ Leslie Stall this when asked if he would build the wall: What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, where a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we are going to incarcerate, he said in the interview, to air on 60 Minutes But we re getting them out of our country; they re here illegally.
Only then, Trump said, will he figure out a plan to deal with the terrific people who are in the U.S. illegally but have otherwise clean criminal histories.
Securing the border, he said, is a prerequisite for any other action on immigration One unchanged part of his immigration platform has been his plan for the construction of a wall along America s southern border with Mexico, something he said he would force the Mexican government to pay for by threatening to cut off the flow of money from immigrants to their families south of the border.
Trump said Sunday that while an actual wall will be necessary along some portions of the border, a mere fence will suffice in others.
I m very good at this; it s called construction, he said.President-elect Donald Trump says the wall on the Mexican border may have fence segments, tonight on #60Minutes: https://t.co/n4ZKu8f3mk pic.twitter.com/bCmtXgcyFh 60 Minutes (@60Minutes) November 13, 2016
