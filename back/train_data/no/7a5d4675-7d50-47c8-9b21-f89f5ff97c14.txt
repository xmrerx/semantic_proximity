21st century wire says the field is now clear for trump to become the gop presidential nominee.watch a video of this report here : ted cruz and john kasich have both now bowed out of the presidential race , leaving donald trump as the last republican candidate standing.the two failing candidates made their decision after trump swept to victory in indiana last night.dr .
inderjeet parmar , head of the department of international politics at city university london , says that , it has exposed a deeply divided republican party whose leadership has lost all credibility and whose conservative philosophy , which it has held dear since 1980 , is in tatters .
it is , indeed , the elite leadership of both political parties that appears to have provoked this realignment in us politics towards outsiders and those not embroiled in what many see as a corrupt and broken system.bernie sanders , the democratic outsider , also shocked the world with a victory over hillary clinton last night.just two weeks ago cruz and kasich were publicising that they had made a deal to stop trump , yet even their combined efforts were useless.yesterday , a rasmussen poll emerged showing that donald trump can indeed beat hillary clinton at the general election , and that scenario is looking ever more likely with the political establishment in such dramatic retreat.it is possible that bernie voters will not support hillary in the general election , and in many ways their anti-establishment position gels much better with the politics of trump than it does with wall street insider clinton.immediately after kasich s announcement today , # dropouthillary began trending on twitter .
at the time of writing it is the number two trending hashtag in the us with 102,000 tweets.with such an immediate response taking aim at another establishment figure , the chances of trump , or perhaps even sanders , taking the presidency seem higher than ever.get the full story on the election : 21st century wire 2016 election files
