london ( reuters ) - nigeria s vice president yemi osinbajo , who has served as acting president for much of this year , said on monday he had not given any thought to contesting the country s next presidential election in 2019 .
nigeria has faced heightened uncertainty over whether president muhammadu buhari plans to contest the next election .
buhari , 74 , took power in 2015 but has been absent for much of this year due to illness .
osinbajo , a 60-year-old law professor , served as acting president during buhari s absences , succeeding in calming tensions in the oil-producing delta region and pushing small steps to improve the business climate , including foreign currency reforms .
some business leaders say he could provide stability by running for president himself in feb 2019 .
asked at the ft africa summit in london if he had considered running , osinbajo said he hadn t thought about it , adding : none of that is on the cards .
osinbajo also said that militants in the oil-producing niger delta region no longer posed a significant threat to oil production .
he said nigeria had lost as much as 1 million barrels per day ( bpd ) of oil production last year amid militant attacks on oil and gas infrastructure , which is concentrated in the southern delta region .
it was now pumping roughly 1.85 million bpd and climbing toward 2 million bpd .
that is closer to its top production of around 2.2 million bpd .
still , he added that nigeria needed to diversify its oil-dependent economy and take advantage of the resource while it was still in high demand .
we don t have all the time in the world with oil , he said .
we have to use oil while it makes sense to do so .
