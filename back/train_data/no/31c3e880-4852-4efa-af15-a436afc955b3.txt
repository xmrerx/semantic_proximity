hanoi ( reuters ) - vietnamese police have ordered the prosecution of an official at scandal-hit state energy firm petrovietnam over financial losses , the ministry of public security said on tuesday .
petrovietnam is at the heart of a sweeping high-level corruption crackdown in the communist state .
the ministry said in a statement that phan dinh duc , a member of petrovietnam s board of directors , would face prosecution on suspicion of violation of state regulations on economic management , causing serious consequences .
petrovietnam told reuters in an emailed statement it would cooperate with the authorities in the investigation .
former petrovietnam chairman dinh la thang , 56 , was arrested on dec 8 .
thang , also a former member of vietnam s politburo , was the most senior executive arrested in the scandal .
police have said they are investigating alleged violations of state rules at petrovietnam , which resulted in a loss of an 800 billion dong ( $ 35.2 million ) investment in local lender ocean bank .
the corruption crackdown made global headlines in august when germany accused vietnam of kidnapping trinh xuan thanh , a former chairman of petrovietnam s construction unit , in berlin after he applied for asylum there .
vietnamese police denied he had been kidnapped saying he had turned himself in and returned to vietnam , where he is in detention .
the communist party has said thanh will go on trial next month .
