2016 has been a gawdawful year.
We lost David Bowie, Prince, Gene Wilder, Elie Wiesel and more than I d care to mention.
We re also losing perhaps the best president in any of our lifetimes, although hopefully he ll be on this earth for a long while to come.
One of the most lasting legacies of 2016 will be the fact that Donald Trump prevailed and we are now facing a white supremacist (or at least someone who won t denounce white supremacy) as our next president.We can take small solace in the fact that the vast majority of Americans did not vote for Trump.
Only 25 percent did.
He lost the popular vote by a significant margin but because of the antiquated voter suppression tool called the Electoral College, Trump won.For those who voted for Trump, and those who didn t, there is one prevailing image, and that was Trump s Make America Great Again red trucker cap.
In case you haven t seen enough of that cap, you can order a Christmas ornament of it from Amazon.com for the low, low price of just $209.99 (plus free shipping).
The cap is made of brass, and like everything Trump, it s finished in 14 karat gold.
Or is it 24 karat?
The Amazon page doesn t seem to be sure.While I have no idea how many people actually bought this overpriced Christmas ornament, the Amazon comments were, as usual, the best part.Here are just a few:Even the sellers aren t fans of the Great Orange One.
Here s how they re answering some of the questions: Well, the nation is in grief.
The best thing we can do (outside of crossing all 10 fingers and all 10 toes that Jill Stein s recount will work) is choose to laugh instead of cry.
That s what the people on Amazon are doing, anyway.Buy one, while it s still available.Featured image via eBay
