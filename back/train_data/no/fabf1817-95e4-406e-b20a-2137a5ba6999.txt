this is hysterical !
senator chuck schumer can t even get a stunt right !
he held a press conference to bash the senate s healthcare bill and tried to pull a childish stunt .
he had someone place a sign with the word mean on it and then took out a sharpie and added the letters e-r .
the only problem is that you couldn t see the added letters at all !
he had to go back and try to fill it in still couldn t see it !
priceless !
.
@ senschumer adds letters `` e-r '' to poster board next to him .
`` the senate version of # trumpcare is even meaner than the house bill . ''
pic.twitter.com/u7r7l1skyr cspan ( @ cspan ) june 22 , 2017 how childish that schumer is fear mongering by calling the senate healthcare bill meaner than the house bill .
if being fiscally responsible with taxpayer dollars while trying to fix the disaster that is obamacare is meaner then so be it .
someone needs to be the adult in the room and stop the madness and government waste that was happening during the obama years .
the democrats just don t understand that the american people get it and are sick of the fear mongering from democrats .
we can also do without the class warfare from the dems !
people from all walks of life have figured out what the democrats are all about .
schumer needs to get a clue !
