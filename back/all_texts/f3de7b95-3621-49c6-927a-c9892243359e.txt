With marriage equality nationwide, and with more people now than ever supporting the love between two human beings regardless of gender, Adidas celebrated that love on Valentine s Day with the following Instagram pic with the caption, The love you take is equal to the love you make.
The love you take is equal to the love you make.A photo posted by adidas (@adidas) on Feb 13, 2016 at 11:30pm PSTPretty adorable, right?
Who could hate that pic, right?
Well, leave it to the internet to show the dark underbelly of society that can t wrap their heads around the idea of two people of the same gender in love.As Buzzfeed reports, several folks were none too pleased with Adidas having the audacity to show this image of two women in love presumably kissing, and many decided to write nasty comments.instagram.comFirst of all, whoever this leepapi is, they are not only a bigot, but clearly a moron.
The image is of two women.
Geez.However, I digress.
Adidas wasn t about to let this bigotry go unchecked and smacked down these bigots were they stand, and in the most magnificently glorious way, well, ever.Check it out:instagram.comCommenting directly to the bigots, Adidas responds to the one jerk by simply waving goodbye with a kiss, and the second by explaining that Valentine s Day is for everyone who is in love, not just heterosexuals.These responses were an absolute thing of beauty and quite honestly, I may go out and buy some Adidas active-wear just because of it.
Well done.Featured image from Instagram
