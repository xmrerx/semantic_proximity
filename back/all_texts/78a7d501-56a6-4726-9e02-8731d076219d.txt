The Rachel Maddow Show attempted to reach out to Maine Governor Paul LePage s office to see if he would be delivering his annual State of the State speech this year (after threatening he wouldn t do it).
Instead of getting a response to that simple question, the Governor s office decided to make things really weird.
Not only did the Governor and his aides not answer the question, but they made complete fools of themselves in the process.
It was a war of words, to say the least.Here is the question they thought was so horrible: Hi, wanted to see if the governor has made a decision about whether or not he will give the State of the State address in person to lawmakers or if he still plans to send a letter.
Do you have any information on that decision yet?
Thanks!
The very first message Maddow got back was: Why does Rachel Maddow have such an unnatural obsession with Governor LePage?
Her neurotic fixation on his is kind of bizarre.
What happened after that is just a back and forth of sheer awkwardness.While it is true that Maddow has reported on Governor LePage, and probably not in the most favorable light, that is the job of a national reporter after all.
And he s made a lot of stupid statements.
Of course, a liberal show is going to laugh at someone like LePage for those comments.
She reports on the news.
It would have been very easy for LePage s office to say we re not sure yet, leaving Maddow almost nowhere to go with the exchange, even if she was trying to troll him.Surely the Governor and his aides must have known that this is precisely the last thing they would want to do to someone who commands an audience of millions.
Not very smart.
Then again, Tea Party Republicans aren t the brightest, either.Featured image via screen capture
