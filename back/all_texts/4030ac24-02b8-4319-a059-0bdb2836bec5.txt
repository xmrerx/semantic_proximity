There are many things that are great about Thursday s Mike Pence interview on MSNBC s Morning Joe.
The general uneasiness with which Pence discusses his running mate, the look on Mika Brzezinski s face when Mr. Joe tells Pence he won the debate but the best part is watching Pence completely crash and burn when attempting to answer very basic questions.When the discussion turned to Trump s policies, Brzezinski asked Pence about two of Trump s most well-known the Muslim ban and his super-awesome Deportation Force.
Pence explained simply that Immigration is our deportation force that will waste $600 million of your dollars deporting every single undocumented person in America.
Pence, of course, did not mention the cost just that we were going to make America great again with a wall and a border so secure it could protect that criminal Killary KKKlinton Adolf Hitler III s totally illegal email server.But when it came to the Muslim ban, Pence was spent.
Done, man.
Out.
The uh, the position of our campaign, the position of our campaign, uh, is in in the interest of, uh, the safety and security of the people of the United States that we are going to suspend immigration from countries that have been compromised by terrorism.
Not a ban on all Muslims?
Scarborough interrupted as Pence was stammering on about Syria.After a long and awkward silence, Pence launched into his next mess of a string of sentences: Well, of course not, he lied, explaining that we can t know who those people are, adding that if we allow people from Syria to take shelter from our mutual enemy ISIS we can t know for certain who these people are.
