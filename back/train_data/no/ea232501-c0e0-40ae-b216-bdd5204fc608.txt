vatican city ( reuters ) - pope francis ’ s suggestion that donald trump was “ not christian ” because of his views on immigration was not a personal attack on the u.s. republican presidential candidate , vatican spokesman father federico lombardi said on friday .
lombardi told vatican radio that the pope ’ s comments , made to reporters during a flight back from mexico in response to a specific question on trump , were simply an affirmation of his long-standing belief that migrants should be helped rather than shut off behind walls .
“ in no way was this a personal attack , nor an indication of how to vote , ” lombardi said .
trump , the longtime republican party front-runner in opinion polls , dismissed the pope as “ disgraceful ” for questioning his faith .
he has said that if elected president in november , he would build a wall along the u.s.-mexican border to keep out immigrants who enter illegally .
lombardi said the pope believed people “ should build bridges , not walls ” .
he added : “ this is his general view , which is very consistent with courageously following the indications of the gospel on offering welcome and solidarity . ”
