New video has surfaced adding to the mountain of evidence that while working alongside his father, Fred Trump, young Donald Trump was part of a real estate business that discriminated against minority applicants.As part of an investigation by NBC News, Stanley Leibowitz, who worked as a rental agent for the Trump Organization, told the news network that he personally witnessed the elder Trump explicitly lay out a racist policy for their apartment properties.In the interview, Leibowitz said that Trump told him I don t rent to the n-word, and indicates that Trump made this statement with Donald Trump in the room and that the younger Trump affirmed the policy.The revelation comes at the same time that the Clinton campaign has released a video highlighting Trump s run-in with the federal government over discrimination.Undercover investigators were sent to Trump properties, and there they repeatedly ran into a policy where black applicants with identical financial backgrounds to white applicants were systematically denied housing.
The white applicants were allowed into the Trump properties.One bit of testimony determined that Trump property managers indicated applications from blacks by putting a C on the documents for colored, and that was a sign that they should be denied.The Trumps denied the allegation, but later settled with the government over the policy without admitting wrongdoing.Donald Trump s involvement with his father s business is key to the entire story of his rise to prominence in the real estate world and the media, as is his father s $14 million dollars that he gave to Trump to start his business.
But if you accept that, the Trump Organization s history of racial discrimination and the legal entanglements that come with that are also part of the story, and no matter how Trump may try to wave it away it s still there.Featured image via screen capture
