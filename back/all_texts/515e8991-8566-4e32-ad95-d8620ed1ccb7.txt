How are nonwhite children supposed to feel safe in Donald Trump s America?
On Tuesday less than half the country elected an open bigot who calls Mexicans rapists and promises to ban people who follow certain religions from entering the country, and who repeatedly attacks and denigrates women.
The 2016 election was a sobering reminder that we, as a nation, have lost our soul to far-Right ideologies and that poison has already seeped into our children.On Wednesday, children at a Michigan middle school celebrated President Grope s win by chanting one of his most popular catchphrases among the Stupid Part of America: build the wall.
Video of the incident has gone viral, reminding the nation of exactly what brand of hate they elected.
Because of the strong emotions and intensity of rhetoric that the posting of this incident to social media has elicited, we have had parents express concern regarding student safety, Superintendent of Schools Shawn Lewis-Lakin said in a statement on Thursday.
Know that we work with our partners in law enforcement on responding to any and all threats that have been or will be made involving our students or schools.
In responding to this incident indeed in responding to this election we need to hear each other s stories, not slogans, we need to work towards understanding, not scoring points, and we need to find a way to move forward that respects and values each and every member of our community, the statement continues.
We will be working on this in school today.
Please work on this with us.
Unfortunately, now that Hell has frozen over, this is something we can expect to become normal in Trump s America.
