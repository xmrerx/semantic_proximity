21st century wire says the us media s neomccarthy-like witch hunt continues as social media giant facebook creates a newly designed feature that allows the website to curate favored news in its news feed section.a new feature called collections created by facebook appears to be yet another exercise in formalizing group think specifically designed to highlight approved mainstream news , while serving to push down or quell any political piece or issue which falls outside prescribed mainstream western media talking points .
the feature is called collections and functions similarly to snapchat s discover section , which showcases news stories , listicles , videos , and other content submitted by handpicked media partners .
( see report below ) it s unclear just how far facebook is prepared to go in filtering user content , but it appears that the social media platform is introducing a brand new level of algorithmic automated censorship that could potentially create a virtual blacklist of online media websites and articles something which could have a lasting impact on freedom of the press and free speech well into the future.in essence , facebook s new restrictions smack of orwellian thought control over the past month , the washington post published an irresponsible propaganda piece that blamed the 2016 us election results on fake news dispensed via sophisticated russian propaganda .
these accusations of course were completely unfounded , deliberately feeding into a paranoid trial by media format that is no doubt echoed by us government sock puppet accounts that act as a digital firing squad by redirecting public perception.see also : washington post sloppy journalism blames russia for fake news crisis and trump s win , while pushing neo-mccarthyismwhile the us mainstream media contends that fake news somehow altered the 2016 presidential election cycle , it s important to remember that the us government has some pedigree here , having been behind the creation of bogus social media accounts and personalities for years now.back in 2011 , the uk s guardian reported that the us government via centcom , was looking to gain a foothold over information shared on the internet through fake online personal accounts : the discovery that the us military is developing false online personalities known to users of social media as sock puppets could also encourage other governments , private companies and non-government organisations to do the same.the centcom contract stipulates that each fake online persona must have a convincing background , history and supporting details , and that up to 50 us-based controllers should be able to operate false identities from their workstations without fear of being discovered by sophisticated adversaries .
this is just one example .
who really knows how widespread this practice is.you can expect a litany of allegations to continue from the mainstream , along with their faux war on fake news sites which has been used deliberately to discredit and frame genuine investigative analysis in alternative media , its intended target .
western media s anti-russian hyperbole has morphed and broadened somewhat , thanks to facebook , google and twitter and the alphabet establishment news agencies , washington has a new go-to scapegoat joining the tired old russian hack meme independent media.facebook s new tool to restrict certain posts has already created a backlash as several employees have recently quit the social media site business insider reports : facebook has created a censorship tool to automatically suppress certain posts in specific geographic areas and several employees who worked on the project quit in dismay , reports the new york times.this software would give third parties , like internet service providers , the ability to monitor facebook for popular stories , and suppress them at will .
additional censorship will be administered via a web browser plug-in called the bs detector promoted on the google chrome app store which labels web articles along political lines.as readers can see , 21st century wire is at the top of the list of websites that will be defamed and censored here : https : //github.com/selfagency/bs-detector/blob/master/chrome/data/data.json with the blessing of washington , social engineers in the silicon valley will now begin parsing internet content into categories like conspiracy theory ( anything which challenges any official version of events ) , biased ( alternative media opinion critical of the establishment or government ) , hate ( any article which violates politically correct language ) , state run ( targeting russia s rt and iran s press tv , but not the bbc , npr , voice of america , or pentagon & cia-affiliated cnn ) , and junk science ( any content which challenges the un party line on climate change .
this level of social control is almost exactly a depicted in huxley s dystopian classic , brave new world.more from business insider below .
