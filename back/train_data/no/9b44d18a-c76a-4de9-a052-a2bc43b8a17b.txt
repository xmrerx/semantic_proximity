a longtime republican activist in wisconsin is so disgusted by donald trump s groping comment and gop refusal to unendorse him that she just quit the party and ripped them a new one on twitter.marybeth glenn has always defended republicans against charges of sexism but donald trump s remarks about grabbing women by the p * ssy are so indefensible that she was disgusted that most republicans still support him as the nominee.in fact , she is so disgusted that she fired off a series of posts on twitter blasting the gop for continuing to endorse this piece of human garbage .
she then quit the party and said they deserve to be called sexists.here s the full takedown via twitter.so let me get this straight : i , a conservative female , have spent years defending the republican party against claims of sexism .
1/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016when i saw republican men getting attacked i stood up for them .
i came to their defense .
i fought on their behalf .
2/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016i fought on behalf of a movement i believed in .
i fought on behalf of my principles while other women told me i hated my own sex .
3/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016not only charges of sexism , but i defended @ marcorubio during go8 , i fought in my state to stop the @ scottwalker recall , etc marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016now some trojan horse nationalist sexual predator invades the @ gop , eating it alive , and you cowards sit this one out ?
5/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016he treats women like dogs , and you go against everything i and other female conservatives said you were & back down like cowards .
6/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016get this straight : we don t need you to stand up for us , you needed to stand up for us for you .
for your dignity .
for your reputation .
7/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016jeff sessions says that he wouldn t characterize trump s unauthorized groping of women as assault .
are you kidding me ? !
8/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016others try to rebuke his comments , yet still choose to vote for a sexual predator because let s be honest , that s what he is .
9/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016 what he said is wrong , and the way he treats women is wrong , but it s not wrong enough for me to not vote for him .
thanks , cowards .
10/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016various men in the movement are writing it off as normal , confirming every stereotype the left has thrown at them .
so i m done .
11/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016i m sooo done .
if you can t stand up for women & unendorse this piece of human garbage , you deserve every charge of sexism thrown at you .
12 marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016i m just one woman , you won t even notice my lack of presence at rallies , fair booths , etc. , you won t really care that i m offended 13/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016by your silence , and your inability to take a stand .
but one by one you ll watch more women like me go , & you ll watch men of 14/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016actual character follow us out the door .
and what you ll be left with are the corrupt masses that foam at the mouth every time you step 15/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016outside the lines .
men who truly see women as lesser beings , & women without self-respect .
& your guiding faith & principles will be 16/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016attached to them as well .
and when it s all said and done , all you ll have left is the party the left always accused you of being .
scum .
17/ marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016cc : @ speakerryan @ tedcruz @ marcorubio @ speakerryan @ reince and every other tool refusing to unendorse this monster .
17/x marybeth ( @ mbglenn ) october 11 , 2016over 70 percent of women view trump unfavorably , and it looks like that number is going to skyrocket only less than a month to go before election day .
furthermore , republicans are in serious jeopardy of losing women voters by historic margins that may take many years to reverse .
and they only have themselves to blame.featured image via facebook
