last week , after president trump retweeted a hilarious wwe wrestling video featuring donald trump body-slamming wwe chairman vince mcmahon , with a cnn logo dubbed over his head .
instead of letting it go , cnn chose instead , to threaten the person who allegedly created the meme .
as it turns out , threatening to out a private citizen for exercising his right to free speech , simply because it offended cnn , probably wasn t a very good idea .
# veryfakenews has been getting hammered on social media ever since , and their ratings are have plummeted as a result.a couple of days ago , we posted a hilarious meme depicting cnn s president jeff zucker , who seems to have made it his mission to destroy president trump , as hitler .
infowars has created a cnn meme contest , offering a $ 20k reward to the winner , as a way to encourage as many people as possible to create memes that expose the fake news network.the internet has provided some pretty funny cnn memes , but so far , the liar liar video is our favorite .
the meme maker couldn t have chosen a more appropriate clip , considering the logo dubbed over liar jim carrey s face is that of the # veryfakenewscnn.enjoy : '' kellyanne conway '' pic.twitter.com/0kxl68thbt anonymous america ( @ koranisburning ) july 10 , 2017here s the actual scene from the movie , liar liar with jim carrey :
