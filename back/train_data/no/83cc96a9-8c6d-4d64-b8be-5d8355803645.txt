berlin ( reuters ) - germany and the united states disagree on how to handle the standoff with north korea , chancellor angela merkel said on wednesday , condemning u.s. president donald trump s threat to totally destroy the reclusive state .
merkel , who is expected to win a fourth term in an election on sunday , said sanctions and diplomacy were the only way to get the nuclear armed state to the negotiating table .
i am against such threats , merkel told the deutsche welle broadcaster when asked about trump s remarks at the united nations .
we consider any form of military solution as totally inappropriate and we insist on a diplomatic solution .
she added : from my point of view sanctions and their implementation are the right answer .
but i consider everything else concerning north korea as wrong .
merkel said she told trump by telephone a few days ago that a diplomatic solution must be found .
