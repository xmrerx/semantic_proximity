they reached a new frenzy after the hacking of dnc e-mails led to the resignation of its chairwoman , debbie wasserman schultz.rich was beaten , shot and killed early on the morning of july 8 while he was walking home and talking on the phone to his girlfriend .
police have said they haven t determined if his murder was a botched robbery or something else .
the killer or killers appear to have taken nothing from their victim , leaving behind his wallet , watch and phone.wikileaks just confirmed murdered dnc staffer seth rich was the source of the dnc leak.wikileaks released a series direct messages from us alleged russian spy guccifer 2.0 to actress model robbin young ( according to young ) .in the stream of texts the discussion leads to the dnc leaker.his name is seth * * in november julian assange said russia did not hack into the dnc servers .
-h/t gp here s the proof : direct messages from u.s. alleged russian spy @ guccifer_2 to actress-model @ robbin_young ( according to the latter ) https : //t.co/umsb9wgxrq wikileaks ( @ wikileaks ) april 8 , 2017actress robbin young claims she had given this information she received from guccifer 2.0 to the authorities but , no one cared : https : //twitter.com/robbin_young/status/850743524953702404actress robbin young states that guccifer 2.0 told her , i m eager to find facts about seth , i m sure it wasn t just a robbery .
seth was assassinated .

# sethrich robbin young ( @ robbin_young ) march 29 , 2017in june 2016 , the hacker guccifer 2.0 claimed responsibility for breaking into the democratic national committee s servers , lifting opposition research the dnc had gathered , including a 200-page document focused on presumptive republican presidential candidate donald trump.the hacker s moniker is an homage to guccifer , the nom de guerre of romanian hacker marcel lazar who claimed a previous hack into hillary clinton s private email server and is now awaiting prosecution for cybercrimes .
rtwhile wikileaks julian assange was being interviewed by john pilger , he brought up the death of seth rich .
watch assange s strange and somewhat cagey reply.here is part of the conversation : julian assange : whistleblowers go to significant efforts to get us material and often very significant risks .
as a 27 year-old , works for the dnc , was shot in the back , murdered just a few weeks ago for unknown reasons as he was walking down the street in washington.reporter : that was just a robbery , i believe .
wasn t it ? julian assange : no .
there s no finding .
so i m suggesting that our sources take risks.watch it again in slow motion below : watch assange answer question about seth rich s murder again in slow-motion : the russia hoax : julian assange acknowledges murdered dnc staffer seth rich was wikileaks source .
why is msm covering this up ?
# trump pic.twitter.com/fs297jooqi vivelafrance ( @ vivelafra ) december 11 , 2016seth rich s parents explain what happened only moments before his death .
he was the voter expansion data director for the dnc .
his parents say he was , making sure everyone who wanted to vote , had the opportunity : shortly after the killing , redditors and social media users were pursuing a lead saying that rich was en route to the fbi that fateful morning , apparently intending to speak to special agents about an ongoing court case possibly involving the clinton family.more recently , wikileaks s thousands of dnc emails and voice mails have piqued reddit s interest , with redditors combing through years of communications looking for any clue to rich s murder.the theory is apparently based on julian assange s recent itv appearance , where he scoffed at the idea that russian hackers could be responsible for the data dump , and said that anyone within the democrats organization could easily have sent wikileaks the offending messages.given that rich as a dnc staffer presumably would have had some access to its servers , reddit is absolutely positive rich paid the ultimate price for exposing debbie wasserman schultz and the dnc s crusade against bernie sanders .
