JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Any Palestinian reconciliation deal must abide by international agreements and terms set by the Middle East Quartet - including the recognition of Israel and Hamas giving up its arms, an Israeli government official said on Thursday.
Israel will examine developments in the field and act accordingly, the government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity.
