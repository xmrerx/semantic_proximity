WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. and Russian generals held a face-to-face meeting this week in an effort to avoid accidental clashes as both sides fight to retake what is left of Islamic State s territory in Syria, U.S. military officials said on Thursday.
They had a face-to-face discussion, laid down maps and graphics, Army Colonel Ryan Dillon, a Baghdad-based spokesman for the U.S.-led coalition, told a Pentagon briefing.
He added that it appeared to be the first meeting of its kind.
A U.S. military official, speaking to Reuters on condition of anonymity, said the participants included both U.S. and Russian generals.
