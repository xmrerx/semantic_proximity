the story below from the liberal new york times is hysterical !
rex tillerson is sweeping the state department clean !
the angle of the nyt article is one of horror and shock that tillerson could let these lifers in the bloated bureaucracy of the state department go in such large numbers .
how dare he !
lol ! 5 minutes and you re outta here : of all the state department employees who might have been vulnerable in the staff reductions that secretary of state rex w. tillerson has initiated as he reshapes the department , the one person who seemed least likely to be a target was the chief of security , bill a. miller.mr .
miller got just five minutes with the secretary of state , the former officials said .
afterward , mr. miller , a career foreign service officer , was pushed out , joining a parade of dismissals and early retirements that has decimated the state department s senior ranks .
mr. miller declined to comment.democrats go nuts over hollowing-out of department : democratic members of the house foreign relations committee wrote a letter to tillerson citing what they said was the exodus of more than 100 senior foreign service officers from the state department since january .
they expressed concern about what appears to be the intentional hollowing-out of our senior diplomatic ranks .
career diplomats are outta here !
tillerson has also slashed the state department budget by 31 percent !
this is great ! tillerson has also frozen hiring and offered payouts to many career employees he s hoping to reduce the state department workforce by 2,000 !
yes , 2,000 ! maga !
