james o keefe of project veritas has released undercover , button-camera video that outlines the process of bird-dogging and how it is being used to rig the 2016 presidential election of the united states in favor of hillary clinton and the democrat party .
the central focus of the video , which is a collection of various undercover videos with commentary , is the process of bird-dogging which refers to essentially hiring people to behave as the equivalent to crisis actors .
except for the fact that there is no actual crisis , and these people are used to simply incite violence , among other things , to goad the media into giving donald trump s campaign negative coverage.various people appear in the video , complete with both audio and video , saying how they skirt the laws of our nation to engage in corruption .
