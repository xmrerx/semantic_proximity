rachel maddow msnbc ( @ maddow ) march 14 , 2017just last week , the new york times columnist nicholas kristoff urged irs employees sunday to break the law , and leak donald trump s tax returns to his publication : if you re in irs and have a certain president s tax return that you d like to leak , my address is : nyt , 620 eighth ave , ny ny 10018 , nicholas kristof wrote on twitter.but if you 're in irs and have a certain president 's tax return that you 'd like to leak , my address is : nyt , 620 eighth ave , ny ny 10018. https : //t.co/ujye100tn9 nicholas kristof ( @ nickkristof ) march 6 , 2017as the hill reminds us , the release of an individual s unauthorized tax returns is a felony .
while reporters who publish illegally obtained information that they did not solicit are traditionally not prosecuted recall that in september 2016 the nyt released an old trump tax return without legal consequences- the legal picture becomes less clear if the reporters are involved in the leaking of the information .
zero hedgehere s what kristof of the new york times had to say about the release of trump s 2005 tax returns : so trump apparently paid 25 % income tax rate overall in federal taxes in 2005 .
low , but higher than romney or many finance tycoons .
