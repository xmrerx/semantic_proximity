CNN s Jim Acosta keeps trolling President Trump and keeps making a total fool of himself!
The latest moment was after signing a trade bill when Acosta asked why the president didn t hold a press conference Trump s response is priceless!President Trump to @Acosta: I like real news.
Not fake news.
You re fake news.

He s so brilliant and knows immigration like no other!
We can t say the same for the White House Press Corp!
The Trump administration made some positive announcements on immigration and the left went nuts!
Miller got the best of them!ANOTHER GREAT TAKEDOWN!
