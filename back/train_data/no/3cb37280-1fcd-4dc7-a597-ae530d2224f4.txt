president trump just put this to bed !
the leakers are hopefully going to be exposed now ( see statement below ) that the doj has appointed former fbi director robert mueller iii as special counsel to its investigation into possible russian interference in our presidential election .
the wall street journal reported : deputy attorney general rod rosenstein announced the appointment because attorney general jeff sessions recused himself from any investigation related to the 2016 race .
mr. rosenstein said in a statement that i determined that it is in the public interest for me to exercise my authority and appoint a special counsel to assume responsibility of this matter .
he cautioned that his decision wasn t the result of a finding that crimes have been committed or that any prosecution is warranted .
he signed the order on wednesday .
mr. mueller , a former federal prosecutor , served as fbi director from 2001 through 2013 and has a reputation for independence .

they will now be fair game !
