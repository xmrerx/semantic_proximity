close your eyes and picture speaker of the house paul ryan ( r-wi ) telling a white radio host that he wouldn t rule out an all-white party .
now picture his political career and his personal life being destroyed .
will the same thing happen to maxine waters , the woman the democrat party is talking about electing as their next leader ? waters joined the breakfast club radio show on monday morning and was asked if it was time for black people to form their own political party .
no , not at this point , waters said .
you have to show that you re willing and you re able to put the numbers together and exercise your influence .
we still are not voting our influence yet , she continued .
what we should do is organize our power , exercise our power , particularly in the democratic party because that s where most of us are .
waters then suggested that when black people are strong enough they may branch out into their own party .
