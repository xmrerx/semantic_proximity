beirut ( reuters ) - an islamic state evacuation convoy trying to reach is territory in east syria has split in two , with some buses remaining in the open desert after others turned back into government-held areas , a u.s.-led coalition fighting the group said on sunday .
the syrian government and lebanon s hezbollah group offered the convoy of about 300 lightly armed fighters and about 300 family members safe passage a week ago in return for islamic state surrendering an enclave on the syria-lebanon border .
however , the coalition has blocked the convoy from entering islamic state territory in east syria , near the border with iraq , by cratering roads and destroying bridges , saying it opposes the evacuation deal as being not a lasting solution .
one group remains in the open desert to the north west of al-bukamal and the other group has headed west towards palmyra , the coalition said in an emailed statement .
on saturday hezbollah said all but six of the buses had safely crossed out of syrian government territory and were no longer the responsibility of it or the syrian government .
it warned the united states that the buses in the desert included elderly people , pregnant women and casualties , and accused it of stopping humanitarian aid reaching the convoy .
the coalition said it had contacted russia to deliver a message to the syrian government that it would still not let the convoy pass , and that it had offered suggestions on how to save the civilians in it from suffering .
food and water have been provided to the convoy , it said , without giving further details .
the coalition has said it will not target the convoy directly while it contains civilians , but said in its statement it had struck about 85 is fighters near the convoy .
it had also struck about 40 is vehicles near the convoy including a tank , an artillery system , armed vehicles and transport vehicles seeking to help move the fighters in the convoy into its territory , it said .
