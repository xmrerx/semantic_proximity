President-elect Donald Trump has been a sore subject for Speaker of the House Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI).
Not only did Ryan speak out against Trump multiple times during his presidential campaign (but stopped short of pulling his endorsement), but Ryan is getting exceedingly worse at defending the President-elect as time goes on.Last night, Ryan gave an extremely awkward, cringeworthy interview on CBS 60 Minutes.
Every time Scott Pelley tried to grill Ryan on Trump, the Speaker of the House pretty much crumbled under the pressure.The most hilarious part of the interview was when Pelley asked Ryan about Trump s recent claim that millions of people voted illegally, therefore costing him the popular vote.
Pelley asked: Trump tweeted in the last week or so that he had actually won the popular vote if you deduct the millions that voted illegally.
Do you believe that?
You can practically see Ryan s skin crawling.
Ryan was noticeably uncomfortable with the question, and went into survival mode by playing dumb.
REAL dumb.
Blinking uncomfortably, Ryan said, I don t know, I m not really focused on these things.
Pelley cornered Ryan and pressed him, Wait a minute, wait a minute.
You have an opinion on whether millions of Americans voted illegally.
And Ryan got even dumber, right before our eyes.
He said: I have no way of backing that up.
I have no knowledge of such things.
Ryan eventually gave up and without ever really answering the question, he said: It doesn t matter to me.
He won the election.
You can watch the humiliating interview below:It s no secret that Ryan and Trump have had a rocky relationship.
Unfortunately, these super-awkward interviews are about to become more frequent, as Trump and Ryan try to get along and make some sort of peace before Trump begins his term.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images
