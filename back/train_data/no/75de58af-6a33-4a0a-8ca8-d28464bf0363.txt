dakar ( reuters ) - a long-awaited multi-national military force in africa s sahel region has begun operations to counter escalating islamist insurgencies , participants in the joint effort said on thursday .
the g5 sahel force , backed by france and the united states , launched its campaign on oct. 28 amid growing unrest in the desert reaches of the sahel , where jihadists such as al qaeda and islamic state-affiliated groups roam undetected , often across long , porous borders .
last month , islamist militants killed four u.s. soldiers and at least four nigeriens in an ambush that highlighted the risks of operating in the remote region .
g5 sahel is made up of troops from mali , niger , chad , burkina faso and mauritania that will police the region in collaboration with 4,000 french troops deployed there since intervening in 2013 to beat back an insurgency in northern mali .
the first mission , called haw bi , comprises several hundred soldiers from mali , niger and burkina faso , whose shared borderlands have been the epicenter of a surge in militant attacks , g5 sahel said in a statement .
the operation ... aims to achieve an area of control in this region of three borders to fight against armed groups and trafficking , in order to allow the return of a level of security favorable to the tranquility of the populations , the statement said .
the force will eventually swell to 5,000 men from 7 battalions and will also engage in humanitarian and development work , it said .
g5 sahel , whose command base is in sevare in central mali , will also coordinate with minusma , mali s u.n. peacekeeping mission .
minusma has faced frequent attacks in the north where islamists have regained ground since 2013 .
the new force faces a number of challenges , not least in funding .
the united states this week promised up to $ 60 million in support , but that fell short of hopes by france and others that washington would back direct funding from the united nations .
