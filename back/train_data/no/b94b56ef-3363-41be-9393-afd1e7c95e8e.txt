as usual milwaukee s outspoken sheriff david clarke nails it chicago has plunged ever further into chaos as gang violence gripped the city for yet another weekend.under the rule of democratic mayor rahm emanuel , the city has seen some of its worst violence in over two decades .
there have been more than 750 shooting deaths in 2016 alone .
over the christmas weekend , 50 people were shot , and 12 were killed double the number from last year .
gang violence accounts for most of the killings nearly 90 % and the perpetrators all had long criminal histories .
most are targeted attacks between rival gangs , according to chicago police superintendent eddie johnson .
during his press conference on monday , johnson said they recovered 45 guns from the streets over the holiday weekend.these guns didn t come from law-abiding chicagoans who face some of the strictest gun laws in the country , but from hardened criminals who don t obey laws .
johnson knows that stricter gun laws never stops violence : these gun offenders have repeatedly shown us that they re not going to play by society s rules .
so , he s calling for tougher penalties for repeat gun offenders .
it s painfully obvious more gun laws will do nothing.it s time democrat ghetto hellholes like chicago pay attention to what s happening in their pro-gun controlled cities instead of learning the hard way that criminals don t care what laws are on the books .
it s never acceptable to take away the rights of good people to offer the illusion of safety .
crack down on crime , make the punishments severe , and allow law-abiding citizens protect themselves .
