The Republican Convention in Cleveland is facing a financial shortfall, and senior party officials are begging for dollars while nominee Donald Trump continues to claim that he is worth at least $10 billion.Politico reports that the party needs money to cover the bills for the event because sponsors they were relying on have pulled out as a result of Donald Trump s bigoted comments and policies.Millions of dollars short and running out of time, organizers of the Republican National Convention have written an urgent request for $6 million to Las Vegas billionaire couple Sheldon and Miriam Adelson to cover the bills for next week s festivities.In a letter addressed to the Adelsons, obtained by POLITICO, the Cleveland 2016 Host Committee revealed the names of more than two dozen prominent corporations and individuals who have reneged on a collective $8.1 million in pledged donations.The letter notes: Over the past couple months, negative publicity around our potential nominee resulted in a considerable number of pledges backing out from their commitments.
Politico reports that among those who have backed out of the convention are:David Koch ($1 million), FedEx ($500,000), Visa ($100,000) and both Pepsi ($500,000) and Coca-Cola ($1 million).What isn t explained is why the RNC is hitting up casino billionaire Adelson for this money, when according to his claims about his net worth, $6 million should be no problem for Donald Trump.
The incident again raises the question of whether Trump is telling the truth about his net worth or not.
He refuses to release his tax returns, so no independent assessment of his wealth is available, though he has previously testified to being far less wealthy than his current $10 billion claim.The funding shortfall is just the latest headache to hit the Republican convention.
Concerns are growing about safety, as Ohio is an open-carry state and many pro-Trump protesters have said they plan to carry their guns in response to planned protests from progressive groups.Also, party chairman Reince Priebus and Trump campaign boss Paul Manafort have had to head off efforts by so-called Never Trump delegates who could turn the nomination process into an embarrassing television spectacle if they vote against the nominee.Featured image via Flickr
