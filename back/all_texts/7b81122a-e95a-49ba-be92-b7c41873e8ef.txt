When a woman in the audience objected, Lopez went off on an unbelievable, vile rant against her ***WARNING***Strong language*** There are only two rules in the Latino family.
Don t marry somebody black, and don t park in front of our house, Lopez said during his set, which prompted a woman in the audience to put up her middle finger.In a clip of the incident obtained by TMZ, Lopez is seen responding to the woman s gesture by calling her a bitch and telling her, Sit your f**king ass down or get the f**k out.
Sit your f**king ass down, Lopez repeated three times.
I m talking, bitch.
You paid to see a show.
Sit your ass down.
You can t take a joke, you re in the wrong motherf**king place.
Sit your f**king ass down or get the f**k out of here.
You have two choices, he continued.
Shut the f**k up or get the f**k out.
I ll tell you what.
I ll make the choice for you.
Get the f**k out of here.
I ll make the choice for you.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
