WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A spokesman for President-elect Donald Trump accused Democratic Senate leader Chuck Schumer on Thursday of “stalling tactics” for slowing confirmation of the incoming Republican president’s Cabinet picks.
Schumer should recognize that “this is more about continuity of government and ensuring that these qualified individuals get voted on as soon as possible so that we can lead this country forward,” spokesman Sean Spicer said at a news briefing.
