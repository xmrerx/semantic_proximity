when an audience member asks kellyanne conway if trump will continue to use twitter as a means to communicate with americans , he ended his comment with a swipe at trump not being entirely truthful with his tweets .
kellyanne conway responded that it would be up to him and the secret service , and that he looks at it as a very good platform for him to convey his messages.jake tapper suggested that trump s tweet about 3 million illegal aliens voting in the election was false .
of course tapper has no evidence to back up his assertion .
the state of california alone has over 2.6 million illegal aliens who could ve technically voted in the election .
in fact , the two top counties where hillary received the most votes , are coincidentally the same two counties who have the highest percentage of illegal aliens .
in october , 2015 , a california state bill was signed in to law by gov .
jerry brown , that registers and allows illegal aliens to vote in us elections .
so just in the state of california alone , over 2.6 million illegal aliens could have voted in the election .
we haven t even talked about the illegal aliens who weren t caught voting in this election because of loopholes in states that allowed illegal aliens to register to vote when they obtained legal drivers licenses.but tapper pressed on asking : tapper : is that really presidential behavior ?
conway : well he s the president-elect , so that s presidential behavior , yes .
tapper : so the things that bill clinton did in the oval office , that you criticized , those weren t presidential ?
conway : should we review for those who weren t born yet what president clinton did in the oval office ?
boom ! https : //youtu.be/t7tc3gr0d5m
