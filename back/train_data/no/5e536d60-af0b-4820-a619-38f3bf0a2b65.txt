oops !
the narrative isn t fitting the truth and the truth is : despite police commissioner anthony w. batts insistence that a minority of out-of-town instigators caused the violence , online court records sunday showed that only three of those arrested during saturday s protests were from outside maryland .
rep. elijah cummings ( d-md . )
alleged sunday that many rioters in baltimore the previous night were from out of town , noting that he was amid crowds in the area.a protest over the death of freddie gray , a black 25-year-old , in police custody turned violent as some went on a rampage as darkness fell , seen smashing windows and throwing objects at police .
i ve got ta give it to the citizens of baltimore .
i was there all day , and it was very peaceful all day , cummings said on cbs s face the nation .
at the end , there were a few people that said , we re gon na turn this city down , we re gon na close it down .
and the next thing you know we had a few people mainly from out of town to come and to start beating up on police cars and throwing all kinds of projectiles , cummings alleged.at least a dozen people were arrested , according to the associated press .
police also kept baltimore orioles fans inside the ballpark as they cleared an area outside , which cummings called a smart idea .
this whole police community relations situation , bob , is the civil rights cause for this generation , no doubt about it , cummings told host bob schieffer on sunday.cummings noted that the maryland delegation in congress had asked for the department of justice to conduct a civil rights investigation into the death of gray .
we ve got to take this department apart and try to figure out what is wrong and what is right , he said , referring to local police .
