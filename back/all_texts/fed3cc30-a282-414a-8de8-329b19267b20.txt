(Reuters) - United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres condemned North Korea s nuclear test on Sunday as profoundly destabilizing for regional security and called on the country s leadership to cease such acts, his spokesman said in a statement.
This act is yet another serious breach of the DPRK s international obligations and undermines international non-proliferation and disarmament efforts.
This act is also profoundly destabilizing for regional security, U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said.
North Korea is also known as the DPRK.
