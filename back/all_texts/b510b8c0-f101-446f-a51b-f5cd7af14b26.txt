This is great!
Ted Cruz calls out the Sierra Club President on his bogus 97% scientific consensus on global warming.
When asked about the 18 year pause in global warming, as documented by satellite data, Mr. Mair denied it exists.
So if the data are contrary to your testimony, would the Sierra Club issue a retraction?
Cruz asked.
Sir, we concur with the 97 percent scientific consensus with regards to global warming, Mair responded.
After some back and forth between the two, Cruz sent the money shot in with this comment: You know, Mr. Mair, I find it striking that for a policy organization that purports to focus exclusively on environmental issues, that you are not willing to tell this committee that you would issue a retraction if your testimony is objectively false under scientific data.
That undermines the credibility of any organization.
