If you didn t know, Friday was Holocaust Remembrance Day a day in which we remember the victims of a man who was very much like our current President*.
Surprisingly, someone on Donald Trump s staff took time away from celebrating the other side of that battle and put out a halfhearted, generic, and disrespectful statement on his behalf one which Trump then made his own by tweeting it the American people:Statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day: https://t.co/KjU0MOxCHk Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 27, 2017Trump s statement is three paragraphs long and reads like it was written by the same guy who has been writing his executive orders white supremacist Steve Bannon.
Trump says he wants to honor the victims, survivors, heroes of the Holocaust though many of his neo-Nazi supporters would surely disagree with others on the identities of the heroes of the Holocaust.
Notably, Trump didn t specifically mention Jewish people a single time a clear fan service for the Klansmen and Sieg Heilers who rally behind him.Trump concludes with a pledge to do everything in his power to ensure that the forces of evil never again defeat the powers of good.
For instance, if a thin-skinned egomaniac backed by an army of neo-Nazis, Christofascists, and other assorted terrible people teamed up with a foreign dictator to manipulate the election and place himself in the Oval Office so he can build a walkl to keep brown people out of the country, ban people of a specific religion from entering, and generally abuse the powers of the office to make the bigoted dreams of his deplorable supporters come to life Trump would totally put a stop to that.
Together, we will make love and tolerance prevalent throughout the world, said the man who is Holocaust Remembrance Day signing an executive order banning refugees from countries he thinks have too many Muslims.If this all seems crazy and hypocritical to you, you re not the only one.
Seemingly all of Twitter showed up to kick Trump in his tiny orange nards:@realDonaldTrump dude neo-Nazis love you Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) January 27, 2017@realDonaldTrump your Chief Strategist's ex-wife says he doesn't like Jews in a sworn court declaration: https://t.co/ZBFZ83Vci8 Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) January 27, 2017.

@realDonaldTrump You're banning people from America because of their religion, turning away refugees and building a racist wall.

@realDonaldTrump Maybe you could honor victims of the Holocaust by not ushering in another ethnic cleansing?
#HolocaustMemorialDay Keegan Stephan (@KeeganNYC) January 27, 2017@realDonaldTrump Your statement forgot to mention Jews.
Brendan Carroll (@_brendancarroll) January 27, 2017@realDonaldTrump but your supporters aren't racist or anti-Semitic, right?

You must be DELUSIONAL not to get that!

Baked Alaska (@bakedalaska) January 27, 2017@bakedalaska @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/8SJJTVOnRp That Mika Face (@CT_muhdick) January 27, 2017Trump is a guy who has done nothing but attack people for their ethnicity, gender, and race since he assumed office a week ago.
In that time he has signed executive orders banning a large number of Muslims from entering the country based solely on where they live and effectively signing the death warrants of countless would-be refugees, stripped federal funding from any international health organization that so much as mentions abortion, ordered the construction of a wall along our southern border and authorized the construction of concentration camps for undocumented immigrants.
During his campaign, he retweeted neo-Nazis and their propaganda almost constantly.He should probably just not talk about the Holocaust.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)/screengrab
