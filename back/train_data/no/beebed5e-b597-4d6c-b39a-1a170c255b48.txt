michelle came out of hiding today to take a baseball bat to president trump .
she spoke to an audience about nutrition and started out her speech by attacking president trump , we got ta make sure we don t let anybody [ trump ] take us back .
because the question is where we going back to ?
and this is where you really have to look at motives .
ya know i mean , you have to stop and think , why don t you want our kids to have good food at school ?
what is wrong with you ?
and then for the kicker , immediately after she lobs a direct verbal bomb at president trump , she asks , why is that a partisan issue ?
why would that be political ? mooch then goes on to call mom s to take action against trump .
she tells the audience , here s the secret if someone [ trump ] is doing that ( taking her crappy lunches out of school cafeteria s ) they don t care about your kids .
can anyone imagine laura bush coming out on her first public appearance after leaving the white house and accusing the newly ordained barack obama of not caring about your kids ?
i can guarantee you d be hearing about it in more places than just conservative media sources like 100percentfedup.com ! it s a question she should have asked herself .
in case anyone has forgotten what mooch s lunches for kids that she cared so deeply for looked like , we ve included a few examples of photos that were posted to social media of mooch s crap sandwiches .
hopefully these photos won t ruin your appetite for your next meal : wow !
i bet the kids couldn t wait to dig into this mystery meal : fresh catch sandwich with fresh sweet corn ! here s michelle s version of pizza :
