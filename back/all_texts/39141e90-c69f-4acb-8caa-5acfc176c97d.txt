GREENSBORO, N.C. (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Friday accused Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim of trying to help Democrat Hillary Clinton win the Nov. 8 election through his connection to the New York Times.
At a rally in Greensboro, North Carolina, Trump also again said a variety of women who have accused him of making unwanted sexual advances are making up their stories.
Trump said Slim, as a major New York Times shareholder, is helping bankroll what he called the Times’ attempt to help Clinton win the presidential election.
The Times published a story from two women accusing Trump of groping them.
“They’re not journalists,” Trump said of the Times reporters.
“They’re corporate lobbyists for Carlos Slim and foreign corporations.”
