Last week the Commerce Department released its third revision for fourth-quarter 2016 gross domestic product.
The number came in at a paltry 2.1 percent, meaning that growth during President Obama s final year in office the end of an Error of Hope landed with a big thud at just 1.6 percent.That low-water mark puts the Obama presidency in last place among all the post-World War II presidents when it comes to economic growth.There have been 13 post-WWII presidents, beginning with Harry Truman, who had the disadvantage of beginning in the aftermath of war in 1946, during which the economy contracted 11.6 percent four times the contraction any other negative year since and even he bested Obama s economic record!Truman, a moderate Democrat, also posted the two best years of growth on record: 1950 at 8.7 percent and 1951 at 8 percent, and there was no zero percent interest rate to gin up the economy back then.Thirteenth of 13 presidents is no mild distinction.
Obama had eight full years to enact a growth policy, while many of his predecessors never had two complete terms.
George H.W.
Bush and Jimmy Carter had just four years each, Gerald Ford had less than three years and Richard Nixon had five.I m not the least bit surprised the Obama economy was a failure.

Bush (1989-92), 2.3 percent G.W.
Bush (2001-08), 2.1 percent Truman (1946-52), 1.7 percent Obama (2009-16), 1.6 percentVia: NYP
