madrid ( reuters ) - spanish police on friday detained a man they said had a close relationship with a number of those involved in last month s attacks in barcelona when militant islamists used a van to hit pedestrians and carried out a follow-up attack , killing 16 .
the moroccan man , 24 , is a resident in spain and had connections to the islamist cell which took part in the attack , especially the imam abdelbaki es satty , the interior ministry said in a statement .
police are looking at the man s part in the acquisition of materials , specifically hydrogen peroxide , which was used in the manufacture of some 100 kilos of tatp explosives , the ministry said .
the cell had accumulated around 120 canisters of butane gas at a house in a town south of barcelona with which , police said following the attacks , it had planned to carry out a larger bomb attack .
a blast that destroyed the house in the town of alcanar on aug. 16 , the eve of the barcelona attack , was accidentally triggered by the cell , police say .
satty , said to be the leader of the militant group , died in the explosion .
six of the suspects were killed by police during the attacks and four have been arrested , with two held in prison .
spanish police have arrested 201 people they claim are associated with militant islamists since raising the alert level to 4 , the second highest , in june 2015 .
