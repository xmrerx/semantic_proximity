At the second presidential debate, Donald Trump had a chance to address the controversy surrounding his claim that he greets seemingly every woman he meets by grabbing them by the pussy.
To Trump, this was locker room talk, though I can t say I have ever been in a locker room in which anyone has bragged about sexually assaulting women.
To the rest of us, it was a horrific reminder that the 2016 GOP nominee is exactly the sort of person to make creepy sexual remarks about his own daughter a man who has been sued for grabbing someone by the pussy (the woman was branded a liar), who is being sued for the sexual assault of a 13-year-old girl, and who admitted he was attracted to 12-year-old Paris Hilton.Asked if The Donald had actually sexually assaulted women, he repeated that it was locker room talk (whatever that means), but was reticent to admit that he doesn t walk about grabbing women by the pussy largely because, one can safely assume, he can not honestly say that he has not sexually assaulted a woman.
Sniffles deflected to ISIS for a while before explaining that it s just one of those things.
Asked if he has ever kissed or groped a woman without her consent, Trump replied that he has great respect for women and that nobody has more respect for women than he does.
For the record, you re saying you never did that, Anderson Cooper said, fishing for clarification.
I ve said things, you hear these things I ve said, and I was embarrassed by it but I have tremendous respect for women and they have respect for me, Trump said, once again evading the question.
Have you ever done those things?
Cooper pressed, finally earning an offhanded no I have not from Trump before he went on to call Bill Clinton a rapist.Watch it below:
