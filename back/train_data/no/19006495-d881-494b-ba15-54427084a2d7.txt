we got here because we switched from a policy of americanism , to a policy of globalism focusing on how to make money for large corporations .
she believes she is entitled to the office .
she gets rich making you poor .
it s not just our economy that s been corrupted , but our foreign policy too .
the hillary clinton foreign policy has cost america thousands of lives , trillions of dollars , and unleashed isis across the world .
her decisions spread death , destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched .
in 2009 , before hillary clinton was sworn in , it was a different world .
libya was cooperating , iraq was seeing a reduction in violence , syria was under control , isis wasn t even on the map .
