wow !
it was an all out brawl at the nv dem convention : the hill reported : tensions were high at the democratic convention in nevada saturday , with bernie sanders supporters demanding delegate recounts , booing sen. barbara boxer ( d-calif. ) and causing other disruptions , according to local media reports .
keep on booing and boo yourself out of this election .we had our nevada caucus and hillary clinton won , barbaraboxer sanders supporters were angry over a voice vote that adopted a set of temporary convention rules as the permanent rules , according to the las vegas sun.and supporters also reacted angrily to the count of delegates attending the convention , which put hillary clinton at an advantage .
final numbers announced later in the day showed 1,695 clinton supporters in attendance to sanders s 1,662 .
the focus has been all on the trump/third party situation but the bernie/hillary situation is what the press might want to focus on an all out brawl happened at the nv dem convention .
here s a little sample of just how ugly it got : fight breaks out - call a medic !
fight just broke out .
