She was sitting in front of a coal sucks poster in the office of California s top state senator.Former EPA chief Gina McCarthy huddled with Democratic lawmakers in Sacramento Thursday to advise them on how the state could move forward with policies aimed at fighting global warming while the Trump administration dismantled Obama s environmental agenda.McCarthy took over EPA in Obama s second term and oversaw the implementation of the president s Climate Action Plan, which included sweeping regulations on power plants and natural gas wells.
