legal expert jonathan turley listened as joe scarborough laid out a lengthy timeline to make a case of obstruction on president trump .
his response is awesome and very precise in its reasons for not recommending obstruction charges .
turley is a democrat but is a very fair legal expert who rules according to the law how refreshing !
while the left freaks out about nothing , the people like turley who are really qualified to judge this are saying it s a nothingburger .
we don t even have evidence of wrongdoing but talk of impeachment is all over the place.please sit back , relax and listen to the voice of reason professor jonathan turley : there was ample reason to fire sally yates when , as acting attorney general , she instructed the department of justice not to enforce president trump s executive order on immigration .
obstruction of justice requires that you act to obstruct or interfere usually with a judicial or congressional proceeding , neither of which was pending at this time .
you also tend to show it was done for a corrupt , or corruptly , to use the statutory term .
this doesn t meet the usual definition of that .
