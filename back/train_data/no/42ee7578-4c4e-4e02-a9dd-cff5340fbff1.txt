manila ( reuters ) - philippine president rodrigo duterte said on wednesday he would tell u.s. president donald trump to lay off if he raises the issue of human rights when they meet .
trump will be in manila on the last leg of his 12-day asian trip , which includes visits to japan , south korea , china , and vietnam .
trump will attend the asia-pacific economic cooperation summit in danang , vietnam , make a state visit to hanoi and end his trip with the association of south east asia nations summit in manila .
duterte , who brooks no criticism of his human rights record and war on drugs , offered a comment on what he would tell trump if he raised human rights .
you want to ask a question , i ll give you an answer .
lay off .
that is not your business .
that is my business .
i take care of my country and i will nurture my country to health , duterte told reporters before leaving for vietnam .
more than 3,900 filipinos have been killed in what the police called self-defense after armed suspects resisted arrest in duterte s war on drugs .
critics dispute that and say executions are taking place with zero accountability , allegations the police reject .
duterte was infuriated by expressions of concern by former president barack obama s administration about extrajudicial killings in the philippines .
human rights , rule of law and due process were among topics trump and duterte would likely discuss during their bilateral talks , sung kim , u.s. ambassador to manila , said last month .
but trump , who has been criticized at home for neglecting rights issues in dealings abroad , in may praised duterte for doing an unbelievable job on the drug problem .
