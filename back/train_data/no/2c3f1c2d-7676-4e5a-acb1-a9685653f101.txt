caracas ( reuters ) - venezuelan president nicolas maduro s approval rating rose to 23 percent in september , up 6 percentage points from 17 percent in july , according to a poll by local firm datanalisis .
the rebound followed several rounds of sanctions by u.s. president donald trump s administration as well as a sharp drop-off in four months of violent anti-government protests .
nearly 52 percent of respondents opposed the trump administration sanctions that came in response to the creation of a legislative superbody called the constituent assembly , which critics call the consolidation of a dictatorship .
fifty-seven percent said they disagreed with the united states using a military option to push for change in venezuela , in reference to trump comments in august that were met with condemnation around the region .
maduro s low approval is not unusual in latin america .
presidents juan manuel santos in colombia and michel temer in brazil have shown lower poll numbers this year .
but maduro s popularity has been falling since he was narrowly elected in 2013 following the death of late socialist leader hugo chavez .
the decline has largely resulted from an economic crisis driven by triple-digit inflation and soviet-style shortages .
the opposition says the crisis is the result of a failing socialist model and rampant corruption .
maduro blames the situation on an economic war by the opposition with the support of washington .
the poll , which surveyed 1,000 people between sept. 8 and sept. 22 , showed that 86.9 percent of respondents believed the country s situation was negative .
the survey s margin of error was 3.04 percentage points .
