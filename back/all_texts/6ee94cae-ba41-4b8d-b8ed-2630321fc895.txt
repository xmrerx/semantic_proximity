Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is planning a second attempt at running for Congress, ostensibly after her Dad uses alien technology to transfer the remaining essence of his dark energy into her not-quite-yet poisoned soul, allowing her to continue his twisted Supreme-Leader-Snoke-like legacy beyond his own lifetime.Seriously, Liz Cheney is running for Congress in Wyoming s only congressional district.
(Wyoming is basically an empty square on the map, and not enough population to facilitate any more than a single member of the House.)
Cheney intends to run for the seat being vacated by the state s sitting GOP congresswoman, Cynthia Lummis, who s held that seat since 2009 and is retiring at the end of this term.And, of course, Dick Cheney held that seat for ten years, from 1979 through 1989 when he resigned to become George H.W.
Bush s Secretary of Defense long before his blood was replaced with sand, pumped through his corroded veins using ancient steampunk dials and cogs.Liz Cheney previously ran for Senate, primary-challenging Mike Enzi, but she was unable to capture to support of the party.
Cheney faces an uphill climb against a field of eight GOP hopefuls, several of them being popular state legislators.Yes, what we really need in the United States is a Cheney Dynasty, consisting of generations of Cheneys holding public office and bilking taxpayers with unnecessary wars and no-bid contracts for buddies in the defense industry.Just for fun, here s a clip via Crooks & Liars of Bill Maher presenting a series of potential campaign posters for Liz Cheney s would-be run for president back in 2012.
She, of course, didn t run, but this is pretty damn funny anyway.
Note that Cheney was referred to in the press as Palin with a Pedigree.
