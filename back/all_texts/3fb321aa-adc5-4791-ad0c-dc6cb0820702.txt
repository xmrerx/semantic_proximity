We told you so a man was having a blast peeping into stalls in the restroom AND filming women!
Not one but three times this year!
This man was basically given a slap on the hand and let go.
This is yet another reason to keep bathrooms the way they are.
With new laws, more men like this can say they identify as a woman so they can get into locker rooms or bathrooms legally.
A man dressed as a woman was arrested in Virginia on Monday after police say he was caught peeping into restroom stalls three times in the past year.
Richard Rodriguez, 30, filmed a woman in a bathroom stall at the Potomac Mills Mall, Prince William County Police said on Tuesday.
A 35-year-old woman was in the stall when she saw a bag moved toward her under the stall divider.
Rodriguez apparently had been filming her, police said.
The victim rushed out of the stall to confront the man and saw him hurry to another stall, next to another woman.
The victim alerted the woman and then contacted mall security of the shopping center on 2700 block of Potomac Mills Circle in Woodbridge, Virginia.Mall security detained Rodriguez until police arrived.
Police then determined that he matches the description of a man who is accused of using a mirror to see into a women s restroom stall on May 15 at a nearby Walmart and also at the Potomac Mills Mall on Oct. 11.
The suspect in the May 15 incident allegedly spied on a 53-year-old woman, police said.
The suspect in the Oct. 11 incident believed to be the same man looked in on a 35-year-old woman and her 5-year-old daughter.
Rodriguez, of Fredericksburg, was charged with three counts of unlawful filming of a non-consenting person and three counts of peeping.Via: NBC
