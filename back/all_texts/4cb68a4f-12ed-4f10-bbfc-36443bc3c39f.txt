First she won the coin toss in Iowa, and now Hillary walks away a WINNER even though she lost in a landslide to Marxist Vermont Senator, Bernie Sanders.
Never underestimate the power of the Clinton machine If you thought Bernie Sanders won the New Hampshire primary, you d be mistaken.
He won the popular vote by 22 percent, but New Hampshire has Super Delegates who don t have to answer to the voters and they re going with Hillary!No wonder the Hillary campaign looked like they were throwing a massive party after last night s crushing defeat at the polls.Sanders won 60 percent of the vote, but thanks to the Democratic Party s nominating system, he leaves the Granite State with at least 13 delegates while she leaves with at least 15 delegates.New Hampshire has 24 pledged delegates, which are allotted based on the popular vote.
Sanders has 13, and Clinton has 9, with 2 currently allotted to neither.But under Democratic National Committee rules, New Hampshire also has 8 superdelegates, party officials who are free to commit to whomever they like, regardless of how their state votes.
Their votes count the same as delegates won through the primary.And they call themsleves the Democratic party.UPDATE:The fix is in for Hillary.
If you followed the link to the article, at the bottom is says after a razor-thin victory in Iowa and a shellacking in New Hampshire, Clinton has 394 delegates and Sanders has 42.
