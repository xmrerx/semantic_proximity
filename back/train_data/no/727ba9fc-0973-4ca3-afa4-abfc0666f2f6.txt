bangkok ( reuters ) - police in thailand on wednesday arrested a woman wanted in connection with a 2015 bombing in bangkok that killed 20 people , 14 of them foreign tourists .
the blast at a central bangkok shrine popular with visitors from china and elsewhere in asia raised fears of a spillover of violence from china s western xinjiang region , where some members of the uighur muslim minority oppose beijing s rule .
no group claimed responsibility for the blast that killed five people from mainland china and two from hong kong and wounded more than 120 people .
the thai woman suspect , wan na suansan , 29 was arrested at bangkok airport , said deputy national police chief srivara ransibrahmanakul .
he declined to say where she had arrived from .
wan na faced various charges including premeditated murder and co-possession of explosives and weapons , police said .
she is one of 17 people wanted in connection with the bombing .
after questioning police will send her to prosecutors , srivara told reporters at bangkok s national police headquarters .
two ethnic muslim uighur men from china were accused of carrying out the bomb attack and are on trial in thailand .
they have denied all charges .
investigators said in 2015 wan na rented a room in bangkok to one of those men .
she fled the country shortly after the attack .
police ruled out terrorism , saying the bombing was prompted by a crackdown on human smuggling networks .
but many analysts and diplomats said it was likely an act of revenge for thailand s deportation to china of the more than 100 uighurs in july that year .
a relative of wan na s told reporters at the national police headquarters that wan na wanted to come back to thailand to prove her innocence .
