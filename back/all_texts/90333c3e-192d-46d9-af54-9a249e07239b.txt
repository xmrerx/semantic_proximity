Here s just one more piece to the puzzle Hillary was able to delete the money trail with bleach bit The owner of BleachBit was tipped off that his product was used by Clinton when Trey Gowdy mentioned it in a TV interview: Gowdy said Clinton s emails had been so thoroughly scrubbed that even God can t read them.
How transparent of her!BleachBit s creator says Hillary may have chosen that program to scrub emails because it doesn t leave a money trail .Hillary Clinton s decision to use BleachBit to scrub her private email server could have been based on the fact that the free software can be downloaded and used with complete anonymity, the program s developer said.Andrew Ziem, the creator of BleachBit, pointed to a recent CNN report about his software in which a computer security expert had speculated that Clinton s team would have selected a more expensive, more sophisticated service if it truly sought to conceal records.
While there may be some merit to that, there is also an argument to be made for hoping that this doesn t leave a money trail.

He noted his website has experienced a spike in traffic since Clinton s use of BleachBit was revealed.Read more: Washington Examiner
