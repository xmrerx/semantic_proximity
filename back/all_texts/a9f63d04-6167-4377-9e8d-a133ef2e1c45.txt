Who doesn t love Weird Al Yankovic and his hilarious parodies of famous songs?
This time, though, he teamed up with Songify to re-enact the third presidential debate, poking special fun at two of Donald Trump s many terrible moments.
It also relives some of Hillary s most searing burns, and is just all-around perfect.The song is titled, Bad Hombres, Nasty Women, which are two of the quotes that the junkyard heap known as Donald Trump is most remembered for right now.
The video not only features both Hillary and Trump autotuned to fit the music, but also features Weird Al himself in the role of the moderator.The first words of the song, in fact, are, Such a nasty woman, from Trump, and then Hillary joins in with: He choked.
He choked.
He goes around with crocodile tears, to which Trump can only say, Such a nasty woman.
A little bit later on, Weird Al asks the candidates a very important question: To stop a Cold War, what should we be doin ?
Would you go thumb-wrestle Vladimir Putin?
We have so many adversaries overseas.
Can we all agree to be frenemies?
Finally, no song about the third debate would be complete without making fun of the Donald s ongoing use of the word, Bigly, and Weird Al works it in like the maestro he is.
But, perhaps one of the best parts are the expressions on Weird Al s face as Hillary and King Cheeto answer his questions.
