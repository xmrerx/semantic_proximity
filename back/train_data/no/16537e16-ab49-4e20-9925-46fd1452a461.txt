london ( reuters ) - britain is less likely to leave the european union without an agreed exit deal after last week s decision by the european commission to recommend that talks move on to the next phase , brexit minister david davis said on thursday .
i think no deal has become massively less probable after the decisions of last friday - and that s a good thing because the best deal is a tariff free , non-tariff barrier-free arrangement , davis told parliament .
he also said the government would have to think about how to respond to a decision by parliament to hand lawmakers more say over a final exit deal with the eu .
