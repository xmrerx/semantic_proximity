The whirlwind of chaos that follows Donald Trump everywhere he goes has just reached a level we ve never seen before.
It turns out, things are way, WAY worse than any of us could have even predicted!According to a new report by The Washington Post, it turns out that the undeserving POTUS isn t the only one who creates mayhem his staff is right behind him, and it s because they have ZERO loyalty to their awful boss.
In a heavily cited article, The Washington Post summed up Trump s shockingly erratic weekend in which he accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping his phones in the Trump Tower.
But more importantly, this article lists SEVENTEEN White House officials who spoke out against Trump under the protection of anonymity.
The article states: At the center of the turmoil is an impatient president increasingly frustrated by his administration s inability to erase the impression that his campaign was engaged with Russia, to stem leaks about both national security matters and internal discord and to implement any signature achievements.This account of the administration s tumultuous recent days is based on interviews with 17 top White House officials, members of Congress and friends of the president, many of whom requested anonymity to speak candidly.Gnawing at Trump, according to one of his advisers, is the comparison between his early track record and that of Obama in 2009, when amid the Great Recession he enacted an economic stimulus bill and other big-ticket items.
To make matters even worse for Trump, the photo The Washington Post chose as the leading photo is a photograph of Trump with his grandchildren while pointing out the fact that the sloppy former reality television star literally uses tape to hold his tie together:This couldn t be worse news for Trump, who has previously flipped out about leaks from within his staff.
