tripoli ( reuters ) - the bodies of 21 egyptian christians killed by islamic state in its former libyan stronghold of sirte have been recovered , the attorney general s office said on friday .
the bodies were found in the same orange jumpsuits the victims were wearing when they were filmed being killed in the coastal city in february 2015 , according to a statement provided to libya s al-ahrar tv channel .
sadiq al-sour , the head of investigations for the attorney general s office , said last week that the area where the bodies were buried had been identified after a captured commander gave details of its whereabouts .
islamic state took control of sirte in 2015 and lost the city late last year to local forces backed by u.s. air strikes .
