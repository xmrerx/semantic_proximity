WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Senator Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania on Wednesday endorsed Florida Senator Marco Rubio for the party’s nominee in the November U.S. presidential election.
“I think Marco Rubio is the strongest candidate to go up against Hillary Clinton ... but my real motivation is I think he’s going to be a really good president,” Toomey said in an interview on CNN, referring to the Democratic front-runner in the race for the Nov. 8 election.
