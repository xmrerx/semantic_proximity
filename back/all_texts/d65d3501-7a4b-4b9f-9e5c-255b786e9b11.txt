With the race for president getting hotter by the day, and now that both parties have their presumptive nominees pretty locked up, the gloves have clearly come off on either side.Donald Trump may have thought it was pretty easy to steamroll over his fellow Republicans during the primary, but now he s up against Hillary Clinton, and she s no newcomer to having everything plus the kitchen sink filled with day-old dishes thrown at her.It s becoming for evident that Trump is starting to flounder and that is pissing him off greatly.
His remarks on the federal judge of Mexican descent really began turning off his own party (as if they weren t listening to his racism before?)
and now after his politicizing of the shooting massacre of a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, well, his pathetic desperation is showing.Trump is actually trying albeit failing to appear as though he s better for women and the LGBT community than Hillary Clinton.So, when Trump asked: You tell me: who is better for the gay community and who is better for women than Donald Trump.
Trump: "You tell me: who is better for the gay community and who is better for women than Donald Trump."

Hi.

And for goodness sake, Trump, don t refer to yourself in the third person.Not only is Hillary better for women and the LGBT community, she s one million times better than Donald Trump on his best day, even if he were to be the Grand Marshall in a pride parade (you know you just pictured it).We can t allow Trump into the Oval Office, not just for women and the gay community, but for the whole nation and the entire world.Featured Photo by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images
