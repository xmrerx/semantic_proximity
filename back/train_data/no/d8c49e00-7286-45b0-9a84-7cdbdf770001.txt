dubai ( reuters ) - an iranian court has re-imposed the death penalty on the founder of a spiritual movement after the first sentence was struck down by the supreme court , the judiciary said on sunday .
mohammad ali taheri , founder of erfan halgheh which calls itself interuniversalism in english , was arrested in 2011 and given five years in prison for insulting islamic sanctities .
he was sentenced to death by a revolutionary court in 2015 for corruption on earth but the supreme court later quashed the sentence .
( taheri s ) case was sent back to court and tried with the presence of a lawyer and various advisors and the judge has again reached , judiciary spokesman gholamhossein mohseni ejei was quoted as saying by the news agency isna .
the sentence can be appealed , he added .
amnesty international says taheri is a prisoner of conscience and has condemned iran s use of capital punishment for vaguely worded or overly broad offences , or acts that should not be criminalized at all .
tehran dismisses such criticism as part of an effort from the west to heap political pressure on the islamic republic .
