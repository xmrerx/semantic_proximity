LONDON (Reuters) - Britain wants to reach an agreement with the European Union that would secure a frictionless border between EU member Ireland and Northern Ireland to avoid any need for queues on either side, junior Brexit minister Robin Walker said on Wednesday.
Settling the border with Northern Ireland has become one of the main sticking points in Britain s talks on leaving the European Union.
