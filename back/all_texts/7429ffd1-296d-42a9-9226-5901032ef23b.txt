Katie Couric took to Twitter to call out Charlottesville, VA protesters who allegedly sprayed urine at two of her producers.
What leftist hack Katie Couric doesn t mention is that the protesters who sprayed her producers with urine were actually ANTIFA protesters.
By leaving that little factoid out of her tweet, she has clearly attempted to mislead anyone reading her tweet into believing that the offending protesters were part of the white nationalist group.
While we strongly condemn any group that believes they are superior because of their race or skin color, these people actually obtained a permit to protest, and until Antifa showed up, their protest was peaceful.Two of my producers just got sprayed with urine.
Lovely.
Hard to keep your cool.

Throwing urine, feces, paint, chemicals, smoke canisters, & pepper spraying.
