disney has officially begun to push a gay agenda on children so young that many of them don t even know there are anatomical differences between themselves and their friends .
no matter , disney apparently has a gay agenda , and no child is too young to start pushing that agenda on our children .
just remember , no one is forcing you to take your kids to disney movies or buy their propaganda .
a controversy has been brewing for some time now over the sequel to frozen where mtv host , alexis isabel started a hashtag campaign : # giveelsaagirlfriend asking disney to make the elsa character a lesbian.let 's trend # giveelsaagirlfriend in hopes that @ disney will consider giving queer girls representation in princess form .
alexis isabel ( @ lexi4prez ) may 1 , 2016disney/pixar s upcoming film finding dory features a transgender stingray who transitions to become sting-rhonda , the film s star ellen degeneres revealed in an interview.the sequel to the 2003 smash hit finding nemo has already fueled speculation that it will be the first disney film to feature a lesbian couple , but degeneres , who voices the titular blue fang fish , told usa today in an interview that the film will feature a trans sting .
there s a stingray that s becoming sting-rhonda , so there s a trans sting in the movie , degeneres said.a representative for pixar didn t immediately return breitbart news s request for confirmation.in may , eagle-eyed viewers of the finding dory trailer speculated that the film would be the first disney project to feature a lesbian couple , after a blink-and-you ll-miss it shot of what appeared to be two women walking near a baby stroller.the creative team behind the film have not confirmed or denied whether the couple is , in fact , lesbian , and degeneres also remained mum on the subject in her interview with usa today .
i don t know if it s true or not or if she just has a bad short haircut , you know ?
degeneres joked .
who knows if she s a lesbian .
some fans of other disney film properties have lobbied the studio to include lgbt characters in its films.there is some recent precedent for gay disney characters ; earlier this year , an episode of abc s fairy-tale drama once upon a time featured a lesbian true love s kiss between ruby and the wizard of oz s dorothy.via : breitbart news
