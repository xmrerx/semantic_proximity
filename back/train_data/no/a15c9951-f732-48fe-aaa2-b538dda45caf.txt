cairo/beirut ( reuters ) - a ceasefire deal for a syrian rebel enclave south of damascus was reached on thursday , brokered by cairo and moscow , egyptian state media said .
the agreement , which includes the jaish al-islam rebel faction , went into effect at midday on thursday ( 1000 gmt ) , egyptian state television said .
we announced a preliminary agreement over the will to enter into a ceasefire and de-escalation deal for the area , jaish al-islam political leader mohammad alloush said in televised comments .
details would be worked out in the near future , he said .
the announcement did not name the exact area or towns covered by the ceasefire , and did not mention the syrian government .
there was no immediate comment from damascus .
rebel factions hold a small pocket of territory south of damascus , bordered to the west by an islamic state enclave and surrounded from the other sides by syrian troops and allied forces .
backed by russia , iran and shi ite militias , the syrian government has pushed back rebels over the past year , shoring up its rule over the main urban centers .
through a series of military offensives and evacuation deals , the government has snuffed out several opposition pockets around the syrian capital of damascus .
thousands of rebels and civilians have poured into the insurgent-held idlib province in northwest syria , transferred out of towns and cities that the syrian army retook .
in recent months , a string of ceasefire deals has eased some of the fighting between government forces and rebels in western syria , including a truce in the southwest brokered by russia and the united states .
