dhaka ( reuters ) - a fire in a textile factory in bangladesh killed six workers on wednesday before it was extinguished , police said , renewing fears about safety in the multi-billion dollar industry .
bangladesh s garment sector , the world s second biggest after china , drew worldwide scrutiny after more than 1,100 people were killed in the collapse of a factory complex in 2013 and 112 killed in a garment factory fire in 2012 .
police said wednesday s fire started on the ground floor of a four-storey building storing chemicals and dyes in munshiganj , 20 km ( 12 miles ) from dhaka , the capital , and spread quickly .
the mill was closed when the fire broke out but there were some workers in the factory and six bodies , including one woman worker , have been recovered , a police official , alamgir hossain , told reuters by telephone .
firefighters had put out the blaze but it was not immediately clear if more workers had been trapped , he added .
the roughly $ 28-billion garment industry employs 4 million people and generates about 80 percent of bangladesh s export earnings .
