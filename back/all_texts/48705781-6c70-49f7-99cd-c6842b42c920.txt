Donald Trump s relationship with his daughter Ivanka has definitely raised a few eyebrows.
It s bad enough that all of his wives including his current wife, Melania have been a couple of decades younger than he is.
What is more disturbing is the fact that he seems to have the hots for his daughter.
Well, this troubling notion is even more eyebrow-raising when you consider an interview Trump did with radio host Howard Stern in 1999.Apparently, Trump and Stern were discussing the women they like to date, and Trump mentioned that he had promised his daughter Ivanka, who was seventeen at the time, that he would not date anyone younger than she was.
Even crazier is the fact that the age of consent in the state of New York is seventeen years of age, so, essentially, all Trump, who was 53 at the time, was promising to do is not to commit rape.
One could argue all day long regarding statutory rape laws and their fairness, but no 17-year-old girl is going to want to do anything like that with a 53-year-old man unless she was shamed, guilted, bullied, or forced into it.
End of story.Trump said to Stern: I have a deal with her.
She s 17 and doing great Ivanka.
She made me promise, swear to her that I would never date a girl younger than her.
So as she grows older, the field is getting very limited.
Stern, who sounded taken aback, made an awkward joke in response: The nerve of her.
Now you can t go out with 16-year-olds.
Indeed.
Needless to say, these comments simply continue the narrative that Trump has an unhealthy affinity for girls that are far too young for him, and this conversation seems to suggest that if he could get away with it, he d date and have sex with underage girls.
Is this the sort of man we really want in the White House?Listen to the audio below, via the New York Daily News:[ad3media campaign= 977 ]Featured image via screen capture from Twitter
