Donald Trump s misogynistic behavior towards women is now legendary.
Repeated stories have emerged showing the Republican presidential nominee thinks nothing of throwing out the worst phrases and ideas, particularly if the target is a woman, who Trump clearly believes are inferior to men.Reporter Jennifer Lin reveals another sordid story from Trump s fast as she was reporting on his Atlantic City casinos, which went belly-up like so many of his other bad business deals.After the article, titled How a Curious Visitor Beat Trump at the Casino Game ran, Trump called Lin to air his grievances.
There was no hello.
But there was yelling, lots of yelling, Lin recalled.
The word shit was used repeatedly as a noun and adjective.
Trump then called Lin s editor, Craig Stock.
Craig was treated to the same Trumpian wordplay, but got an added treat, she continued.
Trump referred to me as that c__t.
Trump denies the story, but he has also denied saying things that have been witnessed by millions of people.
During the recent presidential debate he denied saying climate change was a hoax, but he did, and numerous fact checks and recorded videos show him again and again denying saying things he did.The slur also follows a pattern of behavior for Trump, recently seen in his 3 a.m. meltdown over Miss Universe Alicia Machado as he demanded that she be attacked instead of treated with compassion after he fat-shamed her.Voters have seen that Trump freaks out at reporters and news outlets that print negative stories about him, as he claims they ve made up their facts but never actually refutes them or demands a retraction.
Yelling a slur at a female reporter that would dare point out his shortcomings isn t a stretch of the imagination, it s something Donald Trump does all the time.Featured image via screen capture
