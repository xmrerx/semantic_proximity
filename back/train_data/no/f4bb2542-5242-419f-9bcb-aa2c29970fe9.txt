the left is officially isis isis terrorists have destroyed ancient sites that have been preserved for hundreds and hundred of years .
well , the left isn t too far behind them some jackwagon took a sledgehammer to a 225-year old monument to christpher columbus unreal ! the columbus statue is in baltimore shame on these thugs ! baltimore brew has this to say about the memorial : baltimore s 225-year-old monument to christopher columbus , said to be the oldest in the country and the world dedicated to the explorer that is still standing , has been severely vandalized.in case you re wondering , this is happening in other places in america .
we reported on two catholic saint statues that were vandalized and the peace monument in atlanta that was also vandalized .
are you getting the picture now ?
it s not about the confederacy but about hating anything america stands for .
our kids have been well taught by liberal academia so they only know that imperialist america stole everything from everyone yada , yada , yada , , , this is a turning point some jackwagon narrates the video : christopher columbus symbolizes the initial invasion of european capitalism into the western hemisphere .
columbus initiated a centuries-old wave of terrorism , murder , genocide , rape , slavery , ecological degradation and capitalist exploitation of labor in the americas .
that columbian wave of destruction continues on the backs of indigenous , african-american and brown people .
racist monuments to slave owners and murderers have always bothered me .
baltimore s poverty is concentrated in african-american households , and these statues are just an extra slap in the face .
they were built in the 20th century in response to a movement for african americans human dignity .
what kind of a culture goes to such lengths to build such hate-filled monuments ?
what kind of a culture clings to those monuments in 2017 ?
