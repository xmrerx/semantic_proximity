There s word that the Phoenix Rally will be chaotic.
The Alt-Left is ready to bring violence to the rally to do anything they can to damage our president.Remember during the election when the Alt-Left caused a tremendous amount of violence at Trump events?
Well, this should be that on steroids.
OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE ALT-LEFT: The media is trying their best to control what you see and how you see it when it comes to the alt-left.
We re here to tell you the truth about the violence and who is instigating it.
Antifa and Black Lives Matter have been instrumental from the days of Trump s campaign up until now.
