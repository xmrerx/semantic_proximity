CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela s opposition coalition refused to recognize the results of Sunday s gubernatorial elections where the ruling socialists won a surprise majority, raising the specter of more political turmoil in the oil-rich nation.
The Democratic Unity s election campaign chief, Gerardo Blyde, demanded a complete audit of the 23 governor races and called on its candidates to lead street activities on Monday in protest over the results.
