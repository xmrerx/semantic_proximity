Retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who is an adviser to President-elect Donald Trump, has decided against accepting a Cabinet position in the Trump administration.
Carson, who was a former 2016 Republican presidential candidate, cited his own lack of experience.
Dr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he s never run a federal agency, Carson s close friend and business manager Armstrong Williams told The Hill.
The last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency.
Carson isn t interested in serving as secretary of Health and Human Services, Williams said.
Dr. Carson was never offered a specific position, but everything was open to him, Williams continued to say.The irony meter just exploded.
Despite Trump s onslaught of attacks on Carson during the campaign, the retired neurosurgeon was among the first former rivals to back the acidic GOP presidential nominee.
And now that Trump, who has zero political experience, won the keys to the White House, Carson feels his own inexperience would cripple the presidency.
Dr. Carson doesn t feel like that s the best way for him to serve the president-elect, Williams told Reuters.He said that Carson would remain a close adviser of Trump and also a friend.
His life has not prepared him to be a Cabinet secretary, Williams said.Well, we can t imagine how Trump is possibly prepared to lead this country will no political experience.Dr.
Carson endorsed Trump by calling him thoughtful and cerebral, according to the Washington Post.
He said that even though Trump insulted him over and over and over and over again.
The same thing happened with Ted Cruz.
Trump attacked Heidi Cruz s appearance so what did the Texas Senator do?
He denounced Trump, then later told America to vote their conscience while he never gave in to backing the then-GOP Presidential nominee.
Then he lost his conscience and his spine and jumped on the Trump Train.The GOP has Stockholm Syndrome.Photo by Alex Wong via Getty
