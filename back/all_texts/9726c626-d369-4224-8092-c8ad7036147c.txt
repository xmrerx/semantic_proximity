After audio was leaked revealing Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump speaking about women in a way that only a sexual predator would, even going so far as to say he ll just grab a woman by the p*ssy without her consent, many have come out condemning his remarks.
Including many in the Republican party.Now, even Trump s wife Melania has released a statement condemning his horrible behavior.The statement reads: The words my husband used are unacceptable and offensive to me.
This does not represent the man that I know.
He has the heart and mind of a leader.
I hope people will accept his apology, as I have, and focus on the important issues facing our nation and world.
JUST IN: Melania Trump issues statement following release of husband's 2005 sexually-charged remarks https://t.co/16BtQywsPR pic.twitter.com/IP29jnoUks ABC News (@ABC) October 8, 2016Of course, by the end of her statement, she appears to stand by her man, but even she can t stomach the disgusting remarks that were uttered from her husband s lips.Good on Melania for taking a stand and speaking up against her husband.
Many were waiting to see what she had to say, and this was more than many expected from her.It s going to be interesting to see how the Trump campaign handles all of this moving forward.Featured Photo by Michael Bocchieri/Getty Images
