While Trump and his loyal subjects keep bleating about the mess Obama left for them to clean up, and insist that the world laughed at us for the entire eight years of his administration, a growing movement in France is proving them to be completely out of their gourds.
France s presidential election is coming up in April, and these people, fed up with Marine Le Pen and her Trump-like attitudes and policies, want Obama to come be France s president.Seriously.
They ve got a petition going that s asking Obama to run, and they re hoping they can get at least one million signatures on it.
They ve also put up 500 posters around Paris and have an actual campaign organization going:Oui on peut (?)

Probably not, and the truth is that this is a bit of a joke.
But it s not a joke on Obama or the U.S.
It s a joke in that this group knows he s not going to come run for president there, and they re using this campaign to send a very serious message: We are so fed up with what Marine Le Pen is doing, and with the fact that we weren t able to find a candidate to vote for, only one to vote against.
We started talking about that and it came up that Obama is free so why not hire him?
In other words, they see Obama as someone who still represents hope and something to fight for in a world where we increasingly just vote and fight against things.People have actually been getting in touch with the campaign to offer ideas for how to get around the fact that Obama isn t French.
Even some lawyers have contacted them with advice on how to make it possible, like making him a naturalized citizen of France.
But nobody knows if Obama is even aware of this yet.
If he is, and he answers, then the campaign believes there will be a huge reaction.Featured image by Scott Olson via Getty Images
