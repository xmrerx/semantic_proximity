the unwarranted violence against innocent white people by black lives matter protesters terrorists is getting out of control !
this young girl in a dress and heels is walking down the stairs when she is approached by and angry mob of blacks and is sucker punched in the face .
someone in the background can be heard yelling , hey hey hey she didn t do anything !
the point is they don t care if she did anything .
this is the gut-wrenching , divisive legacy of our first black president # charlotteprotest young woman struck down last night at @ epicentrenc .
