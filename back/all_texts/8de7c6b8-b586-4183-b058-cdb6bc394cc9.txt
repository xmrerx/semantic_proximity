Watch Jim Acosta wave his hands around and have a temper tantrum on air: The White House press secretary is getting to a point, Brooke, where he s just kind of useless.
You know, if he can t come out and answer the questions and they re not going to do this on camera or audio why are we having these briefings or gaggles in the first place?
Acosta expressed dissatisfaction with Spicer s method of answering questions with a promise to find out answers but not providing them later.Acosta turned around to point at the White House and express his frustration with the White House communications team: That s the White House, behind me.
The White House.
And it s just bizarre.
I don t know what world we are living in right now, Brooke.Acosta continued: They bring us into the briefing room here in the White House, and they won t answer these questions on camera or let us record the audio.
I don t know why everybody is going along with this.
It just feels like we are sort of slowly but surely being dragged into what is a new normal in this country, where the president of the United States is allowed to insulate himself from answering hard questions.
He finished his comments with a slam to conservatives: Maybe he ll take a question from a conservative news media reporter and then somebody from the mainstream media, he said.
This is not how we do things in this country, but for whatever reasons we are all going along with it.
