It s quite hard to laugh at what Donald Trump plans to do if he becomes president, especially since he s been winning in the polls for the Republican nomination for president.
However, when kids actually say some of the crazy things Trump has said he plans to do, it all becomes hilarious.
In fact, these kids actually show us how ridiculous Donald Trump actually is.Jimmy Fallon compiled videos of kids imitating some of the silliest statements Trump has made during his nightmarish run for the GOP nomination and then perfectly mocks him.
In one example, a girl in a New York accent hilariously said: If you don t want to build a wall, you re a loser.
Vote for Trump and make America great again.
Or, you re gonna be a loser.
In another skit, a Trump impersonator brags about his performance in the polls, saying: I m doing so good and I m going to win and once I win, we will win so much that everyone will be sick of winning.
The funny skits genuinely prove just how ridiculous Trump s statements are when put in the context of kids saying them.
The hope is that Donald Trump, along with Ted Cruz, will just be a funny memory come November.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtG3h44Ls1o] Featured image via video screenshot.
