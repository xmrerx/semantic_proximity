london ( reuters ) - opposition labour party leader jeremy corbyn said there is likely to be a british national election next year but that he opposes a second referendum on european union membership , grazia magazine reported .
prime minister theresa may lost her conservative party its majority in parliament by betting on a snap election in june , weakening her hand in brexit negotiations .
labour by contrast did well at the election , making a net gain of 30 seats in britain s 650-seat parliament .
corbyn , a lifelong socialist , who has repeatedly claimed that he will win power , said there would soon be another election .
there will probably be another election in the next 12 months , he was quoted by grazia as saying .
he predicted his labour party would win .
i m ready to be prime minister tomorrow , corbyn said .
corbyn , who said he voted against eu membership in a 1975 referendum but voted for membership in 2016 , said he opposed former labour prime minister tony blair s proposal for another referendum on membership .
some were extremely irresponsible in what they did and said , but we have to recognize it was the largest participation of people in an electoral process ever in britain and they chose to leave , corbyn was quoted as saying .
i think we should continue putting pressure on the government to allow a transition period to develop , because at the moment we re in danger of getting into a complete mess in march 2019 , corbyn said , referring to the date britain is due to leave the eu .
