Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has been recently designated by the Donald Trump for President campaign as their go-to opener for his campaign rallies.
He did so in jaw-dropping fashion on Monday as the Trump campaign launched another event with a bizarre statement.Hyping up Trump, Giuliani made the insane statement that before the presidency of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton s tenure as Secretary of State, the United States didn t have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attacks in the U.S. Video of Rudy saying we didn't "have any successful radical Islamic terrorist attacks in the U.S." before Obama: pic.twitter.com/3tC1InfZj0 andrew kaczynski (@BuzzFeedAndrew) August 15, 2016Of course, the reality is that the worst terrorist attack in the history of the United States was perpetrated by radical Islamic terrorists under the banner of al Qaeda on September 11, 2001.The attacks killed thousands of people in New York City, Washington D.C., and Pennsylvania.The statement is even more jaw-dropping because few major politicians are as identified with 9/11 as Giuliani, who served as mayor of New York City on the day of the attack and famously walked with firefighters and police through the rubble after the attacks.He even based much of his failed 2004 presidential run on his actions on that day.The president at the time was of course President George W. Bush, the Republican.
By contrast, Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. marines on May 2, 2011 in a raid on his compound in Afghanistan that was ordered by President Barack Obama.The conservative movement has for years tried to argue that they are stronger against terrorism than Democrats, and as an outgrowth they have worked to down play Democratic successes in that fight.
There has been an intense crackdown on terrorists during Obama s seven years as President, including rolling up on the al Qaeda network, ISIS, and other groups.Giuliani s statement is a blatant lie, but it has strong support with hardcore conservatives.Featured image via Twitter
