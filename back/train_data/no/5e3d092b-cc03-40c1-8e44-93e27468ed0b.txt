by now you ve probably heard about the remarks clueless star and fox news contributor stacey dash made about race , segregation and bet .
however , if you haven t they went something like this : i think it s ludicrous .
we have to make up our minds .
either we want to have segregation or integration .
if we don t want segregation , then we need to get rid of channels like bet and the bet awards and the [ naacp ] image awards , where you re only awarded it you re black .
if it were the other way around , we would be up in arms , it s a double standard there shouldn t be a black history month .
we re americans .
period .
well , as you can only imagine that didn t go over so well .
the twitterverse had her name trending within hours and pretty much everyone had something to say regarding dash s ridiculous remarks .
in fact , bet responded themselves .
first by tweeting a link that displayed every time stacey dash proved she was clueless : every time stacey dash proved she was clueless : https : //t.co/mto8dsxvhe pic.twitter.com/nbdoro6jna bet ( @ bet ) january 20 , 2016then they tweeted : ?
soooooo @ realstaceydash can we get our check back or nah ?
# remember # youwereonthegame # andwedontmeantherapper pic.twitter.com/2vwq03j0c9 bet ( @ bet ) january 20 , 2016dash clearly forgot that she guest-starred on bet s the game .
she also clearly forgot all of these moments in her life as well while making her dimwitted remarks .
roland martin tells it like it is : .
@ realstaceydash says there should not be black networks or awards shows .
so why has she done interviews/photo spreads w/black magazines ?

# oscarssowhite pic.twitter.com/oianra1bz5 rolandsmartin ( @ rolandsmartin ) january 20 , 2016oops.according to dash , she herself is ludicrous and a bad american for appearing in programming on bet , going to award shows for only people of color , and for appearing on magazines meant for the black community .
she really and truly seems clueless as her former role suggests.it s clear why fox news hired her .
dash will say the things that clearly don t make sense to appeal to the audience that fox has built up over the years old , white people who are angry and scared of anyone who doesn t look or sound like them .
it s too bad , really , because she s in a role where she could reach out to that audience to offer some much-needed clarity , but instead she caters to their myopic minds by agreeing with them and telling them what they want to hear.featured image : twitter
