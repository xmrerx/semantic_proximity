democrat dummy of the day rep. tom cole ( r. , okla. ) embarrassed rep. keith ellison ( d. , minn. ) on abc sunday morning when the latter falsely claimed that former democratic alabama governor george wallace was a republican.wallace is perhaps best remembered as being one of the most strident supporters of segregation in the 20th century .
he sought the democratic nomination for president multiple times , with racist stances as a key of his platform .
in 1968 , he ran as the american independent party candidate and received 46 electoral votes , making him the most recent third-party candidate to capture votes in the electoral college.ellison was attacking donald trump when he made his false charge .
at the same time , we do have the worst republican nominee since george wallace , ellison said.host george stephanopoulos didn t correct ellison and went on to ask cole a question about whether the republican national convention was a success , but cole first called out ellison .
well , first i want to correct my friend , cole said .
george wallace was a proud democrat and ran for the democratic nomination .
