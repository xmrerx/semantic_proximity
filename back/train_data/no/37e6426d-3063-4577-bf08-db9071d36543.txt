rome ( reuters ) - italy s upper house senate on saturday gave parliament s final approval to the government s 2018 budget , clearing the way for national elections expected to be held in march .
the financial law , which had already passed in the chamber of deputies , aims to lower next year s fiscal deficit to 1.6 percent of gross domestic product from a targeted 2.1 percent this year .
it also introduces a web tax from 2019 , obliging companies to pay a three percent levy on some internet transactions .
the senate passed the package in a vote of confidence by 140 votes to 97 .
confidence votes allow the government to speed up legislation by curtailing debate on proposed amendments .
if the government loses such a vote it has to resign , but with elections in any case imminent no parties had any real interest in scuppering the budget and bringing down prime minister paolo gentiloni s administration .
president sergio mattarella is expected to dissolve parliament before the end of the year , after which the government will set the date of the election .
politicians often tout march 4 as the most likely date .
the european commission says the budget may break eu rules because it raises previously agreed deficit targets and does too little to rein in italy s huge public debt .
at just over 130 percent of national output , italy s debt is the highest in the euro zone after that of greece .
brussels will issue a final verdict on the budget in the spring , after the italian election which opinion polls suggest will produce a hung parliament .
the anti-establishment 5-star movement leads in the polls , with around 28 percent of the vote , but a center-right coalition of parties is seen winning most seats in parliament .
the ruling democratic party has been hit by internal divisions and lags 5-star by around four points in most polls .
