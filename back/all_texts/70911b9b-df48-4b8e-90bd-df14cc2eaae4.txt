Though they are officially non-profit organizations, Catholic Charities, Lutheran Social Services, and several other Christian organizations are profiting from lucrative contracts with the federal government to resettle refugees in the United States.Of the 100,000 refugees resettled in the United States in 2014 under the Refugee Resettlement program, an estimated 40 percent were Muslims.
BreitbartAs of August 29, 2016, 224 new Syrian refugee arrivals have been reported.
That lifts the total this fiscal year to 10,126, of whom 52 or 0.51 percent are Christians; and 9,945 or 98.2 percent, are Sunni Muslims.The Obama administration s goal was to admit 10,000 Syrian refugees in the fiscal year.The number of Christians among the 10,000 was less than half of one percent.Of the 9,902 before Monday s arrivals, just 47 (0.47 percent) are Christians, according to State Department Refugee Processing Center data.The vast majority of the Syrian refugees permitted to resettle in the United States are Sunni Muslims 9,726 of the 9,902, or 98.2 percent.
Another 20 are Shi a Muslims, and a further 85 are identified in the data simply as Muslims.
CNS NewsIn an exclusive interview President Donald Trump was asked by David Brody of Christian Broadcasting News if he considers it a priority to bring persecuted Christians over to the US from Syria.Trump responded, You know, if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very, very tough to get in to.
If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible and the reason that was so unfair, everybody was persecuted in all fairness, but they were chopping off the heads of everybody but more so the Christians, and I thought it was very,very unfair, so we are going to help them.
