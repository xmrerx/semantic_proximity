MOSCOW (Reuters) - Lebanon s Foreign Minister Gebran Bassil said in Moscow that he hopes Saad al-Hariri, who resigned as prime minister on Nov. 4, would return to Beirut after he completes his visit to France, Russia s RIA news agency reported.
He said that the main aim now is that Hariri can return to Lebanon without any conditions or restrictions on his freedom and, once back in Lebanon, that he can decide whether to step down as the prime minister, the news agency reported.
He said, according to the agency, that Hariri should still be considered as Lebanon s serving prime minister.
Hariri s visit to France was aimed solely at securing his return to Lebanon, the agency reported.
Bassil said earlier on Friday that some forces are trying to oust the Lebanese leader.
