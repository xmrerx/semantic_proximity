bahrain accuses mainly shi ite iran of stoking militancy in the kingdom , a strategic island where the u.s. navy s fifth fleet is based , charges tehran denies .
bahrain has a shi ite muslim majority population but is ruled by a sunni royal family .
the rulings are subject to appeal , the statement said .
bahrain in january executed three shi ite men convicted of killing three policemen , including an officer from the united arab emirates , in a 2014 bomb attack .
they were the first such executions in over two decades and sparked protests .
bahrain had seen occasional unrest since 2011 when authorities crushed protests mainly by the shi ite majority demanding a bigger role in running the country .
