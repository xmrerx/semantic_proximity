Donald Trump, the Republican presidential candidate that has spewed the most hateful, bigoted rhetoric modern America has ever witnessed, had the audacity to call Black Lives Matter very divisive on Tuesday night.That s right.
The candidate that has promised a border wall to keep illegal Mexican immigrants out (after calling them rapists, drug dealers and criminals ), threatened to close mosques in the U.S. and proposed a ban on all Muslims from coming into the United States and routinely retweets white supremacists has the nerve to call a social justice movement divisive.
In speaking to Fox News Bill O Reilly, Trump weighed in on the tragic shootings of African American police brutality victims Alton Sterling and Philando Castile.
He called the shootings very, very sad but in the same breath accused the Black Lives Matter movement a movement that fights the very systemic racism that contributed to those deaths of dividing America.
When O Reilly asked Trump if Black Lives Matter was helping America or hurting America?
, Trump said: I would say they re dividing America.
I think they re hurting themselves.
Trump also said that he was a big supporter of law enforcement and said that police shootings get broadcast and they don t show all the good work the police does.
Of course, no Republican can talk about a tragedy without blaming America s first black President, so Trump made sure to call President Barack Obama the divider-in-chief that was responsible for race relations in America.It does not get more disgusting than this.
Trump s words are an insult to everyone working to improve race relations in America and call awareness to a massive social issue that is finally getting the attention it deserves.
Trump, a racist that is so divisive that he has even torn his own political party apart, is the last one who should be criticizing Black Lives Matter or talking about unifying America.
