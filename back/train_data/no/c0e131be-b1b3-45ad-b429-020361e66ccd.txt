i ll bet obama didn t count on this beautiful young lady pictured below to be our first gold medal was he hoping for a more diverse american to win ?
does it make you gag to hear this horrible president use our olympians as political pawns ?
he did just that during his weekly address video below .
during saturday s weekly address , president obama said , team usa reminds the world why america always sets the gold standard : we re a nation of immigrants that finds strength in our diversity and unity in our national pride .
i m sure he didn t mean a blond hair , blue eyed white girl named jenny thrasher : american shooter ginny thrasher won the first gold medal of the rio olympics , pulling off an upset in the women s 10-meter air rifle event saturday morning.she is an ncaa champion at west virginia competing in her first olympics .
but we re sure obama was thinking of the fencing champion from suburban jersey who ll become the first american olympian to wear a hijab while competing .obama just can t help himself he knows nothing about america and rattles on about diversity : that s why we watch .
and we have a lot to look forward to this year .
team usa reminds the world why america always sets the gold standard : we re a nation of immigrants that finds strength in our diversity and unity in our national pride .
