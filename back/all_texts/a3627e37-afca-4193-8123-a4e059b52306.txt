Father Gerald Murphy goes off on Hillary Clinton following her speech at the Al Smith elite charity dinner last night in New York, where Hillary used a quote of the Pope s as a way to fake his endorsement of her.
Given what her staff said about Catholic faith about an attempt to subvert it, there should have been a statement right at the start saying, I disown everything that was written in those emails.
Donald Trump has said quite clearly he s pro-life, Catholics are quite heartened by that.
I wish Hillary Clinton would change her position.
But at least don t try and pretend that the Pope is endorsing her by quoting him selectively.
Thank you, Father!
Father Gerald Murray goes off on @HillaryClinton who refused to apologize to Catholics & supports partial birth abortion!
