on thursday , donald trump was devastated after an appeals court completely rejected donald trump s muslim ban .
the trump administration has lost dramatically and completely and they re going to have to decide what to do next , cnn senior legal analyst jeffrey toobin said following the court s 3-0 complete repudiation of the trump ban .
the government has taken the position that the president s decisions about immigration policy , particularly when motivated by national security concerns , are unreviewable , even if those actions potentially contravene constitutional rights and protections , the court said , adding that the muslim ban runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy .
the judges , who were appointed by three different presidents , flat-out rejected the trump administration s claim that his decisions are absolute and unquestionable : the supreme court has made clear that the government s authority and expertise in [ such ] matters do not automatically trump the court s own obligation to secure the protection that the constitution grants to individuals , even in times of war .
there is no precedent to support this claimed unreviewability , which runs contrary to the fundamental structure of our constitutional democracy .
after getting checked , trump tweeted out an unbalanced all-caps tantrum , vowing that he will see you in court even though he had just been there , where he lost embarrassingly.see you in court , the security of our nation is at stake !
