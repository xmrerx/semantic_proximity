in case you missed it sen. harry reid ( r-nv ) , who announced last week that he will retire after his current term expires in early 2017 , said he does not regret taking to the senate floor in 2012 to accuse then-gop presidential nominee mitt romney of not paying his taxes .
no , i don t regret that at all , he told cnn s dana bash .
the koch brothers no one would help me .
they were afraid the koch brothers would go after them , so i did it on my own .
bash said some viewed the charge as mccarthy-ite , but reid didn t buy that explanation .
he shrugged , saying , they can call it whatever they want .
romney didn t win , did he ?
reid said somewhat amusingly .
