baghdad ( reuters ) - an iraqi yazidi group affiliated with a shi ite-led armed faction took control on tuesday of sinjar , said residents of the northwestern city that is claimed by both kurdish and central iraqi authorities .
the yazidi group , called lalesh , extended control over all of sinjar after the withdrawal late on monday of kurdish peshmerga fighters who were deployed there , the residents said .
there was no violence , the lalesh group moved after the peshmerga pulled out , said a resident by phone .
responding to a kurdish referendum on independence held last month , iraqi government forces on monday captured the kurdish-held oil city of kirkuk , transforming the country s balance of power .
that was part of lightning strike ordered by minister haider al-abadi to retake all disputed areas , including sinjar , occupied by the kurdistan regional government s peshmerga force in the course of the war on islamic state .
lalesh is affiliated with popular mobilisation , an armed group formed mainly of iran-trained shi ite paramilitaries , with the participation of smaller forces from other communities including sunnis , christians and yazidis .
it is officially under abadi s authority .
