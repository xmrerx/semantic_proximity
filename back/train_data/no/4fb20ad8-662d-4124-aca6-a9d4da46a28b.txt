21st century wire says while everyone is busy hyping the north korean nuclear threat , the one thing that few mainstream media outlets dare to ask about north korea is : do they actually have an operational nuclear weapons program ? here s your answer : no.to date , there is no evidence at all that pyongyang has an operational nuclear weapons program , much less a capable or accurate enough ballistic missile program that could deliver such weapons.the dear leader : kim jung-unthe usual western sources ( media reportage and intelligence sources ) claim that north korea conducted atomic bomb tests in 2006 , 2009 and 2013 although none of these can be independently verified yet .
so again , the answer , so far has to be no.north korea also claimed that it tested a hydrogen bomb in january 2016 .
understandably , fox news loves these pyongyang propaganda claims as it bolsters the military defense industry global threat talking point , but again , this has not yet been independently verified yet.the fundamental question should be : if pyongyang has nukes , and no one has actually seen them , including washington spooks , then why is the media hyping their existence ?
the washington post admitted as much in 2013 , when a former senior obama administration official admitted there s no actual evidence of any such weapons , saying , we re worried about it , but we haven t seen it .the rest is just expensive guesswork , and us military industrial complex fear mongering.perhaps the real story is that a divided korea ( between north and south ) provides the us with its sole justification for carrying on occupying its many military installations in japan , the philippines and numerous other pacific archipelago installations.in other words it pays for the north korean nuclear threat to be real .
understandably , the war hawks and other flamboyant info-tainment personalities will not be happy with this statement made yesterday by us secretary of state rex tillerson , who instead called for diplomacy with pyongyang rt international reports washington does not seek regime change in north korea and at some point would like to have a dialogue with pyongyang to de-escalate the tensions on the peninsula , us secretary of state rex tillerson has said .
we do not seek a regime change ; we do not seek the collapse of the regime ; we do not seek an accelerated reunification of the peninsula ; we do not seek an excuse to send our military north of the 38th parallel , tillerson told reporters tuesday in washington dc.despite repeated warnings from washington that the us might resort to a military solution to curb pyongyang s nuclear and missile programs , tillerson stressed that the us is trying to convey to the north koreans that we are not your enemy we are not your threat .
but , he said , north korea continues to present an unacceptable threat to the united states , which forces washington to respond .
tillerson however expressed hope that washington and pyongyang can resolve their issues through negotiations .
we would like to sit and have a dialogue with them about the future that will give them the security they seek and the future economic prosperity for north korea , tillerson said.secretary tillerson on # dprk : united states and china share the same objective , a denuclearized korean peninsula .
