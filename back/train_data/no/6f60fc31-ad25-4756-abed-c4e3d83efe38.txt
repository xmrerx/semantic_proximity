they also fly at such a slow speed that modern anti-aircraft systems are programmed to ignore their limited returns.also , the aircraft can hug the earth meaning ground-based missile systems will not pick them up and supersonic attack jets will find difficulty in detecting them from above .

it is feared the old aircraft could even deliver a nuclear bomb possibly in a suicide attack into a strategically vital location .
