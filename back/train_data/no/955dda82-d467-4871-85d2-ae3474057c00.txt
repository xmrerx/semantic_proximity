london ( reuters ) - the british government said on tuesday that most european union citizens currently living in britain will be allowed to remain in the country after brexit in 2019 .
outlining plans for a mass registration program , the department for exiting the european union and the interior ministry said eu nationals will be given a two-year grace period to apply for settled status after britain leaves the eu .
the legal status and rights of eu nationals is one of the thornier issues in britain s complicated exit from the bloc .
there are about 3 million eu citizens living in britain .
caseworkers will be able to use discretion when processing applications , meaning they should not be refused for minor technicalities , and the majority would be granted , the departments said in a statement .
the cost of an application should be no more than the cost of a british passport and eu citizens will also be given a statutory right of appeal if denied .
we have been clear that safeguarding the rights of eu citizens is our top priority in negotiations , brexit minister david davis said .
we will support everyone wishing to stay to gain settled status through a new straightforward , streamlined system .
