WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump, who is considering ending a program that allowed young immigrants who came to the United States with their parents illegally to stay in the country, said he would have a decision on the issue later on Friday or over the weekend.
“We love the Dreamers,” he told reporters in the Oval Office, referring to the young men and women who are covered by the program known as DACA.
