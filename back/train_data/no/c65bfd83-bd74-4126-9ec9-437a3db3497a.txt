brasilia ( reuters ) - brazil s government has secured between 270 and 280 of the 308 votes needed to approve a bill to overhaul the country s bloated social security system in february , president michel temer said on friday .
it was the first time temer has said how many votes are still needed to reach the three-fifths super majority to pass the unpopular legislation that investors see as vital to bringing a huge budget deficit under control .
that is the reason why we put off the vote until february , temer said at the swearing-in of a cabinet minister who will be responsible for mustering the votes shortfall .
the measure is due to be put to the vote on feb. 19 , after the christmas to carnival congressional recess , when it could meet with greater reluctance from lawmakers as the 2018 general election approaches .
the delay has increased market skepticism over brazil s ability to rein in a deficit that caused the loss of its investment grade credit rating .
temer s new minister of political affairs , carlos marun , said the bill s approval will be his biggest challenge as he takes over government relations with congress .
marun was sworn in to succeed antonio imbassahy , whose psdb party quit temer s governing coalition and is split over delivering its 46 votes in the lower house to help pass temer s pension plan .
