The Senate waited until Christmas to quietly release a report on how much was dolled out to settle workplace harassment claims.
Remember that you never approved this and they used YOUR money to make the payments to accusers.
The amount is $1.5 million.
This needs to end.
The Senators should pay for this on their own.
It s just too easy to settle using someone else s money YOUR money!Via Daily Caller: As the Christmas holiday weekend set in, the Senate Rules and Administration Committee released a report revealing the Senate has spent $1.5 million on workplace harassment settlements since 1998.The data, provided by the Office of Compliance, a little known administrative body that has quietly settled dozens of complaints against congressional offices, provides little by way of details, beyond an itemized list of violations and the corresponding settlement.GOP Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama, who chairs the Rules Committee, said further particulars cannot be made public, in order to respect the confidentiality afforded to victims.Because we paid for these settlements, should we not have a right to know?
