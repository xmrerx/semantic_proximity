This does not mean that we want to see anything bad happen to the darker races we simply want to live separate from them As GOD intended.
(Lev.20:24-25) It is a simple fact that whenever these races try to integrate themselves into White society, that society is damaged immensely perhaps even destroyed altogether.
Everything that we do as Klan members is in furtherance of our ultimate goal.
We are not evil; hateful people as our enemies would have you believe.
We are common white people from all walks of life who have recognized the problems that our race is facing.
We have chose to stand and fight for those things that we hold dear to our people.
Won t you stand with us, while there is still time!
It is the duty of all white Christian men and women to fight against the Communist who have stolen our Nation The Trump campaign spent a lot of time courting and promoting white supremacists.
They invited white supremacists radio shows to broadcast from campaign stops and on the floor of the Republican Convention, while members of the Trump family also appeared on those programs.
