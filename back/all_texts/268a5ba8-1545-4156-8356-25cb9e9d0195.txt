Beyonce is one of the most sought-after performers in the world, and she knows how to deliver an electrifying performance.
She did exactly that during Super Bowl 50.

Appearing with Bruno Mars and Coldplay, she introduced her first song in more than a year entitled Formation.
But, Formation is not just any song: it also happens to be an ode to the Black Lives Matter Movement, as evidenced by the song s newly-released music video.
