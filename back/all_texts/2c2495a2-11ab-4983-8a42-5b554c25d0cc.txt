Newly released surveillance video shows that a Texas police officer lied when he arrested a young father in front of his two children, claiming the man pointed a gun at him twice.The video, just released by KHOU, shows Julian Carmona s vehicle pulling into a parking space at a Houston, Texas convenience store.
His two children were in the back seat of the vehicle.The off-duty officer who claims the man pointed a gun at him, identified as William Wright of the Houston Police Department, was driving his own personal vehicle at the time of the encounter.In the first few moments of the video, Carmona can be seen pulling in behind the officer s pickup truck, before parking his own vehicle.Carmona says he was in a hurry to get inside the store because he had to use the restroom.
He admits that there was a gun in the pocket of the driver s side door.Carmona says that as he was getting out of the car, the gun somehow fell out of the car.
I don t know if I hit it when I opened the door, or hit it with my foot everything just happened so fast, he told KHOU.The video shows Carmona opening the door to his vehicle, then bending over as if to pick something up off of the ground.
He immediately turns back toward his own vehicle, apparently to return the fallen object to the car.It s at this point that officer Wright can be seen getting out of his pickup truck with his gun drawn on Carmona.
I put my hands up like, Sir, I apologized right away, Carmona said.
Sir, I apologize, because the first thing that come to my mind, I dropped a gun in front of an officer, without even knowing it.
Wright ordered Carmona to the ground, placing the man in handcuffs as his children watch from the car.At one point his young son can be seen getting out of the car as his father lay face down on the ground.
He comes behind me, he starts handcuffing me and my son comes out of the truck.
That was the last thing I wanted, he told KHOU.In his official report, Wright wrote that Carmona pointed a gun at him twice, causing him to fear for his life.He was charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, a felony offense under Texas law.But the video clearly shows that the Texas father never pointed a gun at officer Wright.It should not go without saying that carrying a gun in a vehicle with two children riding inside is a terrible, terrible idea.From the video and Carmona s own statements, it appears that he intended to leave the gun in the car with his children while he used the convenience store bathroom.
That is something no parent should ever do.Be that as it may, it s not a crime in the state of Texas.Carmona has a legal permit to carry a concealed weapon.In an apparent effort to discredit him, police brought up a 2007 charge which was dismissed through deferred adjudication.What s more, video from inside the store shows that Officer Wright has stopped there to purchase beer, something officers in uniform are barred from doing under department policy.Regardless of how you feel about concealed carry laws, there s no justification for this kind of dishonesty and abuse of power on the part of police.Here s more on this story, including footage from the surveillance video, via KHOU.Featured image via video screen capture via KHOU
