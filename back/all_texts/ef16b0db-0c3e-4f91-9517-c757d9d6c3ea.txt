There s a new Gallup poll out showing that Donald Trump can, in fact, make other people popular.
However, the people this poll refers to aren t Republican lawmakers.
They aren t conservative television personalities.
They aren t people working in the White House.
The people gaining popularity because of Donald Trump are Barack Obama and George W. Bush.Obama s popularity has remained fairly steady since the final months of his presidency, and it s considerably higher than Herr Trump s at 63 percent.
Nearly every demographic has a highly favorable opinion of Obama, including all age groups, and both men and women.
Republicans are the only group with which he doesn t poll well, but that s not shocking.
They re still convinced he was secretly the Muslim Kenyan communist socialist anti-Christ that ruined America.Surprisingly, George W. s popularity has soared since Trump took office.
He s currently sitting at 59 percent overall.
Among Democrats, who are supposed to loathe W., his popularity has shot up a whopping 400 percent, to a 41 percent favorability rating.Just Democrats view W. more favorably than everyone views Trump.
That s really embarrassing for a man who considers his poll numbers to be more important than terror attacks in London and seven dead sailors aboard the U.S.S.
Fitzgerald.Furthermore, Republicans are worried that working for Trump will damage their reputations.
Many Republicans have turned down job offers in the White House, and they re making it hard for Trump to fill key posts.
While Trump yells about Democratic obstruction on nominees, he hasn t nominated anyone to fill a lot of those posts.Of course, the administration claims that everyone wants to work there, but what can you expect from someone to whom lying is second nature?Trump can crow about the Rasmussen poll all he likes, and trash President Obama all he likes.
He s just making everything harder on himself with his inability to act like an adult.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images
