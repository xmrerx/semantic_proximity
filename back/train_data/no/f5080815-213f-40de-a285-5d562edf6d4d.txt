manila ( reuters ) - philippine president rodrigo duterte has declared a 10-day unilateral ceasefire with communist rebels to allow filipinos to celebrate a stress-free christmas season , two weeks after peace talks with the insurgents were formally scrapped .
presidential spokesman harry roque said duterte had ordered the army and police to suspend offensive operations from dec. 24 to jan. 2 to lessen the apprehension of the public this christmas season .
he said he expected the maoists and their political leaders to do a similar gesture of goodwill .
there was no immediate comment from the communist rebel movement , whose top leaders and negotiators have been living in exile in the netherlands since the late 1980s .
duterte restarted a stalled peace process and freed several communist leaders as a gesture of good faith when he came to office last year but he recently abandoned talks due to escalating rebel attacks .
he has vented his fury on a near-daily basis at what he considers duplicity by the communist party of the philippines ( cpp ) and its armed wing , the new people s army ( npa ) .
he has collectively declared them a terrorist organization and has ended the three-decades peace process .
the rebel forces , estimated to number around 3,000 , have been waging a protracted guerrilla warfare in the countryside for nearly 50 years in a conflict that has killed more than 40,000 people and stifled growth in resource-rich areas of the philippines .
the guerrillas have been targeting mines , plantations , construction and telecommunication companies , demanding revolutionary taxation to finance arms purchases and recruitment activities .
duterte on tuesday night said he only wanted filipinos to celebrate a stress-free christmas .
i do not want to add more strain to what people are now suffering , he told reporters .
