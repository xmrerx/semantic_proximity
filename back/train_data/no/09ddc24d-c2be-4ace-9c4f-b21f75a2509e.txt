brussels ( reuters ) - belgian police detained four people over a foiled attack in 2015 on a high-speed train linking brussels and paris , federal prosecutors said on monday .
in august 2015 a machinegun-toting attacker wounded three people on a high-speed train before being overpowered by passengers , one in a series of militant attacks that has rocked belgium and france over the past two years .
police carried out six house searches in brussels and elsewhere in belgium early on monday , but did not find any explosives or weapons .
a judge will decide at a later stage whether those detained could be kept further , prosecutors said .
