The Republican candidates continue to sink to newer lows on a daily basis.
After Ted Cruz denigrated the people of New York by accusing Donald Trump of having New York values, Trump immediately saw an opportunity to score points.
At Thursday s Republican debate, Trump condemned Cruz s statement by invoking the resolve of New Yorkers following the September 11th attacks.
Sounds pretty good so far on Trump s part, right?
That s until he milked the opportunity dry on Twitter by posting a picture of 9/11 to attack Cruz.
However, some of the responses are not what Trump expected.
Here is what he tweeted:Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning?

Here are some responses:.
@realDonaldTrump See?
I'll use some tragedy to further MY goals.
I have no shame.
I want to win this bitch and will do whatever it takes!
Fake Donald Trump (@TheFakeTrump) January 16, 2016Yes, as Trump would say: That s disgusting!
@realDonaldTrump You forget that the attack was on the USA, not just NYC.
AND you forget we came to help!~ Judy Stines (@jstines3) January 17, 2016Indeed, the attack was on the United States and it was the country as a whole that came together with the necessary resolve.
The people that died that day weren t only New Yorkers, but people from around the country and around the world.
This was an American tragedy that was resisted with American resolve.
Tribalizing it for political gain is not only silly and low, but it clouds the true picture.
@realDonaldTrump And stop pimping out the worst terrorist attack in US History because your poll numbers are dropping.
Jesse Kelly (@JesseKellyDC) January 16, 2016Donald Trump has shown a knack for being very adept at finding the right moments to attack his opponents.
Thus far, he s made a mockery of other Republican candidates, especially Jeb Bush.
The media and many in the public have found his antics both humorous and outrageous and have tolerated him and even rewarded him: he s been the most covered candidate by the media thus far.However, we should be very careful with this individual.
There will come a time (and that time is coming very soon) when America will have to make an important choice about Donald Trump: Does America want a president who attacks minorities, has clear disdain for women, and uses the worst attack on US history for political gain against his opponent?Let s hope that Donald Trump and Ted Cruz and the rest of the Republican lineup continue to cancel each other out and show their true colors with their classless antics.Featured image via Gage Skidmore/Flickr
