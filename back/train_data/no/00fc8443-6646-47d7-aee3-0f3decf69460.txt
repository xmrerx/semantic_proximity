beijing ( reuters ) - china s communist party opened a meeting on wednesday to make final preparations for a key party congress later this month , state media said , a five-yearly event where president xi jinping is expected to further tighten his grip on power .
the seventh plenary session of the party s central committee will review draft reports on the work of the party , its discipline and anti-corruption commission , and amendments to be made to the party s constitution , all of which will be delivered at the 19th party congress that opens on oct. 18 , the official xinhua news agency said .
the congress will summarize historical progress and precious experiences in advancing socialism with chinese characteristics gained with xi at the party s core , xinhua said .
the congress will also thoroughly examine the current international and domestic situation and draw out guidelines and policies that respond to the call of the times , the news agency said , without giving specifics .
details of the speech that xi , the party s general secretary , will give at the opening session of the congress are closely guarded secrets , although the event is more about ideology than concrete policies .
it is unclear how long the plenum will last , but it could be just a single day .
it will end with a long communique , issued by xinhua , that is usually full of party phraseology but could be short on specifics .
last october , the party gave xi the title of core leader , a significant strengthening of his position ahead of the congress , at which a new standing committee , the pinnacle of power in china , will be constituted .
the party s constitution will be amended at the end of the congress , likely to include a reference to xi s thinking or ideology as a guiding party principle .
mao zedong and the reformist former leader deng xiaoping already have their names enshrined in the document , although xi s two immediate predecessors , hu jintao and jiang zemin , do not .
