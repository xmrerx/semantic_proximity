Just hours before the presidential election, President Obama gave a powerful speech at Hillary Clinton s final campaign rally in Philadelphia.
Taking full advantage of this last opportunity to appeal to voters, the president gave his final plea to Americans before they choose his successor.
I know it s been a long campaign.
There s been a lot of noise, and a lot of distraction, he said.
At times, it s felt more like a reality show, or even a parody, Obama continued.
But tomorrow, tomorrow, Philadelphia, the choice you face when you step into that voting booth could not be clearer and could not be more serious.
Obama explained that Trump is completely and totally unqualified to serve as president.
Don t take my word for it, listen to the Republicans who refuse to support him, the president said.
He lacks a basic understanding of the world.
The commander in chief joked again about Trump s aides revoking his Twitter privileges, but at the same time, he made a very good point.
Over the weekend, his campaign took away his Twitter account because he s erratic, Obama said.
If his closest advisors won t trust him to tweet, why would any of us trust him with the nuclear codes?
Obama then gave one final endorsement of the Democratic nominee.
You don t have to just vote against someone, you have someone outstanding to vote for in Hillary Clinton, Obama exclaimed.
Hillary, he said, will do whatever it takes to deliver on her campaign promises and make life better for the American people.
She will work.
She will deliver.
She won t just tweet, the president said.Watch President Obama s speech in its entirety, here:[ad3media campaign= 1325 ]Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images
