breaking bombshell !
all of the major political parties in france were targeted by obama s cia with both human and electronic spies for the 7 months leading up to their 2012 presidential election.in a document released by wikileaks today , the parties targeted and the goal of the operation are outlined in detail.release : cia espionage orders for the last french presidential electionhttps : //t.co/ard8alujms # ciafrance pic.twitter.com/15q5ojw4l4 wikileaks ( @ wikileaks ) february 16 , 2017via wikileaks : specific tasking concerning his party included obtaining the strategic election plans of the union for a popular movement ( ump ) ; schisms or alliances developing in the ump elite ; private ump reactions to sarkozy s campaign strategies ; discussions within the ump on any perceived vulnerabilities to maintaining power after the election ; efforts to change the party s ideological mission ; and discussions about sarkozy s support for the ump and the value he places on the continuation of the party s dominance .the targets specifically named in the document are : the french socialist party ( ps ) , the national front ( fn ) and union for a popular movement ( ump ) , current president francois hollande , then president nicolas sarkozy , current round one presidential front-runner marine le pen , and former presidential candidates martine aubry and dominique strauss-khan.the cia required that it s agents specifically discover sarkozy s private opinions on other candidates along with how he worked with his personal advisors.the cia seemed to have two prevailing goals according to wikileaks : what policies do they promote to help boost france s economic growth prospects , and what are their opinions on the german model of export-led growth .
this resonates with a u.s. economic espionage order from the same year which required someone obtaining every prospective french export contract or deal valued at $ 200m or more.this travesty is another example of how our intelligence community ran amok during the obama administration .
