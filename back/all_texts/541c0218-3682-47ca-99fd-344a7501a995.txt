Some 2,500 Americans Have Died in Afghanistan and Iraq Under Obama.
Under Obama, America has been at war for longer than under any other U.S. president.
When is the last time you heard those statistics mentioned by our Leftist media?Somewhere along the way, Obama decided that winning (or ending) the wars in the middle east was less important than starting a full-blown race war in America.
Does anyone care that Hillary is openly advocating to carry on his legacy of hate and division over concern for our military or our national security?This is Obama s legacy A California high school football team staged a bizarre die-in to protest the singing of the national anthem.Kaepernick came to Oakland, CA.

It happened during a Friday night football game.Disgraced NFL Colin Kaepernick was on hand to encourage the children to disrespect America and the U.S. Armed Forces.
I had to come out here and stand with y all, he said in remarks covered by the Mercury News.
So I appreciate what y all did.
I love y all.
Y all my brothers I m here with you.
But instead of collapsing on the ground with the children, Kaepernick simply took a knee.
I guess he didn t want to get grass stains on his hoodie.
