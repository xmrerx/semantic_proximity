so many acts of violence and vandalism have been committed against americans who have voiced their support for trump , that voters are staying silent about how they plan to vote .
that doesn t mean that massive numbers of voters won t be turning out for trump when it comes to sending in their absentee ballots or showing up to the polls on november 8th.don t let the media discourage you from getting out to vote for trump and don t believe the polls !
trump s rallies are a pretty good indication of how strong the momentum for his presidency really is .
trump is doing 2-4 rallies every day across america , while hillary is either fundraising or resting .
for the few rallies hillary is actually doing , you d think she d be drawing massive crowds , but the truth of the matter is , she can barely fill a high school gym with people who are passionate about her becoming our next president.listen to what former governor mike huckabee has to say about the silent majority trump voter : https : //twitter.com/wesleyrickard/status/790329136115949570
