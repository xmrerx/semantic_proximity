beirut ( reuters ) - the syrian observatory for human rights reported on sunday that islamic state fighters had captured a town in homs province from government forces , part of a wider counter-attack by the jihadists as they come under intense pressure in eastern syria .
there was no comment from the syrian army on the report that the town of al-qaryatayn had fallen .
the town is located some 300 km ( 190 miles ) from deir al-zor city , the current focus of the syrian government s campaign against islamic state .
syrian government forces and allied militia recovered qaryatayn from islamic state some six months ago .
the observatory said the jihadists had captured it in a surprise attack launched after their fighters had infiltrated the town .
islamic state has lost swathes of territory to the russian-backed syrian government and to u.s.-backed syrian militias that are waging separate campaigns against the group s last major strongholds in deir al-zor province in eastern syria .
islamic state fighters last week counter-attacked government forces and allied iran-backed militias along the highway connecting deir al-zor city to palmyra in central syria , temporarily rendering the road impassable .
hezbollah leader sayyed hassan nasrallah , whose group is fighting in support of the syrian government , said on saturday that islamic state counter-attacks were to be expected as the jihadists were besieged and incapable of recovering ground .
the syrian air force conducted intensive air strikes on islamic state positions and fortifications in several locations , a syrian military source said in a report circulated by state media on sunday .
it did not mention qaryatayn .
the source said dozens of islamic state militants had been killed in the air strikes to the east of the town of al-salamiya ; to the east of the town of al-sukhna , which is on a main road to deir al-zor ; and in deir al-zor province itself .
