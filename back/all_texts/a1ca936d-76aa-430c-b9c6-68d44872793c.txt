She was stunned by what was being taught, so she pulled out her phone and started recording.In the audio, you can hear the teacher say to be white is to be racist, period.
The student said she was instantly offended.
Half of my family is Hispanic, so I just felt like, you know, him calling me racist just because I m white I mean, where s your proof in that, she said.The words that followed were even more shocking to her.In the recording you hear the teacher ask Am I racist?
And, I say yeah.
I don t want to be.
It s not like I choose to be racist, but do I do things because of the way I was raised?
I felt like he was encouraging people to kind of pick on people for being white, the student said.
Why is it okay to demonize one race to children that you are supposed to be teaching a curriculum to, her dad asked.Norman Public Schools released the following statement regarding the issue: Racism is an important topic that we discuss in our schools.
While discussing a variety of philosophical perspectives on culture, race and ethics, a teacher was attempting to convey to students in an elective philosophy course a perspective that had been shared at a university lecture he had attended.
We regret that the discussion was poorly handled.
When the district was notified of this concern it was immediately addressed.
We are committed to ensuring inclusiveness in our schools.
Dr. Joe Siano, superintendent of Norman Public Schools You start telling someone something over and over again that s an opinion, and they start taking it as fact, the student said.
So, I wanted him to apologize and make it obvious and apparent to everyone that was his opinion.
