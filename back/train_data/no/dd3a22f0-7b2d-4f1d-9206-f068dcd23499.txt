santiago ( reuters ) - international researchers investigating the death of chilean poet pablo neruda raised doubts on friday as to whether he died of cancer 44 years ago as previously presumed , and did not rule out foul play .
neruda , known for his passionate love poems and staunch communist views , died days after a coup in september 1973 that ushered in the brutal dictatorship of augusto pinochet .
neruda s chauffeur claimed pinochet s agents took advantage of the poet s illness to inject poison into his stomach as he lay in hospital .
neruda s body was exhumed in 2013 and previous tests have found no evidence of poison but are ongoing .
spanish forensic specialist aurelio luna from the university of murcia told journalists that his team discovered something that could possibly be a laboratory-cultivated bacteria .
it will be analyzed , with results expected in six months to a year .
luna also said that tests indicated that death from prostrate cancer was not likely at the moment when neruda died .
from analysis of the data we can not accept that the poet had been in an imminent situation of death at the moment of entering the hospital , he said .
we can not confirm if the nature of pablo neruda s death was natural or violent , he added .
pinochet died in 2006 .
neruda s family and supporters have been divided over whether the case should be closed and his remains returned to his grave near his coastal home of isla negra , or whether researchers should continue carrying out tests .
