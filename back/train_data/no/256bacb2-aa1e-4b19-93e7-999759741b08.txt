istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish prosecutors said on wednesday they will review legal cases against 11,480 people after finding they had been re-directed unwittingly to a messaging app linked to suspects in last year s failed coup .
turkey has so far identified 215,000 users of the messaging app bylock , which was believed to be used by supporters of a u.s.-based cleric blamed for the failed july 2016 coup attempt .
it launched investigations against more than 23,000 of them .
but on wednesday the ankara prosecutor s office said many of them had been re-directed to bylock without their knowledge or consent , after downloading a different app which had functions for prayer times and music .
as a result of a detailed examination , it has been determined that 11,480 gsm number users with similar properties in terms of connection data parameters were unwittingly re-directed to bylock ips , it said .
state-run anadolu news agency quoted ankara chief prosecutor yuksel kocaman as saying that he would ask for nearly 1,000 people to be released unless there was other evidence against them .
he said an arrest warrant had been issued for the developer of the other app which had re-directed users to bylock .
authorities say bylock was widely used by followers of u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen , who the government blames for orchestrating the failed military coup in which 250 people were killed .
gulen has denied any involvement .
since the coup attempt , more than 50,000 people , including civil servants and security personnel , have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 suspended or dismissed from their jobs .
rights groups say the crackdown has been exploited to muzzle dissent .
the government says the measures have been necessary due to the security threats which turkey has faced since the putsch .
