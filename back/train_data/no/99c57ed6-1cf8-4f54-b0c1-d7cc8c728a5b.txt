if donald trump keeps tweeting about the nyc terrorist like this he will prevent justice from being served.earlier this week , a terrorist killed eight people using a vehicle .
police captured him alive .
so now we not only can get information that could be vital , we can try him in a court of law and get justice for the victims and their families.but justice won t happen if a fair trial can not be had.and that s why trump needs to stop tweeting about it right now.on wednesday night , trump seriously damaged the suspect s ability to get a fair trial by calling for him to receive the death penalty.nyc terrorist was happy as he asked to hang isis flag in his hospital room .
he killed 8 people , badly injured 12 .
should get death penalty !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) november 2 , 2017trump opened his big mouth again on thursday morning , spouting about how he wants to send the suspect to guantanamo bay prison .
however , such a move is illegal because the suspect holds a green cardwould love to send the nyc terrorist to guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the federal system donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) november 2 , 2017 there is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed .
should move fast .
death penalty !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) november 2 , 2017also , there are no such statistics that trump is referring to .
so not only is he making it impossible for the suspect to receive a fair trail , he is demonstrating his complete ignorance of the justice system.featured image : alex wong/getty images
