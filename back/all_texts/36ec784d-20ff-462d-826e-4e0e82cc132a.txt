Obama had a chance to speak of the horrors going on in the Middle East and to say so much more but he chose to behave like a college professor and lecture the Iranians: That path is now available to a nation like Iran, which, as of this moment, continues to deploy violent proxies to advance its interests.
These efforts may appear to give Iran leverage in disputes with neighbors, but they fuel sectarian conflict that endangers the entire region and isolates Iran from the promise of trade and commerce.
The Iranian people have a proud history and are filled with extraordinary petition, but chanting death to America does not create jobs or make Iran more secure.
What a Putz!
