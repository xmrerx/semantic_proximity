SYDNEY (Reuters) - A car was deliberately driven into pedestrians in the Australian city of Melbourne on Thursday, injuring up to 14 people, though the motive was not known, police said.
We believe based on what we have seen that it is a deliberate act, Victorian Police commander Russell Barrett told media in Melbourne.
The motivations are unknown.
