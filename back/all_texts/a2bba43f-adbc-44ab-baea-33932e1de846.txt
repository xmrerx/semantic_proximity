The human rights debacle that is being referred to as the Flint water crisis has just been summed up perfectly by political cartoonist Matt Wuerker, who found a brilliant way to express the true underlying issues behind this massive issue in one powerful image:Cartoon by Matt WuerkerThanks to the irresponsible, neglectful actions of Republican governor Rick Snyder and Emergency Manager Darnell Earley, a city with over 100,000 residents the majority of which are African American has been poisoned.
Almost a dozen people have died from Legionnaire s Disease as a result, with dozens more becoming seriously ill.As more evidence surfaces, Snyder s disturbing role in the crisis has become crystal clear, adding to the outrage as many call for Snyder to resign and be held accountable for allowing this to happen to Flint.
Among those speaking out is filmmaker and Flint native Michael Moore, who called Snyder out for having knowingly poisoned a black city and racial killing.
Flint homeowners have been lied to and were told that their tap water which in some areas is polluted enough to meet the EPA s standards for toxic waste was safe to drink, even though it was discolored.Twitter TwitterThe damage that Snyder s carelessness has caused is irreversible, and it will take 10-15 years for the real damage of the lead-poisoned, highly corrosive water to be calculated.
For the children of Flint, this could be deadly.
It s not just homeowners that have been affected either even hospitals are without safe water.TwitterWe cannot ignore the fact that Flint is a predominately black city with a large low-income population.Even as more evidence is gathered, many GOPers in Michigan (aside from Snyder) are calling the water crisis a hoax.
Republican L. Brooks Patterson has even called reputable reports of the lead poisoning false .
Earlier today, Snyder said that race played no role in the water crisis when asked a question from a New York Times article that asked, If Flint were rich and mostly white, would Michigan s state government have responded more quickly and aggressively to complaints about its lead-polluted water?
