CNN recently broke the news that according to investigators working with the FBI regarding Hillary Clinton s use of a private email server:The FBI has not yet interviewed Clinton as part of its investigation.
As CNN first reported, investigators have not found evidence to support criminal charges against Clinton and none are expected, but no final determination will be made until that interview has taken place.The story, published this weekend, has been buried as more information emerges regarding the horrific terrorist attack in Orlando that left 50 people dead and 53 injured.The revelations from the FBI come as investigators begin poring through her emails regarding a classified drone campaign, which was eventually scrapped.
Before it was scrapped, however, several media outlets (including the Washington Post) obtained information and circulated.
Such information subsequently then ended up on Clinton s private email server.
According to CNN:So sorry, Republicans (and Susan Sarandon), it looks as though there won t be any indictment.
And it s not because President Obama endorsed her.
It s not because of a rigged system.
It s not because of the liberal media.
It s because she broke no laws.And we all know Republicans hate the truth, so only time will tell until they start to turn their backs on the FBI and denounce them as traitors to America.Featured image via Angelo Merendino
