washington ( reuters ) - republican presidential front-runner donald trump told the new york times he would consider stopping u.s. oil purchases from saudi arabia unless the saudi government provide troops to fight islamic state .
trump ’ s comment on friday was included in a lengthy foreign policy interview published by the newspaper on saturday and came in response to a question about whether , if elected president , he would halt oil purchases from u.s. allies unless they provided on-the-ground forces against islamic state .
“ the answer is , probably yes , ” trump said , according to a transcript .
trump has said the united states should be reimbursed by the countries it provides protection , even those with vast resources such as saudi arabia , a top oil exporter .
“ and yet , without us , saudi arabia wouldn ’ t exist for very long , ” trump told the times .
“ ... we ’ re not being reimbursed for the kind of tremendous service that we ’ re performing by protecting various countries .
now saudi arabia ’ s one of them. ” trump also named in the interview retired major general gary harrell , major general bert mizusawa and retired rear admiral charles kubic as additional foreign policy advisors to the five named earlier this week who were criticized as obscure .
trump has faced questions about his reluctance to reveal who was advising his campaign .
he told the times he was willing to rethink traditional u.s. alliances should he become president .
