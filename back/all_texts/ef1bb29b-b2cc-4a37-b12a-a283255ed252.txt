Yesterday, Vice President Pence made the decision to leave the Indianapolis Colts game after players on the opposing team kneeled during our national anthem.I left today's Colts game because @POTUS and I will not dignify any event that disrespects our soldiers, our Flag, or our National Anthem.
Vice President Pence (@VP) October 8, 2017Today, Meghan McCain spent her first day as a co-host in the liberal lion s den, aka The View, defending the flag and attempting to explain why Americans are so offended when NFL players disrespect our flag by kneeling during the national anthem.Anyone who has watched The View since Donald Trump won the election knows, that the show is a safe space for angry liberal women to go, where they can justify their feelings of hate and frustration for President Trump, and anyone who holds an opinion that is counter to theirs.
The View has become a laughing stock of mainstream America and is nothing more than a therapy session for women with Trump Derangement Syndrome (women who can t get over Crooked Hillary s loss in 2016 presidential election).Before we sign off, we d like to address the outrage by liberals over the cost for VP Pence to attend the Colt s game in his home state of Indiana.
This awesome tweet by Rock Princess pretty much sums up the idiocy of the left and how they re using the cost of Vice President Pence s trip to his home state to distract from the disgust Americans have for the 49 ers who continue to disrespect for our flag:The price tag for transportation for Obama to Los Angeles for the Gwyneth Paltrow fundraiser cost taxpayers $1,011,051.30 cry more, losers https://t.co/a3o7pIoD2K RockPrincess (@Rockprincess818) October 9, 2017
