Antifa is a violent, anti-fascist protest group with deep roots in the political left.
The disparate, loosely organized factions of the group are peppered throughout the country and show up at events that they deem fascist in order to disrupt and often engage in criminal behavior.A detailed list of what antifa stands for is hard to pin down, but it is certainly anti-Trump, and the group s tactics typically involve the destruction of property and violence towards innocent civilians.That violence has resulted in a number of antifa arrests over the past few months.
Last weekend, marauding mobs of antifa thugs descended upon UC Berkeley s campus in California in protest of a prayer event.
The antifa members systematically hunted down and beat innocent civilians in the street, assaulting journalists, veterans and police officers along the way.
