roughly 70 % of states use some form of electronic voting machine .
the ease with which these machines can be manipulated is stunning donald trump said this week that he fears the election will be rigged for hillary clinton .
although he didn t specify exactly how clinton , her team , or her supporters would commit widespread voter fraud , allowing her to steal a presidential election , he insisted that the 2012 presidential election demonstrated a cause for significant concern.i ve been hearing about it for a long time , trump told cnn .
and i know last time , there were you had precincts where there was practically nobody voting for the republican .
and i think that s wrong .
i think that was unfair , frankly .
many of trump s supporters agree.but how easy is it to actually rig an election ?
it turns out that while voting machines are notoriously easy to hack , throwing a national election is a major operation that would require serious technical firepower.in a recent cbs news report , hackers demonstrated that individual electronic voting machines the kind used in most precincts are particularly vulnerable.watch : via : heat street
