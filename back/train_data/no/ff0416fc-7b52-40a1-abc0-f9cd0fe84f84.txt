the women s convention in detroit brings to mind the stereotypical liberal female who s angry and bitter : the detroit free press published photo after photo of women with raised fists and a look of anger see what we re getting at ?
the tired and failing democrats are grasping at the notion that president trump is the enemy .
they re behaving like sheeple and following blindly so it s no surprise that they followed the tired chant from california rep. maxine waters .
she shouted impeach 45 during her speech at the women s convention saturday.headlining speaker : waters was the headlining speaker for the women s march event , devoted part of her speech to leading the female attendees into a chant calling for the impeachment of president donald trump .
video footage shows women on their feet with their fists in the air shouting impeach 45 !
impeach 45 !
waters s speech focused on the recent allegations of sexual harassment against figures like harvey weinstein .
she also mentioned trump s past behavior towards women , declaring this president has no respect for women .
chanting `` impeach 45 '' led by @ repmaxinewaters alongside hundreds of strong , like-minded women is my happy place .
