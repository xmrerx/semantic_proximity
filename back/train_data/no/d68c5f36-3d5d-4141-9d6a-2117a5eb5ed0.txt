athens ( reuters ) - greece s top court cleared the way on wednesday for the extradition to the united states of a russian man , also wanted in moscow , suspected of having laundered billions of dollars in the digital currency bitcoin .
a final decision on where alexander vinnik is extradited to now lies with the greek justice minister , who steps in to resolve competing requests .
vinnik , the alleged mastermind of a $ 4 billion bitcoin laundering ring , is one of seven russians arrested or indicted worldwide this year on u.s. cybercrime charges .
u.s. authorities accuse him of running btc-e a digital currency exchange used to trade bitcoin to facilitate crimes ranging from computer hacking to drug trafficking since 2011 .
he denies the charges against him and says he was a technical consultant to btc-e and not its operator .
since vinnik s arrest in a village in northern greece in july , moscow has also requested he be returned home , as it has done before with other nationals wanted by the united states .
vinnik has agreed to be returned to russia , where he is wanted on lesser fraud charges amounting to 10,000 euros , but he appealed to the greek supreme court against a ruling that he be extradited to the united states .
the supreme court rejected his appeal on wednesday .
bitcoin was the first digital currency to successfully use cryptography to keep transactions secure and anonymous , making it difficult to subject them to conventional financial regulations .
the price of bitcoin has soared this year and hit another all-time high on tuesday , two days after the launch of the first bitcoin futures contract on a u.s. exchange .
