WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Jordan’s King Abdullah praised U.S. President Donald Trump’s commitment to addressing the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and said he had hope for the Arab League peace initiative proposed for the region.
“The president’s early engagement in bringing the Palestinians and Israelis together has been a very encouraging sign for all of us,” Abdullah said at a White House news conference with the new American president.
Abdullah said the Arab League peace initiative “offers a historic reconciliation between Israel and the Palestinians.”
