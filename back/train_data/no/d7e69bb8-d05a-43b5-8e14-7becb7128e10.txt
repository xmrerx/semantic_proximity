paris ( reuters ) - france accused the syrian government on wednesday of obstructing u.n.-led peace talks with its refusal to return to geneva and called on russia not to shirk its responsibilities to get damascus to the negotiating table .
talks on ending the war in syria resumed on wednesday , but with no sign of president bashar al-assad s negotiators returning to the table in geneva .
the process began last week .
but after a few days with little apparent progress , the u.n. mediator staffan de mistura said the syrian government delegation led by bashar al-ja afari was returning to damascus to consult and refresh .
france condemns the absence of the delegation of the regime and its refusal to engage in good faith in the negotiations to achieve a political solution , french foreign ministry deputy spokesman alexandre georgini told reporters .
this refusal highlights the obstruction strategy of the political process carried out by the damascus regime , which is responsible for the absence of progress in the negotiations , he added .
he said russia , as one of president bashar al-assad s main backers , needed to assume its responsibilities so that the syrian government finally entered the negotiations .
de mistura had said he expected talks to resume around tuesday dec. 5 , but ja afari said before leaving that he might not come back because the opposition had stated that assad could not play a role in a future interim government .
during last week s sessions , de mistura shuttled between the representatives of the two warring sides , who did not meet face-to-face .
he had planned to continue the round until dec. 15 .
