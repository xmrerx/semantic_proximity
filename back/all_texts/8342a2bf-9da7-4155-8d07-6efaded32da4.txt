On Friday, Fox News reported that the intelligence official one of twenty people who could possibly do so according to NSA Director Mike Rogers who unmasked Trump associates with connections to Russia was very high up.
While it was never a secret that only high-ranking officials could make such a decision if they determined it was in the best interest of the country, this is apparently VERY BIG NEWS according to Donald Trump and his favorite propaganda outlet.
Wow, @FoxNews just reporting big news.
Source: Official behind unmasking is high up.
Known Intel official is responsible, Trump tweeted during his traditional Saturday morning rant.
Some unmasked not associated with Russia.
Trump team spied on before he was nominated.
If this is true, does not get much bigger.
Would be sad for U.S. Wow, @FoxNews just reporting big news.

Would be sad for U.S. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017Note that Trump said some of the people named were not associated with Russia.
This, of course, serves as a tacit admission that members of his team were indeed involved with Putin.Naturally, Twitter was very excited about Trump s huge news:@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Why are you telling Flynn to ask for immunity?
Wouldn't that only be necessary if you KNEW he had something to hide?

You seem overly worried about something you say is 'BIGLY FAKE'.

Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) April 1, 2017@realDonaldTrump Are you aware that you're the President of the United States, and control all the intelligence agencies?
Dom Knight (@domknight) April 1, 2017@realDonaldTrump If it is true, I'm sure it's because you are a threat to the nation and the previous administration was aware of that.
Thanks Obama!

Based on his actions, even speculation has not scratched the surface.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)/screengrab
