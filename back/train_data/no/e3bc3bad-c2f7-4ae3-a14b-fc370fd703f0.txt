madrid ( reuters ) - more than half of spanish voters favor an early national election , a survey showed on monday , as support waned for a minority government embroiled in the country s worst political crisis in decades .
prime minister mariano rajoy imposed direct rule on the region of catalonia after it held an independence referendum on oct. 1 that spanish courts had declared illegal .
the term of the minority government led by his center-right people s party ( pp ) expires in 2020 , but 55 percent of respondents in monday s survey said they wanted a ballot before then .
the figure in an equivalent survey in october was 49 percent .
the poll was taken by pollsters metroscopia for newspaper el pais newspaper between nov. 6 and 8 as former catalan president carles puigdemont whose government was sacked by rajoy pursued his campaign for the region s independence from self-imposed exile in belgium .
authorities in madrid have called an election in catalonia for dec. 21 .
rajoy was given a second term in october 2016 when the pp won the most votes but failed to take a parliament majority .
the pp s weakness in parliament has meant the government has struggled to pass legislation , including the 2018 budget .
support for the pp , if the elections were held today , slipped to 26.1 percent in november from 26.9 percent in july .
backing for ciudadanos ( citizens ) , a pro-spanish unity party originally from catalonia , jumped to 22.7 percent from 18.5 percent , putting it equal second with the socialists .
the poll reflected an official survey taken at the beginning of october that showed support for ciudadanos had risen during the catalan crisis , which has become spaniards second-largest issue of concern after unemployment .
left-wing podemos , which supports a negotiated referendum on catalan independence , saw voting intentions drop to 14.7 percent from 18.7 percent previously , the metroscopia poll showed .
