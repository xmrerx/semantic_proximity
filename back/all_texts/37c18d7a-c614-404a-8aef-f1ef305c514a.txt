ERBIL (Reuters) - Iraq s Kurdistan Regional Government on Monday called on the international community to intervene and help lift sanctions imposed by the central government in Baghdad in retaliation for a September referendum on Kurdish independence.
The restrictive policies adopted by Baghdad against Erbil are in violation of Iraq s obligations and responsibilities under international and humanitarian law, the KRG said in a statement.
We call on the international community to intercede in urging Baghdad authorities to lift the embargo, without condition, on international flights.
