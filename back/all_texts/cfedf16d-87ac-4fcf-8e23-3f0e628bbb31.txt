It you re into puzzles and figuring stuff out, you ve been loving the past few weeks trying to figure out who the vice presidential picks for either major party will be.
Now that we know Indiana Gov.
Mike Pence is Donald Trump s pick, we re now left to sift through clues to figure out who Hillary Clinton will give the nod too.Well, one huge clue was given when Elizabeth Warren showed up at Hillary Clinton s Washington D.C. home today, but an ever bigger clue has come as Warren s name appears to no longer be on the speaking schedule for the Democratic National Convention.Originally slotted to speak as the keynote speaker on Monday night of the convention, Warren s name is now missing.According to Politico, this is the schedule as it stands now:Monday: First Lady Michelle Obama, Senator Bernie Sanders and DREAMer Astrid Silva Gavel time expected at 3:00 p.m.Tuesday: President Bill Clinton Gavel time expected at 4:00 p.m.Also scheduled Tuesday are Mothers of the Movement members Gwen Carr, Mother of Eric Garner; Sybrina Fulton, Mother of Trayvon Martin; Maria Hamilton, Mother of Dontr Hamilton; Lucia McBath, Mother of Jordan Davis; Lezley McSpadden, Mother of Michael Brown; Cleopatra Pendleton-Cowley, Mother of Hadiya Pendleton; Geneva Reed-Veal, Mother of Sandra Bland.Wednesday: President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden Gavel time expected at 4:30 p.m.Thursday: Hillary Clinton and Chelsea Clinton Gavel time expected at 4:30 p.m.Very interesting indeed.Noticeably also missing are other members on Clinton s shortlist for vice president, such as Sherrod Brown and Tim Kaine, but seeing as Warren was scheduled to speak, and now isn t, it could be very, very telling.Now that Trump has rounded out his ticket with Mike Pence, a man who represents the only group Trump has yet to openly hate the LGBT community it s looking pretty good for Clinton come November, and hopefully whoever she picks as her VP will round out the ticket nicely.Featured image via Jessica Kourkounis/Getty Images
