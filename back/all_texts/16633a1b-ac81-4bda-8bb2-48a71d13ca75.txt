Sorry Bernie, but it s all about Obama s third term and he s not about to let some geriatric socialist screw that up for him The Democrats true, Hillary-loving, stacking the deck, anti-democracy colors came through loud and clear today when President Obama screwed over Bernie Sanders just hours after he played nice and shook his hand during a private White House meeting.Here is Bernie Sanders still at the White House thanking Obama for not endorsing a candidate while he is still in the race (Sanders says he is staying in through the last primary which is next week).#Democratic candidate @BernieSanders thanked @POTUS Obama and VP @JoeBiden for their impartiality #voanews pic.twitter.com/Qyk72eg7ja The Voice of America (@VOANews) June 9, 2016Just a few hours later, Barack Obama decided he couldn t wait a week until Sanders backed out and endorsed Hillary anyhow.
