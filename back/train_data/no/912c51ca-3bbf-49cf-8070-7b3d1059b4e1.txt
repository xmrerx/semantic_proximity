hillary clinton told a group of graduates how she coped with her election loss is anyone surprised that she hit the wine bottle to get over it ?
the only problem is that she just gave an interview full of bitter reasons why she feels she beat donald trump ( see below ) .
this woman is still in denial and still believes she s got a chance to run for anything ! hillary clinton just made the claim that she beat president trump in the 2016 election .
the bitter and delusional clinton is a woman who can t let the loss go in a lengthy interview in new york magazine , clinton made the claim that she beat both sanders and trump in the 2016 election : i beat both of them , she said , evidently referencing her popular vote win over trump .
