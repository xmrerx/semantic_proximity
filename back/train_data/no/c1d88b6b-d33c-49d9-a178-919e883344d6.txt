donald trump jr gets more from his dad than just his name , of all the trump kids , don seems to be most obsessed with appearing macho .
unfortunately , it never works out for him .
and even worse , when he faces the inevitable mockery for his hamfisted attempts to appear tough , his first response is to hide.twitter got to see a perfect example of this on saturday , after don jr. thought he d take a dig at the mainstream media and walked right into a pretty hilarious self-own .
donald trump jr. , hot off of tweeting that his critics were triggered , got triggered himself after posting this tweet onto his social media account : i 'm going to have to buy 5-10,000 of these to pass around to our buddies in the # msm .
in the meantime i 'll model it for them ? .
# yourewelcome pic.twitter.com/hnn3z5pspm donald trump jr. ( @ donaldjtrumpjr ) april 15 , 2017any normal person would look at this picture and go please delete this and never show it to another human being .
everything about it was sad .
the weird thumbs up .
the pained expression on his face that was presumably supposed to signal toughness .
the shirt oh god , the shirt .
instead of deleting the photo in shame , don tweeted it with an equally embarrassing caption.playing into his father s rabid base of right-wing fanatics , don promised to send 10,000 shirts reading very fake news to his friends in the mainstream media .
like the rest of the trump family , don hates the media because they have repeatedly debunked trump s lies .
don has retreated into his own conservative bubble , recently praising a pro-rape white nationalist blogger named mike cernovich , suggesting the conspiracy theorist deserves a pulitzer.but don couldn t take it after he dished it .
soon after tweeting , he started facing relentless mockery .
@ donaldjtrumpjr hahaha lol ! ! !
