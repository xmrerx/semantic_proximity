according to a new survey by mclaughlin and associates , 69 percent of americans back the president s order to end the catch and release policy and make stronger laws regarding the deportation of criminal illegal aliens .
this included hispanic voters , 56 percent of whom support the deportation of criminal aliens.52 percent of the democratic voters who supported hillary clinton in the last election said they supported ending the catch and release policy.across the board , 59 percent of those polled agreed that federal funding for sanctuary cities should be cut and 29 percent disagreeing .
hispanic voters were a little more divided on the issue though with 46 percent supporting the cutting of funds and 43 percent opposing it.this is an excellent example of the fact that president trump s common sense policies are being well received by americans , regardless of ethnic background .
there s nothing un-american about deporting criminals , so please don t let the media tell you otherwise .
