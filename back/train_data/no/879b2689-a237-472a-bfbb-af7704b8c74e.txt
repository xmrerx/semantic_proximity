australian senator larissa waters recently went viral after she made history by becoming the first woman to breastfeed in the country s parliament .
but waters resigned today after it was revealed that she has dual citizenship in australia and canada , a breach of australia s constitution for sitting senators.waters , a member of australia s green party , became an international sensation in may when she breastfed her two-month old daughter in australia s parliament .
the country had only just legalized the practice in 2016 , paving the way for a more family-friendly environment in australian politics.waters was born in winnipeg in 1977 to two australian parents and moved down under when she was just 11 months old .
australia s constitution forbids anyone with dual citizenship from serving as a senator .
waters , who says she was unaware that she held citizenship in canada , was elected in 2010 .
i was devastated to learn that because of 70-year-old canadian laws i had been a dual citizen from birth , and that canadian law changed a week after i was born and required me to have actively renounced canadian citizenship , waters said at a press conference today .
it is with a heavy heart that i am forced to resign as senator for queensland and co-deputy leader of the australian greens , effective today , she continued.waters is the second australian senator who s had to resign in as many weeks .
