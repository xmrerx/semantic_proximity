dublin ( reuters ) - irish prime minister leo varadkar s fine gael party surged into an 11-point lead in a poll on thursday , gaining credit for the government s brexit negotiating stance and indicating its recent near-collapse had not hurt his popularity .
varadkar has played a key role in negotiations over britain s withdrawl from the european union this week , insisting that a tentative deal struck on the irish border on monday must be fulfilled if talks are to move onto the next phase , as london wants .
that was in sharp contrast to a week earlier when his deputy prime minister had to resign to avert a government collapse and election before christmas , an episode that members of fine gael feared would damage both the party and its leader .
yet support for fine gael rose by five points to 36 percent in the irish times/mrbi poll , while fellow centre-right rival fianna fail has fallen four points to 25 percent since october .
the left-wing sinn fein party was unchanged on 19 percent .
the most recent survey taken by another polling company , conducted during the government crisis , showed that the two main parties were almost neck and neck .
the number of undecided voters was far higher in the mrbi sample .
satisfaction with the government also rose by five points to 41 percent in thursday s poll , the highest level achieved by any government in almost a decade .
today s poll proves that timing is everything , said mrbi director aisling corcoran .
interviewing took place on monday and tuesday against the backdrop of brexit negotiations and the government has been credited with approaching the negotiations with clarity and determination .
