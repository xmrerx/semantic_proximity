there are no words for these selfish sub-humans here are a couple of profiles from twitter of the people tweeting about blm being ignored because of nice terror tragedy .
they have both made their twitter accounts private : we found this sweet self-described georgia peach listed as a fashion contributor at company called xonecole.com feel free to send a message to her boss on their facebook page .
click here for link.here s another pathetic twitter user : @ _nehoda_ who whined about the attention victims of the nice terror attack were taking from the blm movement .
she s lists herself as living in london , but calls egypt the motherland ? ?
hmmm how does a muslim woman living in london get hooked up with blm terrorists in us ? and then there s the other muslim living in london who s a bit more brash with his tweets : do n't # prayfornice we are fighting a civil war against whites .
# blm andre johnson ( @ larrykingfisher ) july 15 , 2016here are a few replies to omar s tweet : here are a few of this muslim punk s remarks threatening a caliphate and boasting about how the muslims have already won the war against the west : here s real bright guy who s got nothing better to do than take to twitter complaining about the plight of black people on the day after a major terror attack that killed over 80 people .
never mind that people just lost their husbands , wives , children , kids , friends , relatives or co-workers.some white people die in europe and now the media can ignore the plight of black people being exterminated # blacklivesmatter # niceattack bob schmidt ( @ bobschmidt857 ) july 15 , 2016we tryna rise up for equality n somehow a 'muslim ' attacks people ?
# blacklivesmatter # fakeshit # niceattack daye hazit ( @ yurboydw ) july 15 , 2016the real tragedy about the # niceattack is that it takes the spotlight away from # blacklivesmatter thealtrightprofessor ( @ nationalistprof ) july 14 , 2016and finally this guy nails it : nice job with pr # blacklivesmatter nothing makes people want to support you like whining about `` getting the limelight stolen '' by # niceattack pink snow kitty ( @ hugothepinkcat ) july 15 , 2016
