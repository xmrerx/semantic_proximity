imagine what it must be like to be one of the only people in america who doesn t have to abide by any of our laws .
apparently it pays to be a clinton.even though it s against the law to campaign inside the polling place or within 100 feet of the measured entrances of the polling place in ny , hillary and bill can clearly been seen breaking that law in the video below .
much like obama though , hillary knows that no one will hold her accountable for her actions .
she and bill are above the laws that the everyday people hillary claims to be a champion for , are required to follow.watch hillary and bill pander for votes in the video below : ny state law prohibiting electioneering activities in ny : while the polls are open no person shall do any electioneering within the polling place , or in any public street , within a one hundred foot radial measured from the entrances designated by the inspectors of election , to such polling place or within such distance in any place in a public manner ; and no political banner , button , poster or placard shall be allowed in or upon the polling place or within such one hundred foot radial .
