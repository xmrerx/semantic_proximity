There are so many reasons for this little coward to leave America and travel abroad for the duration of his term.
Does he have knowledge of an imminent attack on America and wants to be overseas when it happens?
Is he using taxpayer money to travel around the world campaigning for UN Secretary General?
Perhaps he wants to be on the other side of the world when criminal proceedings against Hillary heat up?
Plotting against America for seven straight years can be exhausting.
Maybe he just needs a break?
Or perhaps it s just as simple as wanting to hit some international golf courses on our dime.
Whatever his reasons, we can be sure that the American taxpayer will once again, be stuck with a hefty bill as this fraud travels across the globe contributing to the greatest danger our nation faces as he spews dreaded CO2 into the environment.While Obama s scorched-earth policies continue to ravage America and beyond, the president will be busy touring the world for much of the duration of his term.The purpose is to seal his foreign policy legacy, according to Politico.Obama is planning to travel the globe to seal his foreign policy legacy https://t.co/iUK6SvPv8O | Getty pic.twitter.com/iwe5Zub5te POLITICO (@politico) December 29, 2015Hold onto your hats folks, it could be a bumpy ride.According to Politico:Obama has asked aides to set a busy international travel schedule for him in his final year, with half a dozen trips already in the works and more potentially coming together.
