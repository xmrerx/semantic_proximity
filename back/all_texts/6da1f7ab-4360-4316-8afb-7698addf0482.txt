In an announcement that can put a lot of minds at ease, former Mayor of New York City Michael Bloomberg has decided that he will not be running for president.
If he had decided to run, it would have undoubtedly split the vote, and could have in turn resulted in Donald Trump being president.In an editorial on Bloomberg View, the former mayor wrote: Over the last several months, many Americans have urged me to run for president as an independent, and some who don t like the current candidates have said it is my patriotic duty to do so.
I appreciate their appeals, and I have given the question serious consideration.
The deadline to answer it is now, because of ballot access requirements.
But when I look at the data, it s clear to me that if I entered the race, I could not win.
I believe I could win a number of diverse states but not enough to win the 270 Electoral College votes necessary to win the presidency.
Bloomberg Politics pointed out: In order to win, Bloomberg would have had to win pluralities in enough states to capture 270 electoral votes.
The Constitution also provides for the election to be thrown into the House of Representatives to decide if no candidate can secure those votes, though that method has been used only twice, after the elections in 1800 and 1824.
That body is controlled by a Republican majority.
It would be almost certain the Republican nominated would ve won the presidency by any way the votes tallied.This was a very smart move on behalf of Bloomberg, putting country before his personal want to be the next Commander-in Chief.
It s looking more and more like Trump will be the Republican nominee and Clinton the Democratic.
Bloomberg seems to realize that in order for the Democratic candidate to win in the general election they are going to need all the votes they can get.
Good on Bloomberg for this move.Featured image via Flickr
