While the media continues to push the narrative that Trump is catching up to Clinton, painting a doomsday scenario for Clinton s campaign, such a sentiment couldn t be further from the truth.A new poll from Reuters/Ipsos shows Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton leading the Republican candidate Donald Trump by eleven points (her largest lead yet), 46-35, while 19 percent weren t sure or responded with someone else.
This newest poll shows even more good news for Clinton: just last week, the same poll had her up by only five points.Clinton also (not surprisingly) leads Donald Trump in favorability.
A staggering 60 percent of respondents polled said they have an unfavorable rating, while 40 percent approved of the Republican blowhard.
On top of that, President Obama s approval rating is at 52 percent, which is good news for Democrats.
One of the deciding factors in presidential elections is the incumbent s approval rating.Clinton has been hitting Trump harder than ever this past week, highlighting his bad temperament, and the impending Trump University case that stands before him.
Given Trump s open hostility to the judge in the case, Democrats should be feeling pretty good about how it s going to pan out.In total, over 1,600 people were polled, a sizable number.It s also worth noting that Reuters also had Trump beating Clinton just three weeks ago by less than a percentage.
As Clinton steps up her attacks, voters begin to flock to her.That s what happens when qualified women take on a loud, racist, sexist bully.
Come September, when those two square off on the debate stage, Clinton will tear him to shreds, and the poor sap won t have his Twitter account pulled up to counter her and that s assuming he doesn t chicken out of a debate like he did with Sanders.As the months go forward, team Clinton is ready to take on Trump and his ilk.
Expanding their ever growing staff over 800 in comparison to Trump s 100, Clinton is laying the groundwork for a bare knuckle brawl that will go until every vote is counted on November 8th.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
