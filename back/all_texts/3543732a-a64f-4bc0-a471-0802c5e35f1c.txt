21st Century Wire says Worth watching.
The Ed Snowden cameo is class.
The Star Wars Libertarian Special features Senate filibusters, border patrol stops, eminent domain, a guest appearance by Edward Snowden, and rarely seen footage from Chewbacca s galaxy-trotting documentary series about free-market economics.
Watch here: FYI: This parody is not affiliated with the Star Wars Holiday Special (1978), though you should watch it if you haven t already.
