on friday , a federal judge in new york issued an emergency stay temporarily halting the removal of individuals detained after president trump issued an order to ban immigrants from seven muslim-majority countries from entering the u.s.the move appears to mark the first successful legal challenge to the trump administration and affects those who have arrived in the u.s. with previously approved refugee applications or were in transit with valid visas .
similar rulings were later issued in virginia , massachusetts and washington state.u.s .
district court judge ann donnelly ruled in favor of a habeas corpus petition filed by the american civil liberties union ( aclu ) on behalf of two iraqi men who were detained at john f. kennedy international airport on friday after trump signed his order.donnelly , who was nominated by former president barack obama and confirmed to her judgeship in 2015 , ruled in the eastern district of new york that there is imminent danger that , absent the stay of removal , there will be substantial and irreparable injury to refugees , visa-holders , and other individuals from nations subject to trump s order .
the hill the aclu is getting multiple reports that federal customs agents are siding with president trump and willfully ignoring a brooklyn federal judge s demand that travelers from seven muslim countries not be deported from the nation s airports .
the court s order could not be clearer they need to comply with the order , omar jadwat , director of the aclu s immigrants rights project , told the post late saturday .
it s enough to be a serious concern , jadwat said of the reports.jadwat and other aclu lawyers had earlier saturday night won an emergency stay of trump s deportation order from brooklyn federal judge ann donnelly .
