johannesburg ( reuters ) - a group of 36 dutch tourists were flying out of south africa on tuesday after they were robbed at gunpoint on sunday in a brazen heist while traveling from johannesburg s main international airport to their hotel , officials said .
the incident is an embarrassment for south africa , a country keen to promote itself as a tourist destination but scarred by violent crime .
tourism accounts for 3 percent of gdp and is seen as a bright spot in an otherwise moribund economy .
journalists saw the group pull out of the hotel in a bus under police escort after they met with south africa s police minister and tourist minister as well the ambassador from the netherlands .
we ll bring these criminals to book .
we ll find them , police minister fikile mbalula told journalists after the meeting .
the bus was stopped on sunday night by a vehicle with police markings and one man in police uniform with five accomplices in civilian clothing robbed the tourists at gunpoint .
nobody was shot but two people were injured , police said .
dutch ambassador marisa gerards said most of the tourists had to cut their visit short because all of their belongings were taken .
ironically , she said many of the tourists had booked this organized trip out of safety concerns .
south africa entices tourists with first-rate infrastructure , sunshine , beaches , wildlife and an exchange rate that makes its food and wine cheap by global standards .
but a jobless rate of over 25 percent and glaring income disparities have worsened its problems with violent crime .
the murder rate is 34 per 100,000 people , according to data released by police last year , almost seven times the rate in the united states .
