On Thursday night, actor Bradley Whitford, of Transparent and West Wing fame, stopped by the Late Show to speak with Stephen Colbert.
It just so happens that Colbert had adorable adoptable puppies there on the set Thursday night as well, and Whitford brought one out with him for his interview.Whitford explained that the puppy, Tucker, was calming him down, and that the little animal was helping him deal with Donald Trump s presidency.
Whitford said: I need a service dog, since the election.
Colbert reminded Whitford that the actor had already been in full-blown Trump panic back in September, and then proceeded to ask him how he is now.
Whitford said: This is calming me, but I do want to reiterate that our president was a birther, which is racist and un-American.
And we have a white nationalist working in the White House, and they have conflated refugees with terrorism, and now they are picking on transgender people.
It s not a joke, and it s very upsetting.
Colbert went on to share some of Whitford s large number of political tweets, which are coming these days in a seemingly unending stream.
His profile photo also shows him in a pink pussy hat from the historic Women s March.I am so happy that this man articulated what so many of us are feeling these days.
I d like one of those puppies to get me through the next four years as well.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture
