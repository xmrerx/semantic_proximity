Donald Trump is now pretending that all the A list celebrities want tickets to his inauguration so he can say he rejected them.Trump s team has been desperately looking for any big star they can find to perform at the inauguration ceremony on January 20th.
But nobody wants to ruin their career and reputation by appearing at that shit-show.Trump has even reportedly offered large sums of money and ambassadorships in exchange if someone will agree to sell their soul for a day.Now Trump is claiming that all the A list celebrities are begging him for tickets to the inauguration.The so-called A list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING.
I want the PEOPLE!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 23, 2016Yep.
Trump is pathetically trying to appeal to the people by claiming that all A list celebrities are lining up to attend but that he s rejecting them because they supported Hillary and he would rather have the people.
But that s contradictory to Trump s effort to get A list talent to perform at his inauguration.
Plus, Trump is clearly trying to soothe his own ego.Well, Twitter had something to say about that.
@realDonaldTrump You won dude.
You can t bitch for the next 4 years.
Or 2.
We ll see.

@realDonaldTrump Baby, if you keep tossing around these vague, self-aggrandizing claims people might start thinking you re full of baloney.

@realDonaldTrump You and I both know that no real celebrity would be caught dead cheering you on, but you need to be okay with that, angel.
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) December 23, 2016@realDonaldTrump Spreading disinformation once AGAIN.
Accept the fact that high-profile individuals do not WANT to attend your inauguration!
Ron Pragides (@mrp) December 23, 2016@realDonaldTrump You need to stay off Twitter, pal.
This is what you deem important, when half the world is crumbling around us.
Clueless.
Jeremy Pond (@JeremyPond) December 23, 2016@realDonaldTrump I hope David Blaine performs and makes you disappear Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) December 23, 2016@realDonaldTrump Scott Baio is a C+ celeb sir.
That is who wants to go.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) December 23, 2016@realDonaldTrump Speaking of people, 3 million less of them voted for you than for Hillary.

@realDonaldTrump Literally nobody wants tix to the inauguration Marlow Stern (@MarlowNYC) December 23, 2016.
@realDonaldTrump If you weren t our next president, your extreme pettiness would be highly amusing Simon Hedlin (@simonhedlin) December 23, 2016@realDonaldTrump No need to lie.
It s okay no one wants to come to your party.
We ve all been there.
I mean, not those of us with friends.
Jon Bershad (@JonBershad) December 23, 2016Seriously, I bet Trump stands in front of a mirror every day and tells himself that everybody likes him.
His ego is incredibly fragile so he has to make shit up to boost it.
It really is pathetic.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
