The football league formerly known as the Lingerie Football League (now the Legends Football League) announced via Instagram and video this week its belief that America s flag and national anthem are far too sacred to protest.The all-woman league said in a Tuesday statement that its players would not be taking a knee during the national anthem as many of their male counterparts in the NFL have done.
The LFL recognizes everyone s First Amendment right to protest, but our nation s flag and anthem are far too sacred, the league said.
Too many fellow Americans have made the ultimate sacrifice, so that our flag and anthem continue in all its majesty.
It symbolizes all the blood, sweat, and tears that have been shed so that we as Americans can raise our flag across our nation, the organization says during the video.
The LFL salutes all those who make this the greatest country in the world.
We stand in salute of our flag.
