tokyo ( reuters ) - heavy rain and powerful winds are expected to lash large areas of japan on sunday as a strong typhoon sweeps ashore , possibly hindering voter turnout in a national election .
typhoon lan was classified as an intense category 4 storm on saturday , with winds of up to 250 km/h ( 156 mph ) , according to the tropical storm risk web site .
by midday , it was south of south borodino island , east of okinawa , and moving northeast at 15 kph , the japan meteorological agency said .
it is expected to weaken to a category 1 typhoon as it nears the tokyo metropolitan area on monday morning , tropical storm risk said .
authorities in okinawa and hyogo prefectures have moved voting ahead a day for some remote islands as the storm neared , media said .
saturday marked the last day of campaigning for the parliament s lower house seats , and bad weather could deter some voters .
prime minister shinzo abe s liberal democratic party-led ( ldp ) coalition is on track to roughly match the two-thirds super majority it held in parliament s lower house before dissolution , helped by divisions in the opposition camp and jitters over north korea s nuclear and missile programs , media forecasts have said .
