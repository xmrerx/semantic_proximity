Sarah Palin is back at it again.
Only this time, Jake Tapper was caught in her crosshairs.
While discussing Donald Trump s flip-flopping on the issue of abortion, Palin somehow was inspired to bring Justin Bieber into the debate.
Let s just say CNN host Jake Tapper, wasn t exactly prepared for that.
It took him completely off-guard.Here was their exchange, in part:Tapper: Donald Trump is somebody who clearly has had different positions on issues than he has today, including an issue very near and dear to your heart, the issue of abortion and life.Palin: I am so glad Trump has seen the light.There are groups that are pro-life; they are giving Trump a hard time on his views of abortion while they re celebrating others like, umm, I was going through a list, like Justin Bieber, and umm, gosh Tapper: Justin Bieber?Palin: Yeah, yeah .Pic via screen capture.We can only imagine what was going through his head when she said that.
The expression on his face, though, was utterly PRICELESS.
That much is for certain.So, why then, was Palin bringing up Justin Bieber?
We were curious.
We did some digging, and apparently the teen heartthrob made some past statements about waiting until you re in love before you do anything with a girl, and, I don t really believe in abortion .It s like killing a baby.
He said that back in 2011.
Why that s relevant, we still don t know.We re also not sure what s going through Donald Trump s head by his continuing to let Mrs. Palin stump for him.
Why is she still doing interviews?
Personally, we love it.
We hadn t laughed this much since, well, when Trump began running.
It s like every single interview is a skit straight out of Saturday Night Live.
Laughter is the best medicine, they say.Featured image from screen capture.
