beirut ( reuters ) - lebanon s army will deploy along the country s entire eastern border with syria and remain stationed there after recently recapturing areas from islamic state militants , army chief general joseph aoun said on friday .
the remarks appeared to confirm comments by the lebanese shi ite group hezbollah that it was handing over points it had controlled along the border to the military .
the army will deploy from now onwards along the extent of the eastern borders , to defend them , aoun said at a ceremony commemorating lebanese soldiers killed by islamic state .
an army offensive last month ended with the militants withdrawing from their last foothold along the border under a ceasefire deal .
the syrian army and hezbollah fought the jihadists separately on the syrian side .
hezbollah leader sayyed hassan nasrallah said in july it would be ready to hand over territory it captured if the lebanese army requested it .
hezbollah led a campaign in the same area that month to oust the nusra front jihadist group from their last foothold along the border .
security sources said hezbollah had begun handing over points it controlled .
iran-backed hezbollah has played a critical role in vanquishing sunni muslim jihadists in the border region during the six-year-long syrian war , part of its military support for syrian president bashar al-assad .
the group , an ally of lebanese president michel aoun , was key to the defeat of militants in the qalamoun area further south in 2015 , and at the syrian town of qusair , in 2013 .
lebanon s southern border with israel , a hezbollah foe , is patrolled by the united nations interim force in lebanon .
