quetta , pakistan ( reuters ) - at least six people were wounded on friday when a bomb went off along railway tracks in southwestern pakistan , halting train service in the region , security and railways officials said .
the train was traveling from baluchistan s capital of quetta to the eastern metropolis of lahore when a blast on the main railway track damaged one of its cars .
one train bogie was damaged in the blast and a portion of the tracks blown up , said railways official aammir baloch , adding that quetta s train services had been suspended .
security officials said six passengers were injured in the blast .
the taliban , sunni islam militants and sectarian groups linked to al qaeda and the islamic state group also operate in the strategically important region , which borders iran and afghanistan .
baluchistan is at the center of infrastructure projects that form part of china s belt and road initiative , which has brought $ 57 billion of investment to pakistan .
violence in the southwestern region has fueled concern about security for a transport and energy link planned to run from western china to pakistan s southern deepwater port of gwadar .
separatists in baluchistan , who have long battled the state for a greater share of the resources of the gas- and mineral-rich region , also accuse the central government of discrimination .
separately , two workers of a prominent political party were killed on friday in a landmine blast in the district of harnai near quetta as they traveled to a party meeting .
the victims were brothers and belonged to the awami national party , regional official abdul salam achakzai told reuters .
