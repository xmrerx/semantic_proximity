Christians don t decapitate their bosses Well, you can t argue with that logic Maybe they ll re-think their open-minded decision post-radical Islam massacre On Thursday the administrative tribunal of Grenoble suspended a judgement of the municipality of Charvieu-Chavagneux, in Is re, which said it only wanted to accept Christian refugees because they don t decapitate their bosses .
The judgement was pronounced after a request for summary suspension filed by the prefecture of Is re, the latter declared in a statement.The prefect initially asked the mayor to withdraw his judgement then initiated legal action when he refused to comply with his request.
The Charvieu-Chavagneux judgement seems to me to be liable to a double criticism on the basis of discrimination and the infringement of equality.
In this judgement approved unanimously by the municipal council on 8 September, Charvieu-Chavagneux town council said it wanted to mitigate the irresponsible foreign policy of the state by welcoming a family of refugees, on the express condition that it is a Christian family.
The municpality explained its choice by declaring that Christians don t jeopardise the security of anyone else, they don t attack trains armed with Kalashnikovs, they don t shoot journalists in editorial meetings and they don t decapitate their bosses as we saw happen only a few kilometres away from our town.
