apparently these trump supporters are also tired of seeing those images and decided to let these domestic terrorists know that their freedom of speech will not be taken away by a bunch of basement dwellers.watch this video as trump supporters clear the streets of the anti-trump attackers and send them running back to their parents basements listen near the middle of the video where one of the reporters tells viewers , they re kicking out antifa .
na , na , na , na , na , nah hey , hey yeah .
goodbye !
