santiago ( reuters ) - a mudslide on saturday tore through a small village in southern chile near a popular national park , leaving five people dead and at least 15 missing after a night of torrential downpours , authorities said .
a video taken from a helicopter by chilean police showed a vast swath of the remote town of villa santa lucia , near chaiten in coastal patagonia , buried beneath the mud as the landslide plowed its way down a flooded river valley .
four chileans and a male tourist whose name and nationality have not been disclosed were died in the mudslide , authorities said .
rescue workers were continuing to search through the debris for at least 15 people .
the mudslide also destroyed a school and several homes and roadways as well as a voting center ahead of chile s presidential election on sunday .
president michelle bachelet declared the area a disaster zone .
i have ordered rescue workers to put all the necessary resources toward protecting the people of villa santa lucia , she said on social media .
more than 4.5 inches ( 11.4 cm ) of rain fell in 24 hours , the country s interior ministry said , but weather conditions were expected to improve later in the day .
villa santa lucia borders chile s corcovado national park , a popular tourist region of volcanoes , fjords and vast forests .
the nearby chaiten volcano erupted in 2008 , forcing the evacuation of thousands of residents .
