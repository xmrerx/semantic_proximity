Donald Trump is a madman putting our nation on the brink of World War III and he isn t even in office yet.In a pair of tweets on Monday afternoon, Trump threatened North Korea after the country announced that they are nearly finished developig a nuclear missile allegedly capable of reaching the United States.North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S.
It won t happen!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017Yes, let s just antagonize a country that is run by a dictator just as egomaniacal as Trump.But it gets worse.Trump also antagonized China, an ally of North Korea and the largest economy on the planet with the largest population.China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won t help with North Korea.
Nice!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 2, 2017Keep in mind that this China bashing comes from a man who has his clothing line manufactured in China and a man who purchases steel for his buildings from Chinese companies instead of American companies.
So Trump is complicit in the very things he is accusing China of doing.Regardless, China is a nuclear power with a strong military, and they will not hesitate to use it if the United States goes after North Korea.
Such action could touch off a major war that would cause a horrifying number of casualties.And Trump s tweets are already terrifying Americans, many of whom took to Twitter to tell Trump to go cool off and keep his mouth shut because foreign relations should not be conducted on social media.
@realDonaldTrump Was this over dinner with Kim Jong-un?
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump your are hardly fit to deal with this kind of challenge.
Unstable.
Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump that s why most Americans don t trust you to handle a crisis.
We know you are emotionally disturbed, anxious, unwell.

@realDonaldTrump Sweetie, this is the perfect example of something you save for your Presidenting meetings, not glib little tweets.
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump I m sure your public call for allowing South Korea to acquire nukes played no role in this Ken Klippenstein (@kenklippenstein) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump You re just like him.

@realDonaldTrump This twitter diplomacy is real classy, you orange moron.
Ben Berkon (@BenBerkon) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump you have mere days until you re sworn in as President.
Do you really want to avoid it so badly that you ll kill us all now?
Alex Zalben (@azalben) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump seriously, I ask you father to father, as a person who wants a future for his children: STOP TAUNTING NUCLEAR SUPERPOWERS.
Alex Zalben (@azalben) January 2, 2017@JKendall4Trump @azalben @realDonaldTrump This is inviting them to launch nukes at us, literally.
StopTrumpPutin16 (@fluffymnuffy1) January 2, 2017@rolandscahill and this is how it ends by a chump making threats on twitter.
JustAGRL (@Clydearoo) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump I ve said it before, I ll say it again.
Don t start a nuclear war.

@realDonaldTrump your goods are made in China and India you hypocrite.
You don t care about the American working class.
Emanuel Zbeda (@therealezway) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump go to your intelligence briefing and stop tweeting!
Michael Skolnik (@MichaelSkolnik) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump you re trying so hard to tweet us into WWIII.
Nice!
Philip Lewis (@Phil_Lewis_) January 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump I m sure plaintive, bitchy, mean-girl tweets like this will solve the problem.
Krister Johnson (@KristerJohnson) January 2, 2017And just think Trump gets full control over the military and our nuclear arsenal in 17 days.
Seriously, Trump is far too dangerous to be president.Featured Image: Wikimedia/Flickr
