Desperation has set in and Planned parenthood is resorting to messy stunts that try and make anti-abortion groups look bad.
I just don t think these ghouls realize that no matter what they do, this is evil and wrong Planned Parenthood claims on several of its websites that the organization s web operations have been attacked by extremists, but this so-called hacking has all the hallmarks of an orchestrated public relations stunt.Numerous people on Twitter pointed to evidence suggesting that this so-called hack wasn t a hack at all:A review of the source code of the main page that appears at PlannedParenthood.org shows that as of 9:30 a.m. today, the page is listed as a Campaign and uses a specific template named Site Down Tempalte (the typo is theirs).
The same page then directs visitors to the Facebook page of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, the political fundraising arm of the nation s largest abortion provider.And that s where Planned Parenthood s hacking facade begins to crumble.
On the splash page declaring that the organization was hacked, visitors are asked Why do you stand with Planned Parenthood and invited to share their stories on a separate page.And wouldn t you know it, that page functions perfectly.What next Planned Parenthood, you gonna stage a fake bombing or arson at one of your abortion clinics as a fundraising hoax?
I m sure your pals at the SPLC could supply a list of likely suspects to frame.It s just a shame these ghouls can t cry racism or homophobia.
Hey, maybe they should expand their services to include sex change operations or race reassignments .
I bet Bruce Jenner and Rachel Dolezal would be onboard with that.Via: Blur Brain
