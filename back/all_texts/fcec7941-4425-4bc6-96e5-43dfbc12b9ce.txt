Trump s press secretary, Sean Spicer, has wasted no time in letting the media know that reporting anything making Trump look less-than totally awesome will not be tolerated.
He took to the White House press room earlier today to scold the press for daring to compare Trump s inaugural numbers to Obama s, when clearly, Trump s numbers were the biggest in history.Yes, he said that.
If you re laughing too hard to continue reading at the moment, believe us, we understand fully.
Transcribing Spicer s comments was unusually difficult for that very reason.It s just beyond absurd: This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration PERIOD, both in person and around the globe.
Even The New York Times printed a photograph showing a misrepresentation of the crowd in the original tweet in their paper, which showed the full extent of the support depth and crowd and inse that existed.
These attempts to lessen the enthusiasm of the inauguration are shameful and wrong.
What.
Just what?
The biggest audience to witness an inauguration ever?
Of course, Twitter beat him up for this:@seanspicer if your goal is to become a bigger liar than your boss the #Appresident, #chumptytrumpty, you re well on your way.

@POTUS @seanspicer https://t.co/P0cDsN4AEW Ithinkitscatchy (@Ithinkitscatchy) January 22, 2017@seanspicer how s it feel to be sowing fascist propaganda?
You re a fool, a chump, and in no way a patriot.
Shame on you.
@realDonaldTrump Lily Turner (@LTurner01) January 22, 2017 Sean Spicer said it was the largest inauguration turnout.
He meant inauguration protest turnout.
Chuck Nigash (@lightfallstudio) January 22, 2017@markberman @BadASSSery @seanspicer Spicer, you re a LIAR.
No integrity.
No morals.
No ethics.
Just a plain old liar in a bad suit.
Nikki (@nikkikl) January 22, 2017@seanspicer Day 1 & you just lost all credibility with Americans.
I along with other Americans watched the live feeds.
The world s watching I SEE STUPID PEOPLE (@ICSTUPIDPEOPLE_) January 22, 2017@FoxNews @seanspicer what an angry liar!

A Twitter search for Sean Spicer reveals thousands of excoriating tweets.But Spicer likely doesn t care.
He also said this in his speech: We know that from the platform, where the president was sworn in to 4th street, holds about 250,000 people.
From 4th Street to the media tent holds about 220,000, and the media tent to the Washington monument another 250,000 people.
Yeah, that s still not one million people, let alone 1.8 million, Mr. Spicer.
No wonder all of Twitter is on your back.
Not only do the photographs and screencaps from the live feed prove you a liar, but you thought you could turn your lies into truth by yelling at the press.
You, sir, are just as ridiculous as your boss.Watch him lie his ass off below, beginning at the 1:36:05 mark:Featured image by Alex Wong via Getty Images
