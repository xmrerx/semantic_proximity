The Berkeley, California anti-Trump protesters got a dose of reality today when pro-Trump patriots fought back.
Video after video posted on twitter shows the pro-Trump group fighting back against the Antifa Anarchists.
One video in particular shows a punk anarchist telling a veteran he s un-American Huh?
Since when is it unAmerican to serve your Country?
This punk immediately got an earful from the veteran.
It s beyond pitiful and sad that this kid wasn t taught about our heroes.
The kid is lucky someone didn t knock him out Disgusting!
ANTIFA kid calls U.S.
Veteran an "Anti-American".
