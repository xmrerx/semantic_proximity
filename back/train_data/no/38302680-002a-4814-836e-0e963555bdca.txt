politico has terminated its contract with magazine writer julia ioffe after she sent a tweet that referenced a possible incestuous relationship between president-elect donald trump and his daughter , ivanka.in a note to politico staff wednesday , editor-in-chief john harris and editor carrie budoff brown said ioffe violated guidelines against displaying gratuitous opinion on social media .
julia ioffe s tweet this afternoon about president-elect trump currently and understandably racing across social media is a clear example of the opposite of what we were talking about .
julia had previously announced she is taking her work to the atlantic .
we have accelerated the close of her politico contributor contract , effective immediately .
poynterearlier in the day , ioffe sent out this vile tweet : ioffe is by no means an objective journalist ( we re not even sure she s actually a journalist ) , but she does like to stir it up on twitter with provocative and controversial tweets , like this one mocking the skin color of trump s cabinet .
of course , she s making a lame attempt at trying to define trump as a racist : time to introduce the hashtag # administrationsowhite ?
