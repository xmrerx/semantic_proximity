New US Ambassador Nikki Haley strutted into the UN on Friday with a blunt message to American allies: For those who don t have our backs, we re taking names.
The former South Carolina governor made the remark to reporters as she arrived at the world body s headquarters in Manhattan to present her credentials to UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres.
Our goal with the administration is to show value at the UN and the way that we ll show value is to show our strength, show our voice, have the backs of our allies and make sure that our allies have our back as well, she said.
For those that don t have our back, we re taking names, we will make points to respond to that accordingly, President Trump s envoy said.She said Trump wants her to put fresh eyes on the UN.
Everything that s working, we re going to make it better, she said.
Everything that s not working we re going to try to fix, and anything that seems to be obsolete and not necessary we re going to do away with.
She then hopped on an elevator and went to the 38th floor to meet Guterres, who became UN chief on Jan. 1.
They then went into his office for a private sit-down.
There have been reports that the White House is poised to demand major cutbacks in UN agencies and personnel in slashing Washington s financial contributions to the organization.
