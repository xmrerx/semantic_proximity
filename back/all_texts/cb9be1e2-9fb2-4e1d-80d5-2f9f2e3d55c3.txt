Donald Trump woke up on Sunday morning and decided to play the victim and Twitter was NOT having any of it.On Saturday, the Republican nominee responded to the speech delivered by Khizr Khan, the father of an American soldier who sacrificed his life to save the lives of the soldiers under his command.Khan told the DNC Convention that Trump has never sacrificed anything for this country and doesn t know what sacrifice is, and Trump proved him right.During an interview with ABC, Trump claimed that he has sacrificed a lot by listing things that he has done like building crap with his name on it.
But sacrifice requires giving up something for the greater good, and that does not include building high-priced resorts only the wealthy can enjoy in order to enrich yourself.Almost instantly, a new hashtag was born as #TrumpSacrifices trended on Twitter.On Sunday morning, Trump whined that it is unfair to attack him because he has the right to respond to Khan s speech, which he characterized as a vicious attack and then threw in an attack on Hillary Clinton.I was viciously attacked by Mr. Khan at the Democratic Convention.
Am I not allowed to respond?
Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2016Of course, Twitter users once again mercilessly mocked Trump for pretending that he is the victim.

@realDonaldTrump his son died fighting for his country.
You took draft deferments to avoid Vietnam Justin Green (@JGreenDC) July 31, 2016.
@realDonaldTrump You were not viciously attacked.
You were asked questions.

Just walk away from this.
Paul Raymond Cook (@Cooksphere) July 31, 2016@realDonaldTrumpThe correct response is: There is no greater sacrifice than to give of your life.
They are welcome to their opinion.
Todd (@toddlemieux) July 31, 2016 @EnemyWithinn @realDonaldTrump slamming a veteran is disgusting.
Enough said.
DrewInDetroit (@bridgespeaks) July 31, 2016@realDonaldTrump Allowed to?
Sure.
Should you?
No.
Knowing when not to speak is an important skill for a president.

(@therealezway) July 31, 2016@realDonaldTrump He asked if you had ever read the constitution.
Couldn t you have just said yes or no ?
Thin-skinned describes you.
Quirkydude (@Quirkydude) July 31, 2016Again, Donald Trump lacks the temperament required to be president.
No other candidate in the history of this country has whined this much.
And the fact that Trump is incapable of letting things go and just moving on proves that the Republican Party made a grave mistake picking him as their nominee and the American people should make them pay the consequences by rejecting Trump by a landslide in November.Featured Image: Isaac Brekken/Getty Images
