Hillary Clinton shocked America a few days ago when she was forced to leave the 9/11 memorial in New York City early, only to have her campaign announce that the former Secretary of State had been diagnosed with pneumonia shortly after.While Dr. Bennet Omalu isn t a household name for many of us, Omalu is the well-respected forensic pathologist and neuropathologist that was responsible for discovering chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in dead NFL players.
This discovery made Omalu an inspiration for the NFL film Concussion where Omalu s character was played by actor Will Smith.With that being said, when a famous doctor gives his medical opinion, people are going to pay attention and when Omalu weighed in on Clinton s illness last Sunday, it definitely raised some eyebrows.
Omalu tweeted that he sensed there was a possibility that Clinton was being poisoned by none other than her political rival, Donald Trump, and his best friend Russian President Vladimir Putin.
He tweeted: I must advice the Clinton campaign to perform toxicologic analysis of Ms. Clinton s blood.
It is possible she is being poisoned.
TwitterA little less than an hour later, Omalu followed his statement up with a second tweet announcing just who he thought might be behind Clinton s illness.
He said: I do not trust Mr. Putin and Mr. Trump.
With those two all things are possible.
TwitterWhile it s been a common thought that Putin and Trump might be working together, the suggestion that they might be poisoning Clinton has certainly never been publicly stated before.
Twitter reacted to Omalu s thoughts with some skepticism, however Omalu s credentials and tenacity are well-known and people are interested in what he has to say.Interestingly enough, the man who has something to say about anything and everything has yet to respond to this accusation.
