After North Korea s most recent missile launch, the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong Un claimed he had finally realized the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force.
US Defense Secretary James Mattis claimed that North Korea now has the ability to hit everywhere in the world.
Meanwhile, the New York Times is blaming the Trump administration for starving the North Koreans, after placing stricter sanctions on the rogue nation.The left-leaning New York Times bizarrely claimed this week that the decades-long famine plaguing North Korea is not the fault of its brutal communist regime, but most likely due to American interference and foreign policy, saying the hunger is devastating.
And it s our fault.
The article, published over the weekend, lays the blame of millions of starved and tortured North Koreans at the feet of the American administration, saying the US and its allies have crippled Kim Jong Un s ability to feed his own people.
Led by the United States, the international community is crippling North Korea s economy, writes the author.
In August and September, the United Nations Security Council passed resolutions banning exports of coal, iron, lead, seafood and textiles and limiting the import of crude oil and refined petroleum products.
The United States, Japan and South Korea have each imposed bilateral sanctions on Pyongyang to further isolate the country.
We are trying to inflict pain on the North Korean regime to stop the development of nuclear weapons and missiles.
That s understandable.
But in the process, we are also punishing the most vulnerable citizens and shackling the ability of humanitarian agencies to deliver aid to them, the author adds.North Korea s massive food shortages date back to the 1990s when dictator Kim Jong Il s regime was incapable of handling droughts and other natural disasters that cut dwindling food supplies by over 30%.
