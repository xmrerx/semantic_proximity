This rock legend is not very impressed with the pop stars today.
We happen to agree with her 100%She provoked fierce debate by saying it was her own fault for being sexually assaulted at 21.And now Chrissie Hynde has waded into another contentious area the overly sexualised nature of modern pop music.In an obvious reference to scantily-clad stars such as Miley Cyrus and Rihanna, the former Pretenders lead singer branded them sex workers for selling music by bumping and grinding in their underwear.
The 64-year-old also accused them of doing a great deal of damage to women with their risque performances.
This is what today s female pop entertainers consider performing for a live audience:***WARNING**** Graphic video****Not suitable for all ageshttps://youtu.be/M2n2iiruVLoMiss Hynde launched the scathing attack during a tense interview on BBC s Woman s Hour yesterday.
She suggested that today s provocatively-dressed stars are sending the wrong message about how people should view sex.Miss Hynde added: I don t think sexual assault is a gender issue as such, I think it s very much it s all around us now.
It s provoked by this pornography culture, it s provoked by pop stars who call themselves feminists.
Maybe they re feminists on behalf of prostitutes but they are no feminists on behalf of music, if they are selling their music by bumping and grinding and wearing their underwear in videos.
***WARNING*** What you are about to see can t be unseen!
That s a kind of feminism but, you know, you re a sex worker is what you are.Via: UK Daily Mail
