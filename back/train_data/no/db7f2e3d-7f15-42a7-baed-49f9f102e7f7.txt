edinburgh ( reuters ) - u.s. basketball legend dennis rodman said on wednesday he had skied and sung karaoke with his friend north korea s leader kim jong un and would like to straighten things out amid a nuclear standoff with the united states .
rodman has paid several visits to kim in the isolated state but the two rarely discuss politics , the retired national basketball association star told british tv show good morning britain .
north korea has carried out a series of nuclear and missile tests and u.s. president donald trump has responded with warnings of a massive military response .
for me to go over there and see ( kim ) as much as i have , i basically hang out with him all the time .
we laugh , we sing karaoke , we do a lot of cool things together .
we ride horses , we hang out , we go skiing , we hardly ever talk politics and that s the good thing , rodman said , according to a transcript .
the basketball ace expressed admiration for trump but said the u.s. president could be a little bit crazy sometimes .
rodman last visited north korea in june and earlier trips stoked talk that he could facilitate a breakthrough between pyongyang and washington , although his comments on kim have also drawn ridicule .
north korea has long ignored warnings from the west and from its lone major ally , china , to halt its nuclear and missile tests which it conducts in defiance of u.n. security council resolutions .
rodman said he was not trying to defend the actions of kim and was just an ambassador for sports .
he said the relationship between the u.s. and russia had changed but for some reason we have a big issue with north korea .
i don t love ( kim ) .
i just want to try to straighten things out for everyone to get along together .
rodman , nicknamed the worm during his playing career and known for his flamboyant character , is considered one of the best defensive players and rebounders in nba history .
