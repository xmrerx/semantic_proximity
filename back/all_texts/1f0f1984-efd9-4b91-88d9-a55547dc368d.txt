A new Donald Trump commercial hits Hillary Clinton on her immigration policy BUT can you guess whose voice it is?
In Hillary Clinton s America, the system stays rigged against Americans, begins the voice over in the ad, which is called, Two Americas: Immigration.
The actor narrating Trump s ad has a very recognizable voice!
Did you guess Bruce McGill?
His name may not be too familiar, but McGill s face certainly will be.
