oh no !
florida killed a counter-terrorism bill right before the orlando attack.florida lawmakers rejected a key piece of counterterrorism legislation earlier this year , prompting outrage from some defense experts who told the washington free beacon that the victims of sunday s mass terror attack in orlando could have used the measure to hold those who plotted the assault accountable.on the heels of sunday s shooting , in which an attacker who pledged allegiance to the isis terror group killed 49 bystanders , marking the deadliest terror attack on u.s. soil since 9/11 , some are criticizing florida s legislature for rejecting a counter-terrorism bill that would have paved the way for victims of these crimes to sue the organizers and sponsors in state court.the legislation , known as andy s law , has already passed in at least five states but was rejected earlier this year by florida s legislature despite gaining bipartisan support from state lawmakers.florida republican house speaker steve crisafulli killed the counter-terror the bill by preventing it from coming to a full vote in the state house.the legislation could have empowered victims of sunday s attack to seek unprecedented recourse in state court by allowing them to file suit against the attackers and anyone identified as supporting the plot .
any suit would have fallen under statutes governed by state rico laws.the law would have boosted criminal penalties for terrorism and the support of terrorism .
it also provides state-level legal recourse for terror victims who have experienced trouble pursuing their cases on a federal level.while the florida version of andy s law overwhelmingly passed out of several committees in the state legislature , it failed to see final passage .
unfortunately , because andy s law failed to pass in the florida house of representatives , victims of the orlando jihadist massacre , as well as their surviving family members , have been denied a powerful tool for seeking retribution against those individuals and organizations who may have supported or inspired omar mateen , the alleged perpetrator of sunday s attack , said christopher holton , vice president for outreach at the center for security policy.sunday s attack is just the latest terror assault to take place in the sunshine state.read more : wfb
