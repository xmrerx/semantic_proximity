so who does canada believe is the actual victim is here ? have you seen the cover of the new maclean s magazine ?
that s rinelle harper sitting down she s the aboriginal woman who was attacked and left for dead in winnipeg.she became a symbol for racist violence against aboriginal women though her alleged attacker was himself aboriginal.that girl on the right is amanda lindhout .
she was a waitress who decided she wanted to be a war reporter in afghanistan , iraq and somalia ; she was kidnapped by muslim terrorists and tortured and raped repeatedly.so you ve got two innocent women who were brutalized by violence and would never hurt a fly.and then you ve got omar khadr standing behind them , with a huge grin on his face.omar khadr is a confessed , convicted al qaida terrorist .
he plead guilty to five charges of war crimes .
he murdered sgt .
christopher speer , leaving tabitha speer a widow , and their two children , taryn and tanner , fatherless.omar khadr has never renounced al qaida or said that he regrets what he did.here s how maclean s describes him , though : omar khadr was imprisoned in guantanamo , captured in 2002 by american forces in afghanistan and charged with war crimes .
so , no mention of the murder he confessed to or his conviction for war crimes.would maclean s magazine put a smiling , chatty paul bernardo on their cover , and say , he s suffered so deeply in prison all because he was charged with crimes .
both are pathological murderers .
why the celebrity treatment ? this isn t journalism.this is propaganda.via : the rebelh/t weasel zippers
