paris ( reuters ) - france will not recognize catalonia if the spanish region unilaterally declares independence , european affairs minister nathalie loiseau said on monday .
if there were to be a declaration of independence , it would be unilateral , and it would not be recognized , loiseau said on cnews television .
catalonia , which has its own language and culture and is led by a pro-independence regional government , held a referendum on oct. 1 over secession in defiance of spain s constitutional court , which had declared the vote illegal .
catalonia can not be defined by the vote organized by the independence movement just over a week ago , the french junior minister said .
this crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of spanish politics .
a hasty decision to recognize independence following such a unilateral declaration would amount to fleeing france s responsibilities , loiseau added .
if independence were to be recognized - which is not something that s being discussed - the most immediate consequence would be that ( catalonia ) automatically left the european union .
