now , states if they wish will be able to withold title x money from abortion-committing organizations , instead prioritizing non-abortion businesses.federal title x dollars fund family planning services , but technically not abortion .
however , government money planned parenthood receives helps the abortion-centered organization overall .
this money is fungible , pro-life advocates say.remember obama was the most pro-abortion president ever !

the u.s. senate voted 50-50 on it on march 13 .
vice president mike pence broke the tie , sending the bill to trump s desk.rep .
diane black , r-tn , penny nance of concerned women for america , and marjorie dannenfelser of the susan b. anthony list were at the white house bill signing .
this week the pro-life movement had two huge victories : first , the swearing-in of justice gorsuch and now , president trump will undo former president obama s parting gift to the abortion industry , said dannenfelser .
