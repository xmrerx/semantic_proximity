GAZA (Reuters) - The United States cannot broker the Israeli-Palestinian peace process, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said on Friday, in response to President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital.
We reject the American decision over Jerusalem.
With this position the United States has become no longer qualified to sponsor the peace process, Abbas said in a statement.
He did not elaborate further.
