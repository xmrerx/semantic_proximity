the clinton foundation has confirmed it accepted a $ 1 million gift from qatar while hillary clinton was u.s. secretary of state without informing the state department , even though she had promised to let the agency review new or significantly increased support from foreign governments.qatari officials pledged the money in 2011 to mark the 65th birthday of bill clinton , hillary clinton s husband , and sought to meet the former u.s. president in person the following year to present him the check , according to an email from a foundation official to hillary clinton s presidential campaign chairman , john podesta .
the email , among thousands hacked from podesta s account , was published last month by wikileaks.clinton signed an ethics agreement governing her family s globe-straddling foundation in order to become secretary of state in 2009 .
the agreement was designed to increase transparency to avoid appearances that u.s. foreign policy could be swayed by wealthy donors.if a new foreign government wished to donate or if an existing foreign-government donor , such as qatar , wanted to increase materially its support of ongoing programs , clinton promised that the state department s ethics official would be notified and given a chance to raise any concerns.clinton foundation officials last month declined to confirm the qatar donation.read more : breitbart
