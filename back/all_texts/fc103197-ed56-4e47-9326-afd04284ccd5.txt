If anyone were to tell you 20 years ago that a career criminal, habitual liar and an enabler of husband who is a serial sexual offender was going to be a frontrunner for President of The United States in two decades simply because of her genitalia, would you have believed them?While the State Department s own internal probe found former Secretary Hillary Clinton violated federal recordkeeping laws, it s not the first time she and her top aides shielded her e-mail from public disclosure while serving in a government position.As first lady, Hillary was embroiled in another scheme to bury sensitive White House e-mails, known internally as Project X.
In 1999, as investigators looked into Whitewater, Travelgate, Filegate and other scandals involving the then-first lady, it was discovered that more than 1 million subpoenaed e-mails were mysteriously lost due to a glitch in a West Wing computer server.The massive hole in White House archives covered a critical two-year period 1996 to 1998 when Republicans and special prosecutor Ken Starr were subpoenaing White House e-mails.Despite separate congressional investigations and a federal lawsuit over Project X, high-level e-mails dealing with several scandals were never turned over.
And the full scope of Bill and Hillary Clintons culpability in the parade of scandals was never known.To those well-versed in Clinton shenanigans, this all sounds distressingly familiar.
Thanks to another server-related problem, Clinton so far has gotten away with withholding more than 30,000 e-mails from congressional committees investigating the Benghazi terrorism cover-up, Clinton Foundation foreign-influence peddling and other scandals.
This Clinton e-mail scandal is nothing new, Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton told me.
There were previous efforts to hide e-mails in the Clinton White House.
His Washington watchdog group filed a lawsuit to recover the missing White House e-mails back then, just as it has against the State Department now, though it has had better luck in this case.The parallels don t end there.During the Project X e-mail scandal, career White House staffers and contractors found that someone close to the first lady had basically turned off the White House s automated e-mail-archiving system.
They fingered White House special assistant Laura Crabtree Callahan, who was overseeing the computer contractors despite obtaining computer-science degrees from diploma mills.Read more: NYP
