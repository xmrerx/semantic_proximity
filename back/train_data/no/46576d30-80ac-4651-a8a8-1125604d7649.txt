harare ( reuters ) - lawmakers from zimbabwe s main opposition party mdc will hold a meeting on tuesday to decide whether to join their ruling party rivals to impeach 93-year-old president robert mugabe , the minority chief whip said .
although mugabe s zanu-pf has the required two-thirds membership to remove mugabe , participation by the opposition could give a boost to a process that was started by the military s intervention last week .
