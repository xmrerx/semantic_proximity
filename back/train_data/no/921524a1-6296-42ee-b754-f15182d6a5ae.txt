green party candidate jill stein successfully requested , and paid for , the wisconsin recount while her attempts for similar statewide recounts in pennsylvania and michigan were blocked by the courts .
stein only got about 1 percent of the vote in each of the states that trump narrowly won on his way to the white house .
she argued , without evidence , that voting machines in all three states were susceptible to hacking.a green party representative said the voting wasn t fair but failed to say exactly why could it be that it wasn t fair because jill stein didn t win ?
it s laughable and pitiful that these people have been able to hijack the election results .
