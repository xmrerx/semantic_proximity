Bernie Sanders finally endorsed Hillary Clinton on Tuesday with a rousing speech to unite the party, and Donald Trump exploded in rage on Twitter.In a series of Twitter-tantrums, Trump attacked Sanders by claiming that he is selling out by getting behind the Democratic nominee.
It took six posts before he tired himself out.Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton.
He will endorse her today fans angry!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2016 I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters.
They are not happy that he is selling out!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2016#CrookedHillary is not qualified!https://t.co/6qi7KTW43O Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2016 Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2016Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2016 To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms.
People first.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 12, 2016Of course, Trump had been hoping that Bernie would stay in the race because he wanted to see chaos at the Democratic National Convention, which would only help him.
Now he s trying to persuade Sanders supporters to join his campaign.Well, Bernie Sanders only needed a single tweet to shut Trump down.Big talk from the same guy who was too afraid to debate Bernie in California.
https://t.co/LVCjo0PKrN Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) July 12, 2016Indeed, Trump had agreed to debate Bernie but chickened out on two separate occasions after the Vermont Senator eagerly accepted Trump s condition that money be raised for charity to make the debate happen.But just because Bernie endorsed Hillary that does t mean he sold out.
Hillary Clinton captured the most states and the most delegates.
She won, but Bernie still is having a major impact on the party.
He pulled Hillary further to the left and has gotten several of his policy goals written into the Democratic platform such as a $15 minimum wage.That s a huge victory that should make Sanders supporters very pleased.
Jumping to Trump s campaign just because Sanders isn t the nominee is ridiculous because if Trump wins this country will only go backwards and all the progress Sanders has fought for will have zero chance of happening.
At least with Hillary we could expect to see some of his proposals become reality, especially if Democrats retake the House and Senate.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images
