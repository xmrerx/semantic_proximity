WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. House Freedom Caucus said his group of conservative Republican lawmakers remained opposed to Republican leaders’ proposed bill to rollback Obamacare, raising doubts about the legislation’s future ahead of a planned Thursday vote.
“The opposition is still strong.
They don’t have the votes to pass this tomorrow.
We believe that they need to start over,” Representative Mark Meadows told reporters after a meeting of his group following earlier talks at the White House.
