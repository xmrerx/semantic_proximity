While it seems like Donald Trump hasn t worked a single full day since he stepped foot in the White House, the former reality television star apparently feels differently.Currently, Trump is busy enjoying his 17-day vacation, despite the fact that he s already spent approximately 20% of his presidency on the golf course, and much more time glued to cable news and his Twitter account.
If there s any POTUS that doesn t deserve to take time off, it s certainly #45.Trump has gotten a lot of backlash over taking time off, especially considering how much Trump criticized former president Barack Obama for taking a little bit of time off.
It s quite hilarious, because Obama worked his a** off for America.
Trump hasn t done a damn thing besides create chaos and humiliate the country, and he s already taken three times as much time off than Obama!
Here s a quick refresher of how Trump has trashed Obama over the years: Now that Trump is being outed for being the laziest POTUS we ve ever had, it s no wonder he threw an absolute FIT today in response to the criticism.
This evening, Trump took a break from his golf outing at New Jersey s Bedminster Golf Resort to whine about how he s working hard and NOT on vacation, despite the fact that this is totally a vacation.Seriously pathetic.
Trump even left work early to begin his golfing holiday today.
The hypocrisy that follows everything Trump does is just mind-blowing.
He truly lives in his own world, far removed from reality and any sort of logical thought.Trump does not deserve to be taking a holiday right now.
He is ignoring America s pressing issues and the American people while creating disturbance everywhere he goes.
Deep down, he knows he doesn t deserve it or else he wouldn t be so damn defensive.Featured image via Ian MacNicol / Getty Images
