this picture is representative of the violence americans witnessed last year after former president obama made it clear ( through his silence ) to americans and to illegal aliens that it was acceptable to violently attack american citizens who held an opposing political view : this picture represents a post-obama america , when american citizens who support our current law-and-order president have had enough , and are fighting back against violent basement dwellers and paid soros activists .
is there really anything better than watching an antifa thug running from a trump supporter wielding an american flag ?
here s the video of what happened after the antifa thugs after attempting to harm pro-trump supporters at a rally in huntington beach , ca : violence erupting at trump rally when pro and anti trump protestors collide .
