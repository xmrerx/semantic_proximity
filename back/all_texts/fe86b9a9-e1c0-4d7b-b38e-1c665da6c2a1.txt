Hillary Clinton has had it with Donald Trump s rude, offensive supporters and the numerous intimidation tactics they try to use against her and the rest of the country.On Tuesday night, Clinton was holding a rally at Reverend Samuel Delevoe Memorial Park in Fort Lauderdale when a Trump supporter shouted, Bill Clinton is a rapist!
over and over, disrupting her speech.
As Clinton s supporters tried to drown out the Trump lover by shouting Clinton s name, the Democratic nominee reacted and went off on the protester, delivering the perfect rant while pointing right at the man.
She said: You know, I am sick and tired of the negative, dark, divisive, dangerous vision and behavior from people who support Donald Trump.
It is time for us to say no, we are not going backwards, we re going forward into a brighter future.
The protester, who was completely unharmed during this entire incident, was taken out of the rally by security.
But before he left, Clinton left the Trump supporter (and anyone else like him) with this parting wisdom: You may be angry about something, but anger is not a plan.
Don t be used.
Don t be exploited.
You can watch Clinton unload on the Trump supporter below:The protester in the video was likely causing issues at Clinton s event not because he actually believes that her husband, former President Bill Clinton, is a rapist but because the website InfoWars has offered to pay anyone shouting Bill Clinton is a rapist at a Clinton rally a hefty reward of $5,000.
Yes, these are the desperate tactics conservatives are using to try to bring Clinton down as she crushed Trump in the polls.
It s unfortunate and nearly pointless for them it s costing them tons of money to continue smearing her name, and none of it is working.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images
