Democratic and Republican presidential candidates have traditionally gone to New York City s Al Smith Dinner to help raise money for charity and to exchange sharp-tongued roast type jokes.
But when the event kicked off on Thursday night, Donald Trump decided to head right for the gutter.Instead of light-hearted humor, Trump returned to the well-worn accusations he has peddled for months on the campaign trail.
And demonstrating his inability to calmly make jokes or be on the receiving end of them was in full display with Trump yet again.He appeared to straddle the line when he talked about how listening to Hillary rattle on and rattle on has made him better appreciate his former nemesis Rosie O Donnell.
But he then seemed to cross it when he referred to her as corrupt during a lengthy riff on the FBI s investigation into her use of a private email server as secretary of state.
Hillary is so corrupt she got kicked off the Watergate Commission.
How corrupt do you have to be to get kicked off the Watergate Commission?
Pretty corrupt, he said to loud boos and at least one call demanding he get off the stage.Trump is the ultimate bubble candidate.
He knows how to throw red meat out to his audience of rabid deplorables , but as the campaign shows so far, he is unable to translate that into mainstream election results.Trump turned a traditionally lighthearted charity event into yet another venue for his bile to go on display and made the watchers both in-house and watching on TV to shudder.
There is just about twenty days left of the Trump campaign and they seem dead-set on losing support in any way possible.
Insulting every single American comes from a place of special hatred towards the audience, and it seems this is the way Trump has chosen to go out.Featured image via screen capture
