Wouldn t it have been great to see Mitt fight as hard to reveal the TRUTH about Barack Hussein Obama, aka Barry Soetoro in 2012, as he is trying to find some bombshell revelation about Trump?Sorry Mitt, but you forfeited your opportunity to save America when you cowered to political correctness.
Cue the Trump Train Wednesday in a Facebook post, 2012 Republican presidential nominee and vocal Donald Trump critic Mitt Romney said, It is disqualifying for a modern day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters.
Romney added, There is only one logical explanation for Mr. Trump s refusal to release his returns: there is a bombshell in them.
Given Mr. Trump s equanimity with other flaws in his history, we can only assume it s a bombshell of unusual size.
In an interview on Tuesday with The Associated Press, Trump said, There s nothing to learn from them.
On Wednesday, Trump clarified by tweeting:In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election!
