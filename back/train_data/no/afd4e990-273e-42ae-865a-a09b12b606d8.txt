moscow ( reuters ) - russia said it will retaliate tit-for-tat over a new canadian law that will impose sanctions on officials from russia and other nations considered guilty of human rights violations .
the bill , expected to be approved by canada s parliament later on wednesday , was inspired by the case of sergei magnitsky , an anti-corruption lawyer who died in 2009 after a year in a russian jail .
russian foreign ministry spokeswoman maria zakharova was quoted by the interfax news agency as saying on wednesday that any anti-russian actions by the canadian authorities will not be left without an adequate response .
canada already has cool ties with russia .
it has repeatedly condemned moscow over russia s 2014 annexation of crimea and has imposed sanctions against russia along with other western nations .
we warn again that in case the pressure of the sanctions put on us increases ... we will widen likewise the list of canadian officials banned from entering russia , zakharova said , according to interfax .
to a large extent , it ( the bill ) simply copies the odious american magnitsky act and is set to further undermine russian-canadian relations .
the united states adopted a law in 2012 freezing any u.s. assets of russian investigators and prosecutors said to have been involved in the detention of magnitsky .
in retaliation , moscow barred americans from adopting russian children .
the canadian parliament s lower house approved adoption of the law on victims of corrupt foreign governments on monday and submitted the bill to the senate for approval .
the law , which was proposed by an opposition legislator and is backed by the government , will come into force once it is signed by canada s governor-general .
the russian embassy in canada , in a statement posted on its twitter page , blamed the magnitsky bill on failed policies , pressed by russophobic elements .
