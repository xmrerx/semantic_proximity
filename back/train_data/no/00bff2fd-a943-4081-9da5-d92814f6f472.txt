dakar ( reuters ) - christian militiamen killed a mauritanian u.n. peacekeeper in an attack on a camp for displaced people in a central african republic diamond-mining town on monday , the united nations mission there said .
fighters armed with ak-47s and makeshift weapons also wounded one zambian and two mauritanian peacekeepers during the 90-minute gunfight at the police checkpoint in the town of bria , the u.n. added .
the country has been riven by sectarian conflict since 2013 when muslim seleka rebels ousted president francois bozize .
that triggered a backlash by christian anti-balaka fighters .
as many as 100 people died in bria in june during a day of clashes between rival factions .
the area is coveted by militia for its surrounding diamond mines .
it also hosts tens of thousands of people displaced by the conflict .
even with 13,000 troops , the u.n. mission has struggled to restore order to a country the size of france and has lost 14 peacekeepers in attacks this year alone .
