montevideo ( reuters ) - lucia topolansky , a uruguay senator and wife of former president jose mujica , became vice president on wednesday following the resignation of raul sendic last weekend over concerns of misuse of public funds .
topolansky , 72 , who is the first woman to serve as uruguay s vice president , was named vice president under provisions of uruguay s constitution .
she said she would aim to liaise between leftist president tabare vazquez s administration and congress .
like mujica , topolansky was a member of the tupamaros marxist guerrilla movement in her youth .
the change was expected to have little impact on policy .
since 2005 , uruguay has been ruled by the left-wing frente amplio ( fa ) party , which has mixed progressive social policy , such as legalizing marijuana , with market-friendly regulations .
the fa s ethics committee had ruled that sendic , who headed state oil company ancap from 2008 to 2009 and from 2010 to 2013 , used his company credit card to buy personal items .
uruguay s constitution says sendic should be replaced by the senator who received the most votes in the last elections , who was mujica .
but uruguayan law bans presidents from serving a consecutive term as president or vice president .
as the senator with the second-biggest number of votes , topolansky was next in line .
