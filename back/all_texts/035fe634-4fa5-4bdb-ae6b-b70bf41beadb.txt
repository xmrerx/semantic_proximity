Donald Trump must be feeling pretty damn humiliated right about now.It s one thing to call out the media for getting something wrong, but it s another when you are accusing them of misquoting you simply because you didn t bother to read an article all the way through.On Thursday, Trump frightened the world by declaring his intention to expand America s already over-bloated nuclear weapons capabilities.The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016Apparently, Trump is so narcissistic that he reads about himself when something he says makes the news.
But as he was reading an article written for NBC about his remarks, Trump became enraged because NBC allegedly only printed part of the quote.
And, of course, he whined about it on Twitter..@NBCNews purposely left out this part of my nuclear qoute: until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.
Dishonest!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 24, 2016Except that NBC didn t misquote Trump at all.
In fact, it turns out Trump misread the article, assuming he read it at all.
Had he read the third paragraph slowly, he would have found his full quote.In other words, NBC was being the opposite of dishonest while Trump lied.
And he was apparently so outraged that his misspelled the word quote.
This is the danger of Trump.
He just got busted smearing the media for something that didn t happen.
He lied about NBC and sullied their reputation on purpose, which frankly should result in a defamation lawsuit against Trump.But Twitter quickly stomped him for it.
@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews Spell check, my man.
Spell check.

Bess Kalb (@bessbell) December 24, 2016@DustinGiebel How the fuck does a person misspell on Twitter with a built in spellchecker?
I guess if they are enraged It could happen.
