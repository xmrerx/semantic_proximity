WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that the United States will take care of the North Korea issue after its latest missile launch, and that the basic U.S. approach to dealing with Pyongyang will not change.
Trump has tightened sanctions on North Korea and pressured China to do more to help rein in Pyongyang s ballistic missile and nuclear ambitions.
North Korea fired what the U.S. Pentagon said appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that landed close to Japan on Wednesday.
Trump said the missile launch did not change what he called the very serious U.S. approach, a week after he put North Korea back on a U.S. list of countries that Washington says support terrorism.
I will only tell you that we will take care of it...
It is a situation that we will handle, Trump told reporters during a meeting with Republican congressional leaders at the White House.
U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis, who was also at the meeting, said the ICBM launch was a higher trajectory than any test conducted thus far by North Korea and called it part of a research and development effort.
It went higher frankly than any previous shots they have taken, Mattis said.
He said South Korea retaliated by firing some pinpoint missiles into the water to show North Korea that the U.S. ally would not be rattled by Pyongyang s launch.
North Korea has said its weapons program is a necessary defense against U.S. plans to invade.
The United States, which has 28,500 troops in South Korea as a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean war, denies any such intention.
