benghazi , libya ( reuters ) - four foreign engineers working for the turkish construction firm enka were kidnapped in southwest libya on friday , a libyan state electricity official said .
the men , who were turkish and south african , were seized while traveling from the airport in the town of ubari to a power plant they were helping to build , the official said , asking not to be named .
there was no immediate indication who had abducted them .
in a statement on its website , enka referred to three turkish citizens being kidnapped .
around midday today in libya three of our citizens , two of them our personnel who were temporarily working in the country , were kidnapped by unidentified people while they were traveling outside the building site , the statement said .
our company is following the subject closely , in contact with turkish and libyan authorities , it added .
