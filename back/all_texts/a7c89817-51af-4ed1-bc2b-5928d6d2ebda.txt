Trump hates the media with a passion.
He often rails on Twitter, and at his rallies, about the dishonest media, and the dishonest coverage they give him.
He complains that he s been treated very unfairly by any media outlet that doesn t immediately shove its head up his ass, and he bans outlets he deems to be too dishonest and unfair to have the privilege of covering him.Not once has he ever actually laid out what is fair.
But, thanks to his former campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, we now have a definition for fair reporting.
But watch out, it s pretty ridiculous: What fairly means is you don t editorialize, you report what he says, that s fair.
If you look at the story that he did in The New York Times on foreign policy, it was literally the transcript of what he said it wasn t editorialized at all.
That s fair reporting.
That was in response to Don Lemon saying that Trump is bashing CNN for repeating what he says and fact-checking it.
So, basically, fair is no fact-checking, no discussion, just his words.
Nothing else.All that does is give Trump a license to say what he wants, because then he knows the media won t call him on it.
Of course, that s exactly what he wants to have happen.
He wants everyone to believe him, to trust him implicitly, even though he s lying through his teeth.
A huge part of his hatred toward the media is their penchant for fact-checking him, and proving him false.This is the most laughable definition of fair reporting imaginable.Watch a video of this below, beginning at about the 3:20 mark:Just now on @CNNTonight: some frank talk about Trump & the media with @CLewandowski_ & @DonLemonhttps://t.co/OJk77DpOvl Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) August 17, 2016Featured image by Jeff Swensen/Getty Images
