new york ( reuters ) - democrat hillary clinton ’ s lead over republican rival donald trump has slipped by about five percentage points since mid-june , according to a reuters/ipsos poll released on tuesday , bringing the race for the white house to within nine points .
the poll showed that 44.5 percent of likely voters supported former secretary of state clinton while 35.5 percent backed businessman trump .
that compares with 46.6 percent support for clinton and 32.3 percent for trump on june 12 , a date that marked her widest lead for the month .
trump has focused much of his energy in recent days on the mass shooting in orlando , florida by a u.s.-born gunman pledging allegiance to islamic state militant group .
trump vowed to ban people from entering the united states from countries with links to terrorism against america or its allies .
hardline national security proposals have help trump win increased support from voters in the past , including after the shootings in san bernardino , california and paris late last year .
clinton responded to the orlando attack by calling for increased intelligence gathering and air strikes on islamic state forces , while warning against demonizing american muslims .
she has also criticized trump ’ s positions on foreign policy and the economy , saying a trump presidency would be a “ disaster ” .
the june 17-21 poll of 1,100 likely voters has a credibility interval , a measure of accuracy , of 3.4 percentage points .
