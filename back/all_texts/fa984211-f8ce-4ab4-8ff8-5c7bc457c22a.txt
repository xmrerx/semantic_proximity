During an interview with New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump referred to Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren as Pocahontas.
In the piece published on Saturday, Dowd says that she asked Trump if Trump had received any negative comments from Republicans about him and Sen. Elizabeth Warren s Twitter feud.
Trump responded to the question with a question, saying, Who, Pocahontas?
The jab is a part of a conservative conspiracy theory that alleges that Warren does not actually have the Native American heritage she claims she does.
Apparently conservatives are not capable of understanding that a person can have a mixed racial and ethnic background.
Which shouldn t be surprising considering Tea Party types aren t capable of understanding that a man named Barack Hussein Obama,isn t automatically a Muslim terrorist sleeper agent sent here to destroy the United States from the inside.Once again, Trump has denigrated a person based on racial lines.
When pressed on any issue Trump falls back to posturing as a bully.
He ll take any ridiculous notion and just run with it because he knows that his followers will simply laugh it up.However, even the Republican candidate who seems impervious to gaffes and criticism should reconsider accusing someone of inventing an identity after recent reports of Trump s bizarre John Miller scandal.
The Washington Post s Marc Fisher uncovered audio recordings that show that Trump invented a fictional spokesman for himself named John Miller back in the 1970 s, 80 s and 90 s. During that period, Trump would pretend to be Miller or on occasion John Barron - and call reporters where Miller would say wonderful things about Trump, in an attempt to inflate Trump s personal brand.Trump has denied the allegations, though the Post reports that there is courtroom testimony where Trump himself had admitted to creating the fictional personality.Featured image (Photo by David Becker/Getty Images)
