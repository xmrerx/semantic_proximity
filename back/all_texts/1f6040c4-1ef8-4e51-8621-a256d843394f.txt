Donald Trump thanked his poorly educated supporters for helping him win Nevada earlier this week, thus opening himself up to the mocking he received from Jimmy Kimmel on Wednesday night.Trump proudly declared during his victory speech after capturing the Nevada caucus: We won with poorly educated!
I love the poorly educated!
Trump destroyed his GOP rivals by a landslide, taking just another step closer toward becoming the Republican nominee.But Jimmy Kimmel saw an opportunity to not only mock Trump, but to accurately depict his supporters at the same time.And that s why he presented a hilarious campaign ad by Poorly-Educated Americans for Trump.After playing a clip of Trump declaring his love of the poorly educated, Kimmel quipped, They feel the same way about you.
In fact, they love Trump so much that they made this ad just for him, Kimmel continued.The ad began with Trump riding an escalator down to the podium to give his announcement that he is running for president.
And as he does so, the narrator says, In dangerous times, Americans need a leader But on the screen the word is misspelled as LEEDER, reminiscent of the misspelled signs that Tea Party supporters have carried during rallies.The ad goes on to misspell other words as well, including terists.
The ad then states that we need a president who will lock down the border to keep immigrants from coming from Mexico, which the poorly educated think is located where Canada is on the map.In addition, the ad praises Trump for standing up to Lil Kim, in North Korea, Voldemort Putin in Russia, and President XI (pronounced eleven in the ad) in China while honoring the principles outlined in the US Constipation and the second commandment in which God says Thou shalt have guns.
The video concludes by identifying who paid for the ad, a Tea Party supporter with a sign that says, Get a brain MORANS!
Here s the video via YouTube.Once again, Jimmy Kimmel finds the perfect way to mock a Republican candidate.
Clearly they are making it just too easy for him.Featured image via video screen capture
