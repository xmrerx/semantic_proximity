the 2014 irs filings for the clinton foundation have been released and the numbers are absolutely sickening .
out of $ 91.3 million spent in 2014 , the organization s irs filings show that only $ 5.2 million of that went to actual charity.see the documents here : viewit all gets very ugly when you see the numbers broken down. > $ 34.8 million the foundation spent on salaries , compensation and employee benefits. > $ 50.4 million recorded as other expenses > $ 851k was marked as professional fundraising expenses .
despite an additional $ 30 million in 2014 , the clinton foundation spent 40 % less on charitable grants in 2014 than in 2013 .
even as it slashed charitable spending , the foundation increased the amount spent on salaries , employee benefits and compensation by $ 5 million in 2014 .
the foundation also spent $ 5 million more other expenses in 2014.it is worth noting that sean davis at the federalist stated , the bulk of the charitable work lauded by the clinton foundation s boosters the distribution of drugs to impoverished people in developing countries is no longer even performed by the clinton foundation .
those activities were spun off in 2010 and are now managed by the clinton health access initiative , a completely separate non-profit organization .
it is absolutely abhorrent that while she claims to do so much for charity one day , then turns around and lauds her wealth over the heads of hard working americans the next she is continuously stashing donated funds for her own personal purposes.we all know that politicians aren t going to be honest but this is a crime , literally , and yet it is just another day in the lives of the clintons.check out this haiti citizens interview about the clintons : h/t [ wz ]
