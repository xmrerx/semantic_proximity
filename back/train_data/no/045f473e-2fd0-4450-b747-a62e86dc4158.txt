copenhagen ( reuters ) - the populist danish people s party ( df ) , upon whose support the minority government depends to pass laws , gave its backing on friday to a fiscal budget for 2018 but one of the coalition parties said it still wanted an agreement on tax cuts .
the liberal alliance ( la ) , a junior partner in the three-way coalition led by prime minister lokke rasmussen s liberals and also including the conservative party said it would not support the budget in parliament unless a deal to cut taxes was agreed .
but df , which is not a member of the coalition , said it could not guarantee that a deal involving historically big tax cuts could be reached .
if la does not vote to give the budget final approval , rasmussen could be forced either to hand power to the social democrat-led opposition or to call a snap election .
we don t know how this will all end , df s negotiator ren christensen told reporters .
otherwise we would have had three deals now , he said , referring to another proposal by df that would tighten rules on granting residency to refugees .
economy minister simon emil ammitzboll-bille , a la lawmaker , said the budget negotiations had been chaotic and there had been a crisis of confidence between the parties , but that the confidence had now been re-established .
tax cuts have been on the right-leaning government s wish list for a long time , but pro-welfare df has been less eager to back that part of the government s policies .
the parties will meet again after the weekend to discuss the proposed tax cuts and df s proposal to make it easier for authorities to revoke residence permits for refugees from war once there is peace in their home countries .
the budget deal includes among other things increased spending on health and elderly care and on infrastructure .
