shanghai ( reuters ) - chinese police said late on tuesday some claims of child abuse at a beijing kindergarten run by new york-listed ryb education were unfounded , the latest twist in a case that has sparked outrage throughout china .
ryb s shares plunged 38.4 percent last friday after police launched an investigation into allegations of child abuse at the school , though they have recovered some losses this week .
by 1700 gmt , the shares were up around 16.6 percent .
police in beijing s chaoyang district said in a statement posted on their official microblog late on tuesday that they had criminally detained a teacher surnamed liu suspected of using knitting needles to discipline children .
however , they added that claims made by some parents that children had been fed unidentified tablets at the school and accounts of a naked adult male conducting purported medical check-ups on unclothed students were fabricated .
china s state-run xinhua news agency had reported last week that police were checking allegations that children were reportedly sexually molested , pierced by needles and given unidentified pills .
the chaoyang police added they had recovered 113 hours of footage from the school s surveillance system , but had not yet found on it instances of people harming children .
they added that the hard drive storage for the footage had been damaged .
the fall-out from the scandal has been widespread .
china s education ministry has launched a special investigation into kindergartens nationwide , while beijing authorities have said they will send permanent inspectors to city nurseries .
ryb , which says it has over 1,300 play-and-learn centers and nearly 500 kindergartens in around 300 cities in china , has suspended one teacher and fired the headmaster of the beijing kindergarten .
the chaoyang police said it would continue with its investigation to get to the bottom of the child abuse claims and hand out severe punishments according to the law .
