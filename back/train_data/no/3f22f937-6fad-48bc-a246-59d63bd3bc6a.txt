sittwe , myanmar ( reuters ) - around 120,000 displaced people - mostly rohingya muslims - in camps in myanmar s rakhine state are not receiving food supplies or healthcare after the u.n. and aid groups suspended operations following government accusations of supporting insurgents .
nearly 400 people have died in fighting in the far north of the state after rohingya militants attacked police posts and an army base a week ago , provoking a major army counteroffensive .
the impact from the conflict has now spread , including to the state capital sittwe further south , where some 90,000 rohingya have lived in camps since an outbreak of communal violence rocked the city in 2012 , killing nearly 200 people .
a further 30,000 rohingya are housed in camps elsewhere in the state , while a small number of ethnic rakhine buddhists displaced in the 2012 violence also live in separate camps .
as a result of the disruption of activities in central rakhine state , many people are currently not receiving their normal food assistance and primary healthcare services have been severely disrupted , said pierre peron , a spokesman for the united nations office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ( ocha ) .
the u.n. and international aid groups had already evacuated all non-critical staff from the north of the state amid intensifying fighting and after the office of national leader aung san suu kyi repeatedly published pictures of world food programme ( wfp ) energy biscuits allegedly found at an insurgent camp .
suu kyi s office also said it was investigating aid groups support for the insurgents in one incident .
now contractors working for the wfp , a u.n. agency , have refused to carry food to the camps in sittwe and elsewhere .
staff with international aid groups who run clinics inside the large , densely populated camps have also been afraid to show up for work , leading to the closure of facilities , u.n. sources and aid workers told reuters .
local staff were afraid of being intimidated by rakhine buddhist hardliners , and some worried about being attacked by muslims , the sources said .
sanitation is also a major problem - contractors cleaning latrines in the camps have also refused to work and the latrines are overflowing in the monsoon rains , increasing the risk of cholera and other waterborne diseases , they said .
the treatment of myanmar s roughly 1.1 million rohingya , who have long complained of persecution in buddhist majority myanmar , is the biggest challenge facing suu kyi .
the top u.n. human rights official , zeid ra ad al-hussein , has criticized suu kyi s office for irresponsible suggestions that aid agencies may have assisted rohingya militants calling themselves the arakan rohingya salvation army ( arsa ) .
# wfp aid & # arsa terrorists : # myanmar govt asking # wfp , aid for civilian or terrorists ?
# rakhine # myanmar , said suu kyi s spokesman , zaw htay , in a tweet on thursday .
tin maung swe , secretary of the rakhine state government , confirmed that workers have refused to work for the wfp .
laborers who carry the wfp food bags don t want to contract with them any more .
people who have made contract with wfp refused to work for them , he said .
he added that residents were disgusted with the organization following the government s accusations .
tin maung swe also said that the government was trying to find a different way to support the organization .
rakhine buddhist leaders have long bemoaned the presence of international agencies , who they accuse of favoring the rohingya .
aid offices in sittwe were sacked during 2014 riots .
the discovery at a suspected militant camp on july 30 of wfp-branded biscuits intended for malnourished children had further stoked tensions even before last week s attacks .
accusations against the u.n. have been spread on social media by nationalist hardliners , stoking fears of another outbreak of communal violence in a state that has long been divided along religious and ethnic lines .
international aid agencies operating in myanmar issued a statement on thursday condemning the insurgent attacks and subsequent violence , and urging all stakeholders to cease the spread of misinformation .
the ocha s peron said the disruption was already being felt .
humanitarian aid normally goes to these vulnerable people for a very good reason , because they depend on it , he said .
in addition to the closure of camp clinics , rohingya who have been referred to the main hospital in sittwe for more serious complaints were finding it hard to travel there , said the hospital s chief doctor kyaw naing win .
there have been some constraints for them to come to the hospital because of the tighter security control after recent clashes , he said , but added the hospital did not discriminate against them .
kyaw naing win said he arranged for the state government to provide security for 17 muslim patients who were discharged from the hospital on thursday .
even before the recent violence rohingya camp residents faced severe restrictions on their movements around sittwe .
talks between government and relief agencies are scheduled for next week , aid group sources told reuters .
possible solutions might include the government providing security escorts for food convoys , they added .
