bauchi , nigeria ( reuters ) - suspected boko haram suicide bombers have killed at least 13 other people in an attack on a market in the northeast nigerian town of biu in borno state , officials said on saturday .
the blasts struck while aid workers were distributing food to people affected by the eight-year conflict with boko haram , said aliyu idrisa , a community leader .
in addition to the 13 victims , 53 people were injured and two bombers were killed , said victor isuku , police spokesman for borno state .
saturday s attack bore the hallmarks of boko haram , which uses suicide bombers , often women and girls , to attack crowded public spaces .
last week , a suicide bombing at a mosque in the northeastern town of mubi killed at least 50 people , one of the deadliest attacks in recent years .
the government has said its long-term plan for the northeast is to corral civilians inside fortified garrison towns and effectively cede the countryside to boko haram .
that plan and a string of deadly attacks have raised questions about assertions by the nigerian government and military that boko haram s islamist insurgency has been all but wiped out .
