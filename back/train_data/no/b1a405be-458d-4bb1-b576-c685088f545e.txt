this is hysterical , but sadly it s not far-fetched at all ! i took down my rebel flag ( which you can t buy on e-bay any more ) and peeled the nra sticker off the front door .
i disconnected my home alarm system and quit the candy-ass neighborhood watch .
i bought two pakistani flags and put one at each corner of the front yard .
then i purchased the black flag of isis ( which you can buy on e-bay ) and put it in the center of the yard .
now , the local police , sheriff , fbi , cia , nsa , homeland security , secret service and other agencies are all watching the house 24/7.i ve never felt safer and i m saving $ 69.95 a month that adt charged me.plus , i bought burkas for my family when we shop or travel .
everyone moves out of way and security can t pat us down safe at last only in usa !
