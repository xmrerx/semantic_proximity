baghdad ( reuters ) - iraq on sunday urged foreign countries to stop importing crude directly from its autonomous kurdistan region and to restrict oil trading to the central government .
the call , published in statement from prime minister haider al-abadi s office , came in retaliation for the kurdistan regional government s plan to hold a referendum on independence on monday .
the central government s statement seems to be directed primarily at turkey , the transit country for all the crude produced in kurdistan .
the crude is taken by pipeline to the turkish mediterranean coast for export .
baghdad asks the neighboring countries and the countries of the world to deal exclusively with the federal government of iraq in regards to entry posts and oil , the statement said .
the iraqi government has always opposed independent sales of crude by the krg , and tried on many occasions to block kurdish oil shipments .
long-standing disputes over land and oil resources are among the main reasons cited by the krg to ask for independence .
iraqi kurdistan produces around 650,000 barrels per day of crude from its fields , including around 150,000 from the disputed areas of kirkuk .
the region s production volumes represent 15 percent of total iraqi output and around 0.7 percent of global oil production .
the krg aspires to raise production to over 1 million barrels per day by the end of this decade .
kurdish oil production has been dominated by mid-sized oil companies such as genel ( genl.l ) , dno ( dno.ol ) , gulf keystone ( gkp.l ) and dana gas ( dana.ad ) .
major oil companies such as chevron ( cvx.n ) , exxon mobil ( xom.n ) and rosneft ( rosn.mm ) also have projects in kurdistan but they are mostly at an exploration stage .
however , rosneft , russia s state oil major , has lent over $ 1 billion to the krg guaranteed by oil sales and committed a total of $ 4 billion to various projects in kurdistan .
