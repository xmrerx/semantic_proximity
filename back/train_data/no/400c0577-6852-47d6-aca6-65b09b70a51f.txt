over the weekend donald trump has been bashing civil rights icon rep. john lewis , even going so far as to say he hasn t done anything.congressman john lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district , which is in horrible shape and falling apart ( not to donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 14 , 2017mention crime infested ) rather than falsely complaining about the election results .
all talk , talk , talk no action or results .
sad !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 14 , 2017congressman john lewis should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the u.s .
i can use all the help i can get !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 15 , 2017you see , trump and his fragile ego couldn t handle lewis calling him an illegitimate president because of all the intelligence revealing russia helped him get elected.if you recall , john lewis marched alongside martin luther king , jr. , throughout the civil rights movement , even speaking at the same memorable event where king uttered his brilliant i have a dream speech.needless to say , when trump dared to tweet out a wickedly generic tweet about martin luther king , jr. on monday morning , it was not received well at all.trump tweeted : celebrate martin luther king day and all of the many wonderful things that he stood for .
honor him for being the great man that he was !

pic.twitter.com/55gczrgv9b jeffrey wright ( @ jfreewright ) january 16 , 2017it s doubtful that donald trump will get the hint that people are tired of his absolute bullsh * t. he talks out of both sides of his mouth , and both sides are equally as repulsive but for different reasons .
one side shows how absolutely vile he is , and the other how he tries to manipulate the fools who are desperate to believe him.if trump wants to honor mlk , he could start by first honoring america by not pretending to actually care when he doesn t.featured photo by win mcnamee/getty images
