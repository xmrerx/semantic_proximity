What does it mean for us as women that we look at those two candidates, as women, and many of us said, that guy, he s better for me, his voice is more true to me, Obama said.
Well, to me that just says you don t like your voice.
You like the thing you re told to like.

She lives in America where there are great opportunities for EVERYONE!It s interesting that Michelle Obama criticized Hillary Clinton yet she s now flip flopping on how she feels.
Hillary also tried to shame women who voted for Trump: When I see women, and look, it s predominantly white women, let s just be clear about that.
I won women, I lost white women although I got more white women s votes than president Obama did in 2012 so this is an ongoing challenge, Hillary said.
But when I see women doing that, I think why are they publicly disrespecting themselves?
, Hillary continued.Note to Hillary and Michelle: WOMEN CAN THINK FOR THEMSELVES!
WE DON T BLINDLY FOLLOW A CANDIDATE JUST BECAUSE SHE S A WOMAN!
