While some have Donald Trump critics have claimed that the unworthy POTUS address to Congress may have actually saved his epically failing presidency and have commented that Trump actually looked presidential for once, liberal documentary filmmaker Michael Moore had an entirely different opinion.In an appearance on MSNBC, Moore tore into Trump and pointed out why no one should be impressed with the disgusting trick Trump pulled on America.
Commenting on the moment in which Trump gave a salute to fallen Navy Seal William Ryan Owens, Moore mocked Trump and said: My ratings.
Record applause.
I m going to get an Emmy for this.
Most applause for a dead soldier on my watch.
The sickness of this man That moment received a standing ovation, but Moore was less than impressed.
Moore accused Trump of inviting Owens wife, widow Carryn Owens, to be present at the address so he could use her as a prop to distract from the fact that the mission that got Owens killed was 100% Trump s fault and was a massive failure.
Moore said: That s why she s there, as sort of an f-you to the people who are criticizing him for this.
And this poor woman, this widow who has lost her husband, she is in desperate grief right now.To use that to put another notch on his belt and what is he thinking about?
The filmmaker also trashed Trump for his complete lack of empathy: To a malignant narcissist you re not ever thinking that you re insulting anybody because it s all about you.
That would require empathy.

Trump will do anything and exploit anyone to detract from his f*ck ups, and he doesn t care how distasteful it is.Featured image via Theo Wargo and Joe Raedle/ Getty Images
