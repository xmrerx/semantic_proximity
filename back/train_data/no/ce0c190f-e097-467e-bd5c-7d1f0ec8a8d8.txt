estcourt , south africa ( reuters ) - police fired rubber bullets and stun grenades to break up crowds hurling insults at a group of men accused of cannibalism in a south african farming town .
more than 500 people gathered outside the magistrates court in eastern kwa-zulu natal province on thursday as the men sat inside , hiding their faces with their hooded tops and their hands .
authorities originally charged seven men after police said one of them had walked into a police station in august with a human leg and a hand .
police spokeswoman col. thembeka mbele told reuters on thursday he had confessed that he was tired of eating human flesh .
the court acquitted three of the men on thursday on charges of murder and conspiracy to commit murder , saying there was a lack of evidence .
the other four were held in custody and the case adjourned until oct. 27 .
we have not charged them with cannibalism , as no such charge exists as far as i know , mbele said .
no one has seen them eating any of the human parts they had in their possession but we are still investigating , she added .
officers were also investigating the suspects for the offence of possessing human remains , mbele said .
police blocked streets outside the court in the town of estcourt , about 160 km ( 100 miles ) north of durban , kwa-zulu natal s biggest city .
they fired the teargas and grenades to keep the crowds at bay as security officers drove all seven men back to jail - the three acquitted man were released later .
members of the crowd shouted back at officers .
where were you when they were eating people ?
said one .
some protesters told local media they feared missing loved ones may have been eaten .
others have linked the deaths with witchcraft , referring to traditional medicines that can be made from a range of ingredients including animal or human body parts .
