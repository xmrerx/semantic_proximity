jarkuduk , uzbekistan ( reuters ) - uzbekistan will no longer have thousands of students , teachers and healthcare workers pick the cotton harvest , prime minister abdulla aripov said on saturday , confirming a halt to a practice condemned abroad as forced labor .
government officials and other sources told reuters earlier this week the central asian nation , one of the world s leading cotton exporters , had abruptly withdrawn students , teachers and medical workers from the autumn harvest .
it s forever , aripov said when asked by reporters whether the government had pulled students and state employees from the fields only for the current harvest rather than for good .
students should study , state employees should work , he said .
officially , the harvest work has been voluntary and paid at about $ 0.005 per kilogram .
in reality those who refuse risk expulsion or dismissal from their jobs unless they bribe an official or hire someone to work in their place , according to sources familiar with the matter .
the move dovetailed with reforms undertaken by president shavkat mirziyoyev in the tightly ruled , former soviet republic since veteran strongman leader islam karimov s death a year ago .
mirziyoyev has moved to liberalize foreign exchange and travel regulations and had about 16,000 people struck off a blacklist of potential extremists , reforms that may help him rebuild ties with the west and attract foreign investment .
despite ending the use of child labor in 2015 under international pressure including boycott campaigns , uzbekistan ranked among the top five worst offenders in the global slavery index compiled last year by activist group walk free foundation .
the foundation estimated that almost 4 percent of the uzbek population - 31 million - lived in modern slavery , placing he country second only to north korea in that category .
