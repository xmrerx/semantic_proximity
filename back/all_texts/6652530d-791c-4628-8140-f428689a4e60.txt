In almost 7 years this president hasn t learned that words don t stop bullets.
He is fundamentally out of touch with human reality, with the reality of history, with the reality of warfare, and Vladimir Putin ruthless and vicious and ugly though he is he s the one that s on the side of history, now.
Not us.
We re clinging to 20th century platitudes, and Putin is changing the world.
CHANGING THE WORLD, as we do nothing.
Putin is a man of action and God help us our president is a deer caught in the headlights of history.
