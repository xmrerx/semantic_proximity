shanghai ( reuters ) - central and local governments will be more open to providing information to help the international community understand china , the official china daily reported on tuesday , citing a senior government official .
we should be open-minded to talk about our disadvantages calmly and conflicts with other countries frankly , the paper quoted jiang jianguo , minister at the state council information office , as saying .
jiang said china should be more confident in discussing its political thought and the way it governs , and should also not avoid talking about hot-button issues .
china enforces strict controls over the media and the dissemination of information online .
it has built a great firewall aimed at restricting overseas websites and is also cracking down on the use of virtual private networks used to circumvent censorship .
in a report published last week , the u.s. non-government organization freedom house ranked china last when it comes to internet freedom , citing censorship targeting ethnic minorities , media and regular citizens .
china has also imposed restrictions on academic publications , forcing them to block access to articles judged to be in violation of local regulations .
however , local authorities have also been urged to improve the accuracy , speed and transparency of economic and environmental data as part of efforts to improve their performance , and china says it is also encouraging the media to hold local officials to account .
