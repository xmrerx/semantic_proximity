it s just too hard too many things christians can not do !
who needs rules when you can just live in a godless society ?
have some fun yolo ! brad pitt is an atheist because his father instilled a christian guilt in him during his upbringing.the actor revealed that he adheres to no religion in an interview with the uk s telegraph on saturday .
pitt told the paper that he was raised in a southern baptist household in missouri , with all the christian guilt about what you can and can not , should and shouldn t do .
the hollywood mega-star elaborated on the christian guilt he was raised with in a 2007 interview with parade .
i d go to christian revivals and be moved by the holy spirit , and i d go to rock concerts and feel the same fervor , pitt told the magazine .
then i d be told , that s the devil s music !
don t partake in that !
i wanted to experience things religion said not to experience .
still , pitt said he learned the value of hard work from his father , who reportedly ran a trucking company in missouri .
he could be a softie , pitt told the telegraph of his father .
but one thing my folks always stressed was being capable , doing things for yourself .
he was really big on integrity and that informed a lot of what [ we ] try to do now .
pitt also revealed that he and his wife and by the sea co-star , angelina jolie , originally wanted double the number of children they currently have .
listen , angie and i were aiming for a dozen , but we crapped out after six , the actor said , adding : everyone talks about the joy of having kids blah , blah , blah .
but i never knew how much i could love something until i looked in the faces of my children .
