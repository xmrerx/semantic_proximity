Donald Trump has been very busy trying to defend his anti-Semitic Star of David tweet, which came from an obviously bigoted white supremacist website, but this latest attempt to defend the indefensible really takes the cake.
Trump actually tried to use Disney s popular Frozen movie which in some sort of advertising campaign for goods relating to the movie used a 6-pointed star to defend his own bigoted Twitter imagery.
He tweeted the following:Where is the outrage for this Disney book?
Is this the 'Star of David' also?
Dishonest media!

It was innocently promoting stickers for children.
What Trump s simple mind can t understand is that it was the combination of things in the image that he tweeted that made it so outrageously offensive.
Well, Hillary Clinton was not letting Trump s ridiculous argument fly.
She seized on Trump s ignorant tweet, and burned him hard:Do you want to build a strawman?

This is just a preview of what we re going to see in the debates.
His ignorance will really show then, and no amount of Crooked Hillary memes and tweets, no number of raucus, violent rallies, and no amount of dog whistling to white supremacists will be able to hide his massive ignorance and gross lack of presidential qualifications on the debate stage opposite the only truly qualified candidate in this race for the highest office in the land.Keep leaning on him Hillary.
We all know how thin his skin is.
