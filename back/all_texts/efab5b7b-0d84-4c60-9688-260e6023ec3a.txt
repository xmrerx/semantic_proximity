We are always doing training to make sure that sailors know the pros and cons of using social media, and they must always observe appropriate conduct, and they re always subject to the UCMJ at all times, she added.The national anthem basically says land of the free, home of the brave, except for hirelings and slaves and I just can t support anything like that, the female sailor said in the video she posted on Facebook.
She continues I think Colin had a really good point when he said we had bodies in the streets.
