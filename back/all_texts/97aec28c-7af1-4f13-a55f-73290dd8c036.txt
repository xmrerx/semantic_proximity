When it comes to the Trump family, one thing is for certain, they love photo opportunities, especially with those who they think may boost the image of the campaign.The Trump campaign knows they re losing, by a lot, with minorities, so any chance they can get to make it look like they re not, they seem to hop on board.Seemingly knowing this, a pair of Latina sisters, Annie and Ceci Cardelle from Salisbury, North Carolina, went to go see Eric Trump as he was out campaigning for his dad in their state.The sisters, ages 23 and 17, are Hillary Clinton supporters, and Annie wore a shirt that read Latina Contra Trump, which of course means Latina Against Trump.
However, knowing neither Trump nor his supporters would likely notice this, and maybe thought it read Latina Con Trump which means with the sisters took a chance to take advantage of the moment.Ceci tweeted out: When you protest a Trump rally but no one realizes your shirt says Latinas AGAINST trump so they take pics w/ you like you re supporters.

And Trump didn t take photos with everyone, so the campaign clearly saw it as a photo opportunity.Ceci said: I was sort of in disbelief when they actually called us forward.
I was like, This is not happening.
There s no way they don t see this shirt.
