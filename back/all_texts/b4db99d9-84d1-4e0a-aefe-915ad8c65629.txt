Donald Trump has been going off on his infamous psychotic Twitter rants again, and they just keep getting more and more terrifying as the days go on.On Tuesday morning, Trump suggested that Americans who burn the American flag should lose their citizenship or alternatively be forced to spend a year in jail: Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag if they do, there must be consequences perhaps loss of citizenship or a year in jail!
TwitterThis is yet another instance where Trump has displayed how little he knows about how the actual Constitution works.
Burning the American flag is completely legal, unlike what Trump is suggesting.
Trump s proposed punishment for flag burning also goes against the landmark 1989 Supreme Court case Texas v. Johnson, where burning the flag was protected under the First Amendment.
It should also be noted that one of Trump s idols, the late Justice Antonin Scalia, ruled in favor of that case.Revoking citizenship is a very serious concept to play with.
According to the Huffington Post, an American citizen can only lose their nationality by pledging allegiance to another country, committing treason, or voluntarily giving it up .Anand Giridharadas didn t hesitate to call Trump out, bringing attention to the fact that Trump is more of a fascist than anything else.
He summed up Trump s threat perfectly when he said the explicit articulation that doing legal things could cost you citizenship.
TwitterThen, Giridharadas gave us some historical context:TwitterThat s terrifying, and unfortunately it s only the tip of the iceberg.
Trump s flag burning tweet came after he went on a troubling Twitter rant last night, in which he attacked the free press for debunking his voter fraud lies.
When you put all of Trump s threats together, it becomes clear that he s more interested in being a dictator than a President.Featured image via Maddie McGarvey /Getty Images
