after much back and forth between the white dude wearing a black lives matter t-shirt and the black man who appears to be acting as security for corrupt hillary , the black man suggests he go to the back of the line and ask secret service for permission to enter .
the good news is that it appears the line to see hillary ( as usual ) is pretty short .
if he had to get to the back of the line for a trump event , that could have been an issue.https : //twitter.com/shaunking/status/724776822018170881corrupt hillary actually sent out this tweet just before the event the white dude in the black lives matter t-shirt wasn t allowed to enter : '' as a white person , i have to talk about [ racism ] more .
we are not a post-racial society . ''
