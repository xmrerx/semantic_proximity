Fox News has declared war on the Merriam-Webster Dictionary for defining a hot dog as a sandwich.America s most embarrassing news network literally incited anger over the classification when Fox & Friends reported on it on Saturday.To celebrate Memorial Day, the Merriam-Webster Dictionary posted a tweet reminding everyone that a hot dog is a sandwich because the definition of a sandwich is two or more slices of bread or a split roll having a filling in between.
While many people have differing opinions on the topic, the dictionary definition certainly makes it sound like a hot dog is, indeed, a sandwich.
Look at Subway for instance.When Subway slices their bread open, they normally do not cut it open all the way through.
If one were to turn the bread on its side it would look just like a hot dog bun, except stuffed with meat, cheese, and veggies.So it makes sense that a hot dog can be classified as a type of sandwich.But Fox News viewers lashed out and host Anna Kooiman read out an angry viewer s comment calling the definition an act of terrorism.
Tucker Carlson then chimed in by calling it un-American.
It sounds like overstatement but when you attack a hot dog you attack America, Carlson said.The pair then threw the segment to Clayton Morris, who was out and about in Times Square desperately looking for hot dog vendors to weigh in on the controversy.
When Morris finally found one, the vendor wanted nothing to do with him or Fox News and actually ended up closing down his hot dog stand rather than talk to him.
When Morris attempted to serve himself, which most people would call stealing, the vendor returned and apparently brought police with him.Here s the video via YouTube:Is there anything Fox News won t try to stoke anger over?
Because trying to make Americans freak out over the dictionary definition of a hot dog is pretty damn petty and ridiculous.
Fox clearly will do anything to keep their viewers angry.Featured Image: Pixabay
