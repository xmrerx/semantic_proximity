Dana Loesch gives us the lowdown on what would happen to our Second Amendment with a Hillary presidency please watch and share!
Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama regularly call for more Second Amendment restrictions.
But yesterday, the president cut short the sentences of 214 convicts 56 of whom were in prison for gun-related crimes.
In the words of Dana Loesch, We don t need gun control.
We need judicial control.
We need politician control.
