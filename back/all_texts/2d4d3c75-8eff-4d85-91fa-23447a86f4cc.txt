KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysia on Tuesday summoned Myanmar s ambassador to express displeasure over violence in Myanmar s Rakhine State, which has displaced nearly 125,000 Rohingya Muslims.
Foreign Minister Anifah Aman said the latest incidents of violence showed that the Myanmar government had made little, if any progress in finding a peaceful solution to problems facing the Rohingya minority, most of whom live in the northwest Myanmar state near the Bangladeshi border.
Given these developments, Malaysia believes that the matter of sustained violence and discrimination against the Rohingyas should be elevated to a higher international forum, Anifah said in a statement.
Muslim-majority Malaysia has been particularly outspoken in its concern about the plight of the Rohingya.
Myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against terrorists responsible for a string of attacks on police posts and the army since last October.
The latest violence began on Aug. 25, when Rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base.
In a separate statement, Malaysia s foreign affairs ministry issued a travel advisory asking Malaysians to defer all non-essential travel to Rakhine State, and for Malaysians in Myanmar to take all necessary precautions and be aware of the security situation.
