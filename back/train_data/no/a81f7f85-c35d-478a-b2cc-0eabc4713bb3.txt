moscow ( reuters ) - the kremlin dismissed u.s. president donald trump s new national security strategy as imperialist on tuesday , but welcomed washington s willingness to cooperate in some areas .
a day earlier , trump s administration had unveiled a security paper - based on the president s america first push - that accused russia of interfering in other countries internal affairs .
a quick read of the parts of the strategy that mention our country one way or another ... ( shows ) an imperialist character , kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov told reporters .
the paper , he added also showed an unwillingness to give up the idea of a unipolar world , moreover , an insistent unwillingness , disregard for a multipolar world .
trump s strategy paper did not include specific accusations from u.s. security agencies that moscow meddled in the 2016 u.s. election .
but it reflected a broader view long held by u.s. diplomats that russia actively undermines american interests at home and abroad .
we can not agree with an attitude that sees our country as a threat to the united states , peskov said .
at the same time , there are some modestly positive aspects , in particular , the readiness to cooperate in areas that correspond to american interests .
trump has frequently spoken of wanting to improve relations with president vladimir putin , even though russia has frustrated u.s. policy in syria and ukraine and done little to help washington in its standoff with north korea .
in a speech laying out his strategy on monday , trump said he had received a call from putin a day earlier to thank him for providing u.s. intelligence that helped thwart a bomb attack in the russian city of st. petersburg .
a u.s. justice department investigation is looking into whether trump campaign aides colluded with russia , something that moscow and trump both deny .
