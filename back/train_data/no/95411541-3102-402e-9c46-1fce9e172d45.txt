harare ( reuters ) - zimbabwe s army declared an end on monday to the military intervention that ousted robert mugabe , promising to shut down their last roadblocks in the capital and hand over to police .
the armed soldiers who took to the streets during last month s de facto coup had largely disappeared from the city center by monday afternoon .
just a handful could be seen standing around with civilian police .
normalcy has now returned to our country .
it is for this reason that ... we announce the end of operation restore legacy today , commander phillip sibanda said , referring to the name of the intervention which the army said targeted criminals in the entourage of the 93-year-old leader and his wife , grace .
civic groups have been urging the soldiers to leave the streets since mugabe s former deputy , emmerson mnangagwa , was sworn in to replace him as president of the southern african country on nov. 24 .
defence forces commander general constantino chiwenga , who spearheaded the de facto coup , was initially billed to address reporters , but he did not turn up and no explanation was given for his absence .
he is widely seen as a contender to become vice president - a post that mnangagwa has promised to fill in the next few days .
mnangagwa made three generals members of the ruling zanu-pf party s executive politburo on friday .
