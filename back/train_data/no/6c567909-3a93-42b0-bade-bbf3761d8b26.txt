all we can say on this one is it s about time someone sued the southern poverty law center ! on tuesday , d. james kennedy ministries ( djkm ) filed a lawsuit against the southern poverty law center ( splc ) , the charity navigation organization guidestar , and amazon , for defamation , religious discrimination , and trafficking in falsehood .
the splc listed djkm as a hate group , while guidestar also categorized it in those terms , and amazon kept the ministry off of its charity donation program , amazon smile .
we embarked today on a journey to right a terrible wrong , dr. frank wright , president and ceo at djkm , said in a statement tuesday .
those who knowingly label christian ministries as hate groups , solely for subscribing to the historic christian faith , are either woefully uninformed or willfully deceitful .
in the case of the southern poverty law center , our lawsuit alleges the latter .
the splc has labeled djkm an anti-lgbt hate group for its opposition to same-sex marriage and transgenderism .
these false and illegal characterizations have a chilling effect on the free exercise of religion and on religious free speech for all people of faith , wright declared .
after having given the splc an opportunity to retract , we have undertaken this legal action , seeking a trial by a jury of our peers , to preserve our own rights under the law and to defend the religious free speech rights of all americans , the djkm president concluded.the lawsuit laid out charges against the splc , guidestar , and amazon.read more : pjm
