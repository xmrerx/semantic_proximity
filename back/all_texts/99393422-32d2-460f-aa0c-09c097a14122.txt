WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump plans to nominate financier Lewis Eisenberg to be ambassador to Italy, the White House said on Monday.
Eisenberg is a co-founder and managing partner of Ironhill Investments and was chairman of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey for six years, the White House said in a statement.
He will need Senate confirmation to take up his post.
