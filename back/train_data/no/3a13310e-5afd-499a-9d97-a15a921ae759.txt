when an employee brought out a tray of oversized doughnuts , the florida-born singer blurted out , what the f k is that ?
i hate americans .
i hate america .
the employee told cbs los angeles that grande was rude and even spit on the doughnuts.now she says that was a mistake .
i am extremely proud to be an american and i ve always made it clear that i love my county ( sic ) , grande told fox411 in a statement .
what i said in a private moment with my friend , who was buying the donuts , was taken out of context and i am sorry for not using more discretion with my choice of words .
the 22-year-old explained she was frustrated by how freely we as americans eat and consume things without giving any thought to the consequences that it has on our health .
she admitted that she should have known better in how [ she ] expressed [ herself ] , but seeing the doughnuts reminded her that the united states has the highest child obesity rate in the world .
we need to do more to educate ourselves and our children about the dangers of overeating and the poison that we put into our bodies , she added.grande also addressed rumors that she pulled out of the mlb all-star concert because of the video after her representative said wednesday the singer would not perform saturday at the paul brown stadium in cincinnati .
as for why i can not be at the mlb show , i have had emergency oral surgery and due to recovery i can not attend the show .
i hope to make it up to all those fans soon .
