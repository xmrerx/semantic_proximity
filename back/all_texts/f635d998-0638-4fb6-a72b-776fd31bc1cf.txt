BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany called for reconciliation and respect for the constitution in Spain after separatists triumphed in Catalan regional elections on Thursday in a result that threatens to prolong political tensions there.
We hope that the current division in Catalan society can be overcome and that a common future can be found with all political forces in Spain, government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer told a regular government news conference on Friday.
Any government will have to act on the basis of the rule of law and the Spanish constitution, she added.
