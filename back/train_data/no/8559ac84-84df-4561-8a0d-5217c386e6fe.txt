istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish police have launched operations to track down 42 university staff from istanbul s marmara university who are alleged to have links to last year s failed coup attempt , a police source said on friday .
so far 22 people have been detained in the operation , the police source said , adding the suspects were believed to be in contact with the network of u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen , whom ankara accuses of orchestrating the abortive putsch in july 2016 .
gulen has denied involvement and denounced in the coup .
since the failed coup , authorities have arrested around 50,000 people pending trial and some 150,000 people , including teachers , judges and soldiers , have been sacked or suspended from their jobs .
the crackdown has alarmed rights groups and some of turkey s western allies , who fear the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent .
the government says the crackdown is necessary given the severity of the security threat .
more than 240 people were killed in last year s coup attempt .
