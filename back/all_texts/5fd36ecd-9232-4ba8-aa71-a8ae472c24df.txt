@AprilDRyan reports Omarosa is leaving the White House because General Kelly "was tired of all the drama."
She "was very vulgar, she was cursing" when he let her know and tried to go see Trump in his residence, but was escorted out by Secret Service https://t.co/tXu1J9HEOw Deena Zeina Zaru (@Deena_CNN) December 13, 2017THE LEFTY TRUMP HATERS WERE GLEEFUL:"Bye girl, bye You have never represented the community.
