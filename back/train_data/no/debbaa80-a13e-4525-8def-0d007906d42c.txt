nairobi ( reuters ) - kenya s supreme court will rule on monday on cases that seek to nullify the re-election of president uhuru kenyatta last month and the judges could order a fresh vote or clear the way for the incumbent to be sworn in for a second term .
the two cases appear to represent a final chance for legal scrutiny of the oct. 26 election and the ruling could end a protracted political crisis in which more than 60 people have been killed .
kenya is a hub for trade , diplomacy and security in east africa .
we will deliver judgment on the 20th , chief justice david maraga told lawyers at the end of a hearing on thursday .
kenyatta defeated opposition leader raila odinga in august but odinga challenged the election and the court voided it citing procedural irregularities and ordered a fresh vote .
the court s decision was the first of its kind in africa .
odinga boycotted last month s poll , saying the election commission had failed to carry out sufficient reforms .
kenyatta won with 98 percent of the vote .
lawyers for the petitioners , a former lawmaker and two human rights activists , urged the court to nullify the repeat poll due to a lack of fresh nominations for candidates and violence in some areas that prevented voting .
their counterparts for the election board , its chairman and kenyatta , rejected the petition and urged the court to uphold the result to help end a crisis that has hurt the economy .
the supreme court was created by a 2010 constitution that followed a crisis over a disputed election in 2007 in which around 1,200 people were killed in ethnic clashes .
analysts said the september ruling by the supreme court could embolden other judiciaries in africa .
this month , liberia s supreme court halted a presidential run-off until the election board investigates claims of fraud in the first round of voting .
