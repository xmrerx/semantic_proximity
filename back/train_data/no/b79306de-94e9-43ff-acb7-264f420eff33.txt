brasilia ( reuters ) - the brazilian government told the supreme court on monday that president michel temer has the authority to revoke the asylum status a former left-wing guerrilla convicted of murder in italy and extradite him at his country s request .
cesare battisti committed four murders in the 1970s when he belonged to a guerilla group called armed proletarians for communism , according to the italian government .
he escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in france before fleeing to brazil to avoid being extradited to italy .
brazil s supreme court authorized battisti s extradition in 2009 , but he was not sent back to italy because former leftist president luiz inacio lula da silva granted him refugee status on his last day in office in 2010 .
in a note to the top court , the government s chief lawyer grace mendon a argued that extradition was a political decision that only the president could make .
she reminded the court that it had approved battisti s extradition in 2009 and asked the justices to reject a habeas corpus writ issued ten days ago by one of its members .
battisti was arrested on oct. 4 as he tried to cross the border into bolivia in a taxi , apparently fearing that brazil s government was about to revoke his asylum status at italy s request .
he was freed two days later .
lula s refusal to extradite battisti upset relations between brazil and italy .
temer , a center-right president who took office when lula s handpicked successor , dilma rousseff , was impeached last year , decided it was time to remove that thorn .
