If you haven t heard, Donald Trump Jr. recently tweeted out emails between himself and Rob Goldstone, a right-wing opposition researcher who was acting as an intermediary between a Kremlin-connected Russian lawyer who promised harmful information about Hillary Clinton.Goldstone arranged a meeting between Russian government attorney Natalia Veselnitskaya and Trump Jr. at Trump Tower on June 9 of last year where he would receive the information as part of Russia and its government s support of the Trump campaign.Here is page 4 (which did not post due to space constraints).

Apparently, Goldstone was there too because he checked in on Facebook at Trump Tower for the meeting:"Preparing for meeting."

Here they are together.

At 4:40 PM, Trump tweeted about Hillary s emails.How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?

He was told that it was part of the Russian government s backing of his father.
He went anyway.Trump Jr. recently hired a criminal defense lawyer.Featured image via Instagram
