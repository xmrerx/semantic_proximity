london ( reuters ) - britain s brexit minister david davis said on tuesday that reaching a deal with the european union was the most likely outcome of talks , but added that the british government was prepared for no agreement with the bloc .
reaching a deal with the european union is not only far and away the most likely outcome , it s also the best outcome for our country , davis said in a speech in london .
i don t think it would be in the interest for either side for there to be no deal .
but as a responsible government it is right that we make every plan for every eventuality .
both sides have spoken of their frustration at a lack of progress in negotiations so far , although davis said talks had made real and tangible progress .
britain wants to move discussions on to the future trade relationship with the eu which brussels will not consider until london settles what it sees as past debts .
while davis said he was unambiguously seeking a deal , he said britain was ready for talks to fail .
over the past year every department across whitehall has been working at pace covering the whole range of scenarios , he said .
these plans have been well developed , have been designed to provide the flexibility to respond to a negotiated agreement , as well as preparing us for the chance that we leave without a deal .
