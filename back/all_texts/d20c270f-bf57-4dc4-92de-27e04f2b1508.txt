When thinking about who would be the perfect person to send to a Donald Trump campaign rally to interview supporters, there really is no one better than Drag Queen Courtney Act, previously of Rupaul s Drag Race.She left the comforts of Provincetown, MA, and went over to Fairfield, CT, to talk to Trump minions.It was there that she met all sorts of interesting folks Islamophobes, racists, misogynists You know, pretty much everyone you think you d find at a Trump rally.Courtney talked to quite a few people, including a man with Trump that B*tch t-shirts, another man with a Made in China Trump hat, as well as a white supremacy group, but one woman really embodied everything Trump.This lady told Courtney: It doesn t matter what your religion is, but I do believe that the Muslim is not a religion.
I believe it s more of a cult and if people got together and sacrificed a human baby or sacrificed a woman at the stake, I would say that people would probably say that s not a good religion.
Like Satanic cults, for instance, they re not legal in our country and therefore I don t believe Sharia law should be legal either.
Besides all the factual inaccuracies and crazy within all that, it doesn t quite seem to be understandable English either.
And she calls herself American.One of the best parts of the video was when some protesters at the rally recognized Courtney from her time on Rupaul s Drag Race.
It was probably a nice relief for her to run into sane people in that crowd of nincompoops.All in all, this video is pretty damn hilarious, yet it s still kinda scary knowing there are people in the U.S. who think this way.
However, these people vote.
Which is all the more reason to make sure we all get out this November and VOTE BLUE.Watch the video here:https://www.facebook.com/junkeedotcom/videos/971933766252421/Featured image via video screen capture
