istanbul ( reuters ) - recent developments in syria s raqqa show that the kurdish ypg militia , backed by the united states , is more concerned about capturing territory than fighting islamic state , turkish foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu said in a speech on thursday .
turkey has expressed anger that a convoy of islamic state fighters were allowed to withdraw from raqqa last month as part of an agreement with the ypg , saying it was appalled by the united states stance on the issue .
[ nl8n1nk9rz ] ankara was also infuriated by washington s support for the syria kurdish fighters , seen by turks as an extension of the outlawed kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) , which has fought a decades-long insurgency in turkey and is designated a terrorist group by ankara , the united states and european union .
turkish procurement of u.s. defence equipment is being delayed in the united states , according to the text of cavusoglu s speech , and turkey is developing alternative solutions for this sector .
we are unfortunately facing important delays in the procurement of defence equipment we urgently need in the fight against terror from the united states due to u.s. internal practices , the text said , without elaborating .
evidently , as these periods are prolonged , we are developing alternative means to acquire the equipment and systems we require , primarily through our own national resources .
turkey recently completed the purchase of russian s-400 surface-to-air missile systems , a defence deal that turkey s western allies see as a snub to the nato alliance as the weapon can not be integrated into the alliance s systems .
