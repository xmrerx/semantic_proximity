No one can accuse Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson of being able to use the few brain his god saw fit to bless him with.
Nobody can accuse him of not clinging so desperately to his faith that he literally can t see anything else, either.
To that end, while speaking at the Western Conservative Summit in Denver, he put forth what he no doubt believes is ironclad proof that the son of his god, Jesus Christ, actually existed.What s his proof?
It s definitely not scientific proof.
It s also not even biblical proof.
No his proof is so uniquely out there that it defies description: [The] calendar documents it is 2016 years since Jesus showed up, right?
So don t tell me he wasn t here!By the way, if your calendar is dated of all the human beings who have ever walked on the Earth, and your calendar is dedicated and predicated to just one of em, evidently something rather large went down.
Wow, he s really got us there.This is a good time to start scratching your head while wondering just what manner of derpiness this is.
Our calendar, dedicated to just Jesus, simply because it s the year 2016?
Don t make us laugh too hard.
It hurts, especially considering that the names of most of the months are based on things that are so un-Christian they re blasphemy:Robertson could stand to read this little history lesson if he s going to make wild claims about our calendar, although it s entirely possible that he d call it all Satan s lies, or something like that.
It s really hard to cure someone like him of willful ignorance; he d just come up with more willful ignorance.Featured image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
