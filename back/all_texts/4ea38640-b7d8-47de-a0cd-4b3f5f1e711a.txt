No matter what Donald Trump does or where he goes, he s never actually doing the right thing and fulfilling his duties as POTUS.One might think that after suffering such a monstrous fail with his American Health Care Act, the president might double down and get right back to work on his quest to somehow improve Obamacare, which he insists is awful despite the fact the Americans overwhelmingly approve of it.
But no instead, Trump decided to spend his Saturday the way he s spent pretty much every Saturday since he became president by playing golf.In the short 9 weeks of his presidency, Trump has already gone golfing 12 times which is far more than any of his predecessors and former President Barack Obama, whom Trump once criticized for taking any downtime to play golf.
Trump has been getting blasted for his weekend golfing getaways, and the White House has gone to great lengths to hide it:However, Trump s cover was blown when some Instagram photographs of Trump surfaced, revealing to Americans what Trump REALLY does when he has his meetings.
Pool was told Trump was in meetings at Trump National this afternoon.
This Instagram photo posted from the course says otherwise pic.twitter.com/WMudqofGmO Josh Billinson (@jbillinson) March 25, 2017As you can imagine, the internet didn t take kindly to being lied to, and went after Trump.
One of the gems that resurfaced from this Twitter attack was this amazing old tweet from White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer which is going to basically make Trump explode:Wow.
That s one tweet Spicer probably wish he d never posted during Obama s presidency, because now it s insulting HIS boss!
To make this even more humiliating for Spicer and Trump, Spicer recently defended Trump s privacy when he was questioned about how often Trump golfs.Twitter is basically losing it over this hypocrisy, and we can t help but laugh along:@seanspicer ?
