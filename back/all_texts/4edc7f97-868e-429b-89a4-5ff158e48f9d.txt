Donald Trump infamously went further into the gutter than usual at a recent debate, where he talked about his hand size, which we all know was just code for the size of his d*ck.
Well, one Chicago hot dog stand has taken this horrible comment and run with it and now their customers can literally take a bite out of Trump s little wiener.Dubbed the Trump Footlong, the hot dog from the Wiener s Circle hot dog stand is pushing something that is definitely false advertising, because the hot dog is anything but a footlong.
In fact, it s only 3 inches.
They tweeted out their new product, and it will likely drive up sales just because people are so eager to humiliate Trump regarding his grossly unpresidential remarks regarding his own genitals:The trump footlong!
At te wiener's circle starting tomorrow!
Just look at those long, resplendent fingers!

Definitely a deal, if you ve ever eaten off of a food truck or stand of any kind in a city the size of Chicago.
Besides, your hard-earned money would be going to infuriate and humiliate the biggest buffoon in American politics.
Definitely well worth it.Just wait until Trump gets a load of this one.
I bet that s the last time he alludes to the size of his d*ck on camera during a presidential debate or anywhere else.Featured image via screen capture from AI archives
