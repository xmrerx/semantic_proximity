it s bad enough that the oscar s this year don t have any black people nominated .
now , to insult to injury , it looks as though some folks think all black people look the same.total beauty , a los angeles based company that provides beauty tips , tweeted a photo of a stunning whoopi goldberg in her gown and wrote : we had no idea oprah was tatted , and we love it .
come on @ totalbeauty there are only a few of us there smhsorry @ whoopigoldberg ? # screenshot pic.twitter.com/hyjdcvtdyi holly robinson peete ( @ hollyrpeete ) february 29 , 2016maybe because that s not oprah .
we had no idea people , in this day and age , were still this dense.well , you can only image the fun twitter had at the expense of this company s absolute stupidity .
the hashtag # thatsnotoprah quickly caught steam.i accidentally thought whoopi was oprah .

as they should be .
they re tweet calling whoopi oprah has since been deleted , and they ve offered an apology : we d like to apologize to oprah and whoopi , as well as everyone we ve offended .
it was our error , and there are no excuses .
we re sorry .

total beauty ( @ totalbeauty ) february 29 , 2016as they should be.now , some may think this is just a small error in judgement and this mistake was easy to make .
those people are idiots .
whoopi goldberg and oprah look absolutely nothing alike .
total beauty got called out on it and got the mocking they deserved.featured image : twitter/twitter
