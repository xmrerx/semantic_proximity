President Obama has been working for months to bring home four American prisoners held in Iran.
It finally paid off with a deal that saw Iran and the United States exchange prisoners.
The president showed that diplomacy instead of war is the right course of action to take.However, that wasn t good for the Republicans who started complaining as soon a the president announced the deal.
It s typical of Republicans to play the partisan card even when what happens is good for the country.
On Late Night with Seth Meyers, Meyers said: Of course, a good day for Obama only lasts seven minutes before Republicans shit all over it.
Which they did, because Republicans were outraged Obama traded seven Iranian prisoners to get the Americans back.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=utJKElxYHPY]Donald Trump was apparently upset that the US gave up seven prisoners while Iran gave up just four.
Yet, clips show that Trump called it a bad deal yet also took credit for it.
Meyers summed it up well.
Imitating Trump s accent, Meyers said: It s a terrible deal we should be ashamed of and not to brag, it was my idea and you should thank me for it.
Trump also denied that he ever said the prisoners would never be released even though the video shows that he did.
Another contradiction from America s favorite contra-dickhead, Meyers said.It s typical fashion for Republicans to go after the president even when the results are good for the country.
