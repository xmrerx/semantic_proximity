Washington Post reporter took to Twitter to post an image of the venue where Trump was to appear in several hours.
The only problem is, the Washington Post reporter didn t say the image was taken several hours before President Trump appeared on stage.Here is Dave Weigel s #FakeNews post, that he has since deleted:As someone who attended Trump s final campaign rally, the night before the election in Grand Rapids, MI, I can attest to the incredible amount of security Trump supporters must go through before entering the venue.
Trump supporters were lined up for miles to get into the event we attended, and after several hours, many of his supporters were seen trickling in, hours after the event started, after waiting to get through security..@DaveWeigel @WashingtonPost put out a phony photo of an empty arena hours before I arrived @ the venue, w/ thousands of people outside, on their way in.
Real photos now shown as I spoke.
Packed house, many people unable to get in.
Demand apology & retraction from FAKE NEWS WaPo!

I deleted the photo after @dmartosko told me I'd gotten it wrong.
Was confused by the image of you walking in the bottom right corner.

Trump called for his firing for pushing #FakeNews on Twitter..@daveweigel of the Washington Post just admitted that his picture was a FAKE (fraud?)
showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in Pensacola when, in fact, he knew the arena was packed (as shown also on T.V.).
FAKE NEWS, he should be fired.
