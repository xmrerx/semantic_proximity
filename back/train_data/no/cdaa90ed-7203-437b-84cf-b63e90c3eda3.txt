according to donald trump , obamacare has wreaked havoc for even longer than even the dumbest among conservatives thought.speaking about healthcare a topic he often confuses with life insurance the donald stood in front of a bunch of human props and complained : for the past 17 years , obamacare has wreaked havoc on the lives on innocent , hard-working americans no , seriously .
he actually said that and mike pence looks like he just ate a fart after hearing it : trump thinks obamacare is 17 years old .
in other words : old enough to date .

msnbc was quick to fact check this claim that the affordable care act , nicknamed obamacare by detractors when it was passed under president obama , became law under president bill clinton.trump started his speech by saying obamacare s been wreaking havoc for the past 17 years so that s cool .

because our so-called president really is the dumbest motherf * cker alive.naturally , trump blew up twitter with this new information that president clinton signed obamcare into law before the first debate on the issue happened : president trump , speaking loudly over crying kids , says obamacare has hurt the country for 17 years .

# resist alan griffin ( @ gryphonskull ) july 24 , 2017at this point , it s fair to ask : is there anything he won t blame on the clintons ? to be fair , he later says that seven years ago , a small group of politicians engineered a government takeover of healthcare years after he says obamacare became law.can we please have some 25th amendment action ?
