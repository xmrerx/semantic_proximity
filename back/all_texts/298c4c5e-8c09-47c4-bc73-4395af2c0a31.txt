WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury would recommend China be considered a currency manipulator if Beijing began unfairly managing the yuan’s value, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to run the Treasury department, Steven Mnuchin, said on Thursday.
Asked in a U.S. Senate hearing if he would recommend Trump formally designate China a currency manipulator if it started manipulating its currency again, Mnuchin said: “I would.”
