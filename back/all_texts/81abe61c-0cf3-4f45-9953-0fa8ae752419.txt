After emerging victorious in the Democratic Primary Tuesday night securing the majority of pledged delegates thanks to New Jersey and California Hillary Clinton got right down to business.
And her first order was to reach out to Trump-weary Republicans with a new domain: RepublicansAgainstTrump.orgRegistered on May 24, the website asks disenfranchised Republicans to sign a pledge to not vote for the presumptive GOP nominee in November.
The pledge simply states:Donald Trump is not qualified to be president.
He does not represent my beliefs as a Republican and, more importantly, my values as an American.
He does not speak for me and I will not vote for him.If one signs the pledge, they will receive a free sticker, courtesy of the Clinton campaign.As Clinton shatters the glass ceiling, Trump continues to divide the GOP, and the Democratic candidate s campaign is taking full advantage of the rift.Just yesterday, Republican Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois who faces a tough reelection battle became the first elected member of the GOP to un-endorse Trump.
On the same day, an Iowa legislator, who has served as a Republican for 18 years, announced he would be leaving the GOP due to Trump s racism.Today, failed presidential candidate and Governor Scott Walker backed away from an endorsement of Trump, saying, It s just sad in America we have such poor choices right now.
Just two days ago, Walker expressed willingness to endorse the frontrunner.Not only does Clinton want to win, she wants an absolute blowout.
There s no better way to achieve that than to reach out to Republicans and right-leaning independents who refuse to back a racist demagogue.
Unlike other elections, it s pretty clear what Trump is: a bigot.
Republicans realize this, giving Clinton an advantage to nab support from the other side.Clinton is set to begin campaigning in the crucial battleground states of Ohio and Pennsylvania.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
