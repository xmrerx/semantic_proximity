wait we thought obama and the democrats were supposed to be standing up to the evil corporations and standing up for the every day american ? when it comes to official and media opinion on obama s crowning trade achievements , the trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) and the transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) , the party line is united .
as previously noted , barack obama has assured the population that this treaty is going to be wonderful for everyone : in hailing the agreement , obama said , congress and the american people will have months to read every word before he signs the deal that he described as a win for all sides .
if we can get this agreement to my desk , then we can help our businesses sell more made in america goods and services around the world , and we can help more american workers compete and win , obama said.the mainstream media s chorus of support for these trade deal is likewise deafening : here are some indicative headlines from this past monday : time magazine : pacific trade deal is good for the u.s. and obama s legacy the washington post : the trans-pacific partnership is a trade deal worth celebrating the far less popular opposing view , one repeatedly presented here , is that like with every other free trade agreement that the u.s. has entered into since world war ii , the exact opposite is what will actually happen : the outcome will be that the us trade deficit ( which excluding petroleum is already back to record levels ) will get even larger , and we will see even more jobs and even more businesses go overseas , thus explaining the secrecy and the fast-track nature of the tpp and ttip s passage through congress.and while the us population , which is far more perturbed by what caitlyn jenner will wear tomorrow than d.c. s plans on the future of world trade , has been mute in its response to the passage of the first part of the trade treaty , the tpp after all the msm isn t there to tell it how to feel about it , aside to assure it that everything will be great even as millions of highly-paid jobs mysteriously become line cooks other countries are standing up against globalist trade interests meant to serve a handful of corporations.case in point germany , where today hundreds of thousands of people marched in berlin in protest against the planned free trade deal between europe and the united states which they say is anti-democratic and will lower food safety , labor and environmental standards.ttip critics fear that it would lead to worse safeguards in europe , bringing down standards for consumer safety , food and health or labor rights down to those in america .
european nations have stricter regulations for things like genetically modified foods or workers benefits than the us does .
there is also discontent with the secretive nature of the negotiations , which prompts skeptics to assume the worst about the document they would eventually produce.the organizers an alliance of environmental groups , charities and opposition parties claimed that 250,000 people were taking part in the rally against free trade deals with both the united states and canada , far more than they had anticipated .
this is the biggest protest that this country has seen for many , many years , christoph bautz , director of citizens movement campact told protesters in a speech.according to reuters , opposition to the so-called transatlantic trade and investment partnership ( ttip ) has risen over the past year in germany , with critics fearing the pact will hand too much power to big multinationals at the expense of consumers and workers .
popular anger appears to be focused on the encroachment by corporations into every corner around the globe : what bothers me the most is that i don t want all our consumer laws to be softened , oliver zloty told reuters tv .
and i don t want to have a dictatorship by any companies .
