Jon Stewart may not be routinely commenting on America s politics anymore, but he certainly hasn t stepped away from the spotlight.
Last night, Stewart took a break from his personal projects to hijack Stephen Colbert s The Late Show, where he couldn t resist weighing in on Donald Trump.During the show, Stewart nailed a personality trait of Trump s that shows just how untrustworthy Trump is.
While it s well known that Trump lies through his teeth every chance he gets (he was also proven to be the most dishonest presidential candidate last year), there s one behavior of Trump s that gives it all away and Stewart pointed this out perfectly.
Mocking one of Trump s most obvious speech patterns, Stewart said: Nobody says believe me unless they are lying.
He elaborated: Trump lies more in one press conference than CNN does in a year.
And this is coming from a guy, who as you know, hates CNN.
Stewart also had some equally harsh words for the media, and advised the press that it should get its groove back and stop latching onto Trump s every attack.
Stewart said to the media: Let s face facts.
You kind of let yourself go a little bit these past few years, put on a few pundits, obsessing 24 hours a day, seven days a week, about this one guy: What s Donnie up to?
Did he say anything about us?
You think he s gonna come on our show?'
Stewart compared the behavior between Trump and the media to a bad breakup, and suggested that it was an opportunity for improvement.
Stewart said, Take up a hobby.
I recommend journalism!
Colbert asked Stewart if he felt the press would actually do some self-reflection and improve, and Stewart joked, I really do believe me.
