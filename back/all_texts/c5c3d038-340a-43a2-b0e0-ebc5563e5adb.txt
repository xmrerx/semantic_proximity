According to a nationwide poll, as many as 2 million non-citizen Hispanics are illegally registered to vote in the U.S.Just Facts President James D. Agresti told The Washington Times: Contrary to the claims of certain major media outlets and fact checkers, a comprehensive analysis of polling data, election records and government investigations shows that many noncitizens vote illegally in U.S. elections, In light of these alarming findings, President Trump has announced that he will be putting together a task force headed by Vice President Mike Pence to look into the allegations of voter fraud which will focus on inaccurate voter registration.A largely ignored National Hispanic survey executed by McLaughlin and Associates in 2013 polled U.S. resident Latinos.
The poll s section on voter profiles showed that of the randomly selected sample of 800 Hispanics, 56 percent, or 448 were non-citizens, and of those 13 percent said they were registered to vote.
The poll did not ask if the non-citizen registered voters had actually voted, presumably because it was made a felony to vote as a non-citizen in 1996.White House adviser Stephen Miller told ABC News: It is a fact and you will not deny it, that there are massive numbers of non-citizens in this country who are registered to vote.
That is a scandal.
We should stop the presses.
Hopefully, the President s task force will be able to prevent any more of the roughly 8.3 million non-citizen adults living in the U.S. from registering to vote.
