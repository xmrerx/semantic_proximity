@realDonaldTrump : - Rand Paul, or whoever votes against Hcare Bill, will forever (future political campaigns) be known as “the Republican who saved ObamaCare.” [0619 EDT] - Kim Jong Un of North Korea, who is obviously a madman who doesn’t mind starving or killing his people, will be tested like never before!
[0628 EDT] - The Russia hoax continues, now it’s ads on Facebook.
What about the totally biased and dishonest Media coverage in favor of Crooked Hillary?
[0644 EDT] - The greatest influence over our election was the Fake News Media “screaming” for Crooked Hillary Clinton.
Next, she was a bad candidate!
[0726 EDT] - Will be in Alabama tonight.
Luther Strange has gained mightily since my endorsement, but will be very close.
He loves Alabama, and so do I!
