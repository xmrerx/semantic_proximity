we can t be certain , but it almost looked like megyn had blood coming out of her eyes during her interview with the soft-spoken and sensible dr. ben carson megyn kelly pressed dr. ben carson to explain why the khan family should apologize to donald trump , instead of the other way around.carson said that the khans said things that are false , like that trump had never read the constitution.when kelly said that khizr khan was stating his opinion , carson said that was unreasonable .
kelly said that she knew carson as an empathetic and kind man , and asked him if he really believe that this gold star family should apologize to donald trump that has sacrificed their son to protect this nation , that were viciously attacked by the presidential nominee that they owe him an apology ?
carson responded that society has gotten itself into a tug of war where people try to demonize each other , and that trump and the khans need to realize that they are on the same side .
