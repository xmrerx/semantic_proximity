brasilia/sao paulo ( reuters ) - brazilian police raided the home of agriculture minister blairo maggi on thursday in a corruption investigation linked to his time as a state governor , adding to the graft scandals rocking president michel temer s government .
last month the supreme court opened a bribery probe into maggi s role in a scheme known as mensalinho , a payment of a monthly stipend to lawmakers in exchange for political support in his home state of mato grosso .
he served two terms as governor there between 2003 and 2010 .
according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter , the raid was linked to a plea deal by former mato grosso state governor silval barbosa , who accuses maggi of participating in the corruption scheme .
barbosa was maggi s vice-governor , replacing him in the top job in 2010 when maggi resigned to run for a seat in brazil s senate .
barbosa was subsequently elected to a four-year term that ended in 2014 .
maggi denied any wrongdoing , claiming in a statement that barbosa lied in his plea bargain testimony .
i never authorized any illegal actions while in office nor have i obstructed justice , maggi said .
maggi is a billionaire who was once brazil s largest soybean producer .
his family firm amaggi sa runs large farms in mato grosso and operates a commodity trading business that competes in brazil with global firms like archer daniels midland co , cargill inc and bunge ltd. mato grosso , where federal police said they served search warrants in nine cities , is a major producer of grains and cattle .
raids were also conducted in s o paulo and bras lia , the police said in a statement .
the probe marks the latest blow to temer s administration , whose economic reform agenda has been repeatedly thwarted by graft investigations that have targeted top officials , including the president .
temer has denied any wrongdoing .
