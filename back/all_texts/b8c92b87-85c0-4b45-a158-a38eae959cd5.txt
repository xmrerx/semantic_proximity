Pastor James David Manning is one of the most vocally homophobic preachers in America.
He is the leader of Atlah Worldwide Church, and has made such disgusting public statements as Jesus would stone homos, and tried to accuse gay people of spreading Ebola through Starbucks coffee.
Well, Pastor Manning is finally getting his comeuppance, because a judge has ordered that his hateful church be put up for public auction.The reason for the order is that Manning has not been paying his church s bill.
DNA Info reports that Manning has nine tax liens against the church s property.
The debts include, but are not limited to:Manning, however, is as delusional as ever, and insists that he didn t know about the auctioning of his church until last week.
This seems to be a flat-out lie, though, as his lawyers responded to the case as early as October 2009, which is a month after the case was opened.
Manning also plans to go against the auction order, which was filed by Judge Joan Kenny on December 17, 2015.
Manning says of the auctioning of his church: I assure you, it s about a water bill and a tax that can t be levied against this church.
I think it s a land grab quite frankly.
Though the church is, like all others, tax exempt, Manning seems to be unable to comprehend that being a tax exempt religious institution does not mean that he does not have to pay his bills.
To that end, whatever appeals he might make to stop the auction will likely prove fruitless.
The auction will be held on February 24.This is all to the good, as the community can now be effectively free of Manning and his followers constant and unending stream of homophobic hate speech.
