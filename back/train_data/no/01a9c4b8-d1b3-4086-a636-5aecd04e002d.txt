baghdad ( reuters ) - around 400,000 children are still displaced from the fighting for mosul , one year after the start of a military offensive to recapture the iraqi city from the islamic state , save the children said on monday .
islamic state s self-declared caliphate effectively collapsed in july , when u.s.-backed iraqi forces re-took mosul , the group s de facto capital in iraq , after a grueling nine-month battle .
just because the fighting in mosul has stopped doesn t mean the humanitarian needs aren t great .
if anything , children need our help now more than ever - those that are still displaced and those that are returning to see what s left of their homes , said the london-based charity s iraq country director , ana locsin .
large parts of mosul have been reduced to rubble ; schools , homes , hospitals , roads , playgrounds and parks .
i ve spoken to dozens of children haunted by their experiences , left with psychological scars that ll take years to heal , locsin said in a statement .
with the fall of mosul and other small towns in the country s north and west , the only area still under control of islamic state in iraq is a stretch alongside the western border with syria , where the militant group is also in retreat .
