NEW YORK (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has canceled a campaign trip to California because of her diagnosis of pneumonia, a campaign official said on Sunday.
Clinton was scheduled to leave for California on Monday morning for a two-day swing that included fundraisers and a speech on the economy.
No other details about her travel were available.
