the lgbt mafia and pc police doing what they do best shaming americans and businesses into conformity .
does anyone have the courage or fortitude to fight back , or are we just going to allow these pc thugs to strip our children of the genders god clearly assigned to each of us ?
target corp. is removing gender labels from most of its children s departments after customers complained about signs designating certain toys for girls.the kids bedding section will no longer feature boy and girl signage , and the toy department will be without labels and pink or blue paper on the shelves , minneapolis-based target said on its website friday .
gender labels will remain in the kids clothing section because of sizing and fit differences.retailers have been moving away from gender stereotypes , and some startups have emerged to break down the divide in kids clothing and toys .
the signage that sparked the dispute at target was for building sets , like goldieblox , that are targeted at girls .
as guests have pointed out , in some departments like toys , home or entertainment , suggesting products by gender is unnecessary , target said .
we heard you , and we agree .
right now , our teams are working across the store to identify areas where we can phase out gender-based signage to help strike a better balance .
in june , ohio mom abi bechtel called out target s gender designations in its toy aisle .
she posted a photo to twitter that showed store signs for girls building sets next to regular building sets .
the outcry was swift , with angry shoppers calling for change .
it stood out to me as a good example of the way our culture tends to view boys and men as the default , normal option and girls and women as the specialized option , bechtel told cnn at the time.via : bloomberg
