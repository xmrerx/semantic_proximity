washington ( reuters ) - u.s. house of representatives budget committee chairman diane black said on thursday republican had enough votes to pass a fiscal 2018 budget resolution which is needed to move tax reform legislation forward , adding that she expects the house to vote on thursday , oct. 5 .
“ i think we ’ re going to absolutely have the votes , ” the tennessee republican told reuters .
“ people are excited about tax reform. ” by passing a budget resolution , congress would unlock a legislative tool known as reconciliation , which republicans need to move tax legislation through the senate with a simple majority of 51 votes .
they control the chamber by a 52-48 margin and would need 60 votes for passage without reconciliation .
