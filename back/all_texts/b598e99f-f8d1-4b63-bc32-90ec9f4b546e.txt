Legendary actor Robert De Niro was in Sarajevo on Saturday to accept an award in recognition of the anniversary of his character in the film Taxi Driver.
But while speaking about the movie, De Niro compared his character of Travis Bickle, who has psychological issues and violent tendencies, to the Republican nominee.
I don t know, it s crazy that people like Donald Trump he shouldn t even be where he is, so God help us, he began as the crowd cheered.
What he s been saying is really totally crazy, ridiculous he is totally nuts.
But I think now they are really starting to push back, the media finally they are starting to say: Come on Donald, this is ridiculous, this is nuts, this is insane.
Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, Donald Trump has drawn outrage from around the world with his offensive and threatening remarks ever since he entered the race for the Republican nomination in June of last year.Perhaps most worrying to people living in Sarajevo is Trump s refusal to rule out using nuclear weapons in Europe.But Trump s outbursts have also included claims that the upcoming presidential election is rigged in favor of Hillary Clinton and his call for Second Amendment people to do something to stop Hillary Clinton from nominating liberal judges to the Supreme Court, which is essentially a call for gun nuts to shoot her.Bosnia and Herzegovina, whose capital city is Sarajevo, is probably also concerned about Trump s ties to Russian president Vladamir Putin, especially since the Republican nominee has threatened to pull American support from NATO and Russia has been aggressive in Eastern Europe.Make no mistake, Trump is crazy and the people in Sarajevo and the rest of the world really appreciated De Niro for speaking out against Trump at a time when many Americans really do want an egomaniacal dictator wannabe in the White House.Featured image via screen capture
