beijing ( reuters ) - president xi jinping vowed to further free up china s economy , again urging asian countries to work closely together in a speech at the asia pacific economic cooperation ( apec ) meeting in vietnam .
the comments echo xi s call to support a multilateral trading system and contrast with those delivered at the weekend by u.s. president donald trump , who pulled out of the regional trans-pacific partnership ( tpp ) trade deal and told the meeting the u.s. would pursue bilateral trade deals instead .
xi said his government would continue to prioritize domestic employment and ensure economic development at home supports job creation , according to a text of his remarks published by the official xinhua news agency late on saturday .
china will open still wider and its development will deliver even greater benefits to the rest of the world , xi told the apec leaders .
china has created 13 million new jobs in cities and towns in recent years , xi added .
economic restructuring does not have to come at the expense of employment , xi said .
on the contrary , stable employment would allow greater leeway for reform and development .
