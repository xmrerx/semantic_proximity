new york ( reuters ) - u.s. senate democratic leader chuck schumer on monday said lawmakers from his party insist puerto rico be included in any supplemental federal disaster relief packages for hurricanes harvey and irma .
hurricane maria slammed puerto rico last week , tearing apart buildings and infrastructure , flooding communities and downing communications to nearly all of the u.s. territory s 3.4 million residents .
puerto rico has taken a serious punch to the gut , schumer said during his opening remarks on the senate floor .
they need our help they , need it now .
schumer also urged his constituents to add the u.s. virgin islands , which were ravaged by hurricane irma several weeks ago , and western u.s. states ravaged by wildfires to future hurricane-related federal relief packages .
he asked for additional aid packages to be prepared quickly .
president donald trump signed a bill on sept. 8 extending the government debt limit for three months and providing about $ 15 billion in aid for states struck by hurricane harvey hurricane irma .
puerto ricans are u.s. residents but they do not pay federal income tax or vote in presidential elections .
there is a growing movement by residents to have their island become the 51st u.s. state , giving them more access to federal funds and the right to vote for u.s. president .
