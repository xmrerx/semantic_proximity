Christmas the perfect time to pander to Muslims There is a reason his mother never let him be King.
During a recent radio broadcast, Charles, Britain s Prince of Wales, told his listeners that Christians should give thoughts to the prophet Mohammed during this Christmas season.Clip via The Telegraph Normally at Christmas, we think of the Birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, he said on Radio 4 s Thoughts for the Day.
I wonder though if this year we might remember how the story of the nativity unfolds, with the fleeing of the holy family to escape violent persecution.
The crown prince then likened that event to Mohammed traveling to Medina in search of converts.
And we might also remember that when the prophet Muhammad migrated from Mecca to Medina he was seeking the freedom for himself and his followers to worship.
Prince Charles then claimed that all religious groups want the same thing the ability to live and worship in peace and to allow others to do the same.
Whichever religious path we follow, the destination is the same to value and respect the other person, accepting their right to live out their peaceful response to the love of God, he said.The Prince of Wales then appeared to go after both president-elect Donald Trump s populist message as well as Great Britain s departure from the European Union based, in part, on the influx of immigrants from Middle Eastern Countries.
We are now seeing the rise of many populist groups across the world that are increasingly aggressive towards those who adhere to a minority faith.
All of this has deeply disturbing echoes of the dark days of the 1930s, he said.
