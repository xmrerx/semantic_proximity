The evidence that Russia is buying us up continues to mount, and the pile is so tall it s about to tip over.
While Trump is busy accusing Chuck Schumer of being a hypocrite because he s met with Russia too (a thing he openly admits and has never lied about or covered up, which is the issue with Trump s people), one of his campaign advisers, J.D.
Gordon, has decided to reverse course on his statements about why the RNC reversed its course on Russia and inserted pro-Russian language to its platform.Now he s saying this: [I, along with others] advocated for the GOP platform to include language against arming Ukrainians against pro-Russian rebels because this was in line with Trump s views, expressed at a March national security meeting at the unfinished Trump hotel [in Washington, D.C.] [emphasis mine]Apparently, Trump didn t want to start WWIII over Ukraine (but he s perfectly willing to start it on Twitter with China, Mexico, and all of NATO).Gordon says that Trump believed helping get Russia out of Ukraine was anathema to improved relations with Russia.
The problem with improved relations with Russia is that Trump doesn t want that for world peace and unity.
He wants it because he s in bed with Putin, along with Jared Kushner, Jeff Sessions, and disgraced security adviser Michael Flynn.Sessions actually presided over the meeting where that plank of the platform was changed.
Look impossibly suspicious yet?
It should.
To make Trump s growing ties to Russia even more crystal clear here, the week that this went down was also the week that Wikileaks released thousands of emails that Russia had obtained via its hacks.Seriously, can we impeach Trump now?
The time for that started the day he was inaugurated.
We have an entire administration selling us out to one of our biggest enemies, and an entire political party that won t do a thing about it, likely because it will make them look as corrupt as they are.Featured image by John Moore via Getty Images
