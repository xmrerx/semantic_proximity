bangkok ( reuters ) - thailand s king maha vajiralongkorn on wednesday presided over a ceremony marking the end of the construction of the royal crematorium that will be used in the funeral of his father , the late king bhumibol adulyadej , on oct. 26 .
the king blessed and then raised the nine-tiered great white umbrella of state , the most sacred regalia of the thai monarchy , to the top of the lavish crematorium - the main site of the royal funeral that was built from scratch on an open space in front of the grand palace in bangkok s old quarter .
artisans have worked for 10 months to build the site that includes eight structures decorated with ornaments of various gods and goddesses , mimicking a vision of heaven in bhramin-buddhist traditions of thailand s royal court .
hundreds of thousands of black-clad mourners are expected to camp for days near the palace to observe the five-day funeral ceremony , a last goodbye to much-loved king bhumibol who reigned over thailand from 1946 until his death on oct. 13 , 2016 .
[ nl4n1mm1n6 ] foreign minister don pramudwinai said at least 30 foreign dignitaries will attend the royal cremation and the number could rise .
the dignitaries who have confirmed their attendance include king jigme khesar namgyel wangchuck of bhutan , queen maxima of the netherlands , queen mathilde of belgium , crown prince haakon of norway , japan s prince akishino , australia s governor general sir peter cosgrove and singapore s president halimah yacob .
about 12 million people , or almost one sixth of thailand s population , have paid their respects to the late king , queuing up to visit the grand palace where he has been lying-in-state .
oct. 26 has been declared a national holiday .
that night , more than 3,000 performers will join a final tribute of music and puppet shows to end a year of mourning .
