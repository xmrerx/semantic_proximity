Isn t there a legal term for those kinds of threats?
Oh yeah it called Extortion:ex tor tion ik st rSH( )n/ noun the practice of obtaining something, especially money, through force or threats.
synonyms: blackmail, shakedown; formalexaction arrested on a charge of extortion Unhappy with a series of small concessions from the administration, protesters at Yale University have released a new list of demands that include firing people they don t like and giving their favored programs a budget increase of at least $8 million a year.The new demands, released by a group calling itself Next Yale, were read aloud to Yale president Peter Salovey Thursday night by protesters who marched to his front door at midnight.
The group says the demands are necessary to reduce the intolerable racism that students of color experience on campus every day.
Salovey is given until Nov. 18 to respond.As evidence of Yale s hostile racial climate, the demands cite a widely debunked alleged exclusion of black women from a party hosted at Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity.
There is substantial evidence this alleged segregation did not happen.Of the Yale student s demands, the most expensive is the third, which orders the school to increase the budget for Yale s four cultural centers (for Asians, blacks, Hispanics, and American Indians) by two million dollars each, a total expense of $8 million.
Along with this increase to their budgets, the students demand that the cultural centers hire five additional full-time employees each.
