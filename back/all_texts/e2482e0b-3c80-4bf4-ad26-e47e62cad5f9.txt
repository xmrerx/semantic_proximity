It s shocking that stalking conservatives to intimidate or harm them is actually happening in 2017.
Several instances of stalking and threatening behavior have been reported by conservatives on campus at UC Berkeley.
The latest reported by Campus Reform is a series of tweets telling where to stalk a group of campus Republicans having dinner.Naweed Tahmas, the vice president of the Berkeley College Republicans, also condemned the actions of Antifa while noting that intimidation will not stop us.
Conservatives in Berkeley are routinely targeted, harassed, and stalked, he told Campus Reform.
Knowing that they have sympathizers within both the city administration and university administration, leftist groups will continue to target conservatives as they know there are no consequences to their actions.
It has become socially acceptable in Berkeley to physically beat someone for being a conservative, Tahmas added.
In fact, it is even encouraged.
Do you ever feel uneasy when you express conservative beliefs?
Do you feel afraid if you wear political attire like a Trump MAGA hat?
We d like to know if you ve ever had a bad experience while showing your conservatism.The left has been so successful at hijacking the narrative on what it means to be conservative.
They ve been screaming that conservatives are Nazis and white supremacists.
