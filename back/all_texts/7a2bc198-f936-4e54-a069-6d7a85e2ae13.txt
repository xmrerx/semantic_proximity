DANANG, Vietnam (Reuters) - Talks among ministers from Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) countries on reviving their trade deal on Thursday were very productive but more discussion is needed, Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said.
Ministers from the 11 countries are meeting in the resort of Danang in Vietnam on the sidelines of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit to discuss how to proceed with the deal after the United States withdrew.
It was a very productive meeting, but we are still discussing.
We will comment later on today, the minister told reporters.
Everybody wants to have a result.
Ministers did not say when further discussions would be held, but an official said they were likely to continue on Thursday evening.
