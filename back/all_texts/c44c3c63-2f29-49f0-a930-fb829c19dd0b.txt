A black college professor from New Jersey is alleging that police officers detained her over a parking ticket, handcuffing her to a table and subjecting her to a search.Dr.
Imani Perry, an African-American studies professor at Princeton University, said she was mistreated by two white police officers because of her race.According to a New York Times interview with police Capt.
Nicholas K. Sutter, a computer search found that Perry had an outstanding arrest warrant for unpaid parking tickets from 2013, and she was arrested.Dr.
Perry wrote about her arrest on Twitter and Facebook, saying it left her humiliated and frightened.
She said she was on her way to work when she was pulled over for a single parking ticket three years ago.
She said that the male officer conducted a body search on her even though a female officer was present.
She said that she was not allowed to make a phone call before she was put into the squad car, and that she was later handcuffed to a table at the station.Writing on Twitter, Perry said she received criticism from conservative observers who insisted she brought her predicament on herself, There are a number of commentators online who have repeated to me an all-too-common formulation: Well, if you hadn t done anything wrong this wouldn t have happened.
But this demand for behavioral perfection from Black people in response to disproportionate policing and punishment is a terrible red herring.
Perry s case is the most recent in a string of incidents that have received exposure online, in which it appears police officers have put black citizens under extra scrutiny, in some cases leading to their deaths in the case of people like Sandra Bland.In turn, this has led to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement, in which greater accountability and oversight of police officers is being demanded.
By contrast, conservatives have insisted that this accountability is part of a war on cops.
