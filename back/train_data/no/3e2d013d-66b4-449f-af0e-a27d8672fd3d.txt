london ( reuters ) - britain s parliament will not discuss the key european union withdrawal bill next week , the leader of the lower house of commons , andrea leadsom , said on thursday , amid concerns the government is struggling to manage divisions over its contents .
the bill is at the heart of the government s brexit strategy .
it will transpose eu law into british law at the point of britain s departure from the bloc and repeal the 1972 act of parliament which made it a member .
lawmakers have proposed hundreds of changes to the bill , some of which have enough backing from lawmakers within prime minister theresa may s conservative party to defeat the government - something that would cause may a major headache and question her ability to complete the brexit process .
there is nothing odd or anything to fear from this slight pause , leadsom told lawmakers .
she promised them there would be eight days of debate on the bill but did not say when they would start .
the bbc reported on wednesday that the government might delay the bill s passage through parliament until next month because of political divisions .
the bill has already passed its first stage of the legislative process , but is expected to face a stiffer challenge when it is next debated .
it has been criticised by lawmakers who say it gives the government too much power to amend eu laws as they are transferred onto the british statute book .
others want safeguards to ensure the government can not walk away from negotiations without parliament s approval .
