seoul ( reuters ) - the united nations nuclear watchdog s chief said on friday north korea s sixth nuclear test conducted on sept. 3 showed the isolated country has made rapid progress on weapons development that posed a new , global threat .
tensions on the korean peninsula have increased markedly since the test , which led to a new round of sanctions against the north after a unanimous u.n. security council resolution .
( the ) yield is much bigger than the previous test , and it means north korea made very rapid progress , international atomic energy agency ( iaea ) director yukiya amano told reporters in seoul .
combined with other elements , this is a new threat and this is a global threat , he said after a meeting with south korean foreign minister kang kyung-wha .
amano said the iaea did not have the capacity to determine whether the north had tested a hydrogen bomb , as pyongyang has claimed .
what is most important for now is for the international community to unite , amano said .
tensions had already flared after north korea tested two more intercontinental ballistic missiles and other launches as it pursues its nuclear and missile programs in defiance of international pressure .
south korea said on thursday the north could engage in more provocations near the anniversary of the founding of the north korean communist party and china s all-important communist party congress .
insults and threats hurled between the north s leader kim jong un and u.s. president donald trump have aggravated the situation further .
members of the international community have urged both countries to resolve matters peacefully while boosting pressure on pyongyang to curb its weapons programs .
a u.s. state department official said on thursday china was making progress in enforcing sanctions imposed on north korea , and urged skeptical members of congress not to rush to enact new measures before giving beijing s efforts a chance to take effect .
