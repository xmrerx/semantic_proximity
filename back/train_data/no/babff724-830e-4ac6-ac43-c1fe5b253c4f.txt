dhaka ( reuters ) - bangladesh is seeking international support for its plan to relocate rohingya muslims fleeing violence in myanmar to a remote bay of bengal island that critics say is flood-prone and unlivable .
more than 300,000 rohingya have fled to bangladesh from buddhist-majority myanmar since the latest violence began on aug. 25 , joining more than 400,000 others already living there in cramped makeshift camps .
the united nations top human rights official on monday slammed myanmar for conducting a cruel military operation against the rohingya , branding it a textbook example of ethnic cleansing .
this is creating a huge challenge for bangladesh in terms of providing shelter as well as other humanitarian assistance to them , bangladesh s foreign ministry said in a statement on monday as foreign minister abul hassan mahmood ali held talks with diplomats .
he urged the international community to push myanmar to find a permanent solution to this crisis and sought support for transportation of the rohingya to bhashan char , also known as thengar char .
bangladesh , one of the world s poorest and most crowded nations , plans to develop thengar char , which only emerged from the silt off bangladesh s delta coast 11 years ago and is two hours by boat from the nearest settlement .
it regularly floods during june-september monsoons and , when seas are calm , pirates roam the nearby waters to kidnap fishermen for ransom .
the plan to develop the island and use it to house refugees was criticized by humanitarian workers when it was proposed in 2015 and revived last year .
bangladesh , though , insists it alone has the right to decide where to shelter the growing numbers of refugees .
