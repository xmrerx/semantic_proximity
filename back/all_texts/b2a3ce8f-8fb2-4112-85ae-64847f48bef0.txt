The former CEO of the President s favorite outlet just slammed him with a hard to ignore insult about what it s like to be in the same room with POTUS.Mega mogul Dick Costolo was invited to a meeting with leaders of Silicon Valley and some of the country s business bigwigs this week.
He wasn t shy in his attempt to let the world know they can rest assured that they did not miss out on anything by not being at the meeting.If you don't get invited to this meeting and want to know what it was like, just drink a bottle of gin and then waterboard yourself.

The man spends hours a day obsessing over Costello s former company, even if its founders despise him.Trump won t address this major dis he never does when people he respects openly bash him.
He just sulks, whines about bullshit, and then goes golfing.
What a phony.Even though Trump himself won t respond to this super funny slam, the world of Twitter will keep us entertained with some AMAZING comments.
