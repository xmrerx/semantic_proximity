donald trump regularly takes a beating on twitter , the home of his poorly-spelled , nonsensical ravings .
but since he s the president , he s above pettiness and respects dissenting opinions and facts , right ?
wrong.while the donald s pea-brained followers regularly call anyone who has a problem with their racism and hatred snowflakes ( a term that ironically refers to someone who was opposed to the abolition of slavery , something trump fans want to bring back ) it seems that the term now applies to donald trump in two ways the original meaning , and the new one thrown around by idiots who think it sounds clever ( see below ) : trump s feelings apparently were hurt by comedy writer bess kalb , who found that the leader of the free world had blocked her : oh .
my .
effing .
god.the president of the united states just blocked me on twitter because i hurt his feelings .
# maga pic.twitter.com/ob5ztas7in bess kalb ( @ bessbell ) may 29 , 2017from now on , there is only one snowflake .
bess kalb ( @ bessbell ) may 29 , 2017naturally , kalb is devastated ( not really ) : i 'd like to summarize my feelings about this in one radical feminist sculpture : pic.twitter.com/qmtdy9viee bess kalb ( @ bessbell ) may 29 , 2017it is mortifying , yet unsurprising to me that the leader of the free world could be so wounded by the gentle ribbing of a comedy writer .
bess kalb ( @ bessbell ) may 29 , 2017and if i could talk to him now i d tell him : donald , sticks and stones may break your bones but articles of impeachment will harm you .
bess kalb ( @ bessbell ) may 29 , 2017but what could have so damaged trump that he would block kalb ?
this.for the official record , here 's the straw that broke the camel 's back .
kalb out .
pic.twitter.com/piv7t5wcc3 bess kalb ( @ bessbell ) may 29 , 2017yes , that s it .
she poked fun at his embarrassing trips abroad , his efforts to avoid serving in the military , and of course the idea of president pence ( shudder ) taking over.kalb took a moment to put this all into perspective , noting that our president took more time to address a girl making fun of him on twitter than the domestic terrorist who fatally stabbed 2 heroes .
today our president took more time to address a girl making fun of him on twitter than the domestic terrorist who fatally stabbed 2 heroes .
bess kalb ( @ bessbell ) may 29 , 2017of course others on twitter share kalb s feeling of devastation mainly because she s seemingly always there to mock the donald and this block represents a huge hole in their lives : @ th3j35t3r @ bessbell i feel bad , i have been openly insulting him and nothing .
