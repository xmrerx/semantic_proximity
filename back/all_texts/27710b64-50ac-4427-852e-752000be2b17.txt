Donald Trump is known for changing his mind, and today he did an about face on the minimum wage.
Despite the fact that he had previously said that wages were too high already, he now says that he thinks the minimum wage should be raised to $10 an hour.Fox News anchor Bill O Reilly pressed the Republican nominee on Tuesday, explaining to him that there has to be a federal minimum wage.
Initially, Trump just didn t seem to get it.
There doesn t have to be, Trump said.
I would leave it and raise it somewhat.
You need to help people.
I know it s not very Republican to say.
Trump just kind of goes with the flow, doesn t he?
He just makes it up as he goes along.
After all, this is the man that changed his stance on abortion four times in three days.
The only thing he can stand firm on when it comes to policies is banning Muslims and building his stupid wall.Featured image via Sara D. Davis/Getty Images
