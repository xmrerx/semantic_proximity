one of twitter s top trending hashtags is full of women who ve been harassed and assaulted , and they re explaining why women don t report such incidents with their personal stories .
there are many , many moving accounts under # whywomendontreport , but there are also the misogynistic jerkwads who are intentionally hurting victims all over again.trump s deplorables are busy reinforcing their image as the bottom-feeders of deplorability .
they re calling trump s victims liars , and they re calling women who report sexual assault liars , gold-diggers , and worse .
in short , they re doing every single thing they can to shame women who have been harassed and outright attacked .
some are even using # nextfaketrumpvictim as a rebuttal to # whywomendontreport.they are disgusting , and they are monsters .
they ve once again shown themselves to be the basket of deplorables that hillary said they are.we don t live in a rape culture .
shut up .

many fear that nobody will believe them .
they fear the accusation will be turned back on them and destroy their reputations and lives .
they can t stomach the idea of having to answer explicit questions about their bodies and their sexuality in order to prove they were actually attacked.it s because there are police who tell women to deal with it , and sometimes don t even file the report .
it s because women are asked what they were wearing , whether they were drinking and flirting , why they were wherever they were , why they let themselves be alone with their attackers , and so forth .
it s because people say that sexual assault is just sex that the victim regrets later on.no , people don t believe us .
yes , people shame us to hell and back .
yes , we re accused of ruining the lives of the men who hurt us so badly .
why don t women report sexual assault and harassment ?
because we can t.featured image by ralph freso via getty images
