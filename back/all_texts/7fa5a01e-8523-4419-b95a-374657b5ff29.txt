MSNBC s Joy Reid filled on All In With Chris Hayes Thursday night, and she had a most interesting guest on.
Reid was joined by Marco Gutierrez, founder of Latinos for Trump.
The subject was Trump s immigration plan, but it quickly devolved into a situation of the man being racist against his own people.While trying to pimp and sell Trump s very hardline immigration stance, Gutierrez warned of his dominant and imposing culture, and how it will take over the United States if we don t do things Trump s way.
He said: We need to understand this is a different time and we re having problems here.
Reid, being the tough interviewer that she is, cut him off and asked, What problems are you talking about?
That s when Gutierrez responded with a shockingly racist stereotype: My culture is a very dominant culture.
And it s imposing, and it s causing problems.
If you don t do something about it, you gonna have taco trucks on every corner.
This takes self-loathing to a whole new level.
This poor guy has bought the anti-immigrant line about the brown people taking over America hook, line, and sinker.
Sad, but true.As for the Trump campaign they really need to start screening their surrogates before letting them loose on the airwaves.
If they are looking to reach wider communities, this is definitely NOT the way to do it.Watching the exchange below:#TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner #inners pic.twitter.com/EEtCG5tWtV All In w/Chris Hayes (@allinwithchris) September 2, 2016And here is the entire interview:Featured image via video screen capture
