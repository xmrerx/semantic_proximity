House of Cards star Kevin Spacey, who plays the fictional character President Frank Underwood, sat down with CNBC International on Thursday and just couldn t avoid getting asked questions concerning the 2016 presidential election.
Chief among them was a question about what would happen if Donald Trump ever had to debate Frank Underwood.Here is the answer he gave, which drew quite a bit of laughter: He wouldn t (debate Underwood).
There would be a terrible accident, on the way to the debate.
It would be terrible, and very sad.
If that wasn t funny enough, he followed that up with his best Trump impersonation: I m huuuge.
I m too huge for this church.
Spacey is currently making rounds across the globe promoting the new upcoming season of House of Cards, which airs in March.
He was also asked this very same question at the annual SkyBridge Capital reception hosted at a piano bar just a day earlier.
He says he often gets asked the question of what would happen if Frank Underwood had to debate Trump, who would win?
I thought about this and I said, We must remember one important distinction, one of these characters is a fictional character, and the other is a fictional character.'
It turns out he s used this line in the past often.
Probably the best and most elaborate answer he s ever provided is from a Q & A session with CNN he did back in September.
Oh, I think Underwood (would win).
He (would win) because he would kill Donald Trump.
Trump would never make it to election day.
It d be over, done.I think it would be great if Donald Trump started a feud with a fictional character, because maybe for once it would be a fair fight.
Perhaps Trump will appear in season 5 of House of Cards next year after he loses the real U.S. election this November.
He is, after all, a TV personality.
It s not too far-fetched that Trump could be a rival of Frank Underwood one day.Featured image via screen capture.
