( reuters ) - zimbabwe s new president emmerson mnangagwa dropped his education minister , a day after reappointing him to a cabinet which gave top posts to senior military officials in what was widely seen as a reward for the army s role in the removal of his predecessor , robert mugabe .
mnangagwa made other changes to the cabinet that his chief secretary misheck sibanda called adjustments to ensure compliance with the constitution and considerations of gender , demography and special needs .
under the zimbabwean constitution , ministers and their deputies have to be members of parliament , except five who can be chosen for their professional skills and competence .
mnangagwa had named as ministers seven people , including major-general sibusiso moyo as foreign minister and marshall perrance shiri to the sensitive land portfolio , who are not lawmakers .
he replaced primary and higher education minister lazaraus dokora with his deputy paul mavima .
dokora s reappointment had caused an outcry from zimbabweans on social media and radio shows who slammed him for poor performance and undermining the country s education system .
he also named zanu-pf lawmaker petronella kagonye to the labor and social welfare portfolio , replacing university professor clever nyathi who was appointed special advisor in the president s office on national peace and reconciliation .
chris mutsvanga , leader of the powerful war veterans association and who was named media , information and broadcast minister , has also been appointed special advisor to the president .
sworn in as president last friday after 93-year-old mugabe quit in the wake of a de facto military coup , mnangagwa s cabinet drew criticisms from analysts and zimbabweans who had expected a more broad-based lineup that marked a break from the mugabe era .
