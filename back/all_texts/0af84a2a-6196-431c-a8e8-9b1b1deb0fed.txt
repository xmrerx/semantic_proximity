Sean Spicer might be in a little bit of a trouble after an off-camera Wednesday press briefing.
Though President* Trump and Spicer himself have been pushing The Donald s baseless conspiracy theory that President Obama tapped the wires at Trump Tower, Spicer accidentally admitted they were just making sh*t up.
There is no reason that we should that we have to think that the President is the target of any investigation whatsoever, Spicy told reporters just minutes after he implied that he was unsure if the President was the target of a counter-intelligence investigation.
I think that s what we need to find out.
There s obviously a lot of concern, Spicer had said.
But at the end of the briefing, he was handed a sheet of paper, from which he read his revised answer verbatim.The wiretapping allegations, clearly intended to distract from and detract from any ongoing investigations into Team Trump s connections to Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, have become quite uncomfortable for Trump, who demanded that Congress waste time, resources, and effort looking into them, as just like everything else our alleged President says they are a lie one that is quickly getting out of hand.Last Thursday, Senators Lindsey Graham (R-SC) and Sheldon White House (D-RI) sent a letter tp the Justice Department asking for any evidence of Trump s ridiculous claim: We request that the Department of Justice provide us copies of any warrant applications and court orders redacted as necessary to protect intelligence sources and methods that may be compromised by disclosure, and to protect any ongoing investigations related to wiretaps of President Trump, the Trump Campaign, or Trump Tower.
All I can say is that the country needs an answer to this, Graham told CNN.
The current President has accused the former President of basically wiretapping his campaign.
Unfortunately, this is the norm for Donald Trump.
Whenever things get too uncomfortably close to the truth, he starts a political forest fire that distracts the nation long enough for everyone to forget about it or at least to provide Trump sufficient time to figure out how to explain away whatever the current issue is.It is imperative that our elected officials stop falling for this and keep their eyes on what really matters that we have a President whose staff both during the campaign and during his presidency was caught colluding with a hostile foreign power.Here s the video:Featured image via screengrab
