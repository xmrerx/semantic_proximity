lome ( reuters ) - security forces in togo fired bullets and teargas on thursday , wounding at least seven people as they sought to break up violent protests against the 50-year ruling family dynasty in the west african banking and transport hub .
activists have been demonstrating since august against president faure gnassingbe s refusal to give a clear date for stepping aside and to allow opposition parties to flourish in the region s only country that still does not accept presidential term limits .
a reuters cameraman saw trucks carrying armed paramilitary gendarmes drive into crowds and fire volleys of teargas .
protesters in the lome suburb of be , flanked by rundown buildings and palm trees , set up barricades , burned tyres and threw stones at the security forces .
we ve received seven people wounded by bullets so far , said a doctor at the social medical centre in be , where some were being wrapped in bandages .
the former french colony of 8 million people is home to several large firms , including ecobank and regional airline asky , and has undergone major port upgrades as the president has sought to turn the resource-poor nation into a commercial hub .
but a history of repression and the monopoly of power by one family - faure took power in 2005 upon the death of his father gnassingbe eyadema , who had ruled for 38 years - threaten its stability .
ghassingbe s opponents says reforms announced last month , in response to august s protests , will still allow him to run the west african country until 2030 .
