BERLIN (Reuters) - German Justice Minister Heiko Maas tweeted on Wednesday that the world would be a bit crazier after Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election.
“The world won’t end but it will get crazier,” tweeted the minister, a Social Democrat (SPD) in conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel’s right-left coalition.
