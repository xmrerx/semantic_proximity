WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman John McCain said on Monday he backed President-elect Donald Trump’s criticism of the costs of Lockheed Martin’s F-35 fighter jet program, but said a president does not have the authority to cancel it because funds have already been appropriated.
In an interview with Reuters, McCain, a leading Republican voice on national security and outspoken critic of Pentagon cost overruns, said, however, that Trump would have the power to reduce future purchases of the new-generation fighters if he decides to do so.
“He can reduce the buy over time, next year, as we look at it again,” McCain said.
“But right now, the acquisition … of lots of them is already taking place, and I’m happy to say at fixed-price contract.
The president, I’m sure, can examine it.”
