since the start of donald trump s presidential campaign , he s gone after pretty much every minority group there is .
along with his obvious and seemingly deliberate racism , he s also declared that he will deport all undocumented immigrants , mainly the ones he can tell by skin color .
in other words , latinos and muslims .
his words have been horrendous and have reached far and wide all across the united states.his words have even reached a young third grader , who seems to be taking an esl ( english as a second language ) course , and their teacher in ohio posted a letter the child wrote concerning donald trump to facebook for all the world to see .
why ?
because it s amazing.the letter reads , in its original grammar : i have a dream 2016 ! i have a dream that donald trump will not be president .
but if he does all asians , africans and mexicans have to go back to their contry .
without them the u.s.a. population will go down to 12,0000 people only .
most enginners are indian then their won t be no tecnolegy !
without tecnolgy theirs no netflix .
without netflix theirs no chill .
is that a world you what live in no .

they are a young child after all and hopefully they won t know the grown up meaning to that phrase til much later in life.however , the point is still made that if we as a nation degrade , look down upon , or worse deport minorities , we ll be doing ourselves a great disservice .
the united states of america is a nation of immigrants , it s kind of our thing .
it makes us who we are , and we can cultivate the best and brightest to build a better future.so to answer the question again , no , we don t want to live in a world with donald trump as president .
