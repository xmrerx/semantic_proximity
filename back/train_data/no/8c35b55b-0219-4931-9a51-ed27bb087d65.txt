hanoi ( reuters ) - china on wednesday dismissed vietnamese condemnation of its military live-fire exercises in the disputed south china sea , saying it was acting within its sovereign rights .
china conducted the drills around the paracel islands , which vietnam claims , prompting vietnam to say it would resolutely protect its legitimate rights through peaceful means .
chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told a regular briefing that china had done nothing wrong .
we hope the relevant side can regard the drills calmly and reasonably , he said , without elaborating .
china claims nearly all the south china sea , through which an estimated $ 3 trillion in international trade passes each year .
brunei , malaysia , the philippines and taiwan also have claims .
tension between china and neighboring vietnam is at its highest in three years over the disputed waters .
vietnam suspended oil drilling in offshore waters that are also claimed by china in july under pressure from beijing .
china has appeared uneasy at vietnam s efforts to rally southeast asian countries over the south china sea as well as at its growing defense relationships with the united states , japan and india .
