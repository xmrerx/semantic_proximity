moscow ( reuters ) - the russian communist party on saturday unexpectedly dropped its veteran leader gennady zyuganov as its presidential candidate to challenge president vladimir putin next year , choosing instead a largely unknown businessman with links to the farm sector .
zyuganov , 73 , an evergreen of the post-soviet political scene , had been widely expected to contest his sixth consecutive presidential election next march .
but instead the party picked pavel grudinin , 57 , a mechanical engineer who has run a farm on the outskirts of moscow since the mid-1990s , as its candidate to take on putin in an election which the 65-year-old kremlin leader is expected to win comfortably .
zyuganov congratulated grudinin on his nomination at an annual gathering of the party on saturday , the communist party said on its website .
by ditching one of the communist old guard as candidate and choosing someone from a new generation , the party appeared to be attempting to widen its political appeal .
its main support base has been from an age group that is fast disappearing .
speaking at the meeting where grudinin was nominated , zyuganov said voter apathy , which many independent analysts say is on the rise , was now russia s biggest misfortune .
the communists came second after the ruling party united russia , which backs putin , in parliamentary elections in 2016 - but winning only 19.2 percent of the vote .
separately on saturday , united russia pledged its full support for putin in what is expected to be a one-sided presidential contest .
