manila ( reuters ) - four people were killed and seven were missing after a philippine ferry with 251 people on board capsized during bad weather on thursday near the capital , manila , disaster officials and a coastguard spokesman said .
accidents involving boats sailing between the many islands of the philippines are common .
vessels are often overloaded but the coastguard said that was not the case on thursday and the ferry had the capacity to carry 286 people .
a total of 240 people were rescued from the sea by fishermen and rescue boats sent out by the coastguard hours after the ferry capsized and sank , about eight miles off real town in quezon province .
search and rescue operations will continue until all crew and passengers are accounted for , said coastguard spokesman captain armand balilo .
most of the rescued passengers were brought to dinahican port .
two men and two women drowned , he said .
the ferry set sail at around dawn from a port in real .
survivors told reporters the weather turned bad three hours later with strong winds and huge waves .
the ferry began taking in water and in minutes it capsized and sank , they said .
disaster officials said search and rescue operations were hampered by heavy rain and huge waves caused by a tropical storm affecting the southern philippines .
a tropical storm is expected to make landfall on the southern island of mindanao late thursday or early on friday .
the weather bureau has warned of extensive flooding and landslides as the storm , packing center winds of 65 kph ( 40 mph ) , approaches the philippines .
