More than 21,000 people from all regions of the world participated in the Best Countries survey, in which they assessed how closely they associated 80 countries with specific characteristics.
Four of these economically stable, good job market, income equality and is a place I would live were included in the Best Countries to Be an Immigrant ranking.Countries also were scored in relation to others on the share of migrants in their population; the amount of remittances the migrants they host sent home; and graded on a United Nations assessment of integration measures provided for immigrants, such as language training and transfers of job certifications, and the rationale behind current integration policies.

NOT assimilation!
ed]Note how important remittances are!
Those are dollars sent out of the host economy and I will bet a buck that any economic study that seeks to justify migration benefits to a country, NEVER factors in how much of the migrants earnings (or their welfare payments!)
are sent OUT of the country (and thus lost to the host country s economy!).
