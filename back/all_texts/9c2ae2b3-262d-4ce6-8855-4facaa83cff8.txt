Trump is off and running now, and I m here to confirm,There ll be a lot of changes by the end of his first term.
Let s put the turbulence on hold and have a little fun .
.
.
Here s my look at where we ll be in 2021.Trump s been re-elected with another strong campaign, Defeating Oprah Winfrey and her running mate .
.
.
McCain.
The wall has been completed and Obamacare is dead.
America is great again .
.
.
just like the Donald said.The president would not allow a migrant infestation, So, coastal California has become a separate nation.
They opened up their borders and adopted the Quran, Made Ashley Judd their leader .
.
.
and they called it Libastan.With Libastan seceding .
.
.
and the lipstick off the pig, Waters and Pelosi had to find another gig.
They both went into acting and received a handsome fee, For starring in the new release of Dumb and Dumber 3 .NBC and CNN have all but gone away.
The day fake news was outlawed .
.
.
they had nothing left to say.
They doubled down on Trump and non-existent Russian spies.
Now, Chuck Todd is at McDonalds .
.
.
in the drive-up serving fries.And, wacky Rachel Maddow still has all the breaking news, Like the loss of the Titanic .
.
.
and the death of Howard Hughes.
Tonight, she has a bombshell scoop that s sure to make her shine .
.
.

Trump got a parking ticket back in 1989.Hillary has settled down with roommate Cheryl Mills.
She keeps a secret server in their cell at Bedford Hills.
There s little cause to worry on her 20-year vacation , She had Slick Willy neutered prior to incarceration.Al Gore waits for the ice to melt outside his padded room.
An inconvenient outcome for his prophecy of doom.
The world no longer buys the hoax that he has tried to sell em.
The only thing that s melting is his unused cerebellum.For years, we ve speculated on the mental health of Schumer.
The doctors then announced that in his butt there was a tumor.
All the surgeons gathered round, and despite initial dread, When they looked a little closer, they could see it was his head.Fauxcahontas Warren has been banished by her tribe.
She spent her people s wampum, and accepted heap big bribe.
They say she spoke with forked tongue, and did some crazy deeds.
She traded Massachusetts for a blanket and some beads.The pigment-challenged Dolezal is back to being white.
Despite a valiant effort, she proved all her critics right.
Three decades in a tanning booth .
.
.
she failed at getting blacker.
Everybody knows you don t put chocolate on a cracker.There s lots of stars in Tinseltown no longer on the clock.
The earthquake they called Trump created quite an aftershock.
Then came a tsunami of depression and despair, The kind of feeling we all get when we see Whoopi s hair.Entertainment s better now that Hollywood is gone.
Billy Ray has moved away .
.
.
likewise, his demon spawn.
Yes, Miley pledged allegiance to the U.K. s Union Jack But, once the British got a taste .
.
.
they tried to give her back.Rosie still plays Bannon for the skits on SNL.
She bears a close resemblance .
.
.
too much time at Taco Bell.
She s mean and unappealing, and to use a metaphor .
.
.
She looks like the result of cloning Slash with Michael Moore.Yes, the snowflakes are all melting and their binkies laid to waste.
A fortune spent on therapy and loyalties misplaced.
Now the country s being run by those that they deplore.
There may not be a snowflake left by 2024.This poem (America 2021) is republished here with permission and attribution to author Tony Olson About the Author: Tony Olson is an American journalist, poet and bestselling author.
