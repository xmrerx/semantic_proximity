Right-wing morons everywhere are panicking about what will happen to the Supreme Court now that notoriously bigoted Justice Antonin Scalia has died.
Of course, immediately this became a political situation before the man s body was even cold, and with politics comes conspiracy theories.
One of the biggest theories out there among the Right is that President Obama had Scalia assassinated.
Of course, this absolutely ridiculous, but that holds no water with idiots.
What is, however, especially horrible is when widely read papers repeat this nonsense, which is just what the NY Post has just done.Citing a report from a supposed forensics expert, the paper ran a grossly irresponsible story saying that Scalia could have been poisoned.
Among other things, the Post said in its trashy article:Lethal poisoning could have left Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia s body in virtually the same condition in which it was found, a top forensic pathologist told The Post on Wednesday.
It would look like he s asleep.
It doesn t show anything on the body, said Dr. Michael Baden, who spent 25 years in the city s chief Medical Examiner s Office.The paper, of course, left out the fact that this forensics guy had no ties to examining Scalia at all, as well as the fact that his passing due to natural ailments was perfectly plausible, too.Well, considering the fact that the man was almost 80 years old, there s absolutely no reason for there to be suspicion that he didn t just die in his sleep.
In fact, he had already lived past the usual age for an American man.Whoever wrote this crap at the NY Post should be ashamed of themselves.
Then again, after seven years, we re used to the right wing blaming President Obama for literally everything, even things he couldn t have possibly had anything to do with.Featured image via Legal Geekery
