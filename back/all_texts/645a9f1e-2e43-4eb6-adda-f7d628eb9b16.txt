One has to wonder how anybody, with or without working brain cells, could stand Steve Bannon.
He s a complete ass, he s hateful, he s a white supremacist, he s overbearing, he s domineering, and he leads by fear instead of example.
During CPAC, Bannon and Trump s chief of staff, Reince Priebus, were up on stage for a joint interview when Bannon appeared to grab Priebus arm.What Priebus did, for all to see, should humiliate Bannon beyond reason.
He literally slapped Bannon off of him, while turning to look at the interviewer to whom they were speaking.
Watch it below:WEIRD!
Anyone Catch Bannon Grabbing Priebus and then his reaction?

Despite that, Priebus was trying to squelch rumors that there s a rivalry between the two of them, even though the media reports otherwise:[Priebus] said he and Bannon get along and work closely together we share an office suite together, we re basically together form 6:30 in the morning until 11 o clock at night, he said and that the 2016 election showed the Republican Party and the conservative movement can be united.That move, though, on Priebus part when Bannon touched him, suggests an already established pattern of dislike between them.
