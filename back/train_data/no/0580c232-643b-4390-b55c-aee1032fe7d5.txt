rome ( reuters ) - italy s ruling democratic party ( pd ) has lost support following its flop in a regional election in sicily , while silvio berlusconi s forza italia ( go italy ! )
has gained ground , according to a poll released on thursday .
national elections must be held by next may , with all recent opinion polls suggesting that it will end in a hung parliament .
ixe pollsters said backing for the center-left pd , which is led by former prime minister matteo renzi , dropped to 23.8 percent , down 3.6 percentage points from its last survey in mid-october .
the pd slump enabled the maverick 5-star movement to establish itself firmly as italy s most popular party , climbing to 27.9 percent from a previous 27.2 percent .
forza italia moved into third spot , rising to 15.5 percent from 13.6 percent and jumping ahead of its long-time ally , the far-right northern league , which dropped 1.6 percentage points to 13.5 percent .
under the terms of an electoral law approved last month , which allows the creation of multi-party coalitions ahead of the national elections , the center-right bloc is expected to emerge from the ballot box as the biggest single force .
the bloc won a regional vote in sicily on nov. 5 , with the victory seen as a personal triumph for berlusconi , who used the ballot to revive his political career after years of graft trials , sex scandals and ill-health .
the 5-star came second on the mediterranean island , with the pd limping in a distant third .
renzi s party has been beset by feuding and looks unlikely to reach any pre-election pact with myriad leftist groups , which have accused him of pushing the pd too far to the left .
the ixe poll suggested the center-right would take a combined 33.8 percent of the vote .
the bloc leaders have said whichever party wins the most votes will decide who should be its prime ministerial candidate .
