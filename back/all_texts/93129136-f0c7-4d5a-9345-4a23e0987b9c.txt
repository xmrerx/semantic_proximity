WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Monday condemned Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro s threat to ban opposition parties from participating in next year s presidential elections.
The Venezuelan people deserve the right to express their views and consent to governance through a free and fair democratic process that is open to all candidates, the department said in a statement.
After three opposition parties boycotted mayoral elections on Sunday, Maduro said on Monday they should be banned from participating in future elections.
