Don t mess with NASA because they will burn you.When a climate change denier made a comment on a post made by Bill Nye the Science Guy, he made a huge mistake by dragging NASA into his rant.Nye was mocking a climate change denier for refusing to take bets on whether climate change is real or not cause he knows what s up re: global temperatures.
Here s the post via Facebook.In response, a right-winger named Fer Morales made a complete ass of himself by disputing climate science by invoking NASA.
Morales attributed several of his claims to NASA, including one about how fossil fuels cool the planet.
Riiiiight, despite NASA confirming that fossil fuels are actually cooling the planet s temperature, and that there s more ice than in the last century in the polar caps.
And the fact that the so-called rises of the sea levels have not materialized, and that any real scientist doesn t back up man-made climate change at all, since it s a cycle that has existed even before we did.
Yep, solid science, leftards.
This didn t sit well with NASA Climate Change, which spotted Morales comment and brutally shut him down with a humiliating educational response.
Do not misrepresent NASA, NASA warned.
Fossil fuels are not cooling the planet.
Here s a screenshot of the exchange:And the humiliation just grew from there as other Facebook users cheered on NASA for smacking down an anti-science nut job.This was an epic shut down by NASA.
The fact that NASA actually took the time to respond is simply amazing.
But NASA was not done yet.
They also responded to two other right-wing idiots who accused the space agency of fudging the numbers and deleting data.
Then NASA proceeded to further educate everyone.Which led to this suggestion by another commenter.This is what it looks like when anti-science conservatives get owned.Featured image via NASA
