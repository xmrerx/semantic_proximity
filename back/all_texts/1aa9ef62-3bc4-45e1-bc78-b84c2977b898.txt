How bad is it in Venezuela?
People are eating one meal a day and the government is doing its best to cover up the humanitarian crisis.
We know about the toilet paper shortage but a food shortage is horrific.
The lines for pretty much everything have been very long.
There s a shortage of everything.
The bottom line is that SOCIALISM SUCKS!
