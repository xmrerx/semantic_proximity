University of Virginia professor and political scientist Larry Sabato has just released his map predicting the electoral vote outcome of the 2016 election, and it forecasts a blowout win for the Democratic Party.Based on the likely nominees being Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump, Sabato currently forecasts a 347-191 electoral college victory for Clinton.
Candidates need a majority of the 538 electoral votes in the United States to win, currently that number is 270.Sabato notes: Election analysts prefer close elections, but there was nothing we could do to make this one close.
The predicted map looks very similar to 2012 s electoral map, but with North Carolina flipping from Republican to Democrat.
In 2012, Mitt Romney won North Carolina, but just by 2.2%.Sabato also predicts a close race in other states that were previously Republican territory: Arizona, Missouri, Indiana, and Georgia.
Notably, President Obama won Indiana in 2008, and the large black population in Georgia has had many thinking it could soon become a swing state.Addressing the storyline that has surfaced in the media, that Trump could appeal to blue-collar voters in some states and flip Democratic votes, Sabato throws cold water on the idea:Trump supporters and some independent analysts assert that his appeal to many blue-collar whites in Rust Belt states (such as Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin) could pull these states electoral votes into the Republican column.
The problem is, there is little evidence that the non-college voters supporting Trump in the primaries are defectors from the Democrats; most have been backing GOP candidates fairly consistently, so the net addition for Trump could be small.Sabato is no random crank or egghead.
His Crystal Ball forecasts are highly cited and in the past he accurately predicted the results of the 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 elections within a few electoral votes or Senate/House races.In 2006 on MSNBC, anchor Lester Holt told Sabato, he predicted Democrats would pick up the six seats needed to take over the Senate.
It appears they have done just that you ve got an impressive record and I m going to call you later; we re going to go over stock picks.
So when he predicts a big electoral college win for the Democratic Party, Republicans should be very worried.Featured image via Public Domain
