White racists launched a war against State Farm insurance company for posting an image of a black man proposing to a white woman.Who said yes?
?Cheers to the newly engaged this holiday season!
Be sure to #ProtectTheBling!

@StateFarm and you thought the Geico cavemen were bad.
Never buying your crap again, State.

This is White Genocide k. rahekr (@krahekr) December 24, 2016Basically, this what happened to white racists when they saw State Farm s tweet.
@StateFarm insecure, racist white men when they saw this image.

While these racists are attacking State Farm, Republicans are busy trying to appease their racist base by trying to bring back interracial marriage bans.
Kentucky Republicans recently attempted to pass a law allowing discrimination against interracial couples.
It actually made it through the state Senate.In fact, a 2012 poll revealed that over 20 percent of Republican voters in Alabama (the home state of Trump a Attorney General pick Jeff Sessions) and Mississippi want interracial marriage to be illegal.Featured Image: Twitter
