The only mistake Hillary Clinton made when saying half of Trump s supporters are a basket of deplorables would be in the fact that the number was too low.
It would be safe to say at least two-thirds of Trump supporters are deplorable, racist, misogynistic, Islamophobic, and just outright horrible human beings deserved of reprimand.If you need further proof of this fact because maybe you ve been living in an underground bunker away from any and all ability to gain access to the news, just take a gander at this video compilation of unfiltered Trump supporters being the terrible people that they so naturally are.In this video you will hear racial slurs, derogatory language against women and minorities, as well as those going directly after President Obama, etc.
etc.
etc.Trump has made being a bigot socially acceptable to so many in our nation right now that it should make every person who has a soul in their body nauseous.Should Hillary have said what she said?
Probably not, but she wasn t wrong.Watch how absolutely deplorable Trump supporters are here: de plor able very bad in a way that causes shock, fear, or disgust : deserving censure or contempt pic.twitter.com/opU89omvRh shauna (@goldengateblond) September 10, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
