Patton Oswalt can really light Twitter up sometimes.
Three days ago, he was tweeting the #TrumpCantSwim hashtag and pretending that getting it trending was absolutely outrageous to him.
For reasons unknown, Martin Pharma Bro Shkreli decided to try and interrupt Oswalt s hashtag fun.
But all did not end well for him.
Oswalt took him down in a way that only Oswalt can.Here s the original tweet, along with Shkreli s lame attempt at insulting him:@pattonoswalt who r u again Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) September 6, 2016Oswalt hit back: why r u ever https://t.co/yERoMuOxDk Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) September 6, 2016Shkreli, at this point, tried to puff up his chest:@pattonoswalt da best Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) September 6, 2016Really?
That s all he had?
Yes.
Well, no, but Shkreli isn t very good at this.
In fact, he just plain sucks at it: Nope.
Now run along, live your life & die wealthy yet confused by how empty you feel in those last seconds.

Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) September 6, 2016 This was where Martin lost, BTW.
https://t.co/jBB2cUOG4R Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) September 6, 2016And just when you thought it was over, Shkreli came crawling back with his tail tucked between his legs the next day, but Oswalt wasn t having it at all:Wanted to say I m sorry for your tragedy & wish you the best.
@pattonoswalt I m in healthcare to help people whether you believe it or not.
Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) September 6, 2016 I don t & you passive-aggressively bringing my deceased wife into a Twitter fight shows what a coffin-worm you are.
https://t.co/oU6VV4ar1X Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) September 6, 2016@pattonoswalt I m truly sorry for your loss & not P.A.
It s a profound tragedy and the fact that so many people adore you is admirable.
Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) September 6, 2016 Don t even trying pulling this faux-concerned wronged hero shit with me now.
Fuck off.
We re done.
https://t.co/xbJQvJfvwy Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) September 6, 2016@pattonoswalt Separately, I help the sick.
I respect it may not seem that way I ll let history decide, even if it s not in my favor today.
Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) September 6, 2016 You ll let history decide .
Good for you, Galileo!
In the present?
You re a pillbug with a soul full of pus.
Bye.
https://t.co/zmo9sk2rAm Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) September 6, 2016@pattonoswalt I m sorry you won t hear from me again.
Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) September 6, 2016 First true thing you ve ever said to me.
https://t.co/fqMdQ25zoi Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) September 6, 2016But it still wasn t over!
The Avengers Chris Evans got in on the fun and tweeted a compliment to Oswalt over this, which sent Shkreli off into the ether with apoplectic fits:@pattonoswalt owning @MartinShkreli is my favorite thing on Twitter right now.
Chris Evans (@ChrisEvans) September 7, 2016 Thank you, Captain!
https://t.co/lKecDxnZDp Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) September 7, 2016 Come to Brooklyn and I ll introduce you to the real Captain America and a couple of fuckin roundhouses if you say my name again @ChrisEvans Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) September 7, 2016.
@ChrisEvans gonna respond with you re going to roundhouse those drug prices or some dumb shit and 1 mil liberals are gonna scream owned Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) September 7, 2016 I have fucking soldiers if u wanna talk shit you have to speak with the rank and file first.
Chain-of-command in these streets.
Where s Milo Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) September 7, 2016I m so fuckin pissed I m gonna do some Muai Thai Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) September 7, 2016At the time of this posting, Evans hadn t responded to this.
Regardless, someone really shouldn t let Twitter get to them this way.
Shkreli may well need some drugs his price-gouging pharmaceutical company makes soon, providing they make anything to deal with all the side effects of perpetual anger.
He can t acknowledge that he got owned, and he has to have the last word.
Otherwise his fragile little ego gets irreparably bruised.Featured image by Mark Wilson/Getty Images
