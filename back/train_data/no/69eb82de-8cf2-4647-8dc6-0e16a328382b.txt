sao paulo ( reuters ) - brazil s finance minister henrique meirelles insisted on monday that he is not planning to run for president and told a business meeting he could consider being a vice presidential running mate .
but he later told reporters that it was just a joke and he was too busy working on the recovery of the brazilian economy as minister to consider the presidential race next october .
meirelles , whose political fortunes are expected to rise as the brazilian economy recovers from its worst recession , said he had been asked to be a vice presidential candidate in 2010 and 2014 and found the position interesting .
meirelles said he expected brazil s gdp to grow at least 2 percent next year and the strengthening economy had created more than 1 million jobs so far this year .
inflation slowing to below bottom-end of the official target range will allow the central bank room to cut interest rates further , meirelles added .
if brazil s congress fails to approve the reform of the pension system proposed by the government , the task will be the first challenge of the next president who will take office jan 1 , 2019 .
