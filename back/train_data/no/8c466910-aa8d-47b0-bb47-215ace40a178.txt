former english defence league leader tommy robinson went to town on a reporter today after he was interrupted in the midst of a rebel media interview at the scene of the london terror attack.robinson was speaking with rebel media s caolan robertson on the unsurprising nature of the incident in light of the suspected perpetrator s identity being released .
this isn t a shock to me , said robinson .
i don t understand people who are surprised by this .
we have over 3,000 muslims who are monitored 24 hours a day 7 days a week at a cost of nine billion [ pounds ] a year .
we re following them , waiting for them to do this .
as robinson continued to rant , a crowd apparently formed around him and began filming .
among them was a reporter who quickly took the offense against robinson .
do you have information that no one else seems to have ?
inquired the reporter .
i have information that shows there was four terrorist attacks last week in france , shot back robinson .
there was 12 planned last year .
driving your car like this man has done is exactly what the inspire magazine , which is al qaeda s magazine , which was downloaded by 50,000 british muslims last year 50,000 british muslims downloaded a terrorist manual .
