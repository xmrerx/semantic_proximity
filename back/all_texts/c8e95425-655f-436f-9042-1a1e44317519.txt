Donald Trump treated Americans who oppose him as the enemy on Saturday and delivered the most divisive speech ever given by a president.Rather than attend the White House Correspondents Dinner, Trump skipped the event instead to hold a rally in Pennsylvania where he displayed the kind of pettiness and divisiveness that are unprecedented in presidential history.
It s time for all of us to remember that we are one people with one great American destiny, and that whether we are black or brown or white, we all bleed the same red blood of patriots, and we all share the same glorious freedoms of our magnificent country, Trump said, suggesting that Americans who oppose him are not patriots.Trump also bragged about the size of his crowd, despite the fact that it was not a record, and bragged about his achievements in his first 100 days even though he has been a complete failure who has done nothing but sign tyrannical executive orders and play golf while having no major legislation reach the Oval Office desk.Indeed, Trump s attempt to repeal the popular Affordable Care Act failed spectacularly and his executive orders on immigration have been blocked by the courts.Trump also treated a protester like shit at the rally, ordering security to get him out of here, as Nazis stood by in approval.Trump speech was not presidential.
It was meant strictly to pander to his vile base of deplorable supporters who still supoort him no matter how much he lies or how much he destroys our country.And David Gergen, who served as an adviser to Nixon, Ford, and Reagan, trashed Trump s disturbing speech.
This was the most divisive speech I have ever heard from a sitting American president, Gergen said.
Others may disagree about that.
He played to his base and he treated his other listeners, the rest of the people who have been disturbed about him or opposed him, he treated them basically as, I don t give a damn what you think because you re frankly like the enemy.
I thought it was a deeply disturbing speech.
Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump should be impeached and everything he has done should be reversed and erased as if he never held office.
He should also be put in prison for colluding with Russia, attempting to sabotage the United States, and violating the Constitution.
Acting like a hateful and vengeful dictator should not be tolerated in this country.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
