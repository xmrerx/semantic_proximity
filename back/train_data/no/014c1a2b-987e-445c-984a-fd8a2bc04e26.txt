anthropologist fuambai ahmadu appeared on tucker carlson to defend female genital mutilation .
her shocking commentary and acceptance of this horrible cultural ritual left us in shock .
are there really people out there who consider this to be in any way similar to male circumcision ?
she tries to conflate the two but only makes tucker carlson wince .
i don t identify with the term fgm with the term mutilation , i don t know anybody in my family that does or my community .
and from over 25 years of research i ve done in the field , i would say the great majority of women who are affected by what i call female circumcision practices do not see themselves as mutilated .
anthropologist fuambai ahmadu what she s really saying in the comment above is that because everyone she knows thinks this is ok , then we all need to accept it https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=zkytu7m95pq
