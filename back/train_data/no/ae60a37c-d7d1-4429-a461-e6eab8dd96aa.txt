brussels ( reuters ) - the european union is seeking to reopen its embassy in libya pending security conditions , officials said on tuesday , offering further political support for the tripoli government struggling to establish control .
eu leaders will announce at their summit in brussels on oct. 19-20 that they encourage work underway to rapidly establish a permanent eu presence in libya , according to their draft joint statement seen by reuters .
but the statement makes clear no such move is imminent as it would be conditional on improving the security situation on the ground .
the eu moved its mission to neighboring tunisia in mid-2014 as security worsened in libya amid escalating fighting between rival factions since the 2011 fall of longtime leader muammar gaddafi , ousted by rebels during a nato bombing campaign .
of 28 eu states , only italy , libya s former colonial master and still the most influential european state on the ground , has an embassy in the country , where the united nations has officially recognized the government of fayez seraj .
the eu has also engaged increasingly with seraj , especially as it sought libya s help in curbing the flow of african refugees and migrants , hundreds of thousands of whom have been boarding smugglers boats on the coast of the lawless state to cross the mediterranean for europe .
the bloc has financed , equipped and trained libya s border and coast guards , despite rights groups sounding alarm over grave abuses refugees and migrants suffer in libya .
