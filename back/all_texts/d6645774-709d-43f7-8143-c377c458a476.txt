Kellyanne Conway is not taking Russian interference in our political process seriously, so CNN host Kate Bolduan called her out for it.During an interview on Thursday night, Bolduan asked Conway about Donald Trump s reaction to President Obama slapping sanctioned against Russia, including the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats, in retaliation for hacking the DNC and meddling in the election on Trump s behalf.Trump insisted that we move on and blamed computers instead of the Russians for the attack because computers have complicated our lives greatly.
Conway, as usual, brushed off the question and began whining about the New York Times and Hillary Clinton all while once again claiming that Trump won a huge victory.
She also accused President Obama of hitting the Russians with sanctions as a political maneuver against Trump.Let s not forget that Clinton won the popular vote and Trump electoral win is one of the smallest margins of victory in the last 100 years.But while President Obama s actions against Russia may make it harder for Trump to kiss Putin s ass, it s hardly politically motivated.
The CIA and 17 other intelligence agencies agree that Russia interfered in our election, and there needed to be consequences because Trump sure as hell was not going to do anything about it himself.Conway, however, continued her obsession with talking about Hillary Clinton to dodge Bolduan s questions and whined about people questioning Trump s legitimacy, which forced Bolduan to call Conway out for not taking the Russian hacking seriously.
This is serious, Bolduan said.
This is about a foreign country hacking into the United States electoral process.
Regardless, it doesn t even have to do with the result, even.
It is more that they tried to and did.
Conway replied by blaming the DNC for the hack instead of the Russians who did the hacking and then proceeded to accuse the intelligence community of trying to interfere with the election results.Here s the video via YouTube:It sure sounds like there will be a lot of friction between Trump s team and the intelligence community, and frankly, they should tell Trump he s on his own.
Because you know he s going to blame them for whatever happens anyway.Featured image via screenshot
