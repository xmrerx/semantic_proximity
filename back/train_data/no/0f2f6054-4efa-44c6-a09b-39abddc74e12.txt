madrid ( reuters ) - spanish prime minister mariano rajoy on friday ruled out calling a national election after catalan separatists won a regional vote , thwarting his bid to resolve the country s biggest political crisis in decades .
rajoy had gambled on unionist parties taking control of catalonia s regional government , which he sacked in october for illegally pursuing independence from spain .
rajoy , speaking at a news conference , said he would make an effort to hold talks with the new catalan government .
however , he did not clarify whether he would be willing to meet deposed catalan president carles puigdemont , who is in self-imposed exile in brussels and whose party retained its position as the largest separatist force .
