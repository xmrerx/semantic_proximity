WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said, if elected, she would use executive action to end a tax loophole for wealthy Americans, according to an interview with USA Today on Wednesday.
Clinton said that if Congress did not act, she would ask the Treasury Department to use its authority to end the tax advantage, known as the carried interest loophole, which allows hedge-fund managers to pay a lower rate than other taxpayers by counting their income as investment income.
