mexico city ( reuters ) - mexican president enrique pena nieto on friday asked senate lawmakers to include civil society s views in their discussion of a divisive bill that critics say would give the military greater powers and deepen its role in the country s drug war .
the bill , which enjoys cross-partisan support , aims to regulate federal defense forces involvement in the drug war , which has claimed well over 100,000 lives in the last decade .
but the united nations , amnesty international and mexican human rights organization have all criticized the bill for prioritizing the military instead of seeking to improve mexico s police .
pena nieto s unusual comments reflect the growing international pressure his government has come under over .
i d like to make a call to the senate to broaden the space for dialogue with civil society organizations in order to hear all voices and enrich what will eventually be decided , the president said at a human rights event in mexico city .
the bill has already passed the lower house , and is due to be discussed in the senate next week , but could potentially be delayed in the wake of pena nieto s comments .
lawmakers who support the bill say it will give clear rules that limit the use of soldiers to fight crime .
however , rights campaigners worry the law opens the door to military intervention in protests , as well as expanding military powers to spy on citizens .
it is opposed by the party of leftist presidential frontrunner andres manuel lopez obrador , which has only a handful of senators .
the bill comes during a particularly violent year , with the 2017 murder tally almost certain to be the highest since modern records began twenty years ago .
