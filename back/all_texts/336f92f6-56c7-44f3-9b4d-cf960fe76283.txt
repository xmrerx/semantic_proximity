Yesterday, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was forced to leave the 9/11 memorial in New York City after falling ill.Although there was a perfectly reasonable explanation for why the former Secretary of State had to leave the event early (she was diagnosed with pneumonia), anti-Clinton conspiracy theorists have been working overtime to smear Clinton s name after she reappeared out of her daughter Chelsea s apartment not too long after being pushed into a car by her security team.
This had wannabe online detectives going nuts and analyzing the photos, which lead to the #HillarysBodyDouble hashtag being created on Twitter and who else would love to jump on this bandwagon more than Donald Trump lover Scott Baio?
!Baio, who has had it out for Clinton for some time, did his best to further the conspiracy theory, and got a bit of karma in the process.
Not only did Baio fail miserably in making Clinton look bad, but he managed to make HIMSELF look like a complete dumba** in the process.
In a tweet, the actor mentioned an actress who is known for her amazing Clinton impersonations, calling her out: Does anyone know the whereabouts of this woman today?
Was she in NYC?
Lol TwitterThe woman Baio is talking about is Teresa Barnwell, whose website hillaryclintonimpersonator.com boasts the actress ability to be a near spitting image of the former Secretary of State.
Here s a screenshot of her homepage:Teresa BarnwellBut of course, just like his favorite presidential candidate, Baio hadn t bothered to actually check the facts and do his research (sound familiar?).
If he had only checked Barnwell s Twitter account that day, he would have known not to ask.
The actress tweeted Baio back, shutting his whole conspiracy down: I m in Los Angeles today.
Not in NYC!
TwitterWhat an idiot.
It s great that Barnwell personally responded to Baio, and told him to shut the f*ck up in her own special way!Featured image via screenshot
