maiduguri , nigeria ( reuters ) - nigeria is replacing the military commander of the fight against boko haram after half a year , an army spokesman said on wednesday , following a string of insurgency attacks despite years of official claims the group has almost been defeated .
the shake-up underscores the fragility of the security situation in nigeria s northeast , where the conflict with the islamist insurgent group is now in its ninth year , despite assertions by president muhammadu buhari s administration that it is on its last legs .
a military spokesman confirmed the replacement of ibrahim attahiru , theater commander of the operation against boko haram , in a text message to reuters .
major general rogers nicholas will take his position .
the spokesman did not provide further details .
attahiru s removal comes in the wake of a series of embarrassing attacks , two military sources told reuters .
they said the conduct of the war against the insurgents is now being reviewed .
the attacks , which occurred during attahiru s command , include the kidnapping of members of an oil prospecting team which led to at least 37 people being killed in july , and deadly assaults on the towns of magumeri , biu and madagali , the sources said .
a spokesman for the president , who serves as nigeria s commander-in-chief , declined to comment .
the governor of borno state , which is at the epicenter of the insurgency , has said the government s long-term plan now is to corral civilians inside fortified garrison towns - effectively ceding the countryside to boko haram .
that plan and the spate of deadly attacks have raised questions about assertions by the government and military that boko haram has been all but wiped out , as well as doubts about nigeria s ability to retain sovereign integrity in the northeast .
