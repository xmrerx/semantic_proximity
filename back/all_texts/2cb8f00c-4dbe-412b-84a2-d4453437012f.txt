WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States expects business as usual at ports of entry when fresh rules on U.S. President Donald Trump’s travel ban on citizens from six Muslim-majority nations goes into effect at 8 p.m. Eastern Time, senior U.S. officials said on Thursday.
“We expect business as usual at the ports of entry starting at 8 pm tonight,” one official told reporters on a conference call about implementing a Supreme Court ruling allowing parts of the travel ban to take effect.
A second official that a “formal assurance” from a U.S. resettlement agency to a refugee would not in and of itself be enough to exempt a refugee from a 120-day ban on entry also imposed by Trump’s travel ban executive order.
