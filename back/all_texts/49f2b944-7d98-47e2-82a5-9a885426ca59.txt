Superstar actress and international humanitarian Angelina Jolie spoke out about Donald Trump s hateful speech that is the central premise of his entire presidential campaign.
Speaking at an event in London organized by the BBC about the ongoing Syrian migration crisis, Jolie was asked to respond to Trump s comments on Muslims.Trump has said that if elected president he would enact a ban on Muslim migration to the United States and would also consider a program to track Muslims within the country.The very idea repulsed Jolie:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_juLMpLPORw To me, America is built on people from around the world coming together for freedoms, especially freedom of religion.
So it s hard to hear this is coming from someone who is pressing to be an American president.
Jolie has served for several years as Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees.
Unlike a lot of celebrities who just talk about global issues, she has actually gone to inhospitable areas including war zones, using the intense media spotlight on her to get coverage of humanitarian and social crises.She recently visited Syrian families currently settled in Lebanon, and asked world leaders to step up and do more to help these people who are innocent victims of the ongoing Syrian civil war.When President Obama announced that the United States would pursue strategies to admit more refugees, several Republican leaders panicked.
Some in Congress sought to pass legislation barring refugees while some Republican governors announced that they would not allow refugees into their states but it isn t up to them, and they actually don t have any legal recourse to block refugees from coming in to America.Jolie also addressed this unwarranted fear at her event today as well, noting: Fear of uncontrolled migration has eroded public confidence and the ability of governments and international institutions to control the situation.
It has given space to a false air of legitimacy to those who promote politics of fear and separation.
