What s happening in Oregon isn t, by any means, an act of patriotism or the duty of citizens.
What s happening in Oregon is a temper tantrum, and nothing short of treason.
This seditious behavior is quite illegal, and the United States Constitution explicitly states that a well regulated militia can be used against insurrections, not in the allowance of such horrific behavior.In Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution, it states: To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress; The founders use of civilian militias was not one to overthrow the government if citizens felt they were being wronged, it was to protect the union from insurrectionists who were a threat to the nation.How did they make sure these militias were well regulated and armed in case of insurrection, invasion, or to maintain the law of the land?
With this thing called the Second Amendment: A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.
See how everything pieces together when you don t just cherry pick the parts of the Constitution you want to make sure every dimwitted Tom, Dick or Sally is armed to the teeth.
The purpose of the militias was to protect the newly formed government.
And while dissent is patriotic, sedition is not.
If you don t like how the government is being run, we have this glorious thing in the United States called democracy and we re able to vote for who writes our laws.What s happening in Oregon, by definition, is exactly treason.
It could also be considered a Seditious conspiracy.
If two or more persons in any State or Territory, or in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, conspire to overthrow, put down, or to destroy by force the Government of the United States, or to levy war against them, or to oppose by force the authority thereof, or by force to prevent, hinder, or delay the execution of any law of the United States, or by force to seize, take, or possess any property of the United States contrary to the authority thereof, they shall each be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than twenty years, or both.
These patriots need to be locked up for a good long time.If you still question the intent of the Founding Fathers effort to thwart insurrection, please take note of the Whiskey Rebellion.
Not much unlike what s happening in Oregon with pissed off farmers, the government imposed an excise tax on distilled spirits, which these farmers decided to rebel against.
Well, President George Washington called forth the use of the militia to stop the insurrection and this refusal to follow the law.
In fact, here is the transcript of his proclamation from September 25, 1794: Whereas, from a hope that the combinations against the Constitution and laws of the United States, in certain of the Western counties of Pennsylvania, would yield to time and reflection, I thought it sufficient, in the first instance, rather to take measures for calling forth the militia than immediately to embody them; but the moment is now come, when the overtures of forgiveness, with no other condition than a submission to law, have been only partially accepted; when every form of conciliation not inconsistent with the being of Government has been adopted, without effect; when the well-disposed in those counties are unable by their influence and example to reclaim the wicked from their fury, and are compelled to associate in their own defence; when the proffered lenity has been perversely misinterpreted into an apprehension that the citizens will march with reluctance; when the opportunity of examining the serious consequences of a treasonable opposition has been employed in propagating principles of anarchy, endeavoring through emissaries to alienate the friends of order from its support, and inviting enemies to perpetrate similar acts of insurrection; when it is manifest, that violence would continue to be exercised upon every attempt to enforce the laws; when, therefore, Government is set at defiance, the contest being whether a small proportion of the United States shall dictate to the whole Union, and, at the expense of those who desire peace, indulge a desperate ambition;Now, therefore, I, George Washington, President of the United States, in obedience to that high and irresistible duty, consigned to me by the Constitution, to take care that the laws be faithfully executed; deploring that the American name should be sullied by the outrages of citizens on their: own Government; commiserating such as remain obstinate from delusion; but resolved, in perfect reliance on that gracious Providence which so signally displays its goodness towards this country, to reduce the refractory to a due subordination to the laws; do hereby declare and make known, that, with a satisfaction which can be equalled only by the merits of the militia summoned into service from the States of New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, I have received intelligence of their patriotic alacrity, in obeying the call of the present, though painful, yet commanding necessity; that a force, which, according to every reasonable expectation, is adequate to the exigency, is already in motion to the scene of disaffection; that those who have confided or shall confide in the protection of Government, shall meet full succor under the standard and from the arms of the United States; that those who having offended against the laws have since entitled themselves to indemnity, will be treated with the most liberal good faith, if they shall not have forfeited their claim by any subsequent conduct, and that instructions are given accordingly.And I do, moreover, exhort all individuals, officers, and bodies of men, to contemplate with abhorrence the measures leading directly or indirectly to those crimes, which produce this resort to military coercion; to check, in their respective spheres, the efforts of misguided or designing men to substitute their misrepresentation in the place of truth, and their discontents in the place of stable government; and to call to mind, that as the people of the United States have been permitted, under the Divine favor, in perfect freedom, after solemn deliberation, in an enlightened age, to elect their own Government, so will their gratitude for this inestimable blessing be best distinguished by firm exertions to maintain the Constitution and the laws.And, lastly, I again warn all persons, whomsoever and whersoever, not to abet, aid, or comfort the insurgents aforesaid, as they will answer the contrary at their peril; and I do also require all officers and other citizens, according to their several duties, as far as may be in their power, to bring under the cognizance of the law all offenders in the premises.
If there were such a thing as a mic drop in the day, it would have hit the floor with the strength of a thunderous boom.Honestly?
Washington s words could be said today in the same regard to the thousands of armed wannabe patriots who are taking up arms against the nation in wrongful insurrection.
These men in Oregon need to be stopped, they need to be arrested, and this sort of behavior, in any way, cannot be condoned or allowed.
It goes against everything we are as the United States of America.Featured image: Wikimedia Commons
