keith ellison blurted out some words that meant nothing and was called out on it this is as rare on msnbc as finding a unicorn brzezinski : i mean she says it was bankrupt .
she says it was totally disorganized .
she says it was a complete mess .
is that the case ? kay : and they didn t give her anything.brzezinski : and they didn t give her anything .
is that true ? rep .
ellison : let me tell you , you know , we can t relitigate the past .
you know brzezinski : man , no.rep .
ellison : but the truth is no , seriously , let me finish my point .
the truth is that trump is getting rid , is abandoning climate action .
he is taking away people s protection for pre-existing conditions .
he is trying to ban people based on their religion .
there is no time for us to go back and try to figure out who shot john .
we ve got to figure out what went wrong so we can fix it and then move forward in an aggressive way.brzezinski : i just don t know what you said rep. ellison : that s where i m at.brzezinski : at all.the truth is keith ellison is a double talking commie ! in case you missed hillary throwing the dnc under the bus : burning bridges is never a smart strategy !
