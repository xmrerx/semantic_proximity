Donald Trump was hoping to visit the FBI for a photo-op in the wake of firing FBI Director James Comey.
The FBI told Trump to f*ck off.In the days since Comey s firing, it has been revealed that Trump pulled the trigger in retaliation against the FBI investigation into his Russia scandal.
Trump demanded that Comey be loyal to him and Comey refused to put Trump above the security of the country.
Trump has even admitted that the Russia investigation was in his mind when he fired Comey.This contradicted the official White House statement on Comey s firing, which has sparked national outrage as most Americans disapprove of Trump s action.Trump was hoping for applause.
Instead, he made things worse for himself.
Now it s clear that he has something to hide.But he didn t just anger the American people.
He pissed off the FBI, most of whom loved their former boss.So when Donald Trump wanted to visit the FBI on Thursday, they told him not to bother.
Trump then tucked his tail between his legs and had the White House cancel the visit.
He likely then threw a temper tantrum like a toddler.
The FBI told the White House the optics would not be good, NBC s Peter Alexander reported as the news came in.
FBI officials apparently said the president was unlikely to be greeted warmly after having just unceremoniously fired a very popular director.
Alexander further explained that while many FBI agents voted for Trump, they don t like that he fired Comey and are disgusted by how Trump did it.Here s the video via YouTube.Donald Trump just turned the FBI into his enemy, and that means they are going to work double-time on the investigation into his ties with Russia.
And I m sure they will be all too happy to slap cuffs on Trump and haul his sorry ass to jail when the time comes.Featured image Shawn Thew Pool/Getty Images
