nancy pelosi said in an interview with joy reid that after she met president trump she prayed for america she giggled nervously .
this is the usual pelosi act where she giggles and then says something so bitter and mean that you just can t believe it.we have quite a collection of pelosi-isms keep it up nancy ! nancy can t call trump her president giggle , giggle nancy pelosi couldn t sink any lower than this .
she was doing a question and answer when she giggled and said she can t call donald trump president trump .
the oddest behavior comes after the giggles .
she goes on to brag about her position in the democrat party and how she was so looking forward to hillary s win .
it s quite a delusional rant.how can the democrats be taken seriously when they behave this way ?
pelosi isn t the only one .
maxine waters is a very close second in the wacky category .
see the video below this one where she goes ballistic on a woman who said i love my president .pelosi giggles like a child :
