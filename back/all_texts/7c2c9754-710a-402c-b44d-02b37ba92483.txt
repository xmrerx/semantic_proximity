We already know Donald Trump is conceited, but now he might be bringing his fragile ego and worrisome habits to a whole new level.With the Inauguration only days away, many people are working diligently to prepare the nation s Capitol for the event.
This includes, but is not limited to, getting all the port-a-potties in their designated locations.Well, one passerby caught something on camera and posted it to Twitter.
The image was of a worker taking blue painter s tape and putting it over the name of the port-a-potty company.
The name of the company?
Don s Johns.
A Washington DC staple if you ve been to any event there, and was even at President Obama s inaugurations.Here s an image of the name of the company being covered:All the port-a-johns at the Capitol are having the "Don" in Don's Johns taped over.
I guess to avoid confusion.

But the name apparently strikes too close to home for organizers of the inauguration of Donald John Trump.Workers have placed blue tape over the company name on dozens of portable restrooms installed near the Capitol for the inauguration.
That s right, it looks as though, but hasn t been confirmed, that Trump is covering up the name of the port-a-potty because it bears a striking resemblance to his name.
And heaven forbid a port-a-potty on Inauguration Day bear the name of the new POTUS.The funniest part of all this?
It s kind of obvious and now more attention has been brought to the company name.
No one was likely to notice, and now everyone will.
Well done, Trump.Featured Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images
