Bill Clinton must be unaware of the very close race in California between his wife and Bernie Sanders.
He gave a finger wag and told hecklers that Bernie doesn t have a chance don t be so sure Slick Willy!
If I were them, I d be screaming too because they know they will be toast by election day, Clinton said, according to a Fox News reporter at the event: Bill Clinton was in East Los Angeles on Sunday campaigning ahead of the California primary on Tuesday.This hasn t been an easy week for Bill Clinton.
He was campaigning earlier in the week and encountered a woman who yelled obscenities about the 1994 Crime Bill: Hey Clinton, F*ck you!
