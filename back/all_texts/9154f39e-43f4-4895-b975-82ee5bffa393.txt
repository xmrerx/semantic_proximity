Eric Garner s daughter has released a new video in which she endorses Bernie Sanders for president.
Erica Garner s father was killed when he was placed in a chokehold by New York City police.In the video, Erica Garner talks about the importance of her family and the struggle of raising her daughter, talking about the problems of racism facing black America in modern times.
Garner says she is fighting for racial justice in honor of her pop-pop after seeing her father die on national TV.
Our people died for this, Garner continues, saying she s behind anyone who s going to listen and speak up for us, and I think we need to believe in a leader like Bernie Sanders.
We need a president who s going to speak about this, Garner adds.Eric Garner was selling loose cigarettes when police approached him for selling them without tax stamps.
As they went to arrest him, he was put in a chokehold.
Garner told them 11 times I can t breathe, and he was pronounced dead an hour later.The ad comes as both Sanders and Secretary Clinton are vying for support amongst the black electorate in South Carolina.
Unlike the mostly white electorate in New Hampshire and Iowa, about 25 percent of the voters in South Carolina are black.
Currently Clinton enjoys an aggregate of 62 percent support in that state, an advantage of 29.5 percent over Sanders.Sanders is hoping to capitalize on the near-tie in the Iowa caucus and his big victory in New Hampshire to eat into Clinton s lead, while also demonstrating that he appeals to more than just white college liberals.The Garner endorsement comes on the same day that Clinton received the backing of the Congressional Black Caucus PAC, announced in a press conference where legendary civil rights leader John Lewis pointed out that he did not personally encounter Sen. Sanders during the heyday of the movement.The Sanders campaign also announced today that actor Harry Belafonte had endorsed the senator.Featured image via YouTube
