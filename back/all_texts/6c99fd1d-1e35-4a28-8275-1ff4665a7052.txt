It seems that Donald Trump has a history of asking hackers for help in furthering his goals.
Not only did he ask Russian hackers to find Hillary s missing emails this morning, he also once asked hackers to help him out with taking President Obama.As the nation s most famous birther, he was all in on proving that Obama was foreign-born, and therefore couldn t be president.
He actually seemed upset that hackers were hacking everything except Obama s records:Obama released his long-form birth certificate in 2011, three years before Trump posted this tweet.
Trump is so sure he s right about everything, though, that he wanted to keep digging and digging until he found the mother lode.
Perhaps he was trying to keep Obama from making him look like the complete fool that he is?This morning, he pretty much told Russia that they would be rewarded if they hacked Hillary Clinton s email server and found those 30,000 emails that Republicans have been salivating over.
Of course, his loyal subjects including those at Fox News are saying he was joking about that, and why shouldn t they?
Asking a foreign government for help in winning a national election, or taking down one of our own, is treason.
Republicans will not want to admit that they nominated someone willing to commit treason.Asking hackers, who engage in illegal activity in order to obtain what they want, could be considered treason as well.
So Trump has a history of seeking illegal means to take down anybody he doesn t like, and he likes neither Obama nor Hillary.
In fact, he s sick and disgusting.But don t tell him that asking hackers, foreign and domestic, looks bad.
In his warped dimension, he s just doing what needs to be done.Featured image by Gustavo Caballero/Getty Images
