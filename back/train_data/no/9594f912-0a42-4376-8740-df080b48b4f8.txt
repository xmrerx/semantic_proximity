stockholm ( reuters ) - sweden will let some migrants who arrived as unaccompanied minors and turned 18 during the process of applying for asylum stay even if their applications are rejected , a rare relaxation of rules imposed at the height of the 2015 migration crisis .
more than 160,000 people sought asylum in sweden in 2015 , more than 30,000 of them unaccompanied minors , swamping the migration authority and leading to a huge backlog of cases .
monday s agreement between the social democrats and greens to relax some rules irons out a rift in the minority government .
these young people have become a part of sweden .
they should not be hurt by the extremely long processing times , deputy prime minister isabella lovin of the green party told a news conference .
sweden tightened asylum rules late in 2015 , saying it could no longer provide housing for all those who had arrived .
asylum seeker numbers fell to less than 30,000 last year , of which only about 2,000 were unaccompanied minors , although the fall is also due to the closing of the main route from turkey to the eu through greece .
the november 2015 tightening of sweden s traditionally generous asylum policies was a blow to the green party which has also had to accept the sale of state-energy company vattenfall s lignite mines in germany , which it wanted decommissioned .
the new rules will apply to asylum seekers who were registered as minors before the new tighter laws were announced , provided the processing time had been longer than 15 months .
they would be given temporary residency permits to finish high school , which could become permanent if they found employment , the government said .
the social democrats and greens will still need backing from parties outside government to get the agreement signed into law .
