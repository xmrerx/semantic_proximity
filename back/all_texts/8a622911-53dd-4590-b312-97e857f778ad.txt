With the inauguration fast approaching, Donald Trump is trying to prove to himself that he is actually liked by the American people.
And after pretty much every singer or performer of high recognition and notoriety wants absolutely nothing to do with him, he now has a singer from the 2010 s reality TV show America s Got Talent.Not to knock the singer, however.
Jackie Evancho is extremely talented.
However, no one really knows who she is.
Yet, she did decide to do the inauguration.
So, for whatever reasons the 16-year-old decided to perform, more power to her.Putting the talent of Evancho aside, Trump seems to be taking credit for her success, because, well, that s what he does.Trump tweeted: Jackie Evancho s album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her Inauguration performance.Some people just don t understand the Movement Jackie Evancho's album sales have skyrocketed after announcing her Inauguration performance.Some people just don't understand the "Movement" Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017Sure, Trump supporters everywhere probably have been buying her album, and since no one really was before, it likely did quadruple her sales.
And good for her.However, this tweet isn t about Evancho at all.
It s about the fact that Trump is trying to stick it to every performer who turned him down.
He s basically trying to say, look what you could have had!
Which, by the way, I doubt Beyonce, Justin Timberlake, Elton John, etc.
are really blinking an eye at.Trump can t handle people not liking him, so he says things that try to make it appear that this is what you could have if you liked him.
But guess what?
He said he didn t need those performers when Hillary Clinton had them.
So why, after all that, would he be surprised that people want nothing to do with him?Trump is just a thin-skinned man with an extraordinarily fragile ego who tries to overcompensate wherever and whenever he can.
