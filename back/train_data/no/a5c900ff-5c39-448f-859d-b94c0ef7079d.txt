tunis ( reuters ) - tunisia s navy rescued almost 100 migrants from a sinking boat off its southeast coast late on monday , authorities said , hours after eight people being smuggled to europe drowned in the same stretch of water .
the incidents coincided with the launch of joint patrols by the tunisian and italian navies to stem migrant flows and carry out search and rescue operations in the area , the tunisian defense ministry said .
tunisia s coast has become the launch pad of choice for traffickers transporting migrants from north africa across the mediterranean .
wooden boats packed with migrants , their numbers often swelled by young tunisians seeking work in europe , have started landing on secluded sicilian beaches , often in broad daylight .
activity via libya , until recently the busiest country of departure on that route , has declined since july as its coast guard and an armed group in the smuggling hub of sabratha tightened controls .
the tunisian interior ministry said late on monday the coast guard pulled 98 tunisians , including three children , from the sinking vessel near the island of kerkennah .
earlier on monday at least eight people drowned nearby when another boat carrying dozens of migrants collided with a tunisian navy vessel .
tunisia has won plaudits from abroad for its transition to democracy since 2011 , when an uprising toppled autocrat zine el-abidine ben ali .
but unemployment remains high , especially among the country s youth .
