paris ( reuters ) - president emmanuel macron s bold vision for european renewal will be harder to translate into real policy change if france does not have a strong partner in germany , france s new government spokesman said on monday .
benjamin griveaux s comments were the most explicit yet by the french government that the faltering coalition talks in germany posed a risk to macron s ideas for reform of the euro zone , as well as defense , immigration and energy policy .
we are naturally paying close attention to everything that might help stabilize the political situation ( in germany ) because without a strong partner it will obviously be more difficult to carry out the president s ambitious european project , griveaux told a weekly news briefing .
macron and german chancellor angela merkel have spoken frequently in past months about their desire for france and germany , the european union s two largest economies and often its engines of change , to take the lead on closer cooperation .
but merkel s fourth term was plunged into doubt a week ago when three-way coalition talks with the pro-business free democrats ( fdp ) and greens collapsed .
now momentum is building for another grand coalition with the social democrats ( spd ) .
even so , those negotiations may not be quick .
the eu faces a narrow window to forge agreement on macron s sweeping proposals because , as european elections in 2019 approach , the bloc is likely to be distracted by brexit negotiations and wrangling over a new long-term budget .
moreover , doubts are rising over whether the spd would make european reform a priority in looming coalition negotiations .
on euro zone reform , macron has called for the creation of a budget , finance minister and separate parliament for the currency bloc .
