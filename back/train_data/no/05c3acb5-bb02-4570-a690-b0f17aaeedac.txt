we told you about the fancy affair obama was planning to host at the white house for black rappers last week .
the latest development with the ankle bracelet on a criminal rapper makes you want to scream , are you kidding me ?
an attempt by president obama to promote his my brother s keeper initiative , which aims to keep youths of color out of trouble , came to a farcical end when rapper rick ross s ankle bracelet which he received on a kidnapping and assault charge went off.obama had invited a bevy of hip-hop heavyweights , including niki minaj , common , busta rhymes , pusha t and dj khaled , to the meeting at the white house friday.but none of them least of all ross himself expected the ankle bracelet to interrupt the president , according to tmz.obama reportedly invited the stars to the serious and fancy affair , which was not made public before the event , to promote the initiative.it was so serious , in fact , that ross , who is typically photographed topless to show off his impressive all-over body tattoos , wore a smart suit and a pair of black adidas sneakers.that suit conveniently covered the ankle bracelet that he received after last year s kidnapping , assault and battery charges .
unfortunately , it wasn t able to block the sound of his new anklet s random beeps one of which went off just as obama was finishing his speech.even the self-styled hood billionaire was surprised at the sound , a source said.he later posted a picture of himself and dj khaled talking after the event on his instagram account .
