Howard Stern: You seem to be pretty conservative.
You kinda are.Megyn: I m conservative on some things and not on others and I love that people just make these assumptions about you because you work at FOX.Howard: Well no, I make it [assumption] because I hear the questions and the line of questions.
Megyn: But that s my job.That s not all Megyn seems to be very selective about who can and can t talk about a woman s weight and appearance.
It sure sounds like she has no problem talking to Stern about her appearance and how important her good looks and physique are for her job.
In fact, it appears as though Megyn actually finds his line of questioning quite amusing.She also spent a considerable amount of time talking about her sex life, her breasts and the size of her husband s penis.
Nope nothing seems to offend Megyn in this interview:https://youtu.be/IML_UGhXz2Q
