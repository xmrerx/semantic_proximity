doha ( reuters ) - qatar s foreign minister said on wednesday that his country was willing to negotiate an end to a gulf diplomatic rift but had seen no sign that saudi arabia and other countries imposing sanctions on doha were open to mediation .
kuwait and the united states are trying to heal a bitter dispute between qatar and four arab countries that has damaged business ties and disrupted travel for thousands of citizens in the six-nation gulf cooperation council .
egypt , saudi arabia , bahrain and the united emirates severed political and trade ties with the small gas-rich country on june 4 , accusing it of supporting terrorism .
doha denies the charges .
a visit this week to the uae and qatar by russian foreign minister sergei lavrov showed no signs of having eased tensions among the gulf arab powers .
qatar maintains its position that this crisis can only be achieved through a constructive dialogue ... but the blockading counties are not responding to any efforts being conducted by kuwait or other friendly countries , qatari foreign minister sheikh mohammed bin abdulrahman al-thani told reporters in doha on wednesday at a news conference with his russian counterpart .
the uae s ambassador to the united states , yousef al-otaiba , in an interview with u.s.-based magazine the atlantic on monday , said his country would negotiate with qatar so long as doha did not set any preconditions for talks .
sheikh mohammed said on wednesday qatar planned to bolster trade with russia , one of the world s biggest gas exporters , and that qatar could no longer rely on neighboring states to support its economy or guarantee food security .
lavrov said if face-to-face negotiations started , russia would be ready to contribute to the mediation and that it was in russia s interest for the gcc to be united and strong .
