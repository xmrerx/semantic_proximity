initial reports suggested the marshals had a warrant but it was subsequently discovered that they did not , and it is not known why they pursued few.greenhouse and stafford were charged with second-degree murder and attempted second-degree murder .
they are being held on $ 1million bonds.as you can see here , these two cops were about as bad as two cops can be .
