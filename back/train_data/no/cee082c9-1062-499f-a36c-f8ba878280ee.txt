was this somali immigrant refusing to appear in a nd court simply because he does not recognize american law ?
or is it simply a case of believing he is entitled to special privileges because he is a victim of islamaphobia in america ?

the most serious charge , class aa felony gross sexual imposition , could carry a lifetime prison term if ali were convicted.at one point wednesday , ali said he was having problems at the cass county jail and that he was taking medication but was not sleeping.mental evaluations are used in criminal cases to assess whether a defendant is unable to assist in his own defense or was mentally ill or deficient at the time of the alleged crime .
either situation can prevent a defendant from standing trial.ali s family has said he suffers from biploar disorder and that minor criminal charges against him in ohio and minnesota were dismissed on mental illness grounds .
