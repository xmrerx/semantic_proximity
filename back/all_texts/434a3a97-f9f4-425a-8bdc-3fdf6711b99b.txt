If you ve been watching the Republican National Convention you ve been witnessing quite the bizarre circus that doesn t seem quite real, as it all seems like a bit of a nightmare.Speaker after speaker has been vilifying Hillary Clinton and talking up Donald Trump as an acceptable choice for President of the United States.
A job he is clearly, not by any means, qualified to do.On the second day of the convention came roll call, and state after state shouted out how many of their delegates went to each candidate.
With Trump being the clear winner it left those who love him very happy, and those who don t want him anywhere near the White House shaking their heads, or worse.One GOP delegate literally stared straight into the camera as his state called out the number of delegates going to Trump, lifted up his hand, and slapped it against his face in a facepalm of epic proportions.Watch it all unfold here:Republican delegate facepalms as his state announces its votes for Trump #RNCinCLE https://t.co/0quzZReAgP https://t.co/KLoHOfqwK4 CNN Tonight (@CNNTonight) July 20, 2016It was the ultimate, well-understood facepalm felt around the world, and probably the way most sane people feel everywhere.If this guy is smart and, well, a decent human being, he ll make sure Trump isn t elected just as the rest of the world hopes is the outcome.Featured image via video screen capture
