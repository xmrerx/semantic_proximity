You can probably expect Donald Trump to roll out some new rules regarding photographers and helicopters soon after a photo someone snapped of him boarding one.Today was the last day photography will be allowed near Trump and helicopters I suspect.

But let s see what the folks on Twitter think about it:It's Count Olaf in disguise!

Expect an Executive Order on no photographers once he sees this photo.
Lol.
Dorothy Domingo (@clayartist2) January 27, 2017@Rschooley Once DJT sees his hair in this photo, no one will get near Marine 1 with a camera.
Pat Lowery Dewees (@DeweesPat) January 27, 2017@rschooley Do they have to re-glue the dead squirrel once he's inside?

Holy smokes, that's scary.
Deb Simpson (@debrdtrip) January 27, 2017@Rschooley it looks like a helicopter blade wacked his hair creature thing and injured it!
#creepy RebelAlliance (@cybersaur1) January 27, 2017Recently, Trump threw a tantrum because a news organization used a photograph he felt made him look fat.
Politico reported in November:The source said the meeting started with a typical Trump complaint about the dishonest media, and that he specifically singled out CNN and NBC News for example as the worst.
Trump turned to NBC News President Deborah Turness at one point, the source said, and told her the network won t run a nice picture of him, instead choosing this picture of me, as he made a face with a double chin.
Turness replied that they had a very nice picture of him on their website at the moment.We can almost assuredly expect yet another meltdown from President Pussygrabber.
After all, his ego is all that matters to him.Featured image via twitter
