this is awfully ironic , considering the previous outrage over so-called , violent tweets targeting cnn.opinion : kill `` fox & friends '' before it s too late https : //t.co/dvucbbgowq washington post ( @ washingtonpost ) july 10 , 2017in the article , the post questions , how could a guy who d run the fbi be guilty of a leak ?
