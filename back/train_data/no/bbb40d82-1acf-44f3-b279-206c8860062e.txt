dubai ( reuters ) - bahrain said on wednesday a bomb attack on a police bus which killed an officer and wounded nine last month was carried out by a militant cell trained by its arch-foe iran .
after authorities quashed shi ite muslim-led arab spring protests on the sunni-ruled island in 2011 , militants have launched deadly bombing and shooting attacks against security forces that bahrain blames on tehran s shi ite theocracy .
iran denies any role in bahrain s unrest .
there was no immediate iranian reaction to wednesday s bahraini interior ministry statement , which added that authorities had arrested one member of the cell while others were fugitives in iran .
the terrorist cell received extensive training in iranian revolutionary guard camps on the use and manufacture of explosives and firearms , as well as material and logistical support , the ministry said .
bahrain said earlier this week that an explosion at its main oil pipeline on friday was caused by terrorist sabotage , linking the unprecedented attack to iran .
a key western ally and host to the u.s. fifth fleet , gulf arab monarchy bahrain has for years grappled with protests and sporadic violence coming from its shi ite majority .
