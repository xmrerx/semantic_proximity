washington ( reuters ) - the head of u.s. forces in africa has ordered an additional investigation into an august raid in somalia by somali and american forces , the u.s military said on thursday .
last month , the u.s. military said it did not kill any civilians when it accompanied somali forces on a deadly raid in the village of bariire .
at the time , it described the dead as enemy combatants and that they were members of al shabaab , the al-qaeda linked insurgent group .
however , eyewitnesses have told reuters that 10 civilians were killed and that the military had been drawn into a local clan conflict .
in a statement , u.s. africa command ( africom ) said it had referred the incident to the naval criminal investigative service after media reports alleged misconduct by u.s. personnel to ensure a full exploration of the facts given the gravity of the allegations .
africom takes all allegations of misconduct seriously and will leverage the expertise of appropriate organizations to ensure such allegations are fully and impartially investigated , the statement said .
the united states has stepped up operations in somalia this year after president donald trump loosened restrictions on the military s operations in march .
a navy seal was killed in somalia in may , the first u.s. combat casualty there since somali militiamen shot down u.s. black hawk helicopters in 1993 .
the united states has also ramped up its use of air strikes , conducting twice as many strikes this year as last year .
somalia has been riven by civil war since 1991 .
it now has a weak , internationally-backed government , supported by african peacekeepers .
