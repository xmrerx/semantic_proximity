the usaa financial services firm is reinstating its advertising on sean hannity s fox news channel program after receiving heavy criticism for its initial decision from many of the military members and veterans that it serves.the san antonio , texas-based company said tuesday it will also start advertising again on other programs where it had suspended ads , including hardball and the rachel maddow show on msnbc , and jake tapper s the lead on cnn.following hannity s reporting on ( what the ap calls a discredited conspiracy theory ) involving the death of a democratic national committee staff member , the liberal advocacy group media matters last week posted a list of his show s advertisers and usaa was one of 10 to say it was pulling its commercials .
at the time , the usaa said the company s policy was to avoid politically opinionated shows.but many of usaa s customers reacted angrily , and it didn t help when the company s advertising on other opinion shows was pointed out.usaa said it wasn t trying to favor one set of political views over another .
we heard concerns from many members who watch and listen to these programs , usaa said in a statement on tuesday .
our goal in advertising has always been to reach members of the military community who would benefit from usaa s well-known commitment to service .
today , the lines between news and editorial are increasingly blurred .
the advertising is returning while the company reviews its policy about avoiding the opinion shows.hannity was due to return to fox tuesday following a brief vacation .
he had said he would no longer talk about the shooting death of seth rich last year following pleas from the man s family , although his network had retracted an online story about rich because it hadn t met its reporting standards.brent bozell , president of the conservative media research center , said he wasn t surprised by usaa s decision , given the avalanche of protests .
his group was behind mobilizing that backlash , and said its members generated more than 1,600 phone calls to usaa within 48 hours .
