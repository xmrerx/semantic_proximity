When the majority of students, regardless of color, accept this twisted premise, Obama has won his war on America and has successfully divided us by race The State University of New York at Binghamton (SUNY-Binghamton) is offering a training class titled StopWhitePeople2k16, to instruct residential assistants (RAs) on how to deal with uneducated people who don t believe in ideas like white privilege.The class is just one of several available to RAs at the school, and was discovered by the Binghamton Review, a student newspaper.
Residential assistants are students who agree to assist with overseeing and monitoring residential life in return for receiving a free room from the school.
Apparently, though, Binghamton RAs also have the responsibility of stopping white people.
The premise of this session is to help others take the next step in understanding diversity, privilege, and the society we function within, the class description says.
Learning about these topics is a good first step, but when encountered with good arguments from uneducated people, how do you respond?
This open discussion will give attendees the tools to do so, and hopefully expand upon what they may already know.
