phnom penh ( reuters ) - a senator from cambodia s main opposition party was pardoned on wednesday from the seven-year jail sentence he had been given over a facebook posting , in a conciliatory sign from prime minister hun sen towards his opponents .
a crackdown on the cambodia national rescue party ( cnrp ) has led to the arrest of party leader kem sokha on treason charges and a government push to have it dissolved completely .
that has brought protests from western donors .
senator hong sok hour , 59 , was sentenced last year over a fake official document he had posted on facebook saying that cambodia and vietnam had decided to dissolve their border .
it is a sensitive subject in cambodia , where hun sen s opponents have long accused him of being a vietnamese puppet since he was put in his post in 1985 when vietnam occupied cambodia after ousting the genocidal khmer rouge .
hong sok hour was pardoned by king norodom sihamoni at hun sen s request .
he wrote a letter of apology to samdech decho and asked him to write to the king to issue a pardon , phay siphan told reuters , using hun sen s official title .
he admitted his fault .
hun sen s critics accuse him of trying to turn the country into a one-party state for the ruling cambodian people s party ( cpp ) and to ensure that he wins a general election next year without any effective challenge .
the opposition welcomed the pardon .
this is a positive sign and each time there s a royal pardon , the political situation calms down , said mu sochua , a deputy to kem sokha who fled into exile fearing that she was about to be arrested , too .
however , hun sen reiterated on wednesday that the cnrp would be dissolved and any elected officials who defected from the opposition to his party would be allowed to keep their positions .
