perhaps merkel should have considered the serious consequences of germany s compassionate open border policy that allowed over 1 million ( mostly ) muslim males to infiltrate their country .
german officials essentially granted them permission to rape and sexually assault their women and children while they looked the other way .
but that s not all germany is giving them free food , housing , education and spending money to boot .
does angela merkel really believe that when she tells these freeloading muslim males that it s time to go back home , that they re going to pack up their bags and leave ?
as germany s open-door refugee policy comes increasingly under fire , the chancellor has tried to silence her critics.despite mounting pressure to cap the number of refugees in the wake of the cologne sex attacks which saw 130 women sexually assaulted by men , believed to be migrants , mrs merkel has stood her ground.some 1.1million migrants entered germany last year , many fleeing conflicts in syria and iraq.mrs merkel said : we need to say to people that this is a temporary residential status and we expect that , once there is peace in syria again , once isis has been defeated in iraq , that you go back to your home country with the knowledge that you have gained .
mrs merkel said 70 per cent of the refugees who fled to germany from former yugoslavia in the 1990s had returned.she urged other european countries to offer more help because the numbers need to be reduced even further and must not start to rise again , especially in spring .speaking to a regional meeting of her christian democratic union ( cdu ) , mrs merkel said said all eu states should have an interest in protecting the bloc s external borders , and all would suffer if the internal passport-free schengen zone collapsed and national borders were closed.peter altmaier , who mrs merkel has tasked with overseeing the government s handling of the refugee crisis , said the government was negotiating with some countries including turkey about taking back criminal refugees who arrived via non-eu countries.yeah because what nation in their right mind wouldn t gladly accept criminal refugees into their country ?
gee , we sure hope merkel isn t foolish enough to believe there aren t any members of isis living comfortably in refugee housing or camps inside their open-borders.via : express uk
