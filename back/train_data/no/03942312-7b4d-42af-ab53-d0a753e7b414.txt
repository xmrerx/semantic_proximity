london ( reuters ) - britain needs to set out plans to make sure its lawyers can keep working across europe after brexit , a lobby group said on thursday .
thecityuk said britain s withdrawal from the european union should also not threaten the international dominance of english law and the prospects of an industry that generated 31.5 billion pounds ( $ 42 billion ) in revenue last year .
the group , which lobbies for financial and legal services firms , said it was urging the government to do everything it can to make sure brexit does not act as a barrier to future growth opportunities but as a stimulant .
this includes the need to secure mutual market access to enable uk-based practitioners to continue to represent clients in eu jurisdictions .
the government needed to give details on how it planned to convert eu rules governing the industry into domestic law , and the process for signing up to international conventions .
legal services make up 1.5 percent of the uk economy and employ more than 311,000 people , thecityuk said in a report on the industry .
more than 200 foreign law firms have set up shop in london and english law is used in 40 percent of global corporate arbitrations , it added .
the choice of english law for global commercial contracts is in part driven by the uk s reputation as the leading center for international dispute resolution , the report said .
but others are waiting in the wings .
the german federal state of hesse promoted a conference earlier this year that looked at how brexit provided an opportunity for frankfurt to become a new litigation hub in europe .
