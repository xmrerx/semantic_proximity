When you re a salesperson, you try your best to identify the need of the customer to convince them to buy what you re selling.
And in the case of Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, he knows the Republican base has a need for someone who claims to be Christian.
This was apparent at the last GOP debate when Rev.
Senator Marco Rubio kept bringing up Jesus Christ time and time again, when Sen. Ted Cruz seems to claim to be the chosen one, and now when Donald Trump brings out his childhood Bible to prove how Christian he really, truly is.You see, there is no religious test in order to be President of the United States.
In fact, it would be unconstitutional if it were to be required of candidates to prove their faith or deem themselves worthy of being elected.
However, Republicans aren t known for following the Constitution, as much as they like to say they do, so we end up seeing things like this pathetic display to pander to evangelical Christians who are apparently so dimwitted that they can t see straight through the farce.Evangelicals, he s selling you a line.
That s what salespeople do so you buy into whatever it is they re selling.
And in regards to who would be the best candidate for the job of president, if they have to tell you how much they love Jesus to make up for the fact that they have zero policy experience, realize you re being duped.
Please.// < !
