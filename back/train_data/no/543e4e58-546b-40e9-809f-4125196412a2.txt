bucharest ( reuters ) - romania has expelled a pro-russian serbian nationalist and banned him from entering the nato member for 15 years after he showed an interest in obtaining classified information on military installations , state security said on tuesday .
bratislav zivkovic , 42 , is a commander of serbia s chetnik paramilitary and went to crimea in 2014-15 to support the russian intervention there .
he told reporters there at the time that it was only natural to want to help russians fighting the ukrainians .
a spokesman for romania s sri secret service said it had identified zivkovic showing interest in obtaining classified documents on critical infrastructure and national and allied military objectives located in south-east romania with the intention of affecting our strategic partnerships .
sri s ovidiu marincea said zivkovic had been caught while taking photos of military radars on the black sea shore and trying to transmit their gps coordinates .
i want to stress this serbian citizen did not succeed in gathering any documents or classified information , marincea said .
he poses a risk to romania s national security , he added .
russia is serbia s traditional ally with the two nations sharing slav origins , the christian orthodox faith and having similar languages .
serbia is heavily dependent on russia s energy and the cash-strapped government in belgrade has turned to kremlin to underpin its budget .
the serbian chetniks gained notoriety in the 1990s when their units committed atrocities against non-serbs in croatia , bosnia and kosovo , a former serbian province dominated by ethnic albanians .
