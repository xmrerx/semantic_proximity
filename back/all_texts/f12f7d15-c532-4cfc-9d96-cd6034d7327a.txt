On Tuesday, all of Kenya went dark for more than three hours after a monkey climbed onto the roof of the Gitaru Power Station and fell onto a transformer.
The Mirror reports that the unfortunate primate caused other machines at the station to overload, causing the national power blackout.
Fortunately, all systems have been restored and the country still has power.Normally, this would be a rather unfortunate, yet benign, story with no protagonist, antagonist, or drama.
But enter American conservatives.
When a site called Drudge Today, actual relationship with right-wing propaganda mill Drudge Report unknown, copy and pasted the story from The Mirror, you can pretty much guess what happened.Since the Right has spent years portraying our President as a Kenyan (not American) usurper who wants to institute a system of Socialist, Communist, Muslim hater-of-all-that-is-good-and-righteous, it is unsurprising that they would see the headline and jump on the opportunity to spew a bunch of hateful, racist bullsh*t.Quickly, the comment section filled with 101 degrees of horribleness.Here are some of the highlights:On the Mirror s website, the hatred flowed as well: Unfortunately, this is the mind of the modern conservative.
While once, a very long, long long time ago, the Republican Party had some good ideas for the nation (remember when they supported unions?
), conservatives have become nothing but hate-hoses.Remember: each and every one of these people will be headed to the polls in November.
Make sure that you re there too.
