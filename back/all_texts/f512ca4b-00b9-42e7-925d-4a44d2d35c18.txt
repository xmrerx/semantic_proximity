With all the candidates from both parties in New York preparing for the primary next Tuesday, it s no surprise that they are making the late night talk show rounds.
Appearing on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, Ted Cruz got a call from Donald Trump offering him advice for the show appearance, and questioning him about some of his policy positions.As crazy as Cruz is, the sketch actually turned out pretty funny with digs being taken at both the GOP candidates.
One of the funniest moments was when Cruz mentioned that the party is starting to unify behind him, yet Trump cut in to remind Cruz that the party is also unifying behind himself unifying against him.
Which is becoming more and more obvious as the weeks and months go by leading up the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio.When Trump questioned Cruz on his New York values remark, Cruz responded by saying that what he meant to say was that he values New York, but he was just speaking like Yoda from Star Wars.At one point in the sketch Trump was offering Cruz some advice on how to get around New York.
When Trump asked the Texas senator if he was writing it down, Cruz responded in the affirmative, but then pulled out a bottle of booze, poured himself a glass, and then took a sip.
Something that likely needs to be done while speaking with the actual Donald Trump, or for that matter, Cruz as well.All in all, no matter how much you may loathe Cruz, and if you re like me you loathe Cruz, it was still a pretty damn funny sketch with Fallon s Trump getting better and better.
However, hopefully after November we won t need to see him play the Republican frontrunner anymore, because a Democrat is going to win.Watch the silly sketch here:Featured image via video screen capture
