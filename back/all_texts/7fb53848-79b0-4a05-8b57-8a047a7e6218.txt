Liberals on Twitter accused President Donald Trump s son Eric of sporting a Nazi haircut when he debuted a new hairdo Sunday.Eric Trump sported a new hairstyle with the side of his head shaved in an interview with Fox News.
Trump s trendy new style is far from unusual: celebrities like Macklemore, David Beckham, Brad Pitt, and Adam Levine have all sported the same look.But in recent years, members of the alt-right, including white supremacist Richard Spencer, have also started wearing their hair the same way.
Some have even begun to call the style fashy, short for fascist.When a screenshot of Trump s hairstyle first hit the Internet, reporters and liberals assumed the worst.
WFBEric Trump has a fascist haircut.This cannot possibly be unintentional.
