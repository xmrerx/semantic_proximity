colombo ( reuters ) - a sri lankan court remanded a buddhist monk in custody on monday after charging him with leading hardline nationalists in a protest against 31 rohingya muslim asylum seekers last week , forcing the refugees to flee a u.n. safe house , police said .
the police have so far remanded seven people on several charges including creating communal disharmony , attacking police and damaging property , police spokesman ruwan gunasekara told reuters .
the monk , akmeemana dayarathana , and colleagues are accused of storming into the safe house chanting rohingyas are terrorists .
president maithripala sirisena s government condemned the attack on the refugees as shameful and urged police to hunt down those responsible .
the refugees , who were arrested in april along with two suspected indian traffickers in a boat in sri lankan seas , were taken into protective custody and then to a detention center outside colombo following the protest on tuesday .
tension between myanmar s majority buddhists and the rohingya , most of whom are denied citizenship , has exploded several times over the past few years as old enmities , and buddhist nationalism , surfaced with the end of decades of harsh military rule .
there has been an exodus of rohingya from myanmar s rakhine state since aug. 25 , when attacks by rohingya militants triggered a military crackdown that the united nations has branded ethnic cleansing .
