Disney has officially begun to push a gay agenda on children so young that many of them don t even know there are anatomical differences between themselves and their friends.
No matter, Disney apparently has a gay agenda, and no child is too young to start pushing that agenda on our children.
Just remember, no one is FORCING you to take your kids to Disney movies or buy their propaganda.
A controversy has been brewing for some time now over the sequel to Frozen where MTV host, Alexis Isabel started a hashtag campaign: #GiveElsaAGirlfriend asking Disney to make the Elsa character a lesbian.Let's trend #GiveElsaAGirlfriend in hopes that @Disney will consider giving queer girls representation in princess form.
Alexis Isabel (@lexi4prez) May 1, 2016Disney/Pixar s upcoming film Finding Dory features a transgender stingray who transitions to become Sting-Rhonda, the film s star Ellen DeGeneres revealed in an interview.The sequel to the 2003 smash hit Finding Nemo has already fueled speculation that it will be the first Disney film to feature a lesbian couple, but Degeneres, who voices the titular blue fang fish, told USA Today in an interview that the film will feature a trans sting.
There s a stingray that s becoming sting-Rhonda, so there s a trans sting in the movie, DeGeneres said.A representative for Pixar didn t immediately return Breitbart News s request for confirmation.In May, eagle-eyed viewers of the Finding Dory trailer speculated that the film would be the first Disney project to feature a lesbian couple, after a blink-and-you ll-miss it shot of what appeared to be two women walking near a baby stroller.The creative team behind the film have not confirmed or denied whether the couple is, in fact, lesbian, and DeGeneres also remained mum on the subject in her interview with USA Today.
I don t know if it s true or not or if she just has a bad short haircut, you know?
DeGeneres joked.
Who knows if she s a lesbian.
Some fans of other Disney film properties have lobbied the studio to include LGBT characters in its films.There is some recent precedent for gay Disney characters; earlier this year, an episode of ABC s fairy-tale drama Once Upon a Time featured a lesbian true love s kiss between Ruby and the Wizard of Oz s Dorothy.Via: Breitbart News
