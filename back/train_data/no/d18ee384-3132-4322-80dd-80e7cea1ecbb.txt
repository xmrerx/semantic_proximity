pic.twitter.com/7sg4syrapa liz heron ( @ lheron ) may 20 , 2016the emoji she s got on there clearly show that she s touting girl power with this photo , but there is , in fact , a major problem with it that brought twitter s wrath down upon her , and the huffington post itself .
it s diversity , or a lack thereof .
where s the racial diversity ? the editorial staff is primarily white , like most executive staffs at most companies , and twitter was kind enough to point that out , along with a couple of other problems : an ed table full of white women , and @ huffingtonpost s 2016 readership is in the toilet .
shocker https : //t.co/mj830qbtmg joe knight ( @ moneyjknight ) may 22 , 2016 .
@ lheron it seems that the @ huffingtonpost has a few kinks left in the cloning process ?

( @ pyramidports ) may 22 , 2016 @ lheron @ huffingtonpost the fact that you don t notice what apparently half of the people in the world do says a lot about your pov .
all bass , no treble ( @ tiffmc1013 ) may 22 , 2016this next one is needling huffpo over the fact that it loves painting itself as the liberal answer to conservative media .
however , it behaves like a typical , profit-mongering corporation that would support conservative business policies to enhance its bottom line , and engages in questionable practices to that same end , like having thousands of writers work for free .
@ lheron @ huffingtonpost what i notice is that nobody there is more than 3 years out of college .
ignorant , but cheap as dirt to hire .
robert tracinski ( @ tracinski ) may 20 , 2016in going through these tweets , one will see some predictably sexist tweets about how it s just as sexist for a company to have an entirely female leadership staff as it is for them to have an entirely male leadership staff .
that s male privilege talking , though we still live in a man s world here .
women have it much harder in the workplace , including climbing that vaunted corporate ladder , than men do.an all-female editorial team in a man s world is great .
however , for a supposedly liberal outlet , whatever attempts they re making at racial diversity suck .
we have to wonder whether their hr department screens out resumes of people with black sounding names like many other hr departments do .
we also have to wonder whether they consider black people to automatically be less qualified , like many other companies seem to.perhaps they re afraid they ll lose readers if their readers know they have black people on their editorial staff.yes , companies should absolutely put the people they believe to be the best qualified in open positions .
oftentimes , however , black candidates are judged more harshly than other candidates , especially white candidates , due to racial biases in a variety of areas .
huffpo , this is extremely disappointing.image via screen capture from embedded tweet by liz heron
