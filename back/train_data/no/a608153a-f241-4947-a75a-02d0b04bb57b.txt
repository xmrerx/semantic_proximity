hanoi ( reuters ) - vietnam police on wednesday ordered the prosecution of a former executive at scandal-hit state energy company petrovietnam over financial losses , the latest move in a high-level corruption crackdown that has seen a politburo member arrested .
phung dinh thuc , a former chairman of petrovietnam , will be prosecuted for alleged violation of state regulations on economic management , causing serious consequences while he was in charge of a petrovietnam solar power plant project , the ministry of public security said in a statement posted online .
thuc is one of two officials that vietnamese state media had earlier this month reported would be prosecuted .
vietnam s state-run news agency later apologized for issuing what it said was a false report on the prosecution of the two .
thuc was not available for comment .
petrovietnam did not immediately respond to a reuters request for comment .
petrovietnam is at the center of a high-level corruption crackdown .
former petrovietnam chairman and also a former member of the communist state s politburo , dinh la thang , 56 , was the most senior executive arrested in the scandal .
police have said they are investigating alleged violations of state rules at petrovietnam that resulted in an 800 billion dong ( $ 35 million ) loss for local lender ocean bank .
on tuesday , the security ministry said phan dinh duc , a member of petrovietnam s board of directors , would face prosecution over financial losses .
the corruption crackdown made global headlines in august when germany accused vietnam of kidnapping trinh xuan thanh , a former chairman of petrovietnam s construction unit , after he applied for asylum in berlin .
vietnam has denied kidnapping thanh and has said he turned himself in .
the communist party has said thanh will go on trial in january .
