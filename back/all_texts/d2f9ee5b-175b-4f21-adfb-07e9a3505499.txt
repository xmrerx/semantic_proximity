WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence never discussed with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson the prospect of the top U.S. diplomat resigning from President Donald Trump’s administration, Pence’s office said in a statement to NBC News on Wednesday.
Tillerson said earlier on Wednesday that he never considered resigning, after NBC News reported that Pence and other top officials intervened to persuade him not to resign during the summer as tensions rose between Trump and Tillerson.
“The vice president can also confirm that, as the secretary of state made clear, at no time did he and the secretary ever discuss the prospect of the secretary’s resignation from the administration,” Pence’s office said in the statement posted on Twitter by NBC News.
