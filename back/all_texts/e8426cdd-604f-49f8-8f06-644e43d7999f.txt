Wow!Variety reported:Fox News human resources department was made aware of a complaint about what one person familiar with the situation characterized as a racially insensitive remark on Tuesday evening.
Executives conducted an internal investigation, this person said, and decided to part ways with Beckel Friday morning.Douglas Wigdor, an attorney who represents several current and former employees who have alleged racial discrimination at Fox News in a lawsuit, said he is representing the employee who complained about Beckel.
In a statement, Wigdor alleged Beckel stormed out of his office when an African-American information-technology employee came to service his computer, telling our client that he was leaving his office because he was black.
Wigdor alleged Fox News executives tried to get the employee to withdraw the complaint.
As with our other 22 clients, we intend on holding 21st Century Fox accountable for these actions and will be filing multiple other complaints in other matters next week, Wigdor said.
