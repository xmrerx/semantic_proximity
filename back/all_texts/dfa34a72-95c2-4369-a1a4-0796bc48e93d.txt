NYC s only Chick-Fil-A restaurant got shut down on Dec 30th after appalling sanitary and food safety violations were discovered in not one but two back-to-back health inspections.
Rather than thanking God for sending an inspector, preventing them from contracting various fun diseases, conservatives are flipping out over not getting enough fly waste and food=borne illness in their daily diet.Below are some images provided by one twitter user regarding the closure.
The list in red is the specific violations and total violation points.No line outside Chick-fil-A in NYC.
Sign says closed for maintenance.
Some violations online, no reason for closure pic.twitter.com/1lnuOonvXG Candice Choi (@candicechoi) January 3, 2016There were literally flies in and around the food to a point where a health inspector said the place had to stop serving food immediately.
Gross, right?The flies must be a false flag for the liberal war on Christian anti-gay chicken sandwiches.
Rather than adopting the personal responsibility attitude that conservatives love, and blaming the restaurant for not being more vigilant in the cleanliness of their facility, they started firing off accusations of it being a liberal plot and anti-religion operation.

A previous inspection earlier in December returned 39 violation points, indicating things got worse not better between the two inspections.
If things were not brought to a halt, they would have been wheeling people out on stretchers.
I guess at least they would still have religious freedom while they were getting their stomachs pumped at the hospital.Featured image via Wikicommons
