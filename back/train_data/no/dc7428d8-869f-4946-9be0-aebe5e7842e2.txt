don t bite the hands that feed you people ! posted by saad kooza salman on saturday , june 6 , 2015 you can not handle their freedom , thats why you re full of hate where do you think those 2 -3 million soldiers who fought your f ass s in fallujah and ramadi and baghdad and up-north went ?
they are here they did not forget how to kill , they did not forget how to fight .
the same ones who fought you in fallujah , they will f - you up here too .
they got guns , but they don t want to choose that path .
