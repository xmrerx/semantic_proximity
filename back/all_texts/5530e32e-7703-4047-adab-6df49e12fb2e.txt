The day has arrived for the Democratic National Convention, and outgoing DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz is off to a very, very bad start.The Democratic Representative from Florida, who was a constant thorn in the Bernie Sanders campaign, yesterday forcefully resigned as the DNC chair after a WikiLeaks publish showed the DNC, under her control, had open disdain for Sanders.And now, Wasserman Schultz is feeling the burn for the reckless organization.While appearing at the Florida delegation breakfast, Wasserman Schultz was literally booed off the stage by the delegation the minute she took the podium.
After initially beginning her speech about a recent shooting at a Fort Myers, Florida nightclub shooting (that left 16 people injured and 2 dead), the crowed erupted into chaos.Delegates held up signs reading, No, E-mails, Thanks for the help Debbie.
Other delegates yelled shame and continued to boo and throw fists in the air.Wasserman Schultz, who clearly got the message, acknowledged her resignation and the outrage, saying to the crowd: I can see there s a little bit of interest in my being here, and I can appreciate that interest We know the voices in this room that are standing up and being disruptive, that s not the Florida we know.
The Florida we know is united, the Florida we know will continue to create jobs.The now disgraced DNC chair promised the delegates she will continue to be seen on the campaign trail, and will actively work with Clinton on a 50 state strategy to defeat Donald Trump.
She also promised more unity with Democrats, and pledged to lock arms with supporters.Something tells me that won t go over quite as she plans.Watch the awkwardness below:Man this is brutal: DWS being booed this morning at the Florida Delegation Breakfast ahead of the DNC: https://t.co/nhdCpyMrZO Frank Thorp V (@frankthorp) July 25, 2016Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images
