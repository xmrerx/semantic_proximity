sofia ( reuters ) - bulgaria s foreign ministry said on friday any discussion about a revision of the treaty defining the borders of its neighbors greece and turkey would not help stability in the region .
the statement comes a day after turkish president tayyip erdogan said during a visit to greece that some details in the treaty of lausanne , which established the borders of modern-day turkey , were unclear and that a lasting solution to issues in the aegean and cyprus was needed .
bulgaria believes that a discussion of peace treaties and existing borders is not beneficial to the international community and stability in the region , the ministry said .
any revision of international treaties may only be done by mutual agreement between the countries in accordance with international law , it said , urging its neighbors to continue on the path of dialogue .
the ministry said it had discussed the issue with the turkish ambassador to sofia .
erdogan , making the first visit by a turkish president to greece in 65 years , said muslims in the greek border region of western thrace were not able to choose their own chief mufti , while christian communities in turkey enjoyed greater freedom to choose their patriarchs , suggesting the treaty was not being applied fairly .
greek president prokopis pavlopoulos also ruled out a revision of the 1923 lausanne treaty .
