TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida said on Thursday he agreed with visiting U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs were not permissible.
Tillerson, a former oil executive, arrived in Japan late on Wednesday on his first trip to Asia and will also visit South Korea and China.
Tillerson told a news conference with Kishida that they had affirmed a “strong and enduring” friendship between their countries, and U.S. commitment to Japan remained unwavering.
