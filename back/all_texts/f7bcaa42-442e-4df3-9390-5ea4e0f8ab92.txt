The 2016 crop of GOP Clown Car candidates is simply awful.
We have Donald Trump, who is a cartoonishly violent bigot with bottom-feeding imbecilic bigots for a base of supporters, and we have anti-gay, anti-woman neanderthal Ted Cruz, who is hellbent on turning America into his personal Evangelical church.
Then there s John Kasich, who is seemingly a bit more moderate, but not really.
At any rate, it s not like he stands a snowball s chance in hell at this point of snagging the nomination anyway.These sad facts have led to a literal civil war within the Republican Party, and many whispers that current Speaker of the House Paul Ryan might nose his way into the race at the last minute, should the Cleveland convention become contested.
There s just one problem with that pipe dream for establishment Republicans looking to save their party, though: Speaker Ryan has absolutely zero intention of running for President.On Tuesday, Ryan said of the prospect of his running in a radio interview, via Alan.com: I am not going to be the nominee, I don t want to be the nominee, Ryan said during a radio interview Tuesday.
If I wanted to be president, I would have run for president.
This is a very scary thing for the GOP, because Cruz is a universally disliked extremist who is known to do things such as embrace an idiot preacher who once tried to perform an exorcism on President Obama, and Trump is a flagrant racist and misogynist who gets off on starting wars with female Fox hosts with whom he disagrees.Paul Ryan is set to make a statement at 2:15 PM CST ( 3:15 PM EST) on Tuesday to put to rest the untrue rumors that he has any interest whatsoever of attempting to put himself into the Oval Office due to the fractured nature of his party.Good luck, GOP.
