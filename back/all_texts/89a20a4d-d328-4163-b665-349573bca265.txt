It s so funny that a lefty effort to harm President Trump has totally backfired again!
For starters, it s not like Trump s even in town for three weeks!
LiberalLogic: HEY!
Let's put up a #TrumpChicken in Washington DC while he is in New Jersey.
#ImWithStupid Kambree Kawahine Koa (@KamVTV) August 10, 2017 He s in New Jersey for 17 days while the White House has repairs done.
We re guessing this guy didn t get the memo on that!A man named Taran Singh Brar gave a statement about why he thought it was important to put a giant chicken with golden hair on the White House lawn: We are out here to criticize our president for being weak and ineffective as a leader and being too afraid to release his tax returns, too afraid to stand up to Putin and now engaged in a game of chicken with Kim Jong Un.
Yet he wants a military parade in DC.
It s all incongruous, and we are here to make fun of him for that.
I found my spirit animal y'all #TrumpChicken pic.twitter.com/jfe6VxTAWg Simar (@sahluwal) August 9, 2017 Lots of funny comments on Twitter referred to the inflatable chicken as the Trump chicken .
One twitter user even said he d found his spirit animal .
Responses by conservatives were positive and supportive of President Trump: We agree that it s pretty darn cute and that it sure has backfired on this guy.
