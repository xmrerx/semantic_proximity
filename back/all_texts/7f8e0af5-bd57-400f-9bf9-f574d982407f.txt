The notion that millennials are stupid, spoiled, uninformed voters who only care about themselves was shredded today after a new poll from the Harvard Institute of Politics showed millennial voters would overwhelmingly back Hillary Clinton in a general election matchup with Donald Trump.Collecting responses from over three thousand 18-29 year old voters showed Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton would garner 60 percent to Trump s 25 percent, an astonishing 36 point lead, while 14 percent remain undecided.So, in other words, the selfish, uninformed, spoiled millennials wouldn t back the actual selfish, spoiled, uninformed Republican front-runner.
Go figure.Not only do millenials overall have a highly unfavorable view of Trump overall, he isn t all that popular amongst young Republicans, either.
His bombastic, hateful nature has rubbed some young Republicans the wrong way:Overall, 60 percent of millennials want to see a Democrat occupy the White House in 2017, up five points from last year, while 40 percent want a Republican.
It seems even Republicans aren t so keen on having a racist, sexist, bombastic blowhard being their commander-in-chief.
When it comes to sheer image, Trump s favorability is negative 57 percent (17 percent favorable, 74 percent unfavorable).According to Politico:Harvard IOP polling director John Della Volpe told reporters Monday that Trump is playing a similar role in helping the Democratic nominee as former President George W. Bush did during Barack Obama s 2008 campaign.
I don t think there s a question about that, he said, and there s a lot of evidence that suggests that that s the case.
The day has come when Donald Trump is more hated than George W. Bush.
Democrats didn t even have to do anything.
Congratulations, GOP, you built that.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
