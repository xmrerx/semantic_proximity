Last year, in an effort to demonize Hillary Clinton staffers, Trump ally Michael Flynn famously said that immunity means you ve probably committed a crime a quote that is now coming back to bite him in his ass now that he is begging for immunity from prosecution in exchange for testifying against Donald Trump.What Flynn did or the extent of his crimes is still a mystery as is what Flynn knows but you don t ask for immunity unless you re ready to give up something big (like the President of the United States).
Trump, still running scared, tweeted his support of Flynn in this witch hunt.
Mike Flynn should ask for immunity in that this is a witch hunt (excuse for big election loss), by media & Dems, of historic proportion!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 31, 2017Now, Trump may call the Russia investigation a witch hunt especially now that his people are beginning to roll over on him but the consensus of 17 intelligence agencies is that Vladimir Putin personally spearheaded a massive fake news, propaganda, and hacking operation with the goal of helping Trump win.
Flynn, a retroactively-registered foreign agent, was fired for his specious contacts with Russian oligarchs.Trump s house is burning down, and the internet is rejoicing:@realDonaldTrump You and Flynn said that anyone involved with Hillary asking for immunity meant they were guilty.
Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) March 31, 2017@realDonaldTrump You don't ask for immunity unless you're guilty, and the FBI won't grant it unless there's a bigger fish to fry.You're the fish.

We'll just take this as an admission of guilt ?

You know exactly what they know, which means Winter is Coming.

(@Stareagle) March 31, 2017@realDonaldTrump Flynn was a foreign agent who lied about contact with Russians during the election WHO YOU HIRED as National Security Advisor.
You own this.
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) March 31, 2017 For the Justice Department to agree to give somebody like him immunity, it means they want him to turn and testify against someone higher up in the food chain, former chief of staff for both the CIA and Department of Defense and former counsel to the House Intelligence Committee, Jeremy Bash, told MSNBC after news broke that Flynn had been flipped: Who is higher up in the food chain, higher than the national security adviser?
There s really only one person, and so this shows that the jeopardy of criminal liability actually extends all the way to the top.
Flynn and Trump have both said that immunity is an indicator of guilt.
By their own admission, Flynn is guilty and there aren t exactly many people Flynn could give up aside from Trump.
