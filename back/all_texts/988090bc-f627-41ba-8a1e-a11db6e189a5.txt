On Friday, more than half the nation will mourn as a bigot with tiny hands and orange skin who is the physical embodiment of all that is wrong with our country is sworn into office.
The other 48 percent will celebrate by burning crosses or whatever racists do with their friends these days.
On Martin Luther King Day, punk band Green Day released a completely appropriate song that sums up this election and the resulting series of disasters both past and future perfectly.On Monday, our nation both celebrated the life of Dr. King and mourned the upcoming day when we hand over our car keys to the drunkest and most racist guy at the party.
While many took the opportunity to toss Trump a nice fuck you, no one did it quite like Green Day did by dropping their new music video for their song, Troubled Times.
Today we celebrate love and compassion more than ever, the band posted on Facebook in announcing the release of the song, which is over three minutes of anti-Trump goodness (especially if you watch the music video):Naturally, Trump s idiot fans rushed to the comment section of Green Day s YouTube post to prove the song right: Recently, Green Day pissed off conservatives when Billy Joe busted out a No Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA chant at the American Music Awards.
It.
Was.
Glorious:If Trump supporters want a music video just for him, though, we have a suggestion.
This ought to do just perfectly:The next four years will be interesting, to say the least not in a good way, but the same way the aftermath of a nuclear holocaust would be interesting.Featured image via Getty Images (Spencer Platt)/Pinterest
