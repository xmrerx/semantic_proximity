# breaking @ realbencarson on # foxreport : if after meeting and they ( trump transition team ) decide they want me , then i would n't turn it down harrisfaulkner ( @ harrisfaulkner ) november 21 , 2016 i didn t 100 % say that i would never serve .
i just said that my preference would be to stay outside .
basically i ve said , my preference was to be outside , and to act as an advisor .
but if after going through the process , they all conclude that , you now , that it would be much better to have me in the cabinet , i would have to give that some serious consideration .
it s just not my preference .
