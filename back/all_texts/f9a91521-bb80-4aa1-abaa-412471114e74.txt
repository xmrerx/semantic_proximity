LONDON (Reuters) - Britain does not believe its tax laws are incompatible with European Union rules, a spokeswoman for Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday after the EU opened an investigation into a British tax scheme.
We do not believe these rules are incompatible with EU law, but we will cooperate with the European Commission s investigation, the spokeswoman told reporters.
