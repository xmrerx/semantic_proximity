Fox News pundit and co-host Stacey Dash attracted a lot of negative comments with her recent comments that BET and the NAACP shouldn t exist.Actress Gabrielle Union is the star of BET s Being Mary Jane, and at a recent appearance at the Sundance Film Festival she put Dash s ignorant comments in their place.When asked about Dash s comments at the Sundance Film Festival premiere of The Birth of a Nation on Monday, Union first replied, Who s that?
Who s Stacey Dash?
Is she like related to Dame Dash?
Was she on Roc-A-Fella (Records)?
Union said the BET Awards remain necessary because of the lack of diversity in mainstream awards.
The more that we focus on inclusion and a true representation of this country, I think that crazy lady will have less to say, Union said of Dash.Dash s career hit its peak with her appearance in the 1990s comedy, Clueless, and since then she has been far more likely to appear in instantly forgettable direct-to-video movies than anything in the mainstream box office.A few years ago she discovered that there is a niche for her as a black pundit who is willing to attack black America, and began using her Twitter account to boost Mitt Romney s presidential campaign.
As that attracted expected pushback from her followers, Dash parlayed that into regular pundit appearances on Fox News, eventually becoming a co-host of the network s rip-off of The View, Outnumbered.On that show, Dash is the reliable source of outrageous, ill-informed quotes, often at the expense of black people to the delight of her Fox News bosses.
Sometimes, Dash has even gone to far for Fox, however, and she was recently suspended for saying that President Obama doesn t give a sh** about terrorism.
Though in reality, the offense for Fox News viewers was probably more that she swore on-air and not that she lied about Obama.Dash has a book coming out this summer about her transition from actress to right-winger, which gives credibility to the suspicion that Dash is in it for the money.Featured image via YouTube
