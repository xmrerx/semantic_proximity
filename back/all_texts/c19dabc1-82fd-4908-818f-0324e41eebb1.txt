LIBREVILLE (Reuters) - An attacker wielding a knife and crying Allahu Akbar has wounded two Danish journalists in Gabon s capital Libreville, the Gabonese defense minister said.
The two reporters for the National Geographic channel were in a popular market for tourist souvenirs on Saturday, when a Nigerien national living in Gabon lunged at them with the knife, Defence Minister Etienne Kabinda Makaga said in a statement on Gabonese television.
After his arrest, the 53-year-old suspect, who has lived in Gabon for two decades, told authorities he was carrying out a revenge attack against America for recognizing Israel s capital as Jerusalem, Makaga said, giving no further explanation.
A judicial investigation was immediately opened at the public prosecutor s office of Libreville to establish if the acts of the aggressor were isolated or a conspiracy, Makaga said.
Oil-rich Gabon has a small Muslim population consisting mostly of foreign workers, although the precise number is not known.
It is not normally considered a high risk country for jihadist violence.
