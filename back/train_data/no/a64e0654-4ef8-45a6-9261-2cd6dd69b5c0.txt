a harvard women s studies and islamic studies professor was forcibly taken off of a southwest flight today .
she demanded that two dogs be taken off of the plane because she said she s allergic to dogs .
well , things got ugly as you ll see in the now viral video : you can hear her yell , don t touch me !
at the 1:59 point she says , i m a professor !
we have many questions about this red flags everywhere ( see below ) ! ibloga reported : the woman , identified as 46-year-old anila daulatzai from baltimore , had complained about two dogs on her flight from baltimore-washington international airport to los angeles .
she said she was deathly allergic , but when crew informed her they couldn t remove the dogs , one of which was a service dog , she was told to leave the plane .
that s when things went south .
after the woman couldn t show medical papers about her allergies and refused to leave the plane , law enforcement arrived to remove her , southwest said in a statement.she s since been charged with disorderly conduct , failure to obey a reasonable and lawful order , disturbing the peace , obstructing and hindering a police officer and resisting arrest.we re wondering why you wouldn t carry papers or have some sort of id if you are severely allergic to dogs .
another reflag is that during her removal by police , the woman said , i need to close my pants .
hummm she also yells out that her dad has surgery tomorrow .
we re wondering if she is severely allergic to dogs then why didn t she run off the plane away from the dogs to tell someone ?
nothing adds up in this situation we smell a rat but we could be wrong .
we just see red flags everywhere with this woman : we found this about daulatzai :
