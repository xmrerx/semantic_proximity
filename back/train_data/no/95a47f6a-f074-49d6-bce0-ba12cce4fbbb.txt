in recent weeks , senate minority leader chuck schumer ( d-n.y. ) has threatened to lead his caucus in filibustering president donald trump s nominee to the supreme court , judge neil gorsuch , often citing a rule that a supreme court nominee needs a 60-vote supermajority in order to be appointed.the alleged rule has been debunked by fact-checkers , but schumer is still holding out , arguing that republicans would be violating the established norms of the senate if they were to subject trump s supreme court nominee to a simple up or down vote .
if judge gorsuch fails to earn 60 votes and fails to demonstrate he is mainstream enough to sit on the high court , we should change the nominee not the rules , schumer said in a wednesday press conference .
when pressed by sinclair broadcast group , he acknowledged that there was no hard and fast rule subjecting every supreme court nominee to approval by a supermajority , but we believe in a 60-vote threshold .
that belief is different from a rule .
and republicans are now arguing that even though the last four nominees to the supreme court were forced to overcome the 60-vote threshold for their lifetime appointments , it is not the standard.senate majority leader mitch mcconnell ( r-ky. ) said on wednesday that his democratic colleagues are invoking a mythical 60 vote standard that doesn t exist , because of their 2016 electoral loss .
a 60-vote threshold has never been the standard for a supreme court nomination .
the 60-vote standard was even debunked by the washington post fact-checker two months ago , saying democrats were using misleading and slippery language .
the claims by schumer and other leading democrats earned two pinocchios.via : fox 57
