Sarah Palin opened her mouth again and people quickly corrected her stupidity.Ever since the United Nations passed a resolution rightfully condemning Israel s continued refusal to stop building new settlements on Palestinian land, conservatives have been fuming about it.Donald Trump even threatened the United Nations and has been trashing the international organization.But now Sarah Palin is also telling Trump to ditch the U.N. in a move that would be similar to Brexit, in which the United States would pull out of the organization just as the United Kingdom pulled out of the European Union, a move that millions of UK voters now regret.
I think many of us have called for America to really step up and consider what it is that we are funding and supporting via the U.N., and how it works so hard really against U.S. interests, and just saying look what the U.K. just did, Palin told Breitbart.
This is such an encouraging time, where it s not just us, but those across the pond, too, are understanding that their nation s sovereignty and security are on the line here, with the ties that bind us to interests that really don t further our agendas.
Yes, God forbid that other nations have opinions, too.
When the U.K. made its move, it was just another reason to call yet again for the U.S. to get the heck out of the U.N. and get the U.N. out of the U.S., Palin continued.
Let s get going on putting America first so that we can sweep our own porch before telling other nations how to sweep theirs.
But the United Nations does not tell America what to do.
U.N. resolutions must be approved by the Senate to apply to the United States and we have the power to veto resolutions.Palin then pleaded with Trump to pull America out of the United Nations.
I called for our next president, Donald Trump, to call for the unshackling of the political bands tying us to the U.N.. By exiting the U.N., where injustice is actually rewarded, we then will be able to uphold America s reputation as the leader, and as the kind and compassionate and generous nation that we are as the nation sharing values that, when emulated by any other nation, can bring justice and equal rights to any other nation.
She then claimed that a revolution put Trump in office and that the same revolution will end the peacekeeping organization that has been around since after World War II.
It s our money funding the lion s share of the globalist circus.
It s we the people needing to rise up and make this a part of the revolution that we have just so benefited from.
Last time I checked, it s not a revolution when a presidential candidate loses the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes and has one of the smallest margins of victory in the electoral vote in history.But Palin crowed about her interview on Twitter and was soon put in her place by people with functioning brains.
@SarahPalinUSA @BreitbartNews yeah!
I ve been tired of the lack of large scale violent conflict between states.

Become isolationists?
How stupid is that?
Maryann Horsley (@thebooklady01) December 30, 2016Indeed, not only would America become isolationist, it would be giving up international power and prestige and the power vacuum in the United Nations would be filled by Russia and China, both of which certainly do not have our best interests at heart.There is a reason why we helped found the United Nations and getting rid of it now when we need it more than ever before would be a grave error that would put the world on the path to selfishness and the brink of war unlike anything we have ever witnessed.Featured image via Huffington Post
