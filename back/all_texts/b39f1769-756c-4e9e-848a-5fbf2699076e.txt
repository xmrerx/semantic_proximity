A growing group of artists is hitting back against Ivanka Trump, with some even demanding the president-elect s daughter take their work down off her walls.A collection of New York artists have banded together to protest Donald Trump through his daughter, with a campaign called Dear Ivanka .The colorful crusade was created by the Halt Action Group, which was founded by curator Alison Gingeras, dealer Bill Powers, Jonathan Horowitz, and a group of others associated with the art scene, Bloomberg reports.
Dear Ivanka, we need to talk about your dad, the group s website reads.
Racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny, and homophobia are not acceptable anywhere least of all in the White House.
Steve Bannon has no place in the White House.
Jeff Sessions has no place in the White House.
Talk of a Muslim registry has no place in the White House.
Hate has no place in the White House.
We refuse to wait and see .
We look to you as the voice of reason.
Other artists, many of whom have pieces in Ivanka s lavish apartment, have also chimed in on the issue.
Dear @Ivankatrump please get my work off of your walls.
