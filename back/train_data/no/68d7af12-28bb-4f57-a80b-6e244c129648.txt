sofia ( reuters ) - bulgaria has asked russian aircraft corporation mig to overhaul and maintain its 15 aged mig-29 fighter jets in a four-year deal worth up to 81.3 million levs ( $ 49 million ) , the country s defense ministry said on monday .
nato and eu member bulgaria needs to keep its soviet-era aircraft operational after plans to buy eight new fighter jets hit another snag .
the defense ministry will have to virtually restart the process and is yet to send requests for proposals to aircraft makers .
main contenders remain swedish manufacturer saab s gripen jets , portugal and the united states with secondhand f-16s and italy with secondhand eurofighter typhoons .
defence minister krasimir karakachanov has said bulgaria may also send a request to boeing for f-18 aircraft .
