Cosmetics brand Lush, popular among young girls and hipsters for their bath bombs, is launching a new anti-President Trump hair care product.According to Cosmopolitan, Lush announced plans to release a hair treatment called Yuge, a play on the way Trump pronounces the word huge, alongside an orange faced, tiny-handed man at their 2017 Lush Summit.The Yuge product is reportedly a hot oil treatment that will add volume and softness to your hair.
Cosmopolitan notes the product is not currently available as it is being tested on humans in the U.K. (Lush opposes animal testing).Here is an excerpt from the article that appears on Lush s homepage:The United States is in the midst of a trying political and social time that is being felt throughout North America and the world.
Intolerance, hostility, racism and fear have been pushed to the forefront and emotions are running high.
Because of this divisiveness, it s now more important than ever to stand up for inclusivity, compassion and respect for all people.Lush has always been, and will always be, a safe space for everyone regardless of immigration status, gender, race, age, sexual orientation, religion or political affiliation.
We love and encourage individuality, and our employees and customers are as diverse as the products we create.
That s what makes the Lush community so special.Lush s Welcome Refugees statement encourages people to share the hashtags #refugeeswelcome and #nobannowall and to visit the website for the International Rescue Committee to take action.
