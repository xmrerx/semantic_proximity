washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. state department said on tuesday that a new law allowing russia s justice ministry to list foreign media outlets as foreign agents posed a threat to free press and it urged moscow not to use the measure to tighten control over the media .
state department spokeswoman heather nauert said in a statement on tuesday , freedom of expression , including speech and media which a government may find inconvenient , is a universal human rights obligation russia has pledged to uphold .
she said russia s foreign agents law had been used to justify a constant stream of raids , harassment , and legal proceedings that effectively obstruct non-governmental organizations from doing their work .
the law , signed by president vladimir putin on saturday , allows moscow to force foreign media to brand news they provide to russians as the work of foreign agents and to disclose their funding sources .
the legislation was rushed through russia s parliament in two weeks after the united states required russian state broadcaster rt to register its u.s.-based affiliate company as a foreign agent .
nauert rejected any comparison between the u.s. and russian laws , saying the american law did not limit publication of information or restrict the organization s ability to operate .
the move is part of the fallout from allegations that russia interfered in last year s u.s. presidential campaign to try to help donald trump win .
u.s. intelligence officials have accused the kremlin of using russian media to influence u.s. voters .
moscow has denied meddling in the u.s. election .
expanding the foreign agents law to include media outlets opens the door to onerous requirements that could further stifle freedom of speech and editorial independence in russia , nauert said .
