By now, we re all sick and tired of hearing Donald Trump whine about fake news, especially when he s team is a major creator of it.Earlier today, Trump went on one of his routine Twitter rants about fake news and unfavorable coverage, targeting unwatchable MSNBC and CNN for their conspiracy theories and blind hatred.
To top it off, Trump happily endorsed Fox News, which has been proven to be the most dishonest media outlet there is.While Trump was whining about networks that tell the truth about how awful he is, CNN s Chris Cuomo hit back and completely shut him down.
Cuomo pointed out that for someone who hates CNN, Trump is one of their most loyal viewers.
Cuomo said: The president, as we know, watches New Day.
We appreciate that viewership.
He does not want to talk to us, but he does want to talk about us, and yet, this situation is different.
He has said nothing to rebut the facts of this situation.
On top of that, Cuomo and his colleagues spent the entire morning reporting on the details that Trump s senior advisors had been in constant communication with Russian intelligence during Trump s presidential campaign making Trump look like a complete idiot.Cuomo also pointed out that fact that Trump hasn t been able to give an answer regarding Russia s involvement in the election or General Michael Flynn s communications with Russia that have now caused him to resign just 24 days after beginning his role as national security advisor.
Cuomo said: Who knew?
The idea that Flynn had to resign because he was soloing with this unique agenda with Russia that nobody else knew about, nobody had told him to do and nobody participated in is hard to believe and goes without good answer from the White House.
Cuomo s attack on Trump is perfect, and hopefully it ll shut him up for a while so he can actually do his job:Featured image via screenshot and Alex Wong / Getty Images
