Is this apology too little too late?
After one year of bashing Trump, and with only one week left before the election, does this apology really matter now?A central Florida newspaper has apologized to its readers for the decidedly anti-Donald Trump coverage that has been published during the election.The Daily Commercial published an editorial titled The media, the election and bias on Oct. 23 that explained the paper is reliant on wire services for much of its election coverage and those reports are weighted heavily against Trump.
The Daily Commercial hasn t done enough to mitigate the anti-Trump wave in the pages of this paper, it wrote.
You deserve a more balanced approach to the coverage of elections and other weighty issues.
In what it described as an open letter that it described as part explanation, part reflection and part mea culpa the paper apologized to its readers.
