GOP Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska has been one of Trump s most vocal critics in the Republican Party.
He s also adamant that he s not going to the GOP convention this year; it seems he doesn t want to expose his kids to Trump.
He doesn t want to have anything to do with Trump, and he s going to nope the hell on out of there.To make his point, his spokesperson told The Hill the following: Sen. Sasse will not be attending the convention and will instead take his kids to watch some dumpster fires across the state, all of which enjoy more popularity than the current front-runners.
Burn!
That hurts.
When Trump met with GOP Senators on Thursday, things got heated when he decided that was just the peachiest of times to criticize Senators that don t like him, instead of, oh, actually behaving in a presidential manner and talking strategy, platform and other important things.
Sasse is one of the louder members of the Never Trump movement, and one of the Senators that Trump felt it appropriate to excoriate.There is nothing more important to His Royal Narcissist than how many people bow and scrape before his really gross little feet.
Those who resist?
He ll make sure they regret it.Sasse isn t the only one to have a snarky response for not attending the convention.
Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ) said he ll be mowing his lawn, and Steve Daines (R-MT) will be fly-fishing rather than doing anything to help Trump along.
These have to be the three most insulting reasons for not helping to officially crown the Fascist-in-Chief.Sasse s spokesperson invoked dumpster fires again when explaining why Sasse cannot and will not vote for Trump: Mr. Sasse continues to believe that our country is in a bad place, and, with these two candidates, this election remains a dumpster fire.
The burns just keep coming, and from a GOP Senator, are absolutely amazing.Featured image by Zach Gibson/Getty Images
