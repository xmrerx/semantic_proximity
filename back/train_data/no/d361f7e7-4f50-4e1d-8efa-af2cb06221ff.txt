ottawa ( reuters ) - the u.s. administration is putting its support behind a bill that would reduce the number of legal immigrants into the united states and prioritize high-skilled workers by setting up a merits-based system similar to those used by canada and australia .
to bring in skilled workers , canada uses a points system to assess immigrants ’ ability to enter the canadian workforce .
the majority of canada ’ s economic immigrants this year are expected to come from this so-called express entry system .
canada plans to allow 300,000 immigrants into the country this year .
applicants are ranked on their age , education , language ability , and work experience and earn points for each category up to 600 .
for example , people aged between 20-29 years get the maximum 100 points while those over 45 get zero for that category .
potential immigrants get additional points if they have a sibling who is a citizen or permanent resident of canada .
immigrants ’ spouses are assessed on the same criteria if they are also applying to come to canada .
for a full list of points awarded under the ranking system , see here with a population of about 35 million , the immigration target for 2017 amounts to 0.9 percent of the population .
according to the 2011 census , 20.6 percent of the population were foreign-born and immigrated to canada .
more recent numbers for 2016 will be released later this year .
the following are canada ’ s immigration targets by category for 2017 .
