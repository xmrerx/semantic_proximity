With the presidential race narrowing down to Donald Trump versus either Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders, the news has been pretty slow, and it leaves people to report on things like enthusiasm and how one candidate may beat another candidate.During a segment that was focused on Hillary hoping to shatter Trump s populist appeal, CNN chose to use Twitter to try to prove how popular Trump has been, so they featured one of his tweets explaining one of his recent rallies.The screen capture CNN chose to use featured a Trump tweet that said: Great rally in New Mexico, amazing crowd!
Now in L.A. Big rally in Anaheim.
However, what CNN didn t do was check to see what else was in the screen capture, because if they had, they probably wouldn t have used it.
The first reply listed under Trump s tweet stated: Does your c*ck match your skin color?
Like, is it orange?
Here s the image that was taken and has been circulating on Facebook:Image via CNNOops.
Looks like they didn t quite crop that image as well as they should and no one apparently caught it before it went to air.
Although, the question in the reply is still a valid one, but one not exactly appropriate for CNN s viewing audience.Nonetheless, this error is frickin hilarious for the rest of us.
So, CNN, never stop being you.Featured image via CNN
