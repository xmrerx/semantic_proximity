Firebrand conservative Ann Coulter exposed Delta Airlines who gave away a seat she had to pay extra for in order to accommodate her very long legs.Conservative columnist Ann Coulter flew into a fit of fury Saturday after Delta Airlines booted her from her reserved Comfort+ seat which comes with 3 additional inches of legroom and gave it to another passenger.In a two-hour tweeting tantrum,she quoted her exchange with a flight attendant: Why are you taking me out of the extra room seat I specifically booked?
she asked.Their answer, she said, was I don t know.
Here s an example of one of Coulter s tweets exposing Delta Airlines for giving her pre-paid seat with extra legroom away to a shorter passenger:Suckiest @Delta moved me from my PRE-BOOKED SEAT & gave it to some woman, not elderly, child, or sick.
I have pictures so don t lie, @Delta!
Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) July 16, 2017Ann Coulter isn t the only person fed up with the shrinking seats on commercial airlines.
Taller passengers are tired of traveling with their knees into their chest or being forced to sit sideways to accommodate their longer legs.
And we haven t even discussed the limited room in seats for people who may be a little wider in the caboose.
It appears that the federal government has decided to step in and flex their muscles, as they attempt to control decisions private airlines make about the size of their seats.Is it the government s job to determine how much space commercial airlines designate for their customers?A federal judge has ordered the Federal Aviation Administration to review seat sizes and legroom on commercial airlines.It s a victory for Flyers Rights, an advocacy group that has pushed for new rules regulating seat sizes.Flyers Rights says small airlines seats can put people s health at risk with conditions like blood clots in legs.They also say the average size of the seat itself has shrunk, along with space between the one behind.According to a report by Business Insider, the major airline that has the most space between seats is JetBlue, with 34 inches apart.The airline that boasted the least room was Spirit, with 28 inches between seats.Delta Air Lines and American Airlines were in the middle, with 31 inches between seats.
Virgin America and Southwest had 32 inches, according to the report.
