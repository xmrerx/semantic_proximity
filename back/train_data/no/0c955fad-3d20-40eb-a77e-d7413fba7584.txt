rome ( reuters ) - an italian man was sentenced on friday to 24 years in prison for infecting more than 30 women with the hiv virus , after having unprotected sex with them despite knowing that he was hiv positive , a court ruled .
valentino talluto , a 33-year-old accountant , seduced dozens of women via social networks for a decade before his arrest in november 2015 .
police believe he had sex with at least 53 women during that time , passing on the virus to 32 of them .
the male partners of three of the women subsequently contracted the potentially fatal illness , as did an eight-month-old infant of a fourth woman .
talluto often found an excuse not to wear a condom , telling his partners that he was allergic to them , or had just had an hiv test , the court in rome heard .
he expressed regret for what had happened , but said he did not realize the consequences of his actions .
prosecutors had urged the court to give him life in jail , saying he had provoked an hiv epidemic .
the court rejected this , convicting him instead of grievous and incurable bodily harm .
many of the women only discovered they had hiv after they heard of talluto s arrest and had a test .
the hiv/aids pandemic has killed around 35 million people worldwide since it began in the 1980s .
