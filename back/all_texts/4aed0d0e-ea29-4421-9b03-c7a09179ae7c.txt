Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Reince Priebus reacted to FBI Director James Comey s letter on Sunday informing Congress the agency will not change its previous decision to not recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton in the e-mail probe.Priebus released the following statement reminding voters the FBI continues to investigate the Clinton Foundation: The FBI s findings from its criminal investigation of Hillary Clinton s secret email server were a damning and unprecedented indictment of her judgment.
The FBI found evidence Clinton broke the law, that she placed highly classified national security information at risk and repeatedly lied to the American people about her reckless conduct.
None of this changes the fact that the FBI continues to investigate the Clinton Foundation for corruption involving her tenure as secretary of state.
Hillary Clinton should never be president.
Last week, Fox News cited two sources with intimate knowledge of the FBI s investigations as saying the agency s probes into the Clinton Foundation continue to be a very high priority among local agents on the ground.Fox News further reported:Agents have interviewed and re-interviewed multiple people on the foundation case, which is looking into possible pay for play interaction between then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Clinton Foundation.
The FBI s White Collar Crime Division is handling the investigation.There is a split, however, between local investigators and FBI headquarters, as well as with the Justice Department.Here is the full text of Comey s letter on Sunday informing lawmakers of the FBI s decision to not alter the agency s conclusion reached last July that it will not recommend charges against Clinton in the email case:I write to supplement my October 28, 2016 letter that notified you the FBI would be taking additional investigative steps with respect to former Secretary of State Clinton s use of a personal email server.Since my letter, the FBI investigative team has been working around the clock to process and review a large volume of emails from a device obtained in connection with an unrelated criminal investigation.During that process, we reviewed all of the communications that were to or from Hillary Clinton while she was Secretary of State.Based on our review, we have not changed our conclusions that we expressed in July with respect to Secretary Clinton.I am very grateful to the professionals at the FBI for doing an extraordinary amount of high-quality work in a short period of time.
