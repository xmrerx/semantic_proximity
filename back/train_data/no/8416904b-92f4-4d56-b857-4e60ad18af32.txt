kanye west announced on twitter this week that he s $ 53 million in debt .
he immediately began begging for help from white billionaires .
the very next day , west took to twitter to announce he doesn t want white publications covering black musicians anymore .
how and why does this racist black rapper get a pass from the media after making such clearly racist and ignorant comments ?
watch the video below to see west s interview with saturdaynightonline.com host garrett , as he compares his dangerous career as a rapper to that of a cop on patrol or soldier at war .
i m putting my life at risk , literally !
when i think about when i m on the can t tell me nothing , and coldest winter moment , like that mountain goes really , really high .
and if i slipped you never know .
and i think about it .
i think about my family and i m like , wow , this is like being a police officer or something , in war or something .
it s pretty sad that a guy with no talent has been given so much opportunity in america , and has literally blown it because he can t keep his big fat , hateful racist mouth shut .
