we all know the defense of children comes dead last when it comes to the left .
it s interesting how hillary helped to get a child rapist off ( before she still had her law license taken away ) and now nearly a decade later , this news about bernie s support for child molesters and his non-support for the amber alert by way of his no vote what s happened to bernie- 2006 anti-bernie by dailypolitics back in 2006 , when sanders was running for the senate , republican richard tarrant pointed out some things about the socialist s voting record he probably doesn t want his liberal flock to know.for example , sanders voted against the amber alert system and refused to endorse a bill that would lock away child molesters for life.via : downtrend
