BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany and the United States disagree on how to handle the standoff with North Korea, Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday, condemning U.S. President Donald Trump s threat to totally destroy the reclusive state.
Merkel, who is expected to win a fourth term in an election on Sunday, said sanctions and diplomacy were the only way to get the nuclear armed state to the negotiating table.
I am against such threats, Merkel told the Deutsche Welle broadcaster when asked about Trump s remarks at the United Nations.
We consider any form of military solution as totally inappropriate and we insist on a diplomatic solution.
She added: From my point of view sanctions and their implementation are the right answer.
But I consider everything else concerning North Korea as wrong.
Merkel said she told Trump by telephone a few days ago that a diplomatic solution must be found.
