mexico city ( reuters ) - at least three people died after torrential rain from tropical storm lidia provoked major flooding around mexico s popular los cabos beach resort on friday , authorities said .
featuring maximum sustained winds of 60 miles per hour ( 97 kph ) , the storm was projected to move north over a large swath of mexico s baja california peninsula before turning west toward the pacific on sunday .
local television footage showed abandoned cars and trucks in washed-out roads , as well as destroyed beach-front structures .
lidia , about 55 miles ( 89 km ) north-northeast of cabo san lazaro , was moving at a speed of 12 miles per hour ( 19 kmh ) as it skirted the western coast of the peninsula , according to an advisory from the miami-based national hurricane center ( nhc ) .
luis felipe puente , the head of national emergency services , told reuters that the storm claimed a child and two adults who were trying to cross a raging river .
lidia also provoked power outages , damaged houses and roads , as well as forcing some 2,800 people into local shelters .
while the storm is forecast to further weaken over the next couple of days , it is expected to dump between 6 to 12 inches ( 15-30 cm ) of rain across the peninsula as well as parts of sinaloa and sonora states .
these rains may cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides , the nhc said in its advisory .
