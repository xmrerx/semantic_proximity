Mall Santas have one job: be jolly.
Unfortunately, that was too much for one Trump-loving douchebag in a red suit to handle.WWLP reports that a mall Santa was removed from the building after he was caught bashing Hillary Clinton when he was supposed to be listening to what kids wanted for Christmas.
The unnamed fake-bearded Deplorable was working at the Seminole Towne Center in Sanford, Florida when he told a little girl she was on his nice list which would be sweet if it wasn t a lead-in to an attack on the winner of the popular vote.
Do you know who is on my naughty list?
the creepy Santa asked the little girl.
Hillary Clinton.
In fact, according to Santa, the former Secretary of State s name is the only one on the naughty list.
Then he laughed like he just did something clever rather than prove to a child that Santa is a terrible person.The girl s mother called management and Santa was quickly dragged away to the North Pole (or HR mediation, whichever you prefer) so he would not be a further terrible influence on children.
He was replaced with another of Santa s helpers hopefully one who knows that it s not St. Nick s job to talk politics with children.A spokesman for the Noerr Programs, the company in charge of staffing mall Santas, said in a statement that the Santa will not be fired from his job, but that he was given additional training.
He is allowed to work with children at another location, but will not be returning to the Seminole Towne Center.
It is unclear to how many other children Santa spread his poisonous message of hate, but no amount of training can keep him from being a terrible person.Watch a report on the incident below:Featured image via Defend Christmas
