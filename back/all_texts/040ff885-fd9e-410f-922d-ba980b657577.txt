Here s how Bill is paying back years of loyalty by his enabling wife Hillary, who made it possible for him to sexually assault an untold number of women.
With Bill s magnanimous personality and Hillary s less than likable aura and fingernails on a blackboard orator skills, Bill has had her right where any strong and capable woman wouldn t have allowed herself to be in his back pocket.
Hillary has allowed herself to be portrayed in the media as a victim and a loyal wife to her impeached husband.
The truth is, Hillary needed (and still needs) Bill more than he ever needed her.
It s precisely because of Hillary that Bill was able to prey on so many women and keep them quite afterwards.
According to several sources, Hillary worked behind the scenes, threatening to do harm to any woman who would dare to come forward and expose her perverted husband for fear of destroying her insatiable desire for a powerful position in politics.During an Oct, 2014 interview, former advisor to President Bill Clinton, Dick Morris said it was then-first lady Hillary Clinton s Nixonian attempt to attack the woman Bill Clinton victimized and sexually harassed by hiring detectives to dig for dirt in their lives Hillary could use against them to smear their character.
Dick Morris said he believes Bill was a very good president but he left because he said, What really turned me off was what I call secret police.
When she [Hillary] hired this fleet of detectives to go around examining all of the woman who had been identified with Clinton.
Not for the purpose of divorcing Clinton.
Not for the purpose of getting him to stop but for the purpose of developing blackmail material on these woman to cow them into silence that had a Nixonian quality that I hold against her and I continue to.
