This morning President Trump called for a meeting of his inner circle in order to figure out how to respond to yesterday s news that a special prosecutor has been appointed by the FBI.Reportedly, he called together Steve Bannon, Hope Hicks, Kellyanne Conway, Reince Priebus, and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.
At the meeting, Mr. Kushner begged the president to go on the attack, pleading with him to fight back against special prosecutor and former FBI Director Robert Mueller.
Immediately after the meeting, Trump took to Twitter to start trying to discredit Mueller, whining about how unfair it was that his corrupt presidency is being investigated.This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 18, 2017He referred to unnamed illegal acts in the Obama administration without clarifying what he might have meant.
With all of the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special counsel appointed!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 18, 2017Trump s strategy, as it always is, seems to be to attack everyone else for his incompetence.
Unfortunately Mr. Mueller is widely respected by both parties, so Trump may find it hard to make his smears stick.This is unspinnably bad for Trump.Mueller is serious, and a good man.
This also signals that the FBI isn't playing games.
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) May 17, 2017GOP operative Rick Wilson immediately recognized how much trouble Trump is in.
He was joined by the Republican rank and file, who are losing patience in a hurry.
@realDonaldTrump as an American who for some reason voted for you.
I now know I let my county down 1 817-903-4520 (@Elite_BatmanxX) May 18, 2017@realDonaldTrump I am starting to regret that I had voted for you.
Meeting was close doors with Russia press only.
You becoming a shame to everyone (sad) Hank Salmons (@HankJr660) May 16, 2017President Trump seems to agree with his son-in-law that the best way out of this mess it to go on the offensive.
Reportedly, word has gone out to all Trump surrogates to start discrediting the messenger since they can t attack the message.
Whether or not this strategy will work remains to be seen, but administration officials have already gotten their marching orders.
Sources say that Sean Spicer, who has been absent from his podium since yesterday, is being briefed extensively about the president s plan for replying to these allegations.
This is reportedly his last chance with the administration, and if he doesn t play ball, he s out.
