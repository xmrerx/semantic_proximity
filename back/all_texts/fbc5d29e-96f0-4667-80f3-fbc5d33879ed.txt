If Republicans were even moderately literate, they would know that the message of Shakespeare s Julius Caesar is that assassinating leaders you don t like is just bad juju all around.
Everyone ends up unhappy in the end.
Enter Donald Trump Jr, stage far-Right.Shortly after the guy who shot GOP Rep. Steve Scalise and four other people at baseball practice was revealed to be a Green Party person who voted for Jill Stein, regularly bashed Hillary Clinton, and who happened to volunteer for Bernie Sanders campaign, Donald Trump Jr. hopped on Twitter to blame a bunch of actors.
Events like today are EXACTLY why we took issue with NY elites glorifying the assassination of our President, the tweet reads.
It is, of course, referencing the Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar.
Traditionally, the play has featured various world leaders, including Abraham Lincoln, in the role of Caesar.
In 2013, for example, the very same play with the very same script featured a man who looked strikingly similar to Barack Obama.
He was murdered, because the play s plot largely hinges on the historical fact that Julius Caesar was murdered.
Here is a photo of the 2013 Caesar:Conservatives said nothing at the time because it was Barack Obama, but when Donald Trump the current President* was Caesar, all hell broke loose because Republicans, as a group, are f*cking morons.Fortunately, the fine folks on Twitter were kind enough to let him know that he s too stupid to know he s stupid:The point of the play is that political violence is wrong.That s like saying we shouldn t watch Saving Private Ryan or it ll lead to war.

Is Donald Trump Jr. complaining about New York elites?
Rod Johnson (@hauterodjohnson) June 14, 2017In fairness to Fox, it s probably safe to assume Shakespeare would have detested Trump.
Rod Johnson (@hauterodjohnson) June 14, 2017I m afraid they are too ignorant of the plays meaning to see the correlation to modern times.
They only see the Trump/Cesar being stabbed Ellen.

Literally?
Then she was shot.

GrifterIvanka (@notimeforthis24) June 14, 2017I didn t see anyone speaking up 5 years ago when the play was about assassinating Obama Impeach Trump (@ForgetTrump2020) June 14, 2017The moral of the play is that violence is wrong.
Did you never read Julius Caesar?
why are you politicizing the shooting in VA?
#Alexandria Janice Fredericks (@JanFred1903) June 14, 2017you re both so fucking stupid.
it s Shakespeare, you inbred cum stain.

cx (@cxcope) June 14, 2017Were these people shot by a piece of art or a gun, you fucking idiot?
Sean Hartofilis (@BeachPillows) June 14, 2017Hey Jr, Your father on LIVE TV actually rallied for his supporters to exercise their 2nd Amendment rights against HIlary Clinton.
Hypocrite!

CamiSheffield (@CamiAnnS) June 14, 2017 Basically, if you haven t noticed, the GOP is effectively fictional detective Frank Drebin lately:(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));This scene has never been funnier.Posted by John Prager on Monday, June 12, 2017While we could not reasonably expect anyone from the Trump family aside from Barron to present a reasonable response to anything the kid was the only person who showed any sign of dismay when one of Trump s supporters shouted out that Obama should be killed at his father s inauguration, after all it is still disappointing that Don Jr., like all Republicans, refuses to address the fact that nothing was done to prevent him from getting a gun.Featured image via Getty Images (Win McNamee)/screengrab
