Once again, the NRA s favored masturbatory aid is responsible for the death of a child.
The terrorist group masquerading as a gun rights organization regularly informs us that keeping a gun in the home is probably the safest thing someone can do for his family next to hiring an army of ninja chimpanzees, but the truth is that both can lead to unintended and disastrous consequences the sort that took the life of 5-year-old Haley Moore on Saturday.Neighbors describe Moore s father, Eric (a retired veteran the NRA would normally use as the poster-ammosexual for gun safety), as being vigilant about keeping his guns out of the hands of his child the sort of thing we can expect the NRA to say about most parents who bravely decide to transform their homes into veritable armories but reality, unfortunately, reared its ugly head when he decided to take a shower at around 9:45 a.m., leaving a loaded .45 handgun on the table.Next door neighbor Joy Ursin told WVUE that she learned what happened when Haley s terrified older siblings informed her: The oldest kid, she told me because they came over to us when all this happened, she s traumatized, my sister, my sister shot herself.
Ursin says she comforted the older children as their father called law enforcement after he finished his shower, that is.
The gun should ve been locked up but at the same time, you should, I think that from an early age, getting children familiar with them and enough to know it s not a toy is the biggest thing, Labat said telling the news station that it s definitely sad when something like this happens.
Unfortunately, this isn t the solution either.
Not only does the simple act of keeping a firearm in the home increase the risk of harm coming to yourself or your family members, but Mother Jones noted in 2013 that For every time a gun is used in self-defense in the home, there are 7 assaults or murders, 11 suicide attempts, and 4 accidents involving guns in or around a home.
While it is comforting for some to think that a child well-informed about the dangers of guns will not touch them, an ABC experiment in which children were exposed to hidden firearms directly after taking a NRA gun safety class ignored the danger and (for the most part) played with the guns they found anyway.Haley died from her injuries in the hospital, another victim of the NRA s jihad against sanity.It is unclear if Eric will be charged with a crime for causing his daughter s death, but we won t be holding our collective breath.Watch a report on the senseless and completely avoidable death below:FOX 8 WVUE New Orleans News, Weather, Sports, SocialFeatured image via Facebook
