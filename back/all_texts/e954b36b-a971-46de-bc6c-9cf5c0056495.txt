MADRID (Reuters) - Spain s state prosecutor on Thursday asked a High court judge to issue a European arrest warrant for ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont after he failed to appear at a court hearing earlier in the day.
Puigdemont s lawyer in Belgium, where he has traveled with four members of his sacked cabinet, said the climate in Spain was not good and his client wanted to maintain some distance; but he would cooperate with the courts.
