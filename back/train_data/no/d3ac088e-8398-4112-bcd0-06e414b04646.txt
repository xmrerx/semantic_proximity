julian assange on hillary clinton in an interview with russia today ( video below ) : rattansi : if there is any illegality in the pending emails you will release or malfesance in what you alreaday released president obama could presumably act on it and get hillary clinton charged ?
regardless on whether you are about to release any email which would mean that james comey and the fbi would have no alternative but to arrest hillary clinton ? assange : our view which we have already stated is if the evidence that the fbi has is enough for a grand jury to indict already but a prosecutor has to ask a grand jury to indict .
and if a prosecutor doesn t ask , a grand jury won t indict .
the us government at the times when hillary clinton was in charge of the foreign policy did use libya as a conduit to get arms to jihadists in syria .
that is well-established not just by a range of raw materials but also by investigative reporters in the us , some of which were even published in the new york times .
la farge , which is giant transnational concrete company was involved in syria .
there are more than 350 la farge related emails in our syria emails release .
the investigations by le monde reveals that they paid isis money , taxes for their operations in certain areas , were engaged in a variety of business deals with isis .
money from la farge in 2015 and 2016 went to hillary clinton foundation .
there is actually a long-term relationship between la farge and clinton ; she was a member of the board .
there is also an extensive relationship between hillary clinton and saudi arabia , between the clinton foundation and saudi arabia .
saudi arabia is probably the largest single donor to the clinton foundation and you can see clinton s arms export policies when she was a secretary of state favoring extensively saudi arabia .
