president trump gave the commencement speech for the coast guard graduating class and hit back at the media during the speech : the coast guard academy was the location for the speech but the speech could be directed at all aemricans plus the media and critics of trump .
he says what everyone else is thinking awesome !
now i want to take this opportunity to offer you some advice .
over the course of your life you will find that things are not always fair .
you will find that things happen to you that you do not deserve you have to put your head down and fight , fight , fight !
never ever , ever give up .
things will turn out just fine .
no politician in history has been treated worse or more unfairly .
you can t let them get you down .
you can t let the critics and naysayers get in the way of your dreams .
trump added : the people understand what i m doing and that s the most important thing .
i didn t t get elected to serve the washington media or the special interests , he said .
i got elected to serve the forgotten men and women and that s what i m doing .
great speech !
he nails it ! full speech : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=snzzxf2gk7u
