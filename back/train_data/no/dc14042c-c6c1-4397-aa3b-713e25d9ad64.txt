khartoum ( reuters ) - sudan regrets that the united states has placed it on a list of states not doing enough to combat human trafficking , the foreign ministry said on thursday , a week before washington was due to announce a decision on lifting sanctions against the country .
it said washington had not appreciated the big steps khartoum had made to alleviate the plight of victims of human trafficking .
the united states has said it is deciding whether to lift a raft of penalties imposed first over khartoum s perceived support of global terrorism and later its violent suppression of rebels in darfur .
the deadline for that decision is oct. 12 and sudan expects the economic sanctions will be lifted .
but the white house said last saturday that it had ordered a group of countries , including iran , venezuela and sudan , to be added to a u.s. list of countries accused of failing to crack down on human trafficking .
the foreign ministry expresses its regret over the united states administration s sept. 30 decision to put sudan on a list of states accused of not doing enough to limit human trafficking instead of highlighting the massive efforts being made , it said in a statement .
sudan had built shelters for victims and provided support , as well as made strides toward policing its borders , the ministry said .
it called on the united states to provide it with support in order to help it further improve its efforts .
