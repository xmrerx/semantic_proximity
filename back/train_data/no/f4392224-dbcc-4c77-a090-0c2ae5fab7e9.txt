karachi , pakistan ( reuters ) - muslims in pakistan crowded mosques and prayer grounds across the country to offer prayers and sacrifice goats and cows for eid al-adha holiday on saturday , marking the second major religious festival of islam .
security was tight , with authorities on guard from any possible attack by religious extremists who have carried out bombings across the country in recent years .
today , we are here to offer eid prayers , said worshipper saleem ahmed at a ceremony in karachi , pakistan s largest city .
the security arrangements were very good .
may allah approve our prayers .
eid al-adha commemorates the koranic tale of the prophet abraham s willingness to sacrifice his son as an act of obedience to allah , before allah replaced the son with a ram to be sacrificed instead .
a similar story involving abraham is recounted in the holy books of judaism and christianity .
it is tradition for those who can afford it to sacrifice domestic animals as a symbol of abraham s willingness to sacrifice his only son .
the result is a booming pre-holiday trade in goats , cows and sheep .
in pakistan alone , nearly 10 million animals , worth more than $ 3 billion , are slaughtered during the two days of eid al-adha , according to the pakistan tanners association .
we are presenting sacrifices to follow the path of the prophet abraham .
we should not forget our poor and needy muslim brethren on this occasion , karachi resident mohamad muzammil said at the prayer ground where cows and goats were being slaughtered .
eid al-adha marks the end of an annual hajj , or pilgrimage to mecca , which is one of the five pillars of islam , and should be undertaken by every muslim who can afford to do so .
with a population of about 208 million people , pakistan is the sixth most-populous country in the world , and has the second largest muslim population after indonesia .
about 97 percent of pakistanis are muslims .
