pristina ( reuters ) - a kosovo prosecutor withdrew his bid on thursday to extradite a turkish citizen accused by turkey of being part of a group linked to a failed coup there in 2016 , saying ankara had not provided enough evidence to back the case .
ugur toksoy was arrested in october at the request of prosecutors in the turkish region of hatay , on charges of working for an ngo in kosovo linked to u.s.-based cleric fetullah gulen , whom ankara accuses of masterminding a failed coup attempt in 2016 .
the hatay prosecutors said toksoy had participated in the attempted coup .
gulen has denied any involvement in the attempted coup .
the kosovo prosecutor told the judge in withdrawing his case that he had asked the turkish embassy to provide more evidence but had not received any .
he said he could start the case again if turkey sends more evidence .
justice in kosovo has won with this verdict because there was no evidence for extradition , toksoy s lawyer adem vokshi said after the session was over .
if turkey had proof about him , they would have sent it by now .
toksoy is one of two kosovo-based turks named on a turkish wanted list of 11 people issued by the public prosecutor in hatay province bordering syria and seen by reuters .
the others are listed as living in austria , thailand , mauritania , romania and lithuania .
gulen-linked schools and foundations have been facing funding problems and closing in the balkans and elsewhere .
kosovo has refused to close gulen schools on its soil , while turkish government-supported schools are also being opened across the country .
turkey remains one of the biggest supporters of kosovo s independence and its companies run the country s sole airport , own electricity distribution and have won the tenders to build two highways worth around $ 2 billion .
