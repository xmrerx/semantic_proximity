washington ( reuters ) - the pentagon said on wednesday it would soon carry out the first exercise in a decade involving three aircraft carrier strike groups in the western pacific , confirming a reuters report published on monday .
it is a rare opportunity to train with two aircraft carriers together , and even rarer to be able to train with three , admiral scott swift , u.s. pacific fleet commander , said in a statement , adding the drills would take place from saturday to tuesday .
u.s. president donald trump will be traveling in asia during the initial days of the drills .
multiple carrier strike force operations are very complex , and this exercise in the western pacific is a strong testament to the u.s. pacific fleet s unique ability and ironclad commitment to the continued security and stability of the region , swift said .
