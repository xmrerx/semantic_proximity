WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bill to fund the U.S. government cleared a procedural hurdle in the Senate on Friday and appeared poised to pass the chamber, averting a government shutdown.
The vote, 61-38, came after Democrats who sought more generous healthcare benefits for coal miners in the bill, ended their attempts to delay action on the measure.
