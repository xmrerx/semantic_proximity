If you haven t noticed by now that Donald Trump rallies have become white pride events then you are either willfully ignorant, or living under a rock.
In fact, some of Trump s most fervent supporters are members of white supremacist groups, including former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke.
It s gotten to the point where shouting Trump Trump Trump is synonymous with shouting white pride.
And if you disagree with that sentiment, take a good long look at yourself in the mirror and think about why you disagree.Noticing how racist Trump supporters are, along with the rest of the sane world, is none other than the folks over at Saturday Night Live.
They put together the perfect spoof campaign ad to attack these nincompoops head-on.
In a sketch titled, Racists for Trump they start by showing what seems to be average Americans working hard and simply loving what Trump stands for.
The commercial begins: The media s been saying some pretty negative things about Donald Trump, but what are real Americans saying?
Trump was then labeled a winner, authentic, job creator, negotiator, an outsider, and above all else, the candidate who can Make America Great Again.
It s at that point when it s revealed that all the supporters speaking are involved some way or another in a white supremacist organization.
Whether it be neo-Nazis, the KKK, or simply white pride, SNL does not hold back in slamming the hate and bigotry that s been spewing out of the Trump campaign alongside his supporters.But of course, all that hate is disguised in clever coded language to make it seem like we don t notice, but guess what?
We notice.Bravo to SNL, this is absolutely perfect.
Well done.Featured image via image screen capture
