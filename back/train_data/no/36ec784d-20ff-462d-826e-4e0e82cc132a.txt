obama had a chance to speak of the horrors going on in the middle east and to say so much more but he chose to behave like a college professor and lecture the iranians : that path is now available to a nation like iran , which , as of this moment , continues to deploy violent proxies to advance its interests .
these efforts may appear to give iran leverage in disputes with neighbors , but they fuel sectarian conflict that endangers the entire region and isolates iran from the promise of trade and commerce .
the iranian people have a proud history and are filled with extraordinary petition , but chanting death to america does not create jobs or make iran more secure .
what a putz !
