cnn s parent company time warner was a major sponsor of the trump assassination play in central park .
in the play , the actor who was made to look like our president , was brutally attacked and assassinated on stage while the audience , which included children , clapped like seals.here s a new take on the video : hey @ kfile , you can quote me on this : # cnnblackmail pic.twitter.com/jghhfapbnu aaron ( @ aaron25394187 ) july 5 , 2017here are a few images from the trump assassination play : imagine the outrage if this bloodied actor was made to look like former president barack obama : cnn promptly threatened to release the private identity of the reddit user who made the video with the cnn logo covering the head of the wwe chairman .
