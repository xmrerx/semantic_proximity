the gun grabbers are at it again pushing for more oversight and background checks for gun owners .
the sheriff says it s borderline treasonous and will be a nightmare for law enforcement .
he s refusing to enforce these efforts at gun control and we salute him for his stance !
bravo ! while oregon democrats stood with gabby giffords and the brady campaign to prevent gun violence to push expanded background checks on april 1 , grant county sheriff glenn palmer stood for the law-abiding citizens whom the checks will target by describing the gun control push as borderline treasonous .
palmer also made clear that if the democrats pass the measure there is zero chance of his office enforcing it.the push for expanded background checks in oregon is being spearheaded by state senator floyd prozanski ( d-eugene ) .
his efforts are strongly supported by the brady campaign and giffords.giffords , in particular , believes every potential gun purchaser should have to pass the same background check her attacker passed to acquire his firearm , which the same background check jerad and amanda miller ( las vegas ) , aaron ybarra ( seattle pacific university ) , elliot rodger ( santa barbara ) , ivan lopez ( fort hood 2014 ) , darion marcus aguilar ( maryland mall ) , karl halverson pierson ( arapahoe high school ) , james holmes ( aurora theater ) , nidal hasan ( fort hood 2009 ) , and many , many others passed to get the guns they used in their crimes.the irony is not lost on sheriff palmer , who sees the push for expanded background checks as just another way to infringe on the second amendment rights of law-abiding citizens without impacting crime or criminals .
for these reasons , oregon live said palmer described the push as borderline treasonous .
moreover , palmer said the background checks pose a nightmare scenario for law enforcement officers who will be straddled with the responsibility of determining when a background should have been done but was not , as well as when a background check is not necessary to begin with.palmer said he has no intention of enforcing prozanski s bill if it becomes law.via : breitbart news
