WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump on Monday suffered another political setback when U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan distanced himself from the Republican presidential candidateâ€™s troubled campaign.
Ryan, according to someone familiar with a conference call held by the speaker and House Republican lawmakers, will not campaign with Trump in the run-up to the Nov. 8 elections and will not defend the Republican Party nominee.
The source did not say whether Ryan intended to withdraw his support for Trump.
But a spokeswoman added that the Wisconsin congressman will focus on maintaining a Republican majority in the House.
