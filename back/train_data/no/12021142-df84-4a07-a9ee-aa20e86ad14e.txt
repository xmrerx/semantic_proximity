vienna ( reuters ) - the european union is increasingly willing to consider western balkan states joining the bloc , which could help ensure peace in the region while enriching the eu itself , the bloc s integration commissioner said .
there is more willingness among ( eu ) member states to address an enlargement ( than a year ago ) , johannes hahn told austrian daily wiener zeitung in an interview published on tuesday .
albania , macedonia , montenegro and serbia are official candidates for eu membership while bosnia and kosovo are seeking the same status .
the eu sees the region as important for issues from controlling immigration to countering security threats ranging from alleged interference of russia to radical islam .
member states have realized that peace could be achieved in the balkans and that the perspective of joining the eu is vital for it , hahn said .
the western balkans and its 20 million people who are keen on developing their prosperity were a very attractive market for the bloc , hahn said , adding that a new member state is not a burden but an enrichment .
the commissioner said he did not support the idea of a multi speed europe as this would lead to member states drifting apart .
instead , every effort should be made to enable weaker states to catch up to strengthen the european union , he said .
