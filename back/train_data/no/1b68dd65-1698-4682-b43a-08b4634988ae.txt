frankfurt ( reuters ) - facebook said on wednesday its efforts to fight fake news during germany s national elections included taking down tens of thousands of fake profiles in the final month of the campaign .
richard allan , facebook s vice president of public policy for europe , middle east africa , said the silicon valley-based company mounted an array of efforts to ensure the social media network was not used as a platform to manipulate public opinion .
these actions did not eliminate misinformation entirely in this election but they did make it harder to spread , and less likely to appear in people s news feeds , the facebook executive said in a statement .
news feed is the central feature in user profiles whereby they can see updates from people they follow .
chancellor angela merkel s christian democratic union secured victory in sunday s balloting with fewer votes than expected , forcing her to enter complicated coalition talks with various parties to form a new government .
the company said it made a stronger push to remove fake accounts when it observed suspicious activity following widely reported foreign interference in the french and u.s. presidential elections over the past year .
besides seeking to encourage civic participation and voter education efforts , it also worked closely with authorities , including the federal office for information security ( bsi ) , to monitor security threats during the campaign .
studies concluded that the level of false news was low , concluded allan , a former british member of parliament who , in addition to his work for facebook , has been a member of the house of lords since 2010 .
a variety of german political experts and social media watchers had given the campaign largely a clean bill of health in terms of any wide-scale efforts to swing votes in the run-up to voting day .
