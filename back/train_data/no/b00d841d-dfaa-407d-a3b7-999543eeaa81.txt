hanoi ( reuters ) - vietnam s most powerful leader has called for greater unity among southeast asian states at a time the country has appeared increasingly isolated in challenging china s territorial claims in the south china sea .
making the first visit by a vietnamese communist party chief to indonesia , nguyen phu trong said in a speech televised at home on wednesday that the association of south east asian nations ( asean ) needed to be unified in resolving territorial disputes .
do not let asean become a playing card for the competition among major countries , trong said , without identifying which he meant .
vietnam has emerged as the most vocal opponent of china s claims in the south china sea , where more than $ 3 trillion in cargo pass every year .
to china s annoyance , vietnam held out an asean meeting this month for language in a communique that noted concern about island-building and criticized militarization in the south china sea .
chinese pressure forced vietnam to stop drilling for oil last month in a vietnamese oil block that china claims .
beijing has also been angered by vietnam s growing defense links to the united states , japan and india .
some southeast asian countries are wary about the possible repercussions of defying beijing by taking a stronger stand on the south china sea .
china claims most of the south china sea , while taiwan , malaysia , vietnam , the philippines and brunei claim parts of the sea , which commands strategic sealanes and has rich fishing grounds along with oil and gas deposits .
after indonesia , trong is due to visit myanmar .
