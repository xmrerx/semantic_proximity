justice ruth bader ginsburg erroneously labeled south carolina sen. lindsey graham as one of the women of the senate on monday.ginsburg s misstatement came in her remarks upon accepting an allegheny college award given to her and the late justice antonin scalia for civility in public life .
hours after justice neil gorsuch was sworn in to replace scalia , ginsburg took to the podium in calling on lawmakers to work together , but mistakenly identified south carolina s senior senator as a woman .
i thought back to the 1993 confirmation of my nomination to the court the hearing was altogether civil , the vote was 96 to 3 .
for justice scalia , the vote was unanimous , ginsburg said .
let s hope members of congress , the members that allegheny college has already honored vice president joe biden and senator john mccain , the women of the senate , senators dianne feinstein and lindsey graham let s hope that they and others of goodwill will lead in restoring harmonious work ways .
