It s a good thing Democrats picked Philadelphia to host their convention.
Pennsylvania is continually being talked up as swing state that could go for Trump (they said the same thing about Romney in 2012, and he lost by 5 percent).But as Hillary Clinton delivered her acceptance speech, one that commentators say could sway undecided voters, a new poll comes out showing Clinton beating Trump by a whopping nine points in the swing state of Pennsylvania.Here s why that s important: people say Trump could (some say will) win Pennsylvania because of the rustic belt white, male centrists who typically lean Democrat, but could be swayed otherwise.The Suffolk University survey showed Clinton leading Trump 50-41, with 8 percent undecided.
The poll also closely reflects NBC News/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll conducted earlier in July that showed Clinton with a 9 point lead, this one 45-36.What s also interesting is Clinton still blows Trump out of the water when factoring Jill Stein and Gary Johnson in the polling:When Clinton and Trump were matched in the poll against Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein, Clinton s margin over Trump was the same, at 9 points 46 percent to 37 percent.
Johnson earned 5 percent, while Stein took 2 percent and 9 percent were undecided among those candidatesThink about that: before Clinton even delivered her speech of a lifetime, two polls one from a well known publication and one from a close-to-home college, show the same results.
Clinton s choice of a progressively centrist VP pick (who is a major ally to unions) could pick up the weary and disenfranchised white blue dog Democrats.After the convention, Clinton and Kaine will be touring the state by bus as they seek to cement and keep their support among Pennsylvanians in the west.Trump continues to be liability for his own campaign while Democrats are getting major viewership at their convention.
Let s hope the momentum can continue.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
