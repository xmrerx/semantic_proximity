SYDNEY (Reuters) - Ten million Australians, or 62.5 percent of eligible voters, have cast their votes so far in a postal ballot on whether same-sex marriage should be legalized, the Bureau of Statistics said on Tuesday.
That was up from an estimate of 9.2 million made a week ago.
Australians began voting last month in the non-binding poll to inform the government on whether voters wanted Australia to become the 25th nation to permit same-sex marriage.
The results will be announced on Nov. 15.
The response rate already surpasses the 60.5 percent reached in Ireland s same-sex marriage referendum in 2015.
