( reuters ) - catalonia will declare independence in a matter of days , the region s secessionist leader carles puigdemont was quoted as telling the bbc , a move that would defy madrid and attempt to implement the directive of sunday s banned independence referendum .
puigdemont said that his government would `` act at the end of this week or the beginning of next '' , according to an interview with the bbc on tuesday .
( bbc.in/2fhfqjx ) when asked by the bbc what puigdemont would do if the spanish government were to intervene and take control of catalonia 's government , he said it would be `` an error which changes everything '' .
