The right is up in arms.
No, not because Sally Yates threw a huge snowball down avalanche hill and not because millions of Americans could lose their health insurance.
They are losing their shizzle because Martha Stewart posed in a picture in front of photos of Donald Trump and Snoop Dogg.
It was a thing of beauty if you aren t a Trump lover.In the photo, Stewart posed in a corner between the two portraits with her arms crossed.
To Snoop, it was all peace and love.
To Trump, though, she flipped the portrait the bird.Can confirm this Martha Stewart photo is real pic.twitter.com/F3S6jADvo6 Yashar (@yashar) May 8, 2017There are questions about the photo s legitimacy but New York Magazine and Daily Beast writer Yashar confirms its validity.Stewart, who once hosted a spinoff of Trump s Apprentice is no fan of the man.
During the election, she was firmly in Hillary Clinton s camp, and she said this about Trump and Clinton: There is so much to know and so much to learn and so much diplomacy and kindness and introspection that goes with that kind of job, Stewart told CNNMoney during a luncheon for Andrea Bocelli s foundation Sunday.
And it does not exist in the world of Donald Trump.
This is the most important election of the last hundred years, she said.
We have to be very certain that we elect a person who has experience, knowledge, a base of education in the world of world politics as well as domestic politics and so obviously I m voting for Hillary Clinton.
And we just can t have a country run by someone who is totally unprepared for what comes.Source: CNNConservatives, who are having a tough day/month/year are not amused:@2ALAW @bfraser747 @MarthaStewart MARTHA OBAMACLINTON PUT YOU IN PRISON+HILLARY DID SAME CRIME+ZERO IN PRISON!!
