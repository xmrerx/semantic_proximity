One of Donald Trump s latest conspiracy theories he s been spreading far and wide about his opponent Hillary Clinton is that she s on drugs and there should be a drug test before the next debate.Of course, he s likely saying this, because as per usual, anything said about him he turns around to say about Hillary.
He s a master projector and this drug test poppycock is no different.
He s been sniffing constantly through the debates, and many have asked if he may be on cocaine or something else.When White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest was just asked about a potential drug test, he said: You re telling me that the candidate who snorted his way through the first two debates is accusing the other candidate of taking drugs?
That s a curious development in the campaign.
Watch for yourself here:.
@PressSec on Trump's call for candidate drug test: Trump "snorted his way through the first two debates " https://t.co/pcmFmEUlDY POLITICO (@politico) October 17, 2016Of course, when pressed if he was insinuated Trump was on drugs, Earnest said he was joking.However, one does wonder why Trump keeps sniffing.
Is he sick?
Does he lack stamina?
Is he taking drugs to stay awake?
Who s really to know, but since Trump did raise the question of drug tests, maybe we should find out.
Maybe he s saying it to deflect because everyone has been questioning him.See, two can play at this conspiracy theory game.How about we stick to the issues?
Or the fact that Trump is still deflecting from his lack of showing his taxes.
You know someone has something to hide when they can t answer questions and choose to make lame claims about their opponent.Good on Earnest for laughing it off, as we all should.Featured image via video screen capture Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
