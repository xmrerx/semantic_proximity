amman ( reuters ) - protests broke out on wednesday in areas of jordan s capital amman inhabited by palestinian refugees in response to u.s. president donald trump s recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital , witnesses said .
youths chanted anti-american slogans in amman , while in the baqaa refugee camp on the city s outskirts , hundreds of youths roamed the streets denouncing trump and calling on jordan s government to scrap its 1994 peace treaty with israel .
down with america .. america is the mother of terror , they chanted .
king abdullah s hashemite dynasty is the custodian of the muslim holy sites in jerusalem , making amman sensitive to any changes in the status of the city , whose eastern sector was captured by israel from jordan in a 1967 war .
many people in jordan are descendants of palestinian refugees whose families left after the creation of israel in 1948 .
