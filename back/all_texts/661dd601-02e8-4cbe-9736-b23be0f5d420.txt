Watch Joy Behar as she hilariously attempts to tie anti-semitism to Breitbart News while interviewing their senior editor who happens to be an orthodox Jew.
When Behar s attempt to prove that Breitbart is an anti-semitic news site, her leftist co-host Sunny Holstein attempts to pin racism and anti-semitism on Breitbart s former boss Steve Bannon.
When that didn t work, Joy Behar attempts to say that it doesn t look like Steve Bannon and Reince Priebus get along because of the their body language.
When Pollack dispels their ridiculous attempts to convince their viewers that Trump s top officials in his administration don t get along, Behar just resorts to the behavior one would expect from a 3 year old and calls President Trump a liar .You almost have to feel sorry for these unhinged rabidly leftist hags almost.
