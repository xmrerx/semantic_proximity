milan ( reuters ) - the leader of italy s main opposition party said he was keeping the option of a referendum on the euro open in the event his party won elections and failed to convince brussels of the need to change some of the euro zone s economic rules .
in comments made on state tv on sunday , luigi di maio , the man widely tipped to be the candidate for prime minister of the anti-establishment 5-star movement , said he wanted to negotiate concessions on eu governance .
if we succeed , europe will be changed and we won t need a referendum on the euro .
otherwise we ll ask italians if they want to stay in or not , he said .
earlier this month , di maio told reuters 5-star had not totally withdrawn the idea of a referendum on the euro , but called it a last resort to be employed only if it was not possible to ease eu governance rules .
the comments come just weeks before parliament is expected to be dissolved ahead of elections early next year which look unlikely to produce a clear winner .
the 5-star movement is predicted to emerge as the largest single party in the next parliament , but it has repeatedly ruled out joining any coalition .
italy has just introduced a new electoral system that is expected to handicap 5-star , favoring instead mainstream political blocs .
