Late night television icon David Letterman gave a scathing review of Donald Trump s time in the White House.
According to the comedian, Trump is a soulless goon and it makes him sick that he is representing the United States.
(Boy can I relate to that feel.)
I m disappointed that this man is representing me and my country.
It makes me sick, Letterman told GQ.Letterman has known Trump for a long time and said that he doesn t regret having the former reality tv star on his show numerous times over the years.
No, no reason to regret it .
But we always looked forward to having him on.
He was a great guest.
He was just a big, wealthy dope who d come on and we would make fun of his hair.
I would refer to him as a slumlord, Letterman continued.However, Letterman said that since that time, Trump has managed to prove to the world that he is completely without a soul.
But now, this goon I don t know.
He s demonstrated himself to be a man without a core, a man without a soul.
Is there a guy in there?
Letterman asked.This isn t the first time Letterman has stepped forward to denounce Trump.
In March, the former host of The Late Show called out Trumpy for the steady stream of lies that he spews forth without even a hint of regret.
How do you know if Donald Trump is lying?
His lips are moving, Letterman said.
If we get a president sometime soon who does not have a mental disorder, Twitter will be useful, he added.Letterman told GQ that he would love to have the opportunity to sit down with Trump one on one in a tv studio so he could ask him this important question: All right, Don: What the fuck happened?
