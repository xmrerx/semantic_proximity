kampala ( reuters ) - uganda is launching a drive against online pornography that critics condemn as a diversion from deeper problems of graft , unemployment and crumbling social services facing president yoweri museveni .
the campaign is the latest salvo in a culture war between conservatives fighting what they see as foreign moral influences promoting criminality and a more liberal , often younger population .
this is an invasion , it s western culture , said simon lokodo , a 59-year-old catholic priest who serves as minister of ethics and integrity .
over consumption of pornography ... the consequences are very dire , he told reuters this week .
the government had released 2 billion shillings ( $ 556,000 ) to his office to combat online pornography .
some money would go to pornography-blocking software , he said .
some ugandans expressed anger at the cost of the ban , saying it served only to divert public attention from failures of president museveni s government .
critics of museveni , who has ruled for 31 years , say he presides over widespread corruption and human rights abuses .
parliament is considering a removing a constitutional age cap to allow museveni to serve longer .
he is also widely considered to be grooming his son , a presidential adviser and the former commander of an elite military unit , to succeed him .
andrew karamagi , a rights activist and lawyer in kampala , said he could not understand government obsession with what people watch , who sleeps with whom , how and when , while it struggled to fund social services such as hospitals and schools .
uganda s only radiotherapy machine broke down last year and hasn t been replaced due to funding shortages .
drug shortages are common in public hospitals where and in dilapidated public schools poorly-paid teachers often don t show up for class .
the regime ... does not have the moral authority to combat pornography , karamagi said .
they are themselves an obscenity .
