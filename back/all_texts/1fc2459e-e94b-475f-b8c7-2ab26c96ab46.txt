As many have been less than enthused with Trevor Noah taking over for Jon Stewart on The Daily Show, the show still held a tremendous amount of hilarious talent, especially in Jessica Williams.
However, Comedy Central has just given her a show of her own, yet to be titled, and she s bidding farewell the late night show.In her final segment, Williams most definitely didn t hold back, and went directly after Donald Trump and those who support him.
In particular, those who claim to be part of the Bernie or Bust movement who haven t quite caught on to the reality that Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders are far more alike than Trump and Bernie will ever be.
Yet, there are still the folks who just won t vote for Hillary because of some reason or another, and Williams tore into them with a line of questioning that undoubtedly proved their stupidity.Some of the Bernie or Busters even claimed that they d rather eat the turd that is Donald Trump, than the maybe-secret turd that, according to them, is Hillary Clinton, because at least they know they re getting a turd.The logic is mind-numbing and actually very scary, because these people actually vote.
Thankfully, Williams shows them their true colors while hilariously bashing Trump in the mean time.
