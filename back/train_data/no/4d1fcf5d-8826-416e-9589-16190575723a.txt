paris ( reuters ) - france on friday firmly backed u.n.-led peace talks on syria in geneva and said the responsibility of the failed negotiations since the end of november fell entirely on the government delegation .
a round of syria peace talks that ended on thursday was a big missed opportunity , but there may be more talks in january if ideas can be found to encourage president bashar al-assad s government to engage , u.n. mediator staffan de mistura said on thursday .
there is no alternative to a negotiated political solution agreed by both parties under the auspices of the united nations , deputy foreign ministry spokesman alexandre georgini told reporters in a daily briefing , reiterating paris support for de mistura .
we deplore the attitude of the syrian regime , which has refused to engage in the discussion .
the syrian regime is responsible for the lack of progress in the negotiations , he said .
