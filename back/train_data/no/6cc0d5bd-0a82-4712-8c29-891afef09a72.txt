brasilia ( reuters ) - president michel temer said on friday that a bill overhauling brazil s costly pension system might not clear congress this year as planned , the first time that he has indicated that such a delay might happen .
in an interview with poder360 news website , temer said the government had to again consult lawmakers in the government coalition , many of whom have already said they are doubtful the legislation will pass this year .
the pension reform is crucial to temer s attempts to plug brazil s budget deficit and reduce the bloated pension system .
but its provisions to increase the retirement age have made it unpopular with brazilians .
temer put the delay down to charges in a corruption case that put his legislative agenda on hold for six months .
the government is considering a watered-down version of the bill , temer said , confirming previous statements from officials that it would be ready to settle for a bill that included at least the introduction of a minimum retirement age of 65 years for men , up from the current average age of 55 .
a diluted pension bill would also need to include a gradual transition to the new rules and parity between the public and private pension systems , he said .
his chief of staff eliseu padilha , who also took part in the interview , said the government hoped a less extensive reform would still achieve 75 percent of the planned fiscal savings , assuming it included cuts to benefits for public sector employees .
temer also said the government may issue a temporary decree to extend for a few weeks the refis program that allows companies and individuals to renegotiate delinquent tax payments .
