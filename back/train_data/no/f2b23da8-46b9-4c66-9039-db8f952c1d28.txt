jerusalem ( reuters ) - israel said on thursday it had thwarted a plan by two israeli arabs with islamic state sympathies to mount an attack at a contested jerusalem holy site where a july gun ambush set off a wave of violence .
the shin bet security service described the suspects , aged 26 and 16 , as residents of the same israeli arab town as three gunmen who on july 14 killed two police guards at a gate to al-aqsa mosque compound and were then shot dead .
israel responded to that attack by briefly installing metal detectors outside the compound , angering palestinians who saw that as a breach of decades-old access arrangements .
four palestinians were killed during ensuing confrontations with israeli security forces and a palestinian stabbed three israeli settlers to death .
the two suspects taken into custody this month support the islamic state terrorist group s murderous ideology and the terrorist attack was meant to be carried out in expression of this , the shin bet said in its statement on thursday .
it said they had two pistols .
they planned a gun attack at the temple mount in jerusalem similar to what transpired on july 14 , it said without elaborating .
jews revere the site , where al-aqsa mosque and the golden dome of the rock now stand , as the location of their two ancient temples .
attempts by jews to pray there , in violation of access arrangements , have been a source of tension with muslims .
israel captured east jerusalem , including the old city and the holy compound , in the 1967 middle east war .
it annexed the area in a move that has never been recognized internationally .
