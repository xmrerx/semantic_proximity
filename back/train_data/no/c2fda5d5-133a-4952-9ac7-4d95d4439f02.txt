this nsa whistleblower has some very interesting things to say about what will happen now that the right to snoop has expired : the ap had this to say about what s happening now with the nsa : eight days after blocking it , senate republicans have agreed to begin debate on a house bill that would overhaul the national security agency s handling of american calling records while preserving other domestic surveillance provisions.but that remarkable turnabout didn t happen soon enough to prevent the laws governing the programs from expiring at midnight sunday as republican sen. rand paul , a presidential contender , stood in the way of extending the program , angering his gop colleagues and frustrating intelligence and law enforcement officials.now , the question is whether the senate will pass a bill the house can live with .
if so , the surveillance programs will resume , with some significant changes in how the phone records are handled .
if not , they will remain dormant.the senate vote on the measure known as the usa freedom act can come no earlier than 1 a.m. , tuesday .
senate republican aides said they expected some amendments , but no major revisions to the bill .
having gone past the brink , the senate must now embrace the necessity of acting responsibly , said adam schiff , the ranking democrat on the house intelligence committee , in a statement after sunday s senate vote.the high-stakes drama played out as congress debated the most significant changes prompted by the disclosures of edward snowden , the former nsa contractor who revealed the phone records collection and other main surveillance programs .
with no deal reached in time , the nsa stopped collecting american phone records at 3:59 p.m. est sunday , officials said.other authorities that expired allowed the fbi to collect business records in terrorism and espionage investigations , and to more easily eavesdrop on a suspect who is discarding cell phones to avoid surveillance .
