The boos rained down after a Republican congresswoman thought she could get away with voting to strip millions of Americans of their healthcare.GOP Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers made an appearance at a Martin Luther King Jr. Day rally to spew bullshit about unity and how change and progress have come to Washington DC because of Donald Trump.That didn t sit well with the crowd, who showered Rodgers with boos and jeers after someone in the audience literally shouted Bullshit!
in response to her claims that she will work hard for the people in her district.Chants of Save our healthcare!
then drowned out Rodgers, who fled the stage as someone called her a liar.
Here s the video via YouTube.Rodgers ignored the anger of her constituents and tried to drone on but soon left the stage.
Considering that Rodgers is literally sentencing millions of people to death by voting to repeal the Affordable Care Act, she s lucky the crowd let her leave and didn t tar and feather her in the public square.Afterwards, she then released a bullshit statement claiming that Republicans are working on a smooth transition to repeal and replace Obamacare so people don t lose their coverage.
No one who has coverage because of Obamacare today, will lose that coverage the day it s repealed we re committed to a smooth and stable transition for those currently receiving care, Rodgers said.A spokesperson for Rodgers later added, The Congresswoman looks forward to keeping the lines of communication open when discussing how to ensure a smooth and stable transition out of Obamacare to put in place a 21st Century health care system.
Most Americans oppose repealing Obamacare without a suitable replacement or don t want it repealed at all.But Republicans voted to repeal Obamacare last week without having any plan at all to replace it with, and they STILL don t have a plan, despite how many times they claim to be working on one.Featured image via screenshot
