pristina ( reuters ) - ramush haradinaj , a former guerrilla fighter who has twice stood trial for war crimes , was chosen on thursday to form a new government in kosovo , ending a political deadlock that has persisted since elections on june 11 .
president hashim thaci gave haradinaj the mandate after his coalition struck an agreement with a smaller party that paved the way for them to take power .
haradinaj s coalition comprises parties made up of former guerrillas who fought serbian forces in 1998 and 1999 .
that campaign led to accusations of war crimes against him , but he was acquitted twice by a united nations war crimes tribunal .
the coalition signed an agreement on monday with the smaller new alliance for kosovo ( akr ) party to put together a new government , an agreement that gives them 62 seats in the 120-seat parliament [ nl8n1l42qo .
the akr is led by behgjet pacolli , whom media call the richest man in kosovo .
haradinaj is expected to present his program to parliament on saturday , after which the government should be elected .
the new government will confront unemployment running at 30 percent and uncertain relations with kosovo s neighbors , especially serbia , a precondition for both countries to move forward in their efforts to join the european union .
it must also reform health and education and the tax administration system as well as include representatives of some 120,000 kosovo serbs who do not recognize independence .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008 , almost a decade after nato air strikes drove out serbian forces that had been accused of expelling and killing ethnic albanian civilians in a two-year counter-insurgency .
