Embattled House Intel Chairman, Devin Nunes (R-CA), has been reported to the FBI for corruption.
The criminal complaint, filed by Scott Dworkin of the Democratic Coalition Against Trump, seems to include Nunes failure to disclose the fact that he s got all his money sunk into a winery with heavy ties to Russia (which means he s got a conflict of interest).
It may also includ his admission that he had an obligation to inform Trump that some of his transition team s communications got swept up in a foreign surveillance operation.Nunes is definitely compromised, which is worth investigating.Dworkin can t make the details of his complaint public, but he did say that Nunes is unethical and that he was working on just such a complaint earlier today:RT if u think Devin Nunes is unethicalI doI m finishing our House Ethics Complaint on him now#NunesMustResign #trumprussia #russiagate Scott Dworkin (@funder) March 26, 2017Then he tweeted the news that his criminal complaint had officially been filed, along with the FBI s explanation of their public corruption program.
One of the things they do is work to identify any connection to terrorism or foreign intelligence that would pose and imminent threat to national security.

They should, though, because Nunes has proven that he s compromised, which further drives us into the morass that is the Russian scandal.Featured image by Drew Angerer via Getty Images
