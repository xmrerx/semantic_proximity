During the first presidential debate, Donald Trump threatened to attack Hillary Clinton with her husband s extramarital affairs.
He has spent every day since bragging about how much credit he deserves for not pulling out Bill s infidelities as a weapon against his opponent.In an interview on Thursday, Trump said he would have had the right to take aim at the former president and his scandals for two reasons.
First of all, said the GOP nominee, Hillary is a big meanie who has said horrible and false things about him.
Second, Bill is fair game because he has been campaigning on his wife s behalf.Trump also tried to claim that the reason he chose to take such a high road is because Chelsea Clinton was sitting in the front row at the debate and he is such a classy, upstanding guy that he just couldn t bring himself to say those awful things in front of such a sweet young lady.When the reporter asked him why Bill s scandals reflected poorly on Hillary, since she wasn t the one who had actually done anything wrong, Trump s response was as disgusting as every other vile, misogynistic thing that comes out of his mouth.
Well, you ll have to figure that out.
I think it s pretty simple to figure that out, Trump replied.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images
