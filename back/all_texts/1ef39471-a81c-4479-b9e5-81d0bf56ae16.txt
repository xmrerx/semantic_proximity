WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration is finalizing a $29 billion disaster aid request after hurricanes hit Puerto Rico, Texas and Florida, the Associated Press reported on Tuesday, citing a senior administration official and congressional aides.
The request, which could come as early as Wednesday, combines $16 billion for the government-backed flood insurance program and almost $13 billion in new relief for hurricane victims, AP said.
