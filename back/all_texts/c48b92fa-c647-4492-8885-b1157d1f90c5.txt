WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The No.
2 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives said on Thursday that he expects Congress will take steps to control the use of “bump stock” gun accessories that enable rifles to be turned into rapid-fire guns, following Sunday’s mass shooting in Las Vegas.
“This is definitely an area we should look at,” House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told the Fox News Channel.
“The one thing I do want to do is, let’s let the sheriff and the authorities carry out their entire investigation,” McCarthy said.
“But I think this is definitely an area we’re going to look (at) and be able to act on,” he said, referring to the use of bump stock gun accessories.
