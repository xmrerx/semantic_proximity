washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. military said on tuesday that it could only confirm that about 90 percent of the syrian city of raqqa had been retaken from islamic state militants , even as u.s.-backed forces declared victory there .
the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) , an alliance of kurdish and arab militias , said the fighting was over and it was clearing raqqa s stadium of mines and any remaining militants .
a formal declaration of victory in raqqa , islamic state s de facto capital in syria , will soon be made once the city has been cleared of mines and any possible islamic state sleeper cells , said sdf spokesman talal selo .
the fall of raqqa , where islamic state staged euphoric parades after its string of lightning victories in 2014 , is a potent symbol of the jihadist movement s collapsing fortunes .
colonel ryan dillon , a spokesman for the u.s.-led coalition fighting islamic state , said that about 100 fighters still remained in raqqa and he expected the sdf to face resistance from remnants of militant group .
we are aware of the reports that isis has been defeated in raqqa , dillon said , using an acronym for islamic state .
however , clearance operations continue and we expect our syrian democratic force partners to hit pockets of resistance as the final parts of the city is cleared , dillon said .
he said that in the past few days , about 1,300 civilians had been assisted to safety by the sdf and about 350 islamic state fighters had surrendered in raqqa .
even as the sdf made gains in raqqa , dillon said islamic state fighters still remained in the middle euphrates river valley .
islamic state has lost much of its territory in syria and iraq this year , including its most prized possession , mosul .
in syria , it has been forced back into a strip of the euphrates valley and surrounding desert .
