KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak called on Muslims everywhere to strongly oppose any recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital.
President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy and recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a move that was condemned by the Muslim countries across the world.
I call on all Muslims across the world to let your voices be heard, make it clear that we strongly oppose any recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital for all time, Najib said in his speech at an annual gathering of the ruling party in Kuala Lumpur.
