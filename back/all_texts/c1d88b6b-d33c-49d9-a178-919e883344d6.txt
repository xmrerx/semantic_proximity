Donald Trump Jr gets more from his dad than just his name, of all the Trump kids, Don seems to be most obsessed with appearing macho.
Unfortunately, it never works out for him.
And even worse, when he faces the inevitable mockery for his hamfisted attempts to appear tough, his first response is to hide.Twitter got to see a perfect example of this on Saturday, after Don Jr. thought he d take a dig at the mainstream media and walked right into a pretty hilarious self-own.
Donald Trump Jr., hot off of tweeting that his critics were triggered, got triggered himself after posting this tweet onto his social media account:I'm going to have to buy 5-10,000 of these to pass around to our buddies in the #MSM.
In the meantime I'll model it for them?.
#yourewelcome pic.twitter.com/Hnn3Z5Pspm Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) April 15, 2017Any normal person would look at this picture and go please delete this and never show it to another human being.
Everything about it was sad.
The weird thumbs up.
The pained expression on his face that was presumably supposed to signal toughness.
The shirt oh god, the shirt.
Instead of deleting the photo in shame, Don tweeted it with an equally embarrassing caption.Playing into his father s rabid base of right-wing fanatics, Don promised to send 10,000 shirts reading Very Fake News to his friends in the mainstream media.
Like the rest of the Trump family, Don hates the media because they have repeatedly debunked Trump s lies.
Don has retreated into his own conservative bubble, recently praising a pro-rape white nationalist blogger named Mike Cernovich, suggesting the conspiracy theorist deserves a Pulitzer.But Don couldn t take it after he dished it.
Soon after tweeting, he started facing relentless mockery.
@DonaldJTrumpJr HAHAHA LOL !!!
LMAO #gotem ?

andy lassner (@andylassner) April 15, 2017Donald Trump Jr doesn t handle getting made fun of well.
The last message in particular must have stung, because he blocked Andy Lassner, which Lassner discovered when he tried to go to Don s Twitter page.Oh for fuck's sake pic.twitter.com/TjA6YLlmAn andy lassner (@andylassner) April 15, 2017Donald Trump Jr is obsessed with blocking people who make fun of him, while still pretending he s a tough guy.Apparently, Donald J Trump Jr has me blocked!

(@JamesJJacksonJr) April 14, 2017Donald Trump Jr. blocked me!
I must have said the right thing.
Good Witch of Emma (@joan_moon) April 1, 2017@AltUSPressSec @DonaldJTrumpJr Oh, Junior blocked me.
Tsk tsk.
(Ab)Cynthia (@Ab_Synthia) April 15, 2017Unfortunately he may have inadvertently started a movement.
People are now actively trying to burn Don so bad that he blocks them, too.
@andylassner I clearly have some work to do.
