the number of refugees appears to have slowed .
625,000 have arrived since aug. 25 .

conditions in myanmar s rakhaine state are not in place to enable a safe and sustainable return ... refugees are still fleeing .
most have little or nothing to go back to .
their homes and villages have been destroyed .
deep divisions between communities remain unaddressed and human access is inadequate , she said .
bangladesh and myanmar agreed on nov. 23 to start the return of rohingya within two months .
it did not say when the process would be complete .
myanmar s security forces may be guilty of genocide against the rohingya muslim minority , according to the top u.n. human rights official this week .
