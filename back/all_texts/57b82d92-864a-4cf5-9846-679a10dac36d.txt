Yet another low from the left, but they will rationalize this away with their usual excuses.

A real genius doesn t make fun of a child.
Pathetic.For such a smart man you certainly were quick to ruin your writing career.
Maybe you and Kathy Griffin can go on an apology tour.You are truly a pile of human excrement .. your publisher should be ashamed.Does it really make you feel like a man to pick on an innocent 11 year old boy?
You are a total douche!!!
!Jennings you are a spineless sniveling coward.
Why don t you talk smack to someone your own size you sick low life scumbag.
