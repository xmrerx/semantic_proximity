as hillary does her best to deflect and stonewall the release of her e-mails , we find out that even an employee of clinton s server company knew something shady was going on .
hillary wants all of this to just go away and is spinning the e-mail scandal like it s just another right wing conspiracy .
the e-mails from the server employee prove otherwise an employee of the computer company that maintained hillary rodham clinton s email server was questioned if he was part of a coverup , according to documents released tuesday .
this whole thing really is covering up some shady s t , the employee said in an aug. 19 company email obtained by sen. ron johnson ( r-wis. ) , chair of the senate homeland security and governmental affairs committee .
the concerns by the colorado-based platte river networks employee were aired after the clinton camp ordered a reduction in the data stored during each server backup .
the limits were ordered after the state department contacted the former secretary of state in summer 2014 to inquire about her private email records .
in october , the department sent a formal request to turn over documents .
the employee was so suspicious that he sent an email to a colleague asking for a copy of the email from clinton executive service corp. to document their directive to limit the number of emails stored.via : nyp
