paris ( reuters ) - president emmanuel macron said on saturday france stood ready if needed to strengthen its military force fighting alongside african troops against islamist insurgents in the sahel .
france has been seeking to eventually withdraw from the poorly policed scrublands of the sahel region - which abuts the sahara to the north and has become a recruiting and training ground for islamist militants - with the help of a new regional african force .
the g5 sahel , which began official operations in november , is made up of troops from mali , niger , chad , burkina faso and mauritania that will patrol the region in collaboration with 4,000 french troops deployed there since intervening in 2013 to quell an insurgency in northern mali .
but macron said on a visit to the niger capital niamey that the sahel would remain a focus for the french army , should it be required in the future .
france is ready , not only to maintain , but if necessary to strengthen its engagement in the region because the fight against terrorism in the sahel is essential , in my opinion , he said during a joint news conference with his nigerien counterpart mahamoudou issoufou .
the fight is not won today ... it is essential not only to maintain but to further improve our agility on the ground , to innovate more and to focus our priorities on the regions identified as the most vulnerable , he added .
speaking during his visit to niger , macron also announced an additional 10 million euros to help educate girls , one of the priorities promoted by president issoufou to curb migration .
this sum is on top of 15 million euros already invested by france to help education in niger .
paris pledged in mid-december to spend 400 million euros over 2017-2021 to support niamey .
