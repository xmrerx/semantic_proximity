is he for real ?
this is so alarming on so many levels because we lost over 1,000 soldiers in ramadi and took it back but now we re expected to do it again ?
this guy is so out of touch and so aloof .
ramadi belongs to isis and will be very difficult to take back .
we re two steps behind in our leading from behind approach to foreign policy and it s not working .
