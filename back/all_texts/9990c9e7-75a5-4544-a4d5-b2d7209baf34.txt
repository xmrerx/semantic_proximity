When Donald Trump stepped on the stage in Iowa Monday night, we almost thought he might behave like an adult after being defeated by Ted Cruz.
He gave a very, very short speech (a strange breath of fresh air after Rubio s), and stayed pretty upbeat and positive until Tuesday.The day after his loss Trump started tweeting whining about losing.
In one tweet he claimed that the people of Iowa didn t appreciate that he hadn t taken money from super PACS.
He even implied that he was wasting his money by self-funding his campaign.On Wednesday morning, Trump continued his temper tantrum and tweeted that Cruz stole the caucus.
Ted Cruz didn t win Iowa, he illegally stole it.
That is why all of the polls were so wrong any why he more votes than anticipated.
Bad!
Shortly after the tweet went out, he deleted it and posted one that left the word illegally out.Ted Cruz didn t win Iowa, he stole it.
That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated.
Bad!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016But he couldn t leave it at just one tweet, he kept going:During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016 Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud.
Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz.
Fraud Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016 And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and choice a total lie!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2016The butthurt is so strong there.He is acting exactly the way we thought he would act if he lost, only it s even more pathetic than we could imagine.
Instead of behaving like an adult and moving on, he is literally acting like a raging toddler.
Ted Cruz came out on top because the Republicans in Iowa are ber conservative Trump is not.
Perhaps he also lost because of his brilliant dumbass decision to skip the last debate (over more hurt feelings).Whatever the reason, voters are not going to look at his recent behavior and think, Yep, this is the guy we want with the nuclear codes.
This meltdown is just solidifying the fact that he definitely doesn t belong in the White House.
