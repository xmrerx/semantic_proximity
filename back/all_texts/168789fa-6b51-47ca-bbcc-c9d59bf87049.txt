Trump s supporters have proven time and time again that the reason they re able to stand behind The Donald with a completely clear conscience is because they re exactly like him.
The pro-Trump crowd is just as Islamophobic, racist, irrational, angry, vulgar and self-involved as the Republican frontrunner himself.
The majority of Trump s supporters also share another trait of Trump s they, too, are misogynists and this couldn t have been more evident than his supporters choice of attire at a recent rally.While at Trump s campaign event in Syracuse on Saturday, Jill Colvin of the Associated Press managed to snap a picture of this disgusting t-shirt, proudly worn and modeled by one of the candidate s young Trump bros.If you need any more convincing that the Trump That B*tch slogan isn t a misogynistic, disrespectful attack on women, just wait until you see what the front says:Misogyny at its finest.
Not only was there a completely despicable message on the back of the shirt, but the front makes a disgraceful, tasteless reference to former POTUS Bill Clinton s infamous affair with Monica Lewinsky.
There couldn t be a more immature, vile way to disrespect Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton than this.These t-shirts were being sold outside of the event, and it s shameful to think that even one person would buy one.
But then again, what else can you expect from someone who believes that Trump is worthy of being the next President of the United States?These people have stood by Trump through every single one of his attacks on women.
Not including Trump s extremely long (and forever expanding) history of misogyny, these morons have supported the disgraced candidate through his horrific abortion remarks that stated women should be punished for terminating a pregnancy, his unprovoked attacks on rival Ted Cruz s wife, an incident where Trump s own campaign manager threw a female reporter to the ground (and Trump did NOTHING about it), Trump s one-sided feud with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, his awkwardly incestuous comments about his own daughters, and so much more.These people have absolutely NO moral compass between right and wrong, and they ll do anything just to get some attention just like Trump himself.
Trump s misogynistic messages are becoming more and more terrifying, and his followers are going to stand behind him one hundred percent.
The GOP has been terrorizing women forever, but Trump s particular brand of hateful rhetoric is especially dangerous.
