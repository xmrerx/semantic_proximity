Saturday Night Live handled Trump spokesidiot Kellyanne Conway s shaky relationship with the press ever since the last of her credibility died in the Bowling Green Massacre in the best way possible by parodying the erotic thriller Fatal Attraction.
After CNN s Jake Tapper (Beck Bennett) refuses to allow her on the air because of the credibility issues presented by her just making things up like certain nonexistent massacres Conway (Kate McKinnon) ambushes him at his home.
Jesus, Kellyanne, what the hell are you doing here?
Tapper asks.
I just want to be a part of the news, Jake, she replies.This is how you do it?
By breaking into my apartment?
Tapper says.
Well, what was I supposed to do?
You weren t answering my calls.
You changed your number.
I m not going to be ignored, Jake!
Conway screams.
You don t get it, Kellyanne, Tapper tells her.
You made up a massacre, we can t have you on.
Yes, things are pretty weird at this point, but they get weirder.
But I miss the news.
I want to get mic d Conway says as she presses up against Tapper.
I want to feel that hot, black, mic pressed up against my skin.
We won t ruin the rest for you.
