After Republicans in the Senate decided that they would side with the gun lobby over saving lives, many have been expressing their opinions in regards to how heartless these GOP Senators must really be.These Republicans voted down expanded background checks, closing the gun show loophole, and preventing suspected terrorists from having access to purchasing firearms.
All pretty damn common sense things that wouldn t to anything to responsible gun owners.
So, it leaves you wondering, why would so many Republicans vote against common sense and humanity?Well, one man, a man who has been a colleague to these Republican Senators for a very, very long time, decided to share some insight with his GOP pals that they seem to be extremely unaware of.Sen.
Harry Reid (D-NV) took to Twitter to let his Republican friends know a thing or two about what the NRA and the gun lobby really wants out of them profit: Here s a tip for my GOP friends: The NRA doesn t care about you.
It cares about making money for gun manufacturers and making money for NRA.
