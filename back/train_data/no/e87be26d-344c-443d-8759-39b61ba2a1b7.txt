i m tired of going through this with you .
you re a two-time loser who lost because you were a lousy candidate , you didn t have a message , you lied every time you opened your mouth ; you didn t know what states to campaign in , you put our national security at risk with your amateur email setup , you were in a foundation that was nothing more than an organized criminal enterprise parading as a charity , four men died under your watch as you lied about a video , and there were a billion dollars missing from the state department when you left .
and i could go on and on , but i just don t have the time .
so , stop with the poor me nonsense .
we ve had it with you clintons always claiming victimhood .
the two of you haven t followed the rules since the day you both showed up in your bell bottoms in arkansas .
be careful , hillary .
be very , very careful .
you pulled the wool over jim comey s eyes once , and you actually got the president to say you re a nice lady .
don t be so sure you re going to get away with your new game , given your illegal , ill-advised , and incompetent instincts.you re a loser , hillary .
face it .
face it , and get back in the woods !
