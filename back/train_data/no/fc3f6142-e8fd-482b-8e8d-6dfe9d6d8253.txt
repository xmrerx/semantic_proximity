skopje ( reuters ) - former macedonian prime minister nikola gruevski , head of the opposition rightist vmro-dpmne party , resigned on monday following an election defeat last year and unrest that rocked the small balkan country in april .
gruevski , 47 , led the ex-yugoslav republic for almost a decade , and his party bloc since 2003 , until january 2016 when a wiretapping scandal brought down the ruling vmro-dpmne bloc .
a snap election in december 2016 ended inconclusively and a long parliamentary stalemate ensued , ending in may when social democrat zoran zaev formed a coalition with ethnic albanian parties that represent a third of the 2 million population .
vmro-dpmne said its central committee had scheduled a leadership congress for dec. 22-23 after gruevski s irrevocable resignation .
gruevski said that ... his resignation was a moral act , as it is natural that the person in whom everyone had confidence should take the responsibility for the ( electoral ) defeat , a party statement said .
in april , protesters including vmro-dpmne supporters stormed parliament and assaulted zaev as social democrats and its ethnic albanian allies elected an ethnic albanian as parliament speaker .
dozens were injured in riots .
the vmro-dpmne suffered a further setback last month when police arrested mitko cavkov , a former interior minister , and a number of its lawmakers and activists on charges related to the disturbances in april .
the april unrest marked the worst crisis in macedonia since 2001 when western diplomats narrowly averted a full-scale civil war arising from an ethnic albanian insurgency , promising skopje a pathway to membership of the european union and nato .
macedonia , which won independence in 1991 from then-federal yugoslavia in 1991 , has made little progress towards eu and nato membership due to a name dispute with greece .
