This is just one of literally thousands of liberal activists who are being paid to teach our youth.
Let that sink in The head of the city s largest police union is calling for the firing of a John Jay College professor after he tweeted it s a privilege to teach future dead cops.
Professor Michael Isaacson, a self-proclaimed member of the Antifa movement who works in the economics department at the CUNY Manhattan college, tweeted from the account @VulgarEconomics: Some of ya ll might think it sucks being an anti-fascist teaching at John Jay College but I think it s a privilege to teach future dead cops on Aug. 23.Patrolmen s Benevolent Association boss Pat Lynch wrote a letter saying Isaacson harbors total disdain for the active and future police officers that he teaches at John Jay College.
In a Friday letter to Karol Mason, president of John Jay College of Criminal Justice, Lynch demanded the immediate dismissal of Isaacson on behalf of nearly 50,000 active and retired New York City police officers who are members of the Patrolmen s Benevolent Association of the City of New York.
Recent media reports have revealed Mr. Isaacson s disgusting anti-police attitudes and his gleeful embrace of political violence, including violence against police officers, as expressed in his own social media postings, Lynch wrote.Lynch continued: It is absolutely outrageous that an individual who holds and expresses these views could be employed by any academic institution, much less one that counts an overwhelming number of New York City police officers as among its students, alumni and faculty members.
He wrote that Isaacson s continued presence will make it next to impossible for John Jay College to maintain any respect or credibility among the women and men who have dedicated their lives protecting this city, or among prospective students considering a law enforcement career.
