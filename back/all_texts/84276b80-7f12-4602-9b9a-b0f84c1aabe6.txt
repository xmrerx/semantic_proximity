BuzzFeed s Ben Smith was interviewed by Tucker Carlson tonight proving he is the type of guy who doesn t care about reality but just wants to make up his own rules.
Remember that BuzzFeed published information that there was a dossier on Donald Trump that had salacious accusations in it.
That should tell you just how slimy this guy is but here s where it got heated:Tucker went on to question Smith on hiring practices by BuzzFeed Basically, BuzzFeed is racist in that they prefer any race over whites.
Tucker gets into it with Smith claiming that it is in fact racism if you don t hire white people.
Racism goes both ways!Why Are BuzzFeed s Racial Hiring Quotas Not Racist ?https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=684&v=RIAvXXKARfM
