dr. ben carson just found over $ 500 billion missing in an audit of hud : link to hud reportthe last paragraph of the report says it all : hud management is downplaying the severity of the condition and impact of the errors identified , which were significant enough to cause it to recall its published afr and reissue its fiscal year 2016 consolidated financial statements and notes .
while the errors identified may not have changed hud s financial position , as hud states at the bottom of its financial statements , the accompanying notes are an integral part of these statements .
these notes contained errors of $ 516.4 billion.fraud and mismanagement is rampant ! the total amounts of errors corrected in hud s notes and consolidated financial statements were $ 516.4 billion and $ 3.4 billion , respectively .
there were several other unresolved audit matters , which restricted our ability to obtain sufficient , appropriate evidence to express an opinion.these unresolved audit matters relate to ( 1 ) the office of general counsel s refusal to sign the management representation letter .
( 2 ) hud s improper use of cumulative and first-in , first-out budgetary accounting methods of disbursing community planning and development program funds .
( 3 ) the $ 4.2 billion in non pooled loan assets from ginnie mae s stand-alone financial statements that we could not audit due to inadequate support .
( 4 ) the improper accounting for certain hud assets and liabilities , and ( 5 ) material differences between hud s subledger and general ledger accounts.this audit report contains 11 material weaknesses , 7 significant deficiencies , and 5 instances of noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations.could it be that dr. carson is on to something ? obama took billions frm fannie & freddie to fund obamacare & he s still trying to cover his tracks # fridayfeeling pic.twitter.com/zdskfpq1g9 stock monster ( @ stockmonsterusa ) april 7 , 2017
