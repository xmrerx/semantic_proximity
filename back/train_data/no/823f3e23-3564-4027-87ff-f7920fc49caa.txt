dublin ( reuters ) - no agreement has yet been reached between britain and ireland on the future of the northern irish border , but the breakthrough required to allow wider brexit talks to proceed could come later on monday , irish foreign minister simon coveney said .
british prime minister theresa may hopes to break the brexit talks deadlock on monday with a new offer on divorce settlements at a crunch meeting with eu officials , but she has not yet achieved sufficient progress on the irish border - one of three issues that must be resolved .
coveney said the talks were in a sensitive place with the two governments discussing possible texts of an agreement , which is a prerequisite for britain to start discussions on a new trade pact and a two-year transitional deal .
we re not quite yet where we need to be .
but it is possible to do that today , coveney told irish state broadcaster rte .
hopefully we ll find a way forward today , he said .
ireland has called on britain to provide details of how it will ensure there is no regulatory divergence after brexit in march 2019 that would require physical border controls .
but any solution will need the support of northern ireland s pro-brexit democratic unionist party , whose 10 members of parliament are propping up may s government .
coveney said that draft texts were produced following progress in talks last thursday and that discussions had continued over the weekend .
there are political conversations happening in both governments in relation to that text , he said .
both governments understand what each other is asking for .
