beijing ( reuters ) - china s ruling communist party announced a new central committee , the largest of its elite ruling bodies , at the closing session of the 19th communist party congress on tuesday , a course-setting leadership reshuffle held every five years .
the list provides clues to who will , or won t , fill top party positions during president xi jinping s second term .
the party will announce its new politburo standing committee around midday ( 0400 gmt ) on wednesday .
the standing committee , which now includes seven members headed by xi and is the apex of power in china , is selected by the new central committee .
here are noteworthy names : - wang qishan , 69 , the anti-corruption tsar and current standing committee member , is not on the new central committee , ending months of speculation whether he would remain for another term and break an unofficial retirement rule of not taking a new position after age 68 .
wang may still get a leadership role outside the standing committee , sources told reuters before the congress .
- zhao leji , 60 , head of the party s organization department , which oversees personnel decisions , made both the central committee and the central commission for discipline inspection committee lists , suggesting he may take over wang qishan s role as top graft-buster .
- vice president li yuanchao , who is on the cusp of retirement at the age of 67 , is expected to retire from the 25-member politburo after he was not included on the 204-member central committee .
- china s top diplomat , yang jiechi , 67 , could keep his state councilor job or be further promoted to parliament or its advisory body after he made it back to the central committee .
if yang retires , foreign minister wang yi , 64 this month , and song tao , 62 , minister of the party s international liaison department , are the top contenders for yang s job .
both wang and song are central committee members .
- veteran diplomat liu jieyi , 59 , china s permanent representative to the united nations , was elected to the central committee and is expected to take over as minister of the taiwan affairs office , replacing zhang zhijun , who is retiring .
- transport minister li xiaopeng , 58 , the oldest son of former premier li peng , became a full member of the central committee .
he was the lowest vote-getter among alternate members of the central committee five years ago .
- ten women made it onto the committee , 4.9 percent of the total , basically the same proportion as the previous central committee .
there were also 16 delegates from ethnic minorities , three of whom are women .
- china s top banking regulator guo shuqing , veteran banker jiang chaoliang and securities regulator liu shiyu , the three front runners to succeed zhou xiaochuan as central bank governor , were all voted onto the central committee .
( this version of the story corrects the number of ethnic minority members to 16 from 15 in paragraph 12 )
