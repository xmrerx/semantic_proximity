berlin ( reuters ) - the travel restrictions put in place by u.s. president donald trump on seven countries are deterring travelers from other countries too , according to a travel analysis company .
forwardkeys , which analyses 16 million flight reservations a day from major global reservation systems , said bookings for international arrivals to the united states over the next three months were 2.3 percent higher than last year .
but on jan. 27 , the day trump issued the executive order , bookings had been 3.4 percent ahead of the previous year , forwardkeys data showed .
when the travel ban was in place from jan. 28 to feb. 4 , bookings to the united states dropped 6.5 percent , including an 80 percent slump in reservations from the seven countries listed on trump ’ s order and a 13.6 percent drop from western europe .
on the day the curbs were lifted by a u.s. judge , bookings from iran surged , forwardkeys said , leaving reservations for travel to the united states five times higher on feb. 3 and feb. 4 than the same two days a year earlier .
most of those bookings were for arrival in the united states on feb. 5 and feb. 6 .
forwardkeys ceo olivier jager cautioned that the data was just a snapshot of an eight-day period and it would continue to monitor the situation .
other groups , such as the u.n. world tourism organization , have also warned travel demand could be hurt by u.s. restrictions , which are still suspended pending a u.s. appeals court hearing due to start at 2300 gmt on tuesday .
“ the ambiguity of these very latest developments introduced by president trump is casting a shadow over the future travel demand to and from the u.s. , ” said nadejda popova , travel project manager at euromonitor .
“ the new executive order could also impact how the u.s. is perceived as a tourism destination and how open to foreign travelers it will be in the future . ”
