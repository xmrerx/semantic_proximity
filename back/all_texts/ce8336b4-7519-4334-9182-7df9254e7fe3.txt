WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senate Republicans passed a measure on Thursday that would permanently repeal Obamacareâ€™s so-called Cadillac tax on high-cost employer-provided insurance without a single Democratic vote amid a broader debate to repeal the healthcare law.
The measure passed along party lines by a 52-48 vote.
To become law, it will need to be passed by the U.S. House of Representatives.
