What does President Cheeto McTinyhands do best when someone s about to make him look REALLY stupid or bad or criminal?
He jumps on Twitter to deflect as hard as he can, and often makes himself look even worse.
The House Intel Committee is falling apart at the seams thanks to Chairman Devin Nunes inability to maintain any semblance of integrity, and now it s been revealed Trump s own son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has met with a Russian bank with ties to the former KGB, and other undisclosed Russian officials as well.This is in addition to the possibility that Michael Flynn has flipped on Trump, the uncertainty surrounding three former Trump aides sudden willingness to testify in the Russia investigation, and the growing calls among Democrats for Nunes to recuse himself from the investigation (or resign entirely).Trump s latest deflection is simple: Why isn t the Intel Committee investigation Hillary?
Because, after all, she allegedly has ties to Russia too:Why isn t the House Intelligence Committee looking into the Bill & Hillary deal that allowed big Uranium to go to Russia, Russian speech .
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017 money to Bill, the Hillary Russian reset, praise of Russia by Hillary, or Podesta Russian Company.
Trump Russia story is a hoax.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 28, 2017Oh gee, could it be because Trump is in the White House and Hillary isn t?
The Trump Russia story is a real story.

They don t matter and have no power.
As opposed to, say, the President colluding with Russia.

#TrumpRussia pic.twitter.com/XCryIbjXsO #TheResistance (@AynRandPaulRyan) March 28, 2017Yes lil Donnie is doing his level best to keep attention off of his growing scandal, his plummeting poll numbers, and his first massive failure.
If he keeps this up, his poll numbers will fall to the lowest this country has literally ever seen in a president s first six months in office.
Then his Twitter deflections will get really interesting.Featured image by Mark Wilson via Getty Images
