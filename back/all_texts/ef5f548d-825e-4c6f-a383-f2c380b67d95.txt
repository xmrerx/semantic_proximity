Oklahoma State Republicans have completely gone off the deep end with this one.
The party, with the help of a few sellout Democrats, passed a state law by a vote of 40-7, that would illegally seize the licenses of doctors who perform abortions.The measure does include a clause that protects doctors in the case of life of the mother or to preserve her health.
However, there was no mention of an equivalent exception for rape or incest.The stupidity of this law can only be described as astounding due to its obvious unconstitutionality.
It will be reversed in court once costly taxpayer-funded litigation starts, after what will likely be equally expensive appeals.One Republican, Brian Crain, was the only member of his party that voted against the law.
It isn t clear if he is against the law or voted against it because it was amended heavily without allowing time for a review.
However, the fact he is pro-life pro-forced birth seems to indicate he would have voted for it.
One other Republican senator, Ervin Yen, was against the bill but claims he accidentally voted for it.
That s a new way to explain bad votes for sure.The Oklahoma State Medical association is against the law for obvious reasons one being that it is blatant and unconstitutional intimidation of doctors.
It also places an undue burden on women seeking to exercise a constitutional right.The precedent that a law like this could set is downright terrifying.
If you can sabotage a person s career for doing a legally protected thing, you can do it for other legally protected things.
You taught your students evolution?
You lose your teaching license.
The list of these kinds of things would grow long in a short amount of time.No word has come from Oklahoma Republicans about how this law will ensure job creation, lower taxes or a reduction in the cost to state welfare programs.Featured image via stubbornfacts1776
