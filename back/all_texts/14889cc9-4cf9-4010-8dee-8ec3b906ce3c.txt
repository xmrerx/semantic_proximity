Michelle came out of hiding today to take a baseball bat to President Trump.
She spoke to an audience about nutrition and started out her speech by attacking President Trump, We gotta make sure we don t let anybody [Trump] take us back.
Because the question is where we going back to?
And this is where you really have to look at motives.
Ya know I mean, you have to stop and think, why don t you want our kids to have good food at school?
What is wrong with you?
And then for the kicker, immediately after she lobs a direct verbal bomb at President Trump, she asks, Why is that a partisan issue?
Why would that be political?Mooch then goes on to call mom s to take action against Trump.
She tells the audience, Here s the secret If someone [Trump] is doing that (taking her crappy lunches out of school cafeteria s) they don t care about your kids.
Can anyone imagine Laura Bush coming out on her first public appearance after leaving the White House and accusing the newly ordained Barack Obama of not caring about your kids?
I can guarantee you d be hearing about it in more places than just conservative media sources like 100percentfedup.com!It s a question she should have asked herself.
In case anyone has forgotten what Mooch s lunches for kids that she cared so deeply for looked like, we ve included a few examples of photos that were posted to social media of Mooch s crap sandwiches .
Hopefully these photos won t ruin your appetite for your next meal:Wow!
I bet the kids couldn t wait to dig into this mystery meal:Fresh catch sandwich with fresh sweet corn!Here s Michelle s version of pizza:
