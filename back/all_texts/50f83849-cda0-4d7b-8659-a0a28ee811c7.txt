Another day, another example of right-wing racism coming out of the GOP.
As the RNC heads into its fourth and (thank God) final night, a story not picked up by the mainstream media is circulating amongst other publications.A Trump delegate based out of Illinois has been sent home after expressing hope that some brave snipers would shoot some n s on a Facebook page.
Lori Gayne, who admitted to making the post under a different name, posted a picture of police officers standing on the roof of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Museum with the caption: Our brave snipers just waiting for some N to try something.
Love them.
Gayne admitted that she made the post while on the floor of the convention.
She was elected a delegate to the RNC back in March during the state s primary.Of course Gayne apologized, but said the post was not meant to be racist and that as a Jewish woman, she wants everyone to know that this post did not represent her feelings towards minorities and that she is completely anti-violence.Yeah sure.
Is that why Gayne goes by the name whitepride on social media accounts?
Is that why she has been openly hostile towards Black Lives Matter and has expressed anger at being called a racist when she does racist things like that Facebook post?The party of personal responsibility really has a responsible delegate on their hands.Thankfully the Illinois GOP had a zero tolerance approach and revoked Gayne s credentials and sent her sorry, pathetic self back to Illinois.This is Trump s America.
Where white racists get to be racist then cry foul and make excuses.
While only 18 of the 2,400 delegates at the RNC are black and only 20 percent of the speakers are non-white, it should come as no surprise that Trump delegates harbor such racist and violent feelings towards those who don t look like them.Is this the kind of branding the GOP is doing to get minority voters on their side?Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
