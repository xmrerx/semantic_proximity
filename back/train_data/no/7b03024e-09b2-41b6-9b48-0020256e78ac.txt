johannesburg ( reuters ) - south africa s government is considering a range of budget cuts that could include slashing social grants for the most vulnerable in order to pay for free tertiary education , a newspaper reported on friday .
south africa s rand weakened on thursday after comments by president jacob zuma raised concerns about higher spending on education , which would put added strain on the country s already stretched public finances .
the mail & guardian newspaper said a presidential fiscal committee had presented a document to zuma outlining possible cuts to fund free higher education for lower-income students as well as plugging a swelling budget deficit .
options included cuts to the social grants that are the main source of income for around 17 million people - a third of the population - and slashing the budgets for housing , infrastructure and the armed forces .
a freeze on civil servant wage hikes was also on the cards , the newspaper reported .
the presidency and treasury did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
violent protests by students and activists demanding free tuition rocked several south african universities last year , underlying tensions in a country marred by glaring income disparities defined largely by race .
south africa is staring down the barrel of ratings downgrades after the treasury last month widened the 2017/18 budget deficit estimate to 4.3 percent of gross domestic product while lowering this year s economic growth forecast to 0.7 percent from 1.3 percent .
