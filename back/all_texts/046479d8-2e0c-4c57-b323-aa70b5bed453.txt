Dr. Ben Carson is brilliant, good-hearted, a true American patriot, and one of the most honest candidates to ever run for President.
He stayed above the fray, yet still managed to hit back hard when it came to the leftist media.
He made a positive contribution to the field of GOP candidates and made some very good observations about what needs to be done to heal a broken Republican party.
Although he is soft-spoken, he didn t mince words or concern himself with political correctness.
He is a true champion of the unborn and does more on his own to help students in poor communities than every Democrat politician combined.
He challenged the media and the elitists in his own party.
His wisdom and courage will be missed by many.
Thank you Ben Carson for bringing class and courage to the Republican party WATCH the brilliant DR. BEN CARSON fearlessly explain the TRUTH behind Planned Parenthood here:Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson announced Wednesday that he sees no political path forward after his Super Tuesday losses and will not attend the upcoming Fox News debate.
I have decided not to attend the Fox News GOP Presidential Debate tomorrow night in Detroit, he said in a statement Thursday.
Even though I will not be in my hometown of Detroit on Thursday, I remain deeply committed to my home nation, America.
I do not see a political path forward in light of last evening s Super Tuesday primary results.
However, this grassroots movement on behalf of We the People will continue.
Along with millions of patriots who have supported my campaign for President, I remain committed to Saving America for Future Generations.
