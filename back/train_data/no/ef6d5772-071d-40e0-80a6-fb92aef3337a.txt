dubai ( reuters ) - state-owned saudi arabian airlines said it will start flying regularly to iraq on monday after a 27-year halt , state news agency spa said .
the carrier s director general , saleh bin nasser al-jasser , will accompany reporters and passengers on the first flight to depart from the saudi city of jeddah to baghdad , spa said late on sunday .
there have been no flights between saudi arabia and iraq since former iraqi president saddam hussein invaded neighboring kuwait in 1990 .
saudi arabia and the united arab emirates are both wooing baghdad in an effort to halt the growing regional influence of arch-foe iran .
in august the two countries said they planned to open the arar land border crossing for trade for the first time since 1990 .
that announcement followed a decision by the saudi cabinet this month to set up a joint trade commission with iraq .
saudi arabian budget airline flynas was the first saudi airline to fly to iraq in more than 25 years .
