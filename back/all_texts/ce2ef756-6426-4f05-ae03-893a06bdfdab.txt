WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he “will absolutely do safe zones in Syria” to protect people fleeing violence there.
“I’ll absolutely do safe zones in Syria for the people,” Trump said in an interview with ABC News broadcast on Wednesday.
“I think that Europe has made a tremendous mistake by allowing these millions of people to go into Germany and various other countries,” he said.
