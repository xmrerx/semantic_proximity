You know how conservatives are demanding proof that Donald Trump paid some Russian ladies for a golden shower (honestly, wouldn t we all enjoy that)?
Well, this gentleman gave The Donald one for free and he can provide evidence.Meet Dino Rachiele.
A quick scroll through his Facebook timeline shows that he doesn t post about politics much, if any (though one post reveals that he makes a delicious-looking Timpano), but he is now gaining recognition for a video he made years ago in which he spoke out about the time that he gave a certain billionaire a golden shower.
This video was largely ignored until now but with news breaking that Trump allegedly paid a couple of nice Russian ladies to drain the swamp on his bed, his YouTube video is picking up traffic quite quickly.Rachiele manufactures high-end sinks (what did you think we meant by golden shower, perverts?)
and used to sell home fixtures, according to Gizmodo.
In his 2011 video, I gave Donald Trump a golden shower, Rachiele who inexplicably found himself able to vote for someone as terrible as Trump says he sent Donald Trump one of two gold shower heads in 2007 and decided to gift one of them to The Donald during one of his feuds with Rosie O Donnell because he knows, like a couple Russian prostitutes seem to know, that Donald Trump just adores gold.Now, some might consider it unbelievable that Rachiele gave The Donald a golden shower, so here s a letter from Trump s assistant at the time verifying that Rachiele did, indeed, send Trump a golden showerhead, but it also seems to indicate that it was part of a sales pitch.
The letter informed Rachiele that Trump has no interest in purchasing at this time with a vague promise of possibly working together in the future and a boilerplate we wish you the greatest success in your endeavors):In what seems to be a clear attempt to create a demand for a limited edition product by first sending one to Trump and later deceptively omitting the fact that it was manufactured by a company owned by Rachiele, he then invites people to email him to get what he claims is the only other one in existence for the hefty price tag of $350.
Either he was lying about it being the only one or there were no takers, as he now says he is considering taking bids on it.If conservatives are as stupid as I know they are, Rachiele will be getting his own golden shower soon enough when one of them spends their kid s college fund on this piece of poorly manufactured history.Watch his video below:Featured image via screengrab
