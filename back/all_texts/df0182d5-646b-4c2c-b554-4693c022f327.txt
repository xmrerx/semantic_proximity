BERLIN (Reuters) - Germany does not support the Trump administration s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Wednesday.
The German government does not support this position, because the status of Jerusalem is to be resolved in the framework of a two-state solution, she was quoted as saying in a tweet by the government spokesman.
