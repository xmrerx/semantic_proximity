laura ingraham is dialed in on the republican s inability to get a good budget bill .
she held up the washington post to show how pelosi and schumer are celebrating the victory of the budget .
the democrats got pretty much everything they wanted at the expense of the american people .
we do not have a republican party on capitol hill that can get its act together .
laura ingrahamlet s face it the republicans didn t fight for us and ingraham knows it .
she mentions key parts of the spending bill in her rant on fox & friends .
we re happy she mentioned the * * * refugee resettlement program because that s one part of the bill that we re very disappointed in .
the refugee resettlement program is so bloated and needs to be overhauled or defunded altogether .
we re sick about it : the bill would include a total of $ 3 billion towards migration and refugee assistance , which is roughly the same that was spent in fiscal year 2016 .
it would also include $ 50 million towards the emergency refugee and migration assistance fund , which is also the same amount spent in the previous fiscal year .
