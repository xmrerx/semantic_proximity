Marco Rubio hates his job.
Last year, he said he wasn t going to run for reelection because he was frustrated.
He also had one of the worst attendance records in the Senate.
Now, Rubio wants his job back, but, as if his voters haven t been screwed enough from him, he won t promise he ll finish his term out.In an interview Tuesday, CNN s Manu Raju asked Rubio if he would commit to serving the entirety of his term, to which the Florida Republican said: No one can make that commitment because you don t know what the future s gonna hold in your life personally or politically.
I can commit to you this, Rubio said.
That if I am running to be a U.S.
Senator, I am fully prepared to allow the U.S. Senate to be the last political office I ever hold.

@mkraju to Marco Rubio: can you commit to serving a full 6 year term?Rubio: No one can make that commitment https://t.co/q5Lh26jjed Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) August 30, 2016Rubio s seat is important to both Republicans and Democrats.
It could help turn the balance of power one way or another and despite Rubio s horrible tenure and his ambivalence toward the office he s trying to hold, Democrats are facing an uphill battle.Right now, two Democrats are eyeing the Senate in Florida, former Rep. Alan Grayson and Rep. Patrick Murphy.
It s expected that Murphy, the more centrist of the two candidates, will win the nomination, but the election is another story.
So far, Rubio is handily winning in most polls.
Two show him within the margin of error.This fact is kind of amazing, considering Rubio has the absolute worst attendance record in the Senate.Of course, that might actually play well with his anti-government base, who would seemingly rather elect someone who s just a placeholder and an obstructionist, rather than someone who actually does his job for the people of Florida.
This is why this country can t have nice things literally.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images.
