A super PAC backing Ted Cruz s presidential campaign is using the confederate flag to promote their candidate and attack another Republican.The Courageous Conservatives PAC is now calling primary voters in South Carolina with a robocall that attacks Donald Trump and Governor Nikki Haley for their supposed opposition to the pro-slavery symbol.The ad and robocall start with audio of Trump stating, Put it in a museum, let it go.
It goes on to state that Trump supported Haley in removing the battle flag from a memorial on the statehouse grounds.
People like Donald Trump are always butting their noses into other people s businesses.
Trump talks about our flag like it s a social disease, the robocall said.It said Trump ridiculed our values and that voters should send Donald Trump and his New York values back to Manhattan.
The creators of the ad said they have called 80,000 homes in the state so far with this racist message, in the hopes that it will cut into the considerable lead most show for Trump.The ad comes after the tragic shooting of black churchgoers by a white supremacist in Charleston pushed Haley and other lawmakers around the country to finally begin moving the flag from state property.The confederate flag was erected in many southern states in reaction to the civil rights movement in the 1950s and 60s.Of course the confederacy was a separatist movement that declared open war on the legitimate U.S. government in order to defend the evil institution of slavery, in which black people were kept as property and free labor.Despite the Republican Party s own report in which it indicated that its loss of the 2012 election came about in part due to its candidate s inability to reach out to racial minorities, there is still a strong base of support within the right in favor of racist causes.
This is just more evidence that the party simply hasn t done the work to exclude open racists from their shrinking coalition.Featured image via Flickr
