berlin ( reuters ) - serbian and u.s. paratroopers will jump side-by-side during a joint exercise aimed at strengthening military ties with serbia , the u.s. general in charge of nato s allied air command said , a move that could trigger protests from moscow .
in the exercise , which is taking place at the invitation of the serbian government , paratroopers from both countries will jump side-by-side from 2 c-130j transport planes built by lockheed martin corp in a so-called insertion exercise .
about 100 u.s. air force and u.s. army personnel will participate in the event , general tod wolters , who also oversees u.s. air forces in europe and africa , told reuters .
they will actually get their paratroop wings as a result of these activities .
these are confidence-building activities - relationships that will last for a lifetime .
and they will certainly enhance the technical expertise of the serbs , he said .
it was not immediately clear how many serbian forces would participate .
wolters said tensions in the balkans remained a challenge for nato and the u.s. military , but engagement was key .
it will continue to be a challenge , but we ve got the right command focus .
we ve got the right resources .
we ve got the right dialogue and time will tell what unfolds , he said .
any nato-related activities in serbia are a red flag for russia , which worries about nato expansion in the former communist east .
moscow has also sought to bolster military ties with belgrade with the donation of six mig-29 fighter jets .
serbia has been performing a delicate balancing act between russia and the west , rejecting calls by u.s. officials to pick a side .
the largest of the states to emerge from the collapse of yugoslavia in the 1990s , orthodox christian and slavic serbia has natural affinity with moscow , but it is keen to join the european union .
although the eu is serbia s single largest trade partner and investor , russia controls its oil and gas supplies .
