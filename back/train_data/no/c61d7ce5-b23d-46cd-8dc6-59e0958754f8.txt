these protesters are only helping to catapult donald trump to the oval office .
the more america gets to see who is against donald trump , they more they want him to win .
they would have been better off keeping themselves busy , doing what they do best at this time of year finding ways to register dead voters and steal the vote .
they made a bad decision to allow the curtain to come back and expose themselves to america .
this may possibly be the worst pr move in the history of the democrat party .
americans are sick and tired of being pushed around by our radical , progressive community organizer and his radical regime for the past seven years.dad tells kids : `` look at [ veterans for trump ] in the eye we 're gon na be fighting against them kkk '' # crushtrump pic.twitter.com/ioenypqccu raheem ( @ raheemkassam ) march 19 , 2016trump supporters are trolling the protest # crushtrump nyc pic.twitter.com/f6g9nnyz5y cassandra fairbanks ( @ cassandrarules ) march 19 , 2016the radical no borders group came out with yuge banner .
