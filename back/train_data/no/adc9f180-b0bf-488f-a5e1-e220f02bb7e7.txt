geneva ( reuters ) - the united nations human rights office is appalled at the hanging of 38 prisoners in iraq , a u.n. spokeswoman said on friday , a day after the executions at a prison in the southern iraqi city of nassiriya .
we are deeply shocked and appalled at the mass execution , the spokeswoman , liz throssell , told a regular u.n. briefing in geneva , adding that the human rights office had huge concerns about iraq s use of the death penalty and - not for the first time - urged the government to halt all executions .
given the flaws of the iraqi justice system , it also appears extremely doubtful that strict due process and fair trial guarantees were followed in these 38 cases .
this raises the prospect of irreversible miscarriages of justice and violations of the right to life .
the 38 male prisoners were convicted by iraq s judiciary for terrorism-related crimes , she said .
she did not have information on their ages or nationalities .
in september , iraq hanged 42 prisoners in a single day , and the u.n. has learned of 106 executions this year , throssell said .
last year the ministry of justice announced 88 executions , but the u.n. believes the number may have been as high as 116 .
the world body had repeatedly asked the ministry of justice for data about prisoners , sentencing and executions but no such information had been provided since 2015 , she said .
previously the united nations had spoken of about 1,200 people being on death row , but it was now impossible to confirm that information , she said .
the justice ministry said in a statement on thursday that all those convicted were members of islamic state .
officials have said all the appeal options available to the condemned had been exhausted , according to the statement .
