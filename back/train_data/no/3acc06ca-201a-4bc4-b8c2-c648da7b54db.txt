warsaw ( reuters ) - ukraine has summoned the polish ambassador in kiev after poland denied entry to a ukrainian official in an escalation of a diplomatic spat over the two neighbours troubled past .
poland s decision to refused entry on saturday to the head of ukraine s commemoration commission , svyatoslav sheremet , was in response to a ban imposed earlier this year by kiev on the exhumation of poles killed in ukraine during world war two , polish state news agency pap reported .
the ukrainian side has complained that mr sheremet was not allowed into poland , poland s ambassador to kiev jan pieklo told pap after the meeting with ukrainian authorities .
i have been also informed that this is a problem that concerns the restarting of exhumations because sheremet is the person responsible for this , pieklo said , adding that both sides had agreed that the exhumations should be restarted .
in an apparent effort to mend ties , representatives of the polish and ukrainian presidents said on friday that they reconfirmed their commitment to strengthening the strategic partnership .
the parties agreed that the ban on the search and exhumation works in ukraine should be lifted , the statement published on friday said .
the denial of entry to sheremet came after the polish foreign minister said earlier in november that poland would bar ukrainians with anti-polish views .
[ l8n1n84ef ] poland last year passed a resolution that declared the world war two-era killing of about 100,000 polish men , women and children by units in the ukrainian insurgent army ( upa ) genocide .
ukraine rejects that label , saying the killings were a result of bilateral hostilities .
