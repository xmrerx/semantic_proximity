The apparent increase among Latino voters in key early voting states seems to be triggering something of a public meltdown with Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
At a campaign event in Nevada, the former reality TV star began spinning a new conspiracy theory.As Donald Trump swept his campaign across the country in a final sprint, he claimed that long lines in Clark County, Nevada, were evidence of electoral wrongdoing.
It s being reported that certain key Democratic polling locations in Clark County were kept open for hours and hours beyond closing time to bus and bring Democratic voters in, Trump said.
Folks, it s a rigged system.
It s a rigged system.
And we re going to beat it, he said.Trump wasn t alone.
Michael McDonald, the state chairman of the Nevada Republican Party made an explicitly racist complaint about the surge in early voters at the same event noting, They kept a poll open until 10 o clock at night so a certain group could vote.
Early indicators show that Republicans are in big trouble in the key swing state of Nevada.
Clark County, home to Las Vegas and the state s largest population, is also over 30% Latino.
The area has been targeted by the Clinton campaign for early voting, as well as by the political operation of Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV).A strong performance there has led to a situation where the Trump ticket is behind the eight ball before Election Day has even begun.
Nevada political analyst Jon Ralston has already said that there is only a tiny sliver of hope for Trump, which may explain his bluster and frustration at the campaign event.Trump launched his campaign with an attack on Latinos, calling Mexican immigrants criminals and rapists and promising to build a wall along the southern border to keep Latinos out.
It appears that they heard him loud and clear and are hell-bent on destroying his campaign.Featured image via Flickr
