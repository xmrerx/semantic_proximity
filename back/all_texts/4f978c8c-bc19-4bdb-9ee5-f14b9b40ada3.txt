Donald Trump s Oklahoma campaign chair is a standup guy except when he s laying down with children, that is.
On Tuesday, The Oklahoman reported that state Senator Ralph Shortey was busted last Thursday getting a hotel room with an underage teen boy.
On March 9 officers of the Moore Police Department were contacted in reference to a welfare check at a local hotel, Lt. Kyle Dudley told the publication.
Responding officers found a juvenile male in a hotel room which was also occupied by an adult male.
The circumstances surrounding this incident are currently under investigation and no additional information can be released at this time.
Police thus far refuse to release a full report on the incident.Shortey (who is best-known for a bill that would ban the use of aborted fetuses in food) registered himself and his underage guest as adults at a Super 8 in Moore for a single night, checking in on March 8 and out on March 9.
It says two adults registered, the motel manager says at 12:20 a.m.
Responding to a welfare check call, police arrived while the the two were still in the room and took pictures according to an employee at the hotel.No charges have been filed yet, but police are investigating text messages sent between the boy and Shortey, who announced in 2015 that he was proud to be tapped to chair Trump s 2016 campaign in Oklahoma.This is something that must be embarrassing for Shortey, who recently bragged that he had lunch with Donald Trump Jr.:What was Shortey doing with an underage boy in a hotel room after midnight?
There s no way to know for certain yet.
But let s hope the child was not harmed.Featured image via Facebook
