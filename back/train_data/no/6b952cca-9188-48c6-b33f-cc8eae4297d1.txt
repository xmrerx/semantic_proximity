moscow ( reuters ) - russian prime minister dmitry medvedev said on thursday that u.s.-russia ties were the worst he could recall , but that u.s. president donald trump struck him as a friendly person keen to establish positive working contacts with russia .
trump took office in january , saying he wanted warmer ties with russia which had fallen to a post-cold war low .
but since then , ties have frayed further after u.s. intelligence officials said russia had meddled in the presidential election , something moscow denies .
medvedev , who met trump in manila this month , suggested he and president vladimir putin both found trump constructive and friendly in person , but accused other u.s. politicians of playing what he called the russian card to achieve their own aims and influence trump s attitude towards russia .
the impression he ( trump ) makes is that of a friendly political figure ready to establish full-scale contacts and who reacts reasonably towards everything , medvedev said in an interview with russia s main tv channels .
medvedev said he had chatted to trump briefly over dinner at a regional summit in manila .
he ( trump ) recalled our cooperation during world war two , saying that it was important both for russia and america , said medvedev .
it was a pretty normal exchange i am sure and president ( vladimir ) putin has spoken about just that - that everything is fine when it comes to our relations when we meet in person .
but medvedev said that was of secondary importance because overall u.s.-russia relations were appalling .
they are very bad , i would say appalling .
they are the worst i can remember .
medvedev said the political climate towards russia in the united states reminded him of the 1950s when u.s .
senator joseph mccarthy helped launch a campaign against anyone he regarded as pro-communist in the united states .
but still , even then there was no talk of settling accounts with your own president , said medvedev .
