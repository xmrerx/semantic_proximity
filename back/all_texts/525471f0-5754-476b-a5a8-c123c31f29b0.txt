Whenever we have a terror attack in America, the media goes to great lengths to make sure no one assumes of the killer was a Muslim.
Meanwhile, the media has gone out of their way to convince Americans that all Hispanics hate Trump.
Isn t it interesting how quickly they print a story about the murderer of two Muslim men who witnesses describe as a tall Hispanic man and then blame Trump?An imam and his assistant were shot and killed in broad daylight as they walked home from a mosque in Queens.
That s not what America is about, Khairul Islam, 33, a local resident told the Daily News.
We blame Donald Trump for this.
Trump and his drama has created Islamophobia.
Another Imam, whose name is unknown at the moment, also blamed the real estate mogul and former NYC mayor for the shooting.
For those in leadership like Trump and Mr. Giuliani, and other members of other institutions that project Islam and Muslims as the enemy, this is the end result of their wickedness, the Imam said at a gathering of Muslims protesting the shooting.Other Muslim gatherings were chanting This is Donald Trump s fault, and Muslim hate crime.
Witnesses providing leads to the NYPD described the shooter as a tall man of Hispanic descent.
The NYPD is currently conducting an extensive canvass of the area for video and seeking additional witnesses as the shooter remains at large.
