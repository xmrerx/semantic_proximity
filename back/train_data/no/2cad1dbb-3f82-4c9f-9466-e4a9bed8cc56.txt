berlin ( reuters ) - chancellor angela merkel s bavarian allies still hope a three-way coalition government can be formed by the end of the year even though negotiators made little progress on bridging deep divisions this week , a senior party official said on friday .
merkel is trying to unite her conservative alliance , which consists of her cdu and its bavarian csu sister party , in a pact with the greens and the pro-business free democrats to form a government .
the conservatives placed first but lost seats in an election last month .
after meeting for 11 hours on thursday , the three camps resigned themselves to further talks next week after making little headway on the contentious issues of immigration and climate policy .
our aim is for the exploratory talks to be at the stage in mid-november where we can tell our ( party ) committees yes , this works , let us begin concrete negotiations , said manfred weber , a senior member of the csu who is involved in the talks .
and then i hope we will have a new government by the end of the year , he told broadcaster bayerischer rundfunk , but added : it will be very difficult .
immigration was the most divisive topic on thursday .
many conservatives want to take a harder line after blaming their election setback on merkel s decision to open germany to more than a million mainly middle eastern migrants in 2015 and 2016 .
negotiators will meet again next monday and thursday , by which time they want to seek a solution on refugee policy , sources close to the talks said .
an agreement reached between merkel s cdu and the csu to cap annual refugee numbers had to be the basis of any coalition accord , andreas scheuer , csu general secretary , said after thursday s talks .
the greens oppose a refugee cap .
politicians say it could take months to form the coalition , leaving germany hobbled as the european union looks to its wealthiest country for leadership on governance reform .
