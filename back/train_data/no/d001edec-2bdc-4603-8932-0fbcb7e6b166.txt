we are way past any further discussion or debate .
scientists are as sure that humans are causing climate change as they are that cigarette smoke causes lung cancer .
so unless you want to debate that point , don t debate about climate change any longer because it is our moral responsibility to act .
that responsibility right now is crystal clear and that is why we have taken action .
