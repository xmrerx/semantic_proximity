WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Senator Rand Paul said on Sunday that the Obamacare replacement bill he plans to unveil would get rid of some of the mandates for health insurance coverage with the aim of bringing down the cost of insurance.
Speaking on the CNN program “State of the Union,” Paul also said his proposal would overhaul healthcare regulations to allow small businesses to band together to buy insurance.
