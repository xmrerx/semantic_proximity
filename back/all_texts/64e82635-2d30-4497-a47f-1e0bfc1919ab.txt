Wow way to appeal to an almost exclusively female audience!
Because every woman who s been raped, can certainly connect with a loudmouth talk show host who calls them tramps Unbelievable!The View's Joy Behar calls Bill Clinton's rape victims "tramps," liberal audience laughs.
But they really care about women.
