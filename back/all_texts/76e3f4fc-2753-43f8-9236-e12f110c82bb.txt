There s a lot of uncertainties in this election, but one thing is crystal clear: Donald Trump is liar.
Now, whether or not he believes in anything he says remains to be seen.
No one has been able to crack the Republican presidential nominee (he even bragged that people can t) so who knows.But there is some telling evidence that Trump is a pathological lying, walking contradiction.
Look at his Politifact file.
Over 77 percent of the things that come out of his mouth have been lies.Then there s the obvious stuff: he use to support gay marriage and abortion, now he doesn t. He use o think Hillary Clinton was terrific and now she s crooked.
He opposed the Iraq War from the beginning but actually he didn t. The list goes on and on.But instead of reading a list, the Democratic Coalition Against Trump has made a video documenting, chronicling and highlighting dozens of Trump s biggest lies and contradictions.Republicans thought they were clever with their Hillary Clinton Lying For 13 Straight Minutes video until it was picked apart and debunked by Politifact, Reddit, Daily Kos and so forth.
But when it comes to political hogwash and making mountains out of mole hills, Republicans are professionals.But with Trump as their nominee, they have no room to speak.Posted on their Facebook, the organization, which runs a website dedicated to exposing Trump s lies, wrote:This is incredible watch Trump contradict himself on Iraq, abortion, Hillary Clinton, profanity, universal health care, the Libyan Intervention, illegal immigration, nuclear weapons, neo-Nazism, minimum wage, Bill Clinton, integrity, his tax returns, and his own political leanings.It is truly incredible to watch a man who has duped millions of Republicans into believing he is an authentic, conservative, pro-American counter to Hillary Clinton.Here s the video in all its glory, watched by over 3 million people:Trump supporters claim they back to bloated narcissist because he says what he means and he tells it like it is.
Only he doesn t say what he means just what s expedient and he doesn t tell it like it is, he tells it based on what his supporters want, and that certainly isn t the truth.Featured image via Jeff Swensen/Getty Images
