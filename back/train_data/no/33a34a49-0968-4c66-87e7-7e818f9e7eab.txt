washington ( reuters ) - republicans plan to bring a bill addressing puerto rico ’ s debt crisis to the floor of the u.s. house of representatives by the end of march , house majority leader kevin mccarthy said on monday .
mccarthy , speaking to reporters at a press briefing , offered no details on the content of the planned legislation .
he said two house committees will be in charge of developing legislation , adding that one of them is looking at a “ control panel ” to help the caribbean island u.s. territory out of its debt problems .
the u.s. treasury department has called on congress to create a fiscal control board for puerto rico .
puerto rico governor alejandro garcia padilla has said his administration would seek to ensure that any such board would respect the island ’ s autonomy .
“ chapter 9 ” bankruptcy for municipalities also has been discussed , mccarthy said .
last year , house speaker paul ryan said he wanted the republican-led house to come up with a response to puerto rico ’ s fiscal crisis during the first quarter of 2016 .
“ it ’ s our intention to meet that deadline to get a bill ... on the floor , before the end of the first quarter , ” mccarthy said .
separately on monday , white house spokesman josh earnest said ryan was likely to discuss puerto rico ’ s crisis during tuesday ’ s scheduled meeting at the white house with president barack obama and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell .
