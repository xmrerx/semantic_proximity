Bernie Sanders has done plenty of things in his life.
From civil rights activist to U.S. senator and now to presidential candidate, Bernie has always figured out a way to create a platform that allows him to advocate for issues that are important to America.
What many of us didn t know was that while mayor of Burlington, Vermont, Sanders was also a host of a cable access show.NBC s Late Night host Seth Meyers reminded Bernie of those days when he showed a reel of the former mayor out and about talking to constituents.
Meyers said: I want to ask you one last thing.
If you were elected president, would you do what you did when you were mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and would you host a public access show?
Before you answer, we actually have footage of a show you hosted as mayor in Burlington.
