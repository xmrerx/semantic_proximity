david mikkelson told the dailymail.com that snopes does not have a standardized procedure for fact-checking since the nature of this material can vary widely .
he said the process involves multiple stages of editorial oversight , so no output is the result of a single person s discretion .
he also said the company has no set requirements for fact-checkers because the variety of the work would be difficult to encompass in any single blanket set of standards .
accordingly , our editorial staff is drawn from diverse backgrounds ; some of them have degrees and/or professional experience in journalism , and some of them don t , he added.for entire story- daily mail
