It s hard not to love Joss Whedon, the director of The Avengers films.
Not only is he a great film director capable of seamlessly blending action, drama and comedy, but he can also be rather outspoken on politics.
To that end, he created a very short film titled, If Congress Was Your Co-Worker, and it s, well, entirely too perfect for the situation in which we now find ourselves.Star Trek s Chris Pine stars in the video as Leonard, the biggest, most babyish obstructionist in the whole entire history of everything.
His co-workers responsible people who actually know how to work and want to get things done have to put up with his ridiculous, puerile behavior that s stopping everything they try to do in its tracks.Leonard starts off opposing the company s new healthcare plan, and when he s asked what they should do instead, he says, Not that!
and then shuts down the entire company while bragging that he still gets paid.Later on, the company appoints a consultant named Bob to untangle legal issues, and Leonard literally blocks him.
He blocks everyone s views of Bob while screaming, BOOOOO!
and says he doesn t like Bob.
When the boss asks why, he shouts, Because you chose him!
If any of that sounds familiar, it s because it s a perfect illustration of why neither Congress, nor Obama, has been able to get anything done since the Tea Party wave of 2010.
Leonard is the Tea Party, and also the larger Republican Party that allowed the Tea Party to come to power and do this to us.
That includes ridiculous and draconian views of the LGBTQ community, religious and racial minorities, and things like sexual harassment and assault, all of which are also touched on.The video ends with the company getting together to do something about Leonard.
Watch what they do below, and remember to go vote on Tuesday, Nov. 8, if you haven t already done so.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
