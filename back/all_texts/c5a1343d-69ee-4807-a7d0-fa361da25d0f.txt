TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Friday that it is not so easy to change U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s mind on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP).
Trump will seek quick progress towards a bilateral trade agreement with Japan in place of the TPP deal he abandoned this week, when Abe visits the White House next month, an official in the Trump administration said on Thursday.
