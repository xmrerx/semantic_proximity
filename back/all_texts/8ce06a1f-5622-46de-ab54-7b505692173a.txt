The picture, snapped by a White House photographer traveling with the president as he left his golf course in Sterling, Va., went viral almost immediately.
News outlets picked up the story when it appeared in a White House pool report.
Late-night talk show hosts told jokes about the encounter and people on social media began hailing the unidentified woman as a she-ro, using the hashtag #Her2020.The woman s name is Juli Briskman.
Her employer, government contractor Akima LLC, wasn t so happy about the photo.
They fired her over it.Juli was so proud of her disgusting and hateful act of disrespect for our President that she posted the image of herself to the top of her Facebook page:In a Saturday interview with HuffPost, Briskman, a 50-year-old mother of two, said she was stunned that someone had taken a picture of her giving Trump the middle finger.As the photo circulated online, Briskman decided to tell Akima s HR department what was happening when she went to work on Monday.
By Tuesday, her bosses called her into a meeting and said she had violated the company s social media policy by using the photo as her profile picture on Twitter and Facebook.
They said, We re separating from you, said Briskman.
Basically, you cannot have lewd or obscene things in your social media.
So they were calling flipping him off obscene.
Briskman, who worked in marketing and communications at Akima for just over six months, said she emphasized to the executives that she wasn t on the job when the incident happened and that her social media pages don t mention her employer.
They told her that because Akima was a government contractor, the photo could hurt their business, she said.
