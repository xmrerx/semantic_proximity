Why does FOX News even give this guy a microphone?
He lost his relevance about a decade ago, and yet FOX News still thinks Americans care about anything he has to say.
He was against gun control before he was for it Republican strategist Karl Rove said on Fox News Sunday the only way to stop gun-related violence, like the Wednesday massacre at Emmanuel African Methodist Church in Charleston S.C., was to repeal American citizens Second Amendment rights.When Chris Wallace asked Rove how we can, stop the violence, the long-time gun-rights advocate stated that we have made great strides as a nation in empathizing with the victims of these types of shootings, but the only way to guarantee they will stop is to remove guns from society.
What do you think?WALLACE: How do we stop the violence?What do you think?
ROVE: I wish I had an easy answer for that, but I don t think there s an easy answerWhat do you think?
We saw an act of evil.
Racist, bigoted evil, and to me the amazing thing is that it was met with grief and love.
Think about how far we ve come since 1963.
The whole weight of the government throughout the South was to impede finding and holding and bringing to justice the men who perpetrated the [Birmingham] bombing.What do you think?
And here, we saw an entire state, an entire community, an entire nation come together, grieving as one and united in the belief that this was an evil act, so we ve come a long way.What do you think?
Now maybe there s some magic law that will keep us from having more of these.
I mean basically the only way to guarantee that we will dramatically reduce acts of violence involving guns is to basically remove guns from society, and until somebody gets enough oomph to repeal the Second Amendment, that s not going to happen.Via: Daily Caller
