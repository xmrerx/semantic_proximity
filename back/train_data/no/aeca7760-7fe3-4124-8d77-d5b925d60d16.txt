the international committee of the red cross said lorena enebral perez , 38 , was killed in its orthopedic rehabilitation center in mazar-i-sharif .
energetic and full of laughter , lorena was the heart of our office in mazar .
today , our hearts are broken , said the icrc s head of delegation in afghanistan , monica zanarelli .
perez s work in afghanistan involved helped people , including children , who had lost legs or arms , mostly in the war , to learn to walk again or feed themselves .
sheer jan durani , a spokesman for the police chief in balkh province , said two patients were admitted to hospital and one took out a pistol apparently concealed in a wheelchair and shot the woman .
both men were arrested , he said .
afghanistan is one of the most dangerous countries in the world for aid workers , with groups including the icrc often facing attacks on their staff , both afghan and foreign .

the kidnapped afghan staff were released six days ago , the icrc statement said .
the icrc has seven rehabilitation centers in afghanistan that manufacture more than 19,000 artificial limbs per year and treat hundreds of thousands of patients .
