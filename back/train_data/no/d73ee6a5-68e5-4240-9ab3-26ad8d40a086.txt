singapore ( reuters ) - former zimbabwe president robert mugabe visited a hospital in singapore this week apparently for medical checks , his first trip outside his country since he was ousted from office last month , sources in singapore said on thursday .
the 93-year-old former leader who ruled the southern african nation for 37 years , resigned after the army and his ruling zanu-pf party turned against him when it became clear that his 52-year-old wife , grace , was being groomed as his successor .
mugabe left harare with his wife and aides on monday evening , a zimbabwe state security official said this week .
he was expected to also visit malaysia where his daughter is expecting a child .
an air zimbabwe flight arrived in singapore on tuesday .
mugabe visited a private hospital in central singapore on wednesday with an entourage that included his security guards , the sources who were familiar with the visit told reuters .
they spoke on the condition they were not identified as they are not authorized to speak to the media .
a spokesman at the hospital said he would not be able to confirm whether mugabe had visited its clinics .
mugabe has a reputation for extensive international travel , including regular medical trips to singapore - a source of public anger among his impoverished citizens .
