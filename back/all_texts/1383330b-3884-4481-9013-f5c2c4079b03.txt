Whenever a tragedy strikes, one can always count on love, support, and compassion to outweigh the horror, sadness and emptiness.
The smallest acts are what matter most.
And JetBlue is doing its part to help pick up the pieces after the horrific attack in Orlando.With family members all across the nation receiving the devastating news, the airline (which trains all of its employees in Orlando), is giving victims and their families free fights in and out of the city, so those who lost loved ones or need to support those who survived will not be burdened with traveling expenses.A spokesperson for the airliner explained: JetBlue is providing free seats on its available flights to/from Orlando for immediate family and domestic partners of victims who were killed or injured.
According to news sources, many of the victims have family members from Puerto Rico, which JetBlue flies in and out of as a popular destination site.
JetBlue will also be giving vouchers to those affected who need to make last minute changes to their ticketing.Currently, a 3-day roundtrip flight from Puerto Rico to Orlando on JetBlue costs $399 per person.
Ensuring these free flights for victim s family members will be a huge financial relief which is the least anybody can do to help ease any pains for these families.It s companies like JetBlue that show the naysayers how strong and resilient the human spirit can be in times of hopelessness.
A free plane ticket might not seem like much, but it is.
Human kindness comes in all forms.Also stepping up to the plate is Allegiant Airlines, which will also be offering free flights in and out of Orlando.Hopefully local hotels will follow in ensuring financially stress-free accommodations to the families flying in to pick up the pieces.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images
