White grievance queen Tomi Lahren was sent into full panic mode after someone discovered a bunch of tweets she forgot about when she apparently stopped popping p*ssy after a nice rousing chugging contest and tweeting about it.
Lahren made a name for herself by proving to be one of the dumbest people in the universe though her appearances on Glenn Beck s can you even call it a TV station?
Fine, for lack of a better phrase we ll go with tv station.
Before she worked for The Blaze, Lahren was a completely different person.
She might complain about people taking their damn handouts now, but here s her reaction to her first job.
Don t worry, she worked for her mommy and it was chill as F with a capital F. This website is free pic.twitter.com/fTZPR7Jbus med ?

(@med11n) January 10, 2017Others on Twitter found some more interesting tweets.
Did you know, for example, that she likes tweeting about the moisture level of her vagina and the importance of ensuring that someone trained in CPR being nearby at all times?
Many of her other tweets are sure to be a hit with her conservative Christian audience:Honestly Tony I don't know what you're referring to but you're 100% right @TomiLahren pic.twitter.com/qZo0boZizV med ?

She can pop as much p*ssy as she wants and drink herself into oblivion.
But watching her scramble through her timeline deleting posts in a panic is hilarious, as is her anger.
She s mad at all of you.
Like, really mad:Ok tommy pic.twitter.com/1Ooq98EXSg med ?
(@med11n) January 10, 2017On Thursday, Lahren released a video to address her old tweets and It.
Is.
Hilarious.
We re not going to ruin it for you, but you get to watch her throw a tantrum and go off on people in the background for making too much noise as she tried to explain what she meant by pop that p. Oddly, she did not address what she meant when she said she can t promise she won t drown you if you get her wet.
What a shame.
