Hillary Clinton is speaking up after her election loss and coming forward with the facts on what contributed to the results.
Despite the mainstream media s claims to the contrary, she points the finger at the extraordinary decision by FBI Director James Comey to interfere in the middle of the race.
Just as we were back up on the upward trajectory, the second letter from Comey essentially doing what we knew it would saying there was no there there was a real motivator for Trump s voters, Clinton said.
Essentially, the second Comey letter played right into Trump s hands by giving new suspicions to those who believed the Washington establishment was helping Clinton win and pushed a surge in turnout.
Trump spent the last four days of this campaign engaged in a nonstop attack on me personally, and the result is the result, Clinton said.The former presidential candidate also said she is concerned and deeply saddened for those who say they are living in fear in the United States after Trump s election.The decision by Comey was blasted by Democrats, and even some Republicans, as it gave the appearance that Clinton was still involved in wrongdoing, even though she had been previously cleared.
It also fed into the mainstream media s obsession with Clinton s emails, which they covered more than nearly any other issue during the election.By contrast, Trump s refusal to release his tax returns hardly merited coverage, by comparison, nor did the shady dealings of his personal charity, the Trump Foundation.The press, in concert with the FBI and the right wing, weighed in on the election all against one candidate.
While the right makes claims about liberal media bias, it is clear time and time again that they are weighing in on the behalf of the Republican side of the aisle and not the other.Featured image via Flickr
