geneva ( reuters ) - a convoy from the united nations and syrian arab red crescent entered towns in the besieged damascus suburb of eastern ghouta on monday , bringing aid to 40,000 people for the first time since june 2016 , the united nations said .
a tightening siege by government forces has pushed people to the verge of famine in the eastern suburbs , residents and aid workers said last week , bringing desperation to the only major rebel enclave near the syrian capital .
the u.n. office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs ( ocha ) said on twitter they had entered the towns of kafra batna and saqba .
the syrian arab red crescent said in a separate tweet that the inter-agency convoy had 49 trucks .
they carried food , nutrition and health items for 40,000 people in need , ocha spokesman jens laerke said .
the last time we reached these two locations were in june 2016 , he said .
a health worker in saqba who was present when the convoy started to offload said that nine trucks of foodstuffs , including milk and peanut butter , and four trucks of medicines had arrived so far .
technical specialists were on board to assess needs in the towns in order to plan a further humanitarian response , he said .
more aid to complement today s delivery is planned in the coming days , laerke added .
at least 1,200 children in eastern ghouta suffer from malnutrition , with 1,500 others at risk , a spokeswoman for the u.n. children s agency unicef said last week .
bettina luescher , spokeswoman of the u.n. world food programme ( wfp ) , said the convoy carried nutrition supplies for 16,000 children .
food , fuel and medicine once travelled across frontlines into the suburbs through a network of underground tunnels .
but early this year , an army offensive nearby cut smuggling routes that provided a lifeline for around 300,000 people in the enclave east of the capital .
