bamako ( reuters ) - mali s government said it has delayed regional elections from december to april amid security concerns caused by the spreading reach of islamist militants .
mali has struggled to deal with insurgents and sectarian infighting this year despite international military interventions and a 2015 peace deal , and much of the country s north remains beyond government control .
four united nations peacekeepers and a malian soldier were killed and 21 people wounded in two separate attacks in the center of the arid west african country on friday .
the government said in a statement that it wants to delay the regional elections , which were originally scheduled for dec. 17 , in order to organize inclusive elections in a peaceful atmosphere .
it was not clear if the delay would affect the timing of presidential elections scheduled for july .
opposition politicians expressed concern that the security situation is unlikely to improve by april .
the government would not even set the date of the ( regional ) elections because it does not control the security situation , said abouacar sidick fomba , chairman of the adepm party .
there is no evidence that the situation will improve by that date .
militants seized mali s desert north in 2012 before being forced back by french military intervention in 2013 .
but over the last two years they have reemerged as a major threat to security in mali and across its vast , porous desert borders in niger , burkina faso and beyond .
