even though obama has to pay for anything he wants to keep , it s still a bribe in my book.throughout 2014 , saudi king abdullah and top kingdom officials spent a fortune on gifts for obama , first lady michelle obama and their daughters roughly $ 1.35 million on the list.the accounting was made public the day before thanksgiving , with americans poised to dive into the gift-buying season.the first thing to know is that these gifts aren t bribes ( wink , wink ) .
if obama wants to keep anything he gets from another world leader , he has to pay fair market value for it and take it with him when he leaves office .
otherwise , u.s. law stipulates that the president must turn over everything to the national archives or other institutions for storage or display.obama is wealthy book sales and investments , on top of a $ 400,000 annual salary , have made the onetime college professor financially quite comfortable .
but it s hard to imagine him putting up the cash to keep the gold and silver men s wristwatch with leather band , valued at $ 18,400 , that he received from the saudi king on jan. 14 , 2014 .
or the $ 67,000 needed to own another timepiece , a white gold men s wristwatch with leather band , that the monarch gave him on april 15 , 2014 ( no word on whether it was inscribed happy tax day ) .
and then there was the 48-inch gold-plated brass replica of the makkah clock tower on marble base , presented march 28 , 2014 , and coming in at a cool $ 57,000 , roughly what a median american family earns in a year.impressive ?
not when compared to the gifts the saudi king , who died in 2015 , gave michelle obama.on jan. 14 , 2014 , barack obama might have been admiring the watch he wasn t going to keep , but the first lady got a diamond and emerald jewelry set including necklace , earrings , ring and bracelet .
value ?
$ 560,000.on april 15 , 2014 , she received an identically described set , but this one was worth $ 570,000.malia and sasha weren t left off the saudi king s list .
on jan. 14 , 2014 , they received diamond and emerald jewelry set including earrings , necklace , ring , brooch , and wristwatch .
diamond and ruby jewelry set including earrings , necklace , ring , brooch , and wristwatch .
price tag : $ 80,000.so did the saudi king give the gifts to the first family out of the kindness of his heart ?
of course not they re bribes , nobody gives stuff like that unless they expect something in return.read more : blur brain
