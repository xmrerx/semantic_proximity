The world is mourning the loss of a legend, as Prince Rogers Nelson known around the globe simply as Prince has died at the very young age of 57.
Tributes have poured in all over social media and around the world.
Block parties blasting his music could be seen roaring late into the night everywhere from his home state of Minneapolis, Minnesota, to New York City.
There is another way the public is playing tribute to the iconic artist though: by bathing buildings in purple.Social media site Twitter is alight with images and tweets of various buildings alight in Prince s signature color, from his famous and timeless hit, Purple Rain.
Here are just a few of those tweets, from the hashtag #PurpleForPrince:#PurpleForPrince today pic.twitter.com/lBunkN7xRI York Theatre Royal (@YorkTheatre) April 22, 2016It should be noted in the following tweet that Niagara Falls was actually scheduled to turn purple for Queen Elizabeth s birthday long before the beloved star s death, but what a weird coincidence that it collided with this tragic day.Melbourne's Arts Centre spire is purple tonight.
We love you #Prince ???

It really is a testament to how absolutely influential and loved this man was worldwide, and how much he is already missed.
When you loved Prince, hated him, or were indifferent to him, there is no denying that Prince is iconic, and that his amazing talent, artistry, and body of work changed the world.
It is my belief that he changed it for the better.Rest in Peace, Prince Rogers Nelson.
