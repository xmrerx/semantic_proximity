Is he really going to do it this time?
With Stephen Colbert, it s hard to tell but he made an appearance on Russian television and dropped a bombshell that could affect the 2020 election you know, if he s serious..@realDonaldTrump Don't worry, Mr. President.
I'm in Russia.
If the "tapes" exist, I'll bring you back a copy!

I am here to announce that I am considering a run for president in 2020, and I thought it would be better to cut out the middleman and just tell the Russians myself, Colbert continued.
If anyone would like to work on my campaign in an unofficial capacity, please just let me know.
While this seems unbelievable, this wouldn t be the first time Colbert has thrown his hat into the ring.
He once ran for president as his alter-ego, but the campaign ended with the primary.Americans for years have been urging Colbert to actually run for president preferably with Jon Stewart as his running mate and if there s one thing we have learned from the reality show host currently in the White House it s that anything is possible.Watch Colbert s announcement below:Featured image via screengrab
