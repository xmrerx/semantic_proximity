jerusalem ( reuters ) - an israeli and a palestinian were killed on thursday in two separate incidents in israel and the occupied west bank , officials said .
an israeli man was stabbed to death in the southern israeli city of arad in what police said was most probably a terrorist attack .
the investigation is continuing and police units are searching for the suspect who fled the scene , said a police spokesman .
earlier in the day , an israeli settler shot and killed a palestinian man in the west bank , in what the israeli army said was a response to an attack by palestinians throwing rocks , an account that palestinians denied .
the israeli military said the shooter had opened fire in self-defense as part of a group of settlers hiking near the village of qusrah who had come under attack .
local villagers identified the palestinian who was killed as mahmoud odeh , a 48-year-old farmer .
they denied that any clash had taken place before the shooting .
palestinian president mahmoud abbas condemned the incident as a cowardly act and evidence to the world of the ugly crimes conducted by settlers against unarmed palestinians , his office said in a statement .
the israeli military said troops arrived at the scene after the shooting .
israeli police said they were investigating the incident .
a wave of palestinian street attacks that began two years ago has largely dissipated and it is uncommon for two deadly events to occur in the same day .
