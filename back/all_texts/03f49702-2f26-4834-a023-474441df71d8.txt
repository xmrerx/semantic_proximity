Fareed Zakaria tends to go for the heart of the matter when he s talking about pretty much anything, but it s not likely that anybody expected him to criticize Donald Trump as bluntly as he did.
Zakaria was live on CNN, speaking with Wolf Blitzer about what it says when a presidential candidate has to come back, time and again, to clarify what he says on volatile issues like Russia.Zakaria explained that there s a pattern of ignorance with Trump, and how, when someone points out that he s wrong somewhere, he comes back with a certain bravado and tries to explain it away with a tweet or a statement.
He listed multiple examples of this, such as Brexit, the nuclear triad, and even where Tim Kaine was governor (Trump said New Jersey; Kaine actually governed Virginia).
Then he said: Usually he adds that the press hates him.
But there s a term for this kind of thing This is the mode of a bullshit artist.
DAMN.
There s a truth bomb if there ever was one.
Trump is, indeed, a bullshit artist there s no other way to put it.

Trump can t ever admit that he made a mistake.
It s the media that s dishonest.
It s his opponents and enemies who are dishonest.
Everyone but him is incredibly dishonest and unfair, and he s just a victim for whom our hearts bleed pink carbonated peanut butter.
In the end, though, a bullshit artist is what he really is.
And he s the GOP s candidate for president.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
