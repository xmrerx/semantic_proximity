just a few minutes after a terrorist murdered people in nyc , jake tapper chose the worst timing ever to weigh in on his thoughts about allahu akbar cnn anchor jake tapper called the islamic phrase allahu akbar beautiful minutes after reports of a terrorist attack in new york city , tuesday on the lead .
tapper was interviewing cnn s crime and justice reporter shimon prokupecz when he chimed in to give his opinion on the nature of the terrorist chant .
the arabic chant allahu akbar , god is great sometimes said under the most beautiful of circumstances and too often we hear of it being said in moments like this , tapper said.jake tapper : `` allahu akbar is sometimes said under the most beautiful of circumstances '' .

horrible ! a man in a rented home depot truck ( rented in nj ) ran over people on the bike path in lower manhattan but was stopped by a bus full of disabled children .
the terrorist then got out of the truck and started running around with a paintball gun and a pellet gun in each hand pointing at bystanders ( see video below ) .one witness wrote on twitter , jesus !
a car just ran over two people and then crashed into a school bus .
