On Tuesday, Donald Trump kicked off his morning by inserting his foot in his mouth, then his other foot, then growing a third foot and stuffing it in there too.As President I wanted to share with Russia (at an openly scheduled W.H.
meeting) which I have the absolute right to do, facts pertaining .
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017Sure, his explanation started out dumb as f*ck, but it gets better/worse: he says he gave code word material to Russia for humanitarian reasons.
Yes, you read that right he provided highly classified information to a hostile dictatorship for humanitarian reasons.
to terrorism and airline flight safety.
Humanitarian reasons, plus I want Russia to greatly step up their fight against ISIS & terrorism.

No need to pay for spies when Trump will give Russia intel freely.
Rob Szczerba (@RJSzczerba) May 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump Oh okay so you shared data so sensitive they have to use code-names for the subjects in it because of humanitarian reasons?
Jules Suzdaltsev (@jules_su) May 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump The way you re cosying up to Russia is sickening.
What are you thinking?
And why put Russia ahead of American interests?
Corruption 101.
Mike P Williams (@Mike_P_Williams) May 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump One sticky facts, Donald:YOU HAD YET TO SHARE THIS INTEL WITH OUR OWN ALLIES.No humanitarian concerns regarding western Europe?
Canada?
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) May 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump You criticize your administration for leaks and you leaked to our enemy!
Jail Donald Trump (@DTrumpExposed) May 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump The why not get permission from the country who shared it first?
You burned their source and possible we are less safe in future.
Jon (((Wolfsthal))) (@JBWolfsthal) May 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump Translation: I told the Russians because I m worried about them.
I love them.Also, I planned to tell America s allies eventually.

Penelope Reed (@PMilstein) May 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump Oh you re a humanitarian now?
So why are you trying to rid 20 million people of health care?
AC (@ACinthe715) May 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump Omg, did you just admit to giving the Russians classified information?
Randy Withers (@counselorinsite) May 16, 2017Interestingly, Trump national security advisor H.R.
McMaster claimed on Monday that Trump did not reveal classified information something he just as good as admitted in his tweets.Ironically, Trump who leaked classified information directly to Russia complained that he has been asking FBI Director Comey (whom he fired after Comey requested additional resources for the Russia investigation) and others to figure out who has been leaking information about his and his administration s misdeeds.I have been asking Director Comey & others, from the beginning of my administration, to find the LEAKERS in the intelligence community .. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 16, 2017This administration is a joke so bad it s almost criminal.
OK, it is criminal.
In fact, we re left to wonder when not if, but when Republicans will feel that they have no choice but to put their country first and impeach this orange motherfucker.Featured image via Getty Images (Pool)/screengrab
