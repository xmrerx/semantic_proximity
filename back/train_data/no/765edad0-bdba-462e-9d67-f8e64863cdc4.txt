mogadishu ( reuters ) - the united states military has carried out an air strike in somalia against al shabaab , an al qaeda-linked islamist insurgency that wants to topple the u.n.-backed government , the u.s. africa command said on wednesday .
it said several militants were killed in the strike 60 miles northwest of the capital , mogadishu , on tuesday at about 1500 gmt .
it was coordinated with the somali government , africom said in a statement .
al shabaab has publicly committed to planning and conducting attacks against the u.s. and our partners in the region , africom said .
earlier this month , the u.s. warned of a threat to its diplomatic staff in mogadishu and directed all non-essential staff to leave the capital .
al shabaab was pushed out of mogadishu in 2011 and has lost control of most of somalia s cities and towns .
but the group retains a strong presence in the south and center and can still carry out major attacks .
it was blamed for bombings in mogadishu last month that killed more than 350 people .
the group aims to topple somalia s government , drive out african union peacekeeping troops and impose its own harsh interpretation of islamic law .
