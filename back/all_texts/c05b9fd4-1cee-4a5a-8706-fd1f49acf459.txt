Jesse Jackson thinks he s Heaven s gatekeeper The arrogant reverend proclaimed that President Trump might not qualify to enter Jesus Kingdom.
How dare he!Jackson made the comments at the Ministers March for Justice : Trump says you must be able to speak the language of English, be qualified, and have a job skill.
Jesus would not qualify to come in Trump s country he would not qualify to get into Jesus kingdom.
Jackson used religion to bash Trump during the event: He quoted part of a passage from the gospel of Matthew: I was hungry, you fed me; naked, you clothed me; captive, you set me free.
Jackson was referring to the fact that he believes in open borders and welcoming arms for everyone.
Nice try, it s just not true that a nation can survive without borders.
This is typical of the pandering reverend who s been using minorities his entire life to profit off of.
He s a grifter along with Sharpton who was in attendance of course.
These shysters detest Trump because they know he s the real deal and will REALLY help all Americans.
