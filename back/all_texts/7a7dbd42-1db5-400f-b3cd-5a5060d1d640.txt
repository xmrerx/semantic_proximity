Donald Trump is concerned about the terminally ill not about their ability to recover, their quality of life, the amount of pain they re in or if they re happy or sad, but he wants them to live until November 8.
On Wednesday at a Nevada rally, Trump urged the terminally ill to hang out till November so they can assist in the destruction of the United States so they can vote for him.
I don t care how sick you are, The Donald said.
I don t care if you just came back from the doctor and he gave you the worst possible prognosis, meaning it s over.
Doesn t matter.
Hang out till November 8.
Get out and vote.
And then, all we re gonna say is, We love you and we will remember you always, Trump continued.
Get out and vote.
Naturally, Stephen Colbert wasn t about to allow this to go unchecked.
On Thursday.
he tweeted a new campaign slogan for The Donald:Trump asked the terminally ill to hold on 'til Election Day to vote for him.
He s revamped Diddy s slogan Vote Or Die to Vote, Then Die.
Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) October 7, 2016This is what we can expect from Donald Trump s America he will literally focus on whatever benefits himself as people die and the world burns around him.While it is doubtful that the terminally ill will be lining up to vote for him in November, many people will make sure that you get out there and do your part to make sure our next president isn t a man whose sole concern is The Vote, no matter where it comes from.Featured image via screengrab/Getty Images (Ethan Miller)
