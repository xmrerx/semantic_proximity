brussels ( reuters ) - the european union wants a post-brexit transition in which britain would no longer have a say in the bloc but would still fall under eu laws , according to eu documents and diplomats of the bloc s 27 remaining states .
here is a summary of the eu s vision of both the immediate period after britain leaves the bloc and its future trade relationship , as outlined in the documents seen by reuters ahead of a meeting of the 27 on wednesday .
the eu plans to engage with britain on these two issues only after the first , ongoing round of divorce talks advances enough to merit new negotiations with london on what comes after brexit .
the current , slow-moving talks have focused mainly on matters surrounding britain s actual split from the bloc , namely the exit bill , safeguarding expatriate rights and the future irish border .
the eu is waiting for britain s moves on these key issues before it agrees to open talks about the transition and future ties .
that may happen in december but is not a given .
* crucially , the eu is determined to ensure brexit does not leave britain better off economically or otherwise , as this could create a precedent undermining the bloc s purpose and existence in the future .
a discussion document for the wednesday meeting in brussels hence says that a non-member of the union , that does not live up to the same obligations as a member , can not have the same rights and enjoy the same benefits as a member .
* britain s request for a transition period of about two years in which the status quo would be largely preserved would require a temporary application of union law to and within the united kingdom together with ... regulatory , budgetary , supervisory , judiciary and enforcement instruments and structures , it reads .
* eu 27 will look further into how such a temporary arrangement would impact the bloc s cooperation with third countries , including on trade , fisheries or air transport .
* the bloc will also seek to ensure britain adheres to eu rules - including any changes - during transition , and the possible avenue for communication with london since it would no longer be represented in the eu institutions and participate in the decision-making process .
* for any agreement on the future ties with london , the eu expects safeguards to preserve financial stability and rules out british participation in parts , but not all , of its single market .
* the bloc is keen to protect itself against unfair competitive advantages through ... tax , social , environmental and regulatory measures and practices .
* beyond trade , the eu is keen to maintain cooperation with britain on security - including fighting terrorism and international crime - defense and foreign policy .
* the bloc seeks a balance of rights and obligations for britain and is determined to preserve the indivisible four freedoms of its single market - of goods , capital , services and labor .
* inside the bloc , the eu wants to preserve the role of the top european court of justice , from whose jurisdiction london wants to remove itself .
* after britain leaves , no agreement between the eu and uk would apply to gibraltar without a separate accord between london and madrid .
* in preparing their own stance on transition and future ties , the 27 will bear in mind the uk position .
