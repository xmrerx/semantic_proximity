beirut ( reuters ) - syrian president bashar al-assad met two former dissident footballers who returned to the national team for its world cup qualifying campaign after years in exile , photographs posted by his office showed on monday .
syria s football team outdid expectations in its campaign to qualify for the world cup finals , reaching a play-off against australia on oct. 10 that they lost 2-1 .
the photographs published on the presidency s social media feed showed him apparently in amicable conversation with firas al-khatib and omar al-soma , players who were both pictured with the syrian opposition flag early in the conflict .
other photographs showed assad posing with the whole team and signing a player s jacket .
syria s war , which began with demonstrations against assad in 2011 , has killed hundreds of thousands of syrians and left more than half the population homeless .
the army has gained momentum over the past two years , with military support from russia and iran .
the government says its policy is to pardon any syrians who joined the opposition unless they have blood on their hands .
however , many exiles have said they fear arrest if they return .
the football team s unexpectedly strong performance in the qualifiers was hailed by many government supporters as a unifying moment for the country .
but some opposition supporters identified the team with assad s government , and declined to back it .
