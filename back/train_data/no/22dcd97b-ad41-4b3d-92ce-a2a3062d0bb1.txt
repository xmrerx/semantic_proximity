beirut ( reuters ) - the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) , an alliance of kurdish and arab militias , said on friday it had taken the last districts in the old city of raqqa from islamic state , but the u.s.-led coalition which backs it could not confirm the report .
we declare to our people the liberation of the old city of raqqa , the sdf said in a statement .
the sdf has been battling to capture the former de facto capital of islamic state s self-declared caliphate since june with backing from u.s.-led jets and special forces .
the walled old city lies in the heart of raqqa but the jihadist group still holds important districts in the west of the city .
the sdf said it now held 65 percent of raqqa in total .
a war monitor , the britain-based syrian observatory for human rights , said it was not true that the sdf had fully captured the old city , but added that it did hold more than 90 percent of that area .
the coalition said it was not yet able to confirm the news .
we have not received confirmation of that through our channels , coalition spokesman colonel ryan dillon said .
