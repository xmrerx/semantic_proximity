One of Donald Trump s favorite morons you know, the poorly educated as he calls them managed to pick a fight he couldn t win with a 12-year-old boy outside a city council meeting in Huntington Park, California on Tuesday.The boy had just finished speaking to the city council when an angry man wearing a Trump flag asked him if he was an American.
I was born here, but I am also half-Mexican, Joseph Moreno replied.
Then Mr. MAGA learned that typical talking points he and his exceptionally stupid friends regularly throw at people on Twitter don t work when the target is twelve.Calling the preteen brainwashed, the Trump follower began angrily demanding to know if the boy, who (once again) is twelve, if he can vote in Mexico.
So you can vote over there?
the man asks.
I.
Am.
Twelve.
Years.
Old, the kid says, emphasizing every word as though he was talking to a Trump voter (oh, wait, he was).
I can t even vote here if I wanted to.
Can you vote over there, the man repeated.
I can t right now because I m 12, the kid replies.This is just one gem in a treasure trove of stupid, which you can watch below if you need a good laugh:(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));MUST WATCH!

He gave an amazing speech at the podium at Huntington Park City Council Meeting.
Mark my words.. he is a future leader!
