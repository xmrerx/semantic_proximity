dana loesch gives us the lowdown on what would happen to our second amendment with a hillary presidency please watch and share !
hillary clinton and barack obama regularly call for more second amendment restrictions .
but yesterday , the president cut short the sentences of 214 convicts 56 of whom were in prison for gun-related crimes .
in the words of dana loesch , we don t need gun control .
we need judicial control .
we need politician control .
