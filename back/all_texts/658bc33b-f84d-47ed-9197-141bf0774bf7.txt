HARARE (Reuters) - The leader of Zimbabwe s war veterans Chris Mutsvangwa said on Monday he would initiate court action to legalize the military action against President Robert Mugabe after the army seized power on Wednesday.
The 93-year-old president defied expectations that he would resign in a national address on Sunday night during which he was flanked by military generals.
