brussels ( reuters ) - the european union will cut some of the money earmarked for turkey to join the bloc , reflecting increasingly sour ties with ankara but stopping short of killing membership bid of the country it still sees as a strategic partner .
the eu has been walking a tight rope for months on turkey , angered by president tayyip erdogan s crackdown on critics after a failed coup in july , 2016 , but dependant on ankara to keep a lid on immigration to europe and combat militants in syria .
the eu leaders chairman , donald tusk , said the bloc had agreed in two days of talks in brussels to cut or reroute some of the 4.4 billion euros ( $ 5.2 bln ) ankara was due to get as part of its accession talks in 2014-20 .
it was a substantive discussion .
we want to keep the door open to ankara , but the current reality in turkey is making this difficult , tusk told a news conference .
germany has seen its ties with turkey particularly strained and chancellor angela merkel called last month for a tougher stance on ankara as she campaigned for re-election at home .
