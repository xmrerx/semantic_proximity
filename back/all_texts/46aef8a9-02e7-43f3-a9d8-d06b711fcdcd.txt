WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump struck a blow against the 2015 Iran nuclear agreement on Friday in defiance of other world powers, choosing not to certify that Tehran is complying with the deal.
Based on the factual record I have put forward, I am announcing today that we cannot and will not make this certification, Trump said at a White House event as he unveiled a tougher strategy against Tehran.
Trump s move does not pull the United States out of the agreement, formally known as the JCPOA.
