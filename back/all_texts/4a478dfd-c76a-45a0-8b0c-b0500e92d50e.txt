WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States cannot trust Russia and must see “positive actions” by Russia before easing U.S. sanctions, Nikki Haley, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said on Wednesday.
“Russia is trying to show their muscle right now.
It is what they do.
And I think we always have to be cautious.
I don’t think that we can trust them,” Haley told lawmakers during her Senate confirmation hearing.
“I think that Russia has to have positive actions before we lift any sanctions on Russia.”
