Ted Cruz summed up the significance of Justice Antonin Scalia s passing quite nicely in the early parts of Saturday s GOP debate: the appointment of a liberal justice would completely destroy every Republican agenda for the foreseeable future.
We are one Justice away from a Supreme Court that will strike down every restriction on abortion adopted by the states.
We are one Justice away from a supreme Court that will reverse the Heller decision, one of Justice Scalia s seminal decisions that upheld the Second Amendment to keep and bear arms.
We are one Justice away from a Supreme Court that would undermine the religious liberty of millions of Americans, and the stakes of this election for this year, for the Senate, the Senate needs to stand strong and say we re not going to give up the U.S. Supreme Court for a generation by allowing Barack Obama to make one more liberal appointee.
Yes, a more liberal Justice would reverse the 2008 Heller decision, which for the first time in our nation s history affirmed the right of men like George Zimmerman, the Bundy militia, and other violent people to own firearms.
A more liberal Justice would definitely undermine what conservatives call religious liberty these days the right to deny service based on sexual orientation, the right to discriminate in the name of God.Cruz is right: Scalia s death emphasizes the importance of the upcoming election.
The next President will appoint at LEAST two Supreme Court Justices three, if conservatives have their way.Watch Cruz s remarks below:Featured image via screengrab
