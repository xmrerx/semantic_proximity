The GOP has been absolutely obsessed with blocking President Barack Obama s Supreme Court justice pick ever since the death of Justice Antonin Scalia.
While the Republican Party s attempts to prevent Obama from doing his job have proven that the GOP is nothing more than a joke, one particular presidential candidate has just made the selection of Supreme Court justices even more ridiculous and humiliating.On Wednesday morning, Republican front runner Donald Trump told Good Morning America that as president of the United States, he would be picking Supreme Court justices with one truly pathetic goal in mind he only wants justices that will investigate Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton s emails.Toward the end of his interview, which Trump spent the majority of talking about the arrest of his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, host David Muir asked Trump to address a comment Clinton had recently made in a speech at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
Clinton had posed the question to her audience, As scary as it might be, ask yourself, What kind of justice would a President Trump appoint?'
Trump responded to Muir with this: Well, I probably would appoint people who would look very seriously at her email disaster because it s a criminal activity and I would appoint people who would look very seriously at that to start off with.
What she is getting away with is absolutely murder.
You talk about a case, now that s a real case.
Now nothing seems to be happening, but you can also poll people on that and you can see what happens on that because that is a real case and if she is able to get away with that you can get away with anything.
You can watch the full interview below, with Trump s comments about Clinton starting at about the 6-minute mark:Trump has been obsessed with Clinton s emails for a long time, despite the fact that there has already been an in-depth investigation on them.
Throughout his campaign, Trump has made it perfectly clear that if he becomes President, he has every intention of trying to prosecute Clinton and put her behind bars.
