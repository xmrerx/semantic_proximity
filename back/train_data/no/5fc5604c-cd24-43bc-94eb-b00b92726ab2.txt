a four-year-old iowa boy died as the result of a gunshot injury on june 18.according to kwwl , the boy and his mother were visiting a friend s home in elgin at the time of the shooting .
the two women had stepped outside , leaving the four-year-old and a second child inside the home to play.the unidentified preschooler found the loaded gun and reportedly shot himself in the face.neither of the women had a cell phone to call 911 .
the boy s mother ran across the street for help.kwwl reports that several members of the local community rushed to the child s aid .
a local business owner attempted to perform cpr , but the boy was not breathing.he was rushed by ambulance to palmer hospital where doctors pronounced him dead.according to police , the gun belonged to the owner of the home who was not present at the time of the child s death.so far this year 263 children under the age of 11 have died from a gunshot injury .
another 1,336 children between the ages of 12 and 17 have also been killed by guns .
you can read their names and learn their stories here.no matter how many times we read about children who are injured or killed by improperly stored guns , careless and irresponsible gun owners still leave loaded weapons within easy reach of four-year-olds.if you ask republicans they ll tell you these are just tragic accidents .
they ll say there s no one to blame and there s nothing that can be done to prevent it from happening over and over again.that s not the truth .
according to children s defense fund , u.s. children and teens are 32 times more likely to die from a gun homicide and 10 times more likely to die from a gun suicide or a gun accident than all their peers in the other high-income countries combined .
the statistics tell us that we re doing something wrong , while countries that have enacted sane gun laws , like many of those located in the uk , are doing something right.protecting the most vulnerable members of society is right , no matter what the nra or their republican lapdogs in congress say.here s more on this story from kwwl.kwwl eastern iowa breaking news , weather , closingsfeatured image via wikimedia commons
