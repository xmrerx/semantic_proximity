If you ever needed any more proof that conservatives are hypocrites, this is it.Michael Tassone is an anti-Obama restaurant owner who turned his diner into the perfect place for racist conservatives to eat out.His American Diner in Liverpool, New York, which has been featured in a story on Fox News, even has a menu filled with items that make it clear how much he hates President Obama and the First Family.There s a meal called Dictator Obama that sells for $3.69 but comes with a $27 tax.
And then there s the Anti-Michelle Obama Don t Tell Me What To Eat Or Feed My Kids Burger, which is probably loaded with the most calories and fatty foods than anything else on the menu.The decor includes Gadsden flags and signs and, of course, and Tassone is vehemently pro-gun and allows open carry of firearms in his establishment, probably because he thinks the government is coming for him.Here s a video about his restaurant.It s a paradise for hungry conservatives to convene and whine about how much they hate Mulsims, Hispanics, and welfare recipients.But as it turns out, Tassone is a hypocrite just like his fellow conservatives.Over the course of two years from 2009 to 2011, Tassone committed welfare fraud by getting Medicaid benefits he was not supposed to have, and ended up owing the Onondaga County Department of Social Services over $23,000.Senior Assistant District Attorney Michael Kasmarek told Syracuse.com that Tassone committed fraud.
It was Medicaid fraud.
They had failed to disclose income on their application.
As a result they obtained Medicaid benefits they weren t entitled to, from May 1, 2009 to April 30, 2011, he said.Tassone was arrested in 2011 and the judge told him to pay up if he didn t want his case to end up in front of a grand jury.In the end, Tassone paid up but thinks he was unfairly targeted because of his extreme conservative views.
Guys like me are a target, Tassone said.
Because I speak the truth.
Funny, he didn t speak the truth when he lied about his income on an application for aid.But as usual, conservatives think only they are entitled to welfare and if they get busted committing a crime they claim they are being targeted because of their political views.Featured image via Syracuse.com
