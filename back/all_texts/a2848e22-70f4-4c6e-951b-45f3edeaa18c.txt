What the heck is going on in Brooklyn, NY!
Just check out this crazy freak show of a Brooklyn hijab-wearing Muslim being sworn in as a judge.
The entire ceremony is unreal!
What s happened to America?I know Keith Ellison was sworn in by Nancy Pelosi but can a judge properly abide by the laws of the land if she s Muslim judge?The article below is from Morocco World News so it s got a slant favoring this woman: New York New York Judge Carolyn Walker-Diallo, a Black Muslim woman took oath as a civil court judge in New York on Thursday, while swearing to abide by the U.S. Constitution placing her hand on the Holy Quran.// <!

StaffordPosted by Mohammed N. Mujumder on Thursday, 10 December 2015In the United States and the majority of Western countries, politicians and members of the courts are sworn in to their positions while placing their hand on the Holy Bible when they take their oath.However, Judge Walker took her oath respecting the sacred book of her Islamic faith, the Holy Quran, while also wearing a hijab.A video posted on Facebook shows the moment when Judge Walker was sworn in as a civil court judge of the 7th Municipal District at the Brooklyn Burough Hall in New York City.
All is praise is indeed due to the Most High!
I am humbled that my community has entrusted me with the immense responsibility of ensuring that EVERYONE has notice and a FAIR opportunity to be heard in the halls of justice, Walker wrote on her website.The video of her ceremony has prompted many comments in favor her induction.

Doesn t matter if it s a Bible or a Holy Quran, it s just the promise to perform to the best of your ability, swearing on something sacred to you, a Facebook user said.
The problem is that America isn t a Christian nation.
It s supposed to accept all religions and be a nation that accepts people regardless of their race, religion, and now sexual orientation.
If we don t allow all to be equal and free, then we lose the essence that makes us truly American, she added.
She follows the Constitution just as Christian judges don t follow the Bible when they pass a verdict, she will not follow the Quran when she rules in a court of law, a user said in response to those against her induction.Meanwhile, others denounced the fact that she was allowed a to take oath on the Quran instead of the Bible.A Facebook user posted a picture of the Holy Quran burning in flames to express his disagreement, while others took it a step further and posted images where the Quran is used as toilet paper, and messages such as F**k Islam and obscene remarks against Muslims.While social media users were arguing about whether she is allowed to take oath on the Quran, no one focused on Carolyn Walker s exceptional work.
Here s a glimpse of her skills and achievements:Carolyn received a Juris Doctor from New York Law School.
She serves as First Vice-Chair of Brooklyn Community Board 5, Board Chair of The George Walker Jr. Community Coalition, Inc., Board Member of the East New York Restoration Local Development Corporation, and a Member of the 75th Precinct Community Council.
She is also a trained mediator with the New York Peace Institute, according to her biography.Via: Free Republic
