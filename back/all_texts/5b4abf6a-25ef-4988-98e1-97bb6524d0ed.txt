BARCELONA (Reuters) - Tuesday s session of the Catalan parliament at which regional leader Carles Puigdemont could unilaterally declare the region s independence from Spain has been delayed, a parliament spokeswoman said.
Organisers of the political parties in the assembly are holding a meeting, she said.
Local media said the delay could be the result of disagreements within the pro-independence coalition on how far Puigdemont s speech should go in declaring a split from Spain.
