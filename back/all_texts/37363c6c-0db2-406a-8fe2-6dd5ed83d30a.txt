Sen. John McCain (R-AZ) was diagnosed with brain cancer following a surgery to remove a two-inch blood clot from above his left eye.
Amateur president Donald Trump has failed to deliver a message on his always-busy Twitter timeline, but former President Barack Obama did to show solidarity with the 80-year-old Senator.
It is, after all, not a partisan issue to show you have a person s back when they need it most.
To show that politics doesn t have to be bitter when someone s life might be on the line.
Obama and McCain go way back to his first election.
When a woman in the audience at a rally called Obama an Arab, McCain shut her down.
In contrast, Donald Trump launched the birther conspiracy theory in order to delegitimize our country s first black president.President Obama tweeted, John McCain is an American hero & one of the bravest fighters I ve ever known.
Cancer doesn t know what it s up against.
Give it hell, John.

Barack Obama (@BarackObama) July 20, 2017Obama s tweet has gone viral with over 373,000 likes so far.
In 2015, Trump crossed the line with McCain, going where no person should go.
He s not a war hero, Trump said of McCain.
He was a war hero because he was captured.
I like people who weren t captured.
McCain, a former Navy pilot, spent approximately five-and-half years in a notorious North Vietnamese prison known as the Hanoi Hilton, where he was repeatedly tortured.
John McCain spent two of those years in solitary confinement.Unfortunately, Donald Trump hasn t mentioned McCain s health yet.
The former reality show star failed to contact former President Jimmy Carter after he collapsed on Thursday while working on a Habitat for Humanity home in Winnipeg, Canada.
Prime Minister Justin Trudeau did call Carter, though, to wish him well.
That s what leaders do.
