21st Century Wire says For his role in helping to sow chaos in the US political system and for promulgating the official conspiracy theory that Russia somehow hacked the US electoral process helping Donald Trump to win last November, and also ensuring that no charges were brought anywhere near the Clintons former FBI Director James Comey has just received the first of many gifts from the Establishment.James Comey is no stranger to elite circles, and is clearly regarded by those at the top as a safe pair of hands.
As 21WIRE reported last year, James Comey served on the board of banking giant HSBC the same bank that was convicted of international drugs and terrorism money laundering, as well as a bank which was closely linked to the corrupt Clinton Foundation.
After working fellow lawyers Eric Holder and Lorretta Lynch to stage manage the public fall out from revelations about HSBC s epic criminal enterprise, and their subsequent slap on the wrist, Comey was then rewarded by President Obama when he was appointed head of the FBI in 2013.By anyone s measure, Comey was central to the mess which has resulted from the political circus surrounding the establishment s efforts to derail the Trump campaign, and now through the Trump presidency.Congratulations.
You got your book deal.
You ve made it James AP/The GuardianThe former FBI director James Comey has signed a $2m ( 1.5m) deal for a book about leadership and decision-making that will draw on his career in government, which included the high-profile drama leading up to his sacking from Donald Trump s administration.According to the publisher, Comey will tell how he handled the bureau s probe into Hillary Clinton s private email server and the allegations of ties between Russia and Trump s presidential campaign.Trump sacked Comey as FBI chief in May, later telling NBC News that he was angered by the FBI s investigation into this Russia thing , which he insists is a fake story.
Comey has since testified before Congress that Trump asked him to end an investigation into former National Security Adviser Michael T Flynn and kept memos about his meetings with the president.The book was acquired by Flatiron, an Macmillan imprint, which promises that Comey will cite examples from some of the highest-stakes situations in the past two decades of US government .
It will also share yet unheard anecdotes from his long and distinguished career .The book is currently untitled and scheduled for publication next spring.
Throughout his career, James Comey has had to face one difficult decision after another, as he has served the leaders of our country, Flatiron said in a statement.
His book promises to take us inside those extraordinary moments in our history, showing us how these leaders have behaved under pressure.
By doing so, Director Comey will give us unprecedented entry into the corridors of power, and a remarkable lesson in leadership itself.
