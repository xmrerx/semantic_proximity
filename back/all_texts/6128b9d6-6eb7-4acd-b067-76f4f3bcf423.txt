WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Pakistan s cooperation in securing the release of a U.S.-Canadian couple and their children who had been held by the Taliban-linked Haqqani network signaled a new respect for the United States by Islamabad.
The Pakistani government s cooperation is a sign that it is honoring America s wish that it do more to provide security in the region, Trump said at a White House event.
They worked very hard on this and I believe they are starting to respect the United States again.
