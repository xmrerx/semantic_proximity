Just when you think you ve seen everything, a video pops up online showing a white teacher trying to explain to a black student that it s okay to use the n-word.In Louisiana, at Ben Franklin High School, a teacher referenced as Coach Ryan is seen on video in a heated discussion with a black student.
The student is clearly upset with the teacher and would like Coach Ryan to stop using the n-word.The teacher even went so far as to say that it s a commoditized word that holds no negative meaning anymore and that people need to move on from thinking that it s bad.You can hear the student say: That s racist as sh*t. Why can you not understand that it s racist for a white man to say n***er to a black man?
It s f*cking racist.
Watch the interaction here:It s unbelievable, yet unfortunately believable, that a teacher in the year 2017 would not only think that it s okay to use the n-word, but to also try to argue with a black student about it, and insist that it s not racist.The Root reports: According to the TImes-Picayune, students went to the principal s office after class with the intent of staging a sit-in that instead turned into an hourlong assembly.Videos and photos of the assembly circulated on social media, too, with a different student talking about the stigma that black people face in society.
It s good that a great discussion stemmed from such a profoundly awful situation, but hopefully, that teacher has also been reprimanded for his insanely derogatory speech.
When our educators are trying to educate that racism is okay, that s not okay at all.Featured image via video screen capture
