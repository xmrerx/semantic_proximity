berlin ( reuters ) - french president emmanuel macron , accused by critics of being out of touch with ordinary people , denied in an interview with a german magazine he was aloof , saying that he was merely trying to stamp out cronyism between politicians and the media .
the 39-year-old former banker was caught on video earlier this month saying during a visit to a struggling company that workers protesting his economic policies would do better to get a job in a nearby aluminum factory battling to find employees .
that prompted the far-left and far-right , who have sought to cast macron as out of touch with the common man and a president for the rich , to say he had shown contempt .
but macron told germany s der spiegel : i am not aloof .
when i travel through the country , when i visit a factory , my staff tell me after three hours that i am ruining the schedule .
he added : when i am with french people , i am not aloof because i belong to them .
macron said being surrounded by journalists was not akin with being close to the people , adding : a president should keep the media at arm s length .
he has said he planned a jupiterian presidency - dignified and weighing his pronouncements carefully - a departure from his often-mocked predecessor francois hollande s man-of-the-people style .
macron said on friday in a surprise move that he would give his first long live tv interview on sunday evening .
