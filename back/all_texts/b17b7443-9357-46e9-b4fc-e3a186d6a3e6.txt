JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - New ANC leader Cyril Ramaphosa said on Tuesday the Top Six of South Africa s ruling party comprised politicians from different sides of its ideological divides and he expected the party to emerge from this week s leadership conference stronger.
Analysts have warned that the party s top decision-making group could fail to agree on policy, with three politicians apiece drawn from the Ramaphosa camp and that of his rival, Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma.
The leadership that has been chosen is a unity leadership, Ramaphosa told reporters at the conference.
It s a leadership that combines different views and approaches that were prevalent in the conference prior to the election.
