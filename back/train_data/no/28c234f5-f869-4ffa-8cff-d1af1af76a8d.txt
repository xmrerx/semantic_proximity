washington ( reuters ) - republican front-runner donald trump said on wednesday he would not attend the next televised republican presidential debate scheduled for next monday .
“ i think we ’ ve had enough debates , ” trump , who won three states in tuesday ’ s nominating contests , told fox news in an interview .
fox on monday announced the new debate , its latest in the primary season as the party chooses its candidate ahead of the nov. 8 presidential election .
trump said he had scheduled a major speech the same night - before the american israel public affairs committee - and was surprised to hear fox had planned another debate .
“ how many times can the same people ask you the same question ? ” trump asked .
“ so i was very surprised when i heard that fox called for a debate .
nobody told me about it and i won ’ t be there , no. ” the pro-israel lobby group holds its annual policy convention in washington sunday through tuesday and has confirmed both trump and democratic presidential front-runner hillary clinton as speakers .
it has not issued a formal schedule .
it would not be the first time trump has skipped a debate .
he also sat out the fox news/google debate on jan. 28 , after complaining of unfair treatment in a previous fox debate .
