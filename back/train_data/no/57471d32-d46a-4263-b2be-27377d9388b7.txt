istanbul ( reuters ) - turkey s denizbank said on thursday it did not have any dealings with the shipping group owned by gold trader reza zarrab , who is testifying in a u.s. federal court after pleading guilty to conspiring to evade u.s. sanctions against iran .
zarrab on wednesday told the court that he helped iran use funds deposited in turkey s state-owned halkbank to buy gold , which was smuggled to dubai and sold for cash .
halkbank has said all of its transactions complied with national and international regulations .
according to local media reports , zarrab also testified that he used denizbank for some transactions .
denizbank disputed the reported allegations .
our transactions only revolved around buying and selling gold domestically , and there were no foreign transactions , it said in a statement .
our bank ... has had no dealings with the royal shipping group owned by reza zarrab .
the case has fueled tensions between the united states and turkey , which are nato allies .
turkish president tayyip erdogan s government has said the case was fabricated for political reasons .
turkey s banking regulator last month denied a local media report that six turkish lenders could face substantial fines from the united states over alleged violations of iran sanctions .
( corrects third paragraph to show that sourcing for zarrab s testimony on denizbank is local media reports )
