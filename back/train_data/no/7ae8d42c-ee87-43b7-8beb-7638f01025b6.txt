nairobi ( reuters ) - south sudan s government has sought to disarm the bodyguards of detained former army chief paul malong on fears he might escape and launch a rebellion , his wife said on saturday , highlighting tensions within the leadership .
malong - the man who has led president salva kiir s campaign against rebels - has been under house arrest since may after kiir sacked him following a string of military resignations by senior generals alleging abuses and ethnic bias .
malong had initially fled the capital juba with a convoy of vehicles for his home state of aweil following his dismissal - raising fears he might join opposition forces , before returning to the capital .
on saturday , his wife lucy ayak told reuters security officials arrived at their home late on friday with specific orders from kiir .
they came carrying the order from the president and told general malong that they had been ordered to disarm his bodyguards , she said , adding that they also tried to take his phone and said his family members would not be allowed to visit .
the government is thinking that general malong might take the country back to war .
the tension is still high ... we do not know if they might come back and arrest him by force if he resists .
residents in juba told reuters heavily-armed soldiers have blocked the main road leading to his house .
media outlets from juba also reported that a senior commander in the army who is allied with malong has also defected with the aim of launching a rebellion .
president kiir s press secretary ateny wek ateny declined to comment , saying the issue was purely an army matter .
south sudan won independence from sudan in 2011 but plunged into civil war in 2013 after kiir fired his deputy riek machar .
the conflict , largely fought along ethnic lines , has pitched parts of the oil-producing country into severe hunger , paralyzed public services and forced a quarter of the population - three million people - to flee their homes .
