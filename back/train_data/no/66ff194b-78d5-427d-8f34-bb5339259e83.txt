london ( reuters ) - british police arrested four men on tuesday , including some serving soldiers , on suspicion of belonging to a banned far-right group and planning terrorist acts .
the men , aged 22 to 32 , were detained on suspicion of being involved in the commission , preparation and instigation of acts of terrorism and of being members of the national action group .
the neo-nazi organization became the first far-right group to be outlawed in britain last year after the murder of member of parliament jo cox , whose killing the group had praised .
the four arrests were made by counter-terrorism officers in the cities of birmingham , ipswich and northampton and in powys , wales .
the arrests were pre-planned and intelligence-led ; there was no threat to the public s safety , west midlands police said .
the ministry of defence ( mod ) said a number of serving members of the army had been arrested .
these arrests are the consequence of a home office police force-led operation supported by the army , an mod spokeswoman said .
this is now the subject of a civilian police investigation and it would be inappropriate to comment further .
britain is on its second-highest threat level , severe , meaning an attack is highly likely .
suspected islamists have killed 35 people this year in london and manchester , and a man died in june after a van was driven into worshippers near a london mosque .
last month , a senior police chief said the number of referrals to the authorities about suspected right-wing extremists had doubled since the murder of cox , who was killed in june last year by a loner obsessed with nazis and white supremacist ideology .
