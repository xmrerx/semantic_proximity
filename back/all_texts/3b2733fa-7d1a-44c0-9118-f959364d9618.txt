If there s one thing that has always remained consistent about Donald Trump, it s his infamous hairdo.
He s kept it the same way for decades, and it s pretty much his calling card.However, in a picture posted to Instagram by the president-elect s son, Donald Trump Jr., it seems as if the hairstyle the entire world has become accustomed to has changed.Check out this photo of Trump with his grandson: Grandpa @realdonaldtrump and Tristan aka T-man on the ride back from #florida after an incredible #Christmas #vacation this past Sunday.

Sure.
That s actually probably exactly what it is.
However, it needs to be noted that Trump actually looks more presidential this way, although he still has yet to prove he can behave like a president.Last summer Trump said he would get rid of his infamous hairstyle if he won the presidency, saying: I would probably comb my hair back.
Why?
Because this thing is too hard to comb I wouldn t have time, because if I were in the White House, I d be working my a** off.
So, who knows, really?
Maybe that s a promise he ll actually follow through with.And sure, this article is petty and silly and doesn t really matter in the grand scheme of things.
But you clicked on it, didn t you?Featured image via Instagram
