Greg Pruitt s wife was awoken at approximately 5 a.m. when she noticed her husband was having a seizure.
Quickly, she called 911.
As help was on its way, Greg s seizure started to subside a bit, and he was coming out of it when help arrived.Twenty-nine-year-old Jason Adams, a volunteer fireman, was the first responder on the scene.
When Adams was standing in the doorway of the room where Pruitt was, attempting to evaluate the situation, Pruitt promptly shot and killed Adams, thinking he was an intruder.Adams was a nearby neighbor who lived approximately a half-mile from the residence.
A witness who entered the home after the shooting gave the same account of what happened.
Adams was rushed to a local medical center in North Little Rock but was pronounced dead.Not very surprisingly, authorities do not know if there will be any charges filed in this accidental shooting.Please, can we admit yet that we have a problem with guns in America?
This is a perfect example of why we do.
I know when people are in an emergency situation, possibly panicking, they don t think about the gun that is in arm s reach of a seizure victim, or about what will happen because of it when a stranger suddenly enters their home.
But, is that really an acceptable way to write off this sort of thing?The idea of responsible gun ownership is exactly what s in question here.
Why are we living in such paranoia, in the home of the brave, to where we are shooting at every shadow we see?
It s incredibly wrong for a first responder to have to second-guess rendering aid because they re afraid they will get shot just by showing up.
The concept of always shoot first because it s just an accident if you do, that has been cultivated by the NRA and Republicans in America needs to come to an end.Watch news coverage of the incident below:featured image via twitter
