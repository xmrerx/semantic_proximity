madrid ( reuters ) - catalonia will create a special commission to investigate claims of abuse by spanish police during a banned referendum on independence on sunday after more than 800 people were left injured , leader of region carles puigdemont said on monday .
thousands of spanish police were shipped in to the region to prevent the vote on secession though scenes of violence due to heavy-handed tactics by armored , baton-carrying riot units have received international condemnation .
the vote which the constitutional court banned and madrid said was illegal , yet still attracted millions of defiant voters , was valid and binding , puigdemont said during a conference .
the catalan leader said he had had no contact with spain s central government and called on prime minister mariano rajoy to say whether he was in favor of mediation in talks over the region s future , which should be overseen by the european union .
