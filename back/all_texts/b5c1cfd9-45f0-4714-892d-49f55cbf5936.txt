265 days and counting Is this a warning shot?
This chilling footage shows a Russian nuclear submarine launching a cruise missile from underwater to destroy a coastal training target.The 120-metre Severodvinsk submarine can be seen sinking slowly below the surface of the Barents Sea as part of Russian navy Arctic combat drills.Then the Kalibr missile erupts from the waves in a plume of smoke and streaks away into the distance.
A loud rumbling can be heard before the camera zooms in to show the launch site.It is the latest show of strength from the country s military after a number of close passes by fighter jets near US planes and ships.This year Russia has increased its military presence in the Arctic region where it and other world powers are locked in a battle to claim valuable territory and underwater mining rights.
MirrorA Russian fighter pilot has provoked fury at the Pentagon after allegedly performing a barrel roll just 25 feet from an American reconnaissance plane over the Baltic Sea.Outraged defense officials called the interception manoeuvre unsafe and unprofessional , but Russia said it was forced to intercept the American RC-135 plane because it had switched off its identifying transponder.The Pentagon admitted the barrel roll incident could escalate tensions between the countries after a number of close-flying encounters.In a taunting statement the Russian defence ministry said: We are already starting to get used to the insults of the Pentagon regarding alleged unprofessional manoeuvres when our fighters intercept US spy planes at the Russian border.
The US Air Force has two solutions either not to fly near our borders, or to turn the transponder on for identification.
Reports differed on just how close the Russian SU-27 Flanker fighter jet came to its lumbering quarry.
US Army spokeswoman Lt Col Michelle Baldanza said it came within 25 feet, or 7.6m, while others claimed a figure of 100 feet, or 30 metres.Lt Col Baldanza told CNN: The SU-27 intercepted the U.S. aircraft flying a routine route at high rate of speed from the side then proceeded to perform an aggressive maneuver that posed a threat to the safety of the U.S. aircrew in the RC-135.
