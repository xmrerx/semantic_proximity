It s fairly well-known that Ted Cruz has few friends, if any at all, in and around the beltway.
Cruz has spent the better part of the last two years alienating every single member of Congress possible while showing a level of disrespect for the president that can only be described as disgusting.Ted Cruz stood on the Senate Floor and had himself a little temper tantrum when the Republican leadership passed the omnibus package without defunding Planned Parenthood.
He has been known as a know-it-all who nobody likes going back all the way to the Dubyah campaign.
How many Texas Republicans ended up NOT working in the White House or nearby?
Well there was Ted Cruz.Why nobody likes him is a question of character, You can tell just by looking at him that he s a freak just waiting for a phone call from his mother telling him Jesus said it was OK to nuke North Korea.
You can tell when you listen to him speak that his real parents were weasels from Who Framed Roger Rabbit.
There isn t a single likeable thing about the guy; even his own daughter agrees.Maybe there s some kind of redeeming quality in his past.
You can t be in public service for so long and never have done anything remarkable, right?
Turns out that is true with Ted Cruz.
What he did as Texas Solicitor General is such remarkable douchebaggey that Cruz should never be able to live it down:Yes, that actually happened.
Rather than admit the state was wrong about something as simple as a sentencing guideline, Cruz not only agreed that a man should spend more than a decade and a half behind bars, he was willing to take the mistake all the way to the Supreme Court.Ted Cruz, in short, is a pile of pure sh*t.Featured image from Gage Skidmore
