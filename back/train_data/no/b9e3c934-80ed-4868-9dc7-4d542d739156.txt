london ( reuters ) - the u.s. government is continuing to develop its policy on iran and will consider the wider threat it poses beyond its nuclear capabilities , u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said on thursday .
in april , u.s. president donald trump ordered a review of whether a suspension of sanctions on iran related to a 2015 nuclear deal , negotiated under president barack obama , was in the u.s. national security interest .
he has called it the worst deal ever negotiated .
the trump administration is continuing to review and develop its policy on iran ... no decision has been made , tillerson said during a news conference in london following a meeting with british foreign minister boris johnson .
president trump has made it clear ... we must take in to account the totality of iranian threats , not just iran s nuclear capabilities , that is just one piece of our posture towards iran .
tillerson also said iran was clearly in default of the expectations of the 2015 deal .
