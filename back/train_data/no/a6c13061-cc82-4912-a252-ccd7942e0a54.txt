republican congresswoman marsha blackburn ( tn ) decided to launch an online poll to ask , do you support the repeal of obamacare ?
rt if you do , and share what you want to see as the replacement .
ok , we know online polls aren t for reals but conservatives tell us they are so we re just going to believe them this one time .
and the survey says : 84 percent do not want obamacare repealed .
only 16 percent called for a repeal.do you support the repeal of obamacare ?
rt if you do , and share what you want to see as the replacement .

( @ melindafla ) january 4 , 2017 @ marshablackburn repealing without a simultaneous replacement is deeply irresponsible .
gop has had six years to come up with a plan .
christopher coleman ( @ ccineastnash ) january 3 , 2017in 2014 , blackburn said obamacare is a failure because medicaid expansion wasn t happening .
so , a journalist pointed out to her that her own state blocked medicaid expansion from happening .
but she knew that already .
republicans could fix obamacare , but it s the president s name they don t want attached to it.photo by scott olson/getty
