singapore ( reuters ) - singapore authorities charged human rights activist jolovan wham on wednesday for organizing public assemblies without a police permit , prompting rights groups to call on the government to guarantee the right to peaceful assembly .
the 37-year-old wham , the former executive director of a group advocating the rights of foreign workers in singapore , could be fined up to $ 10,000 or imprisoned for up to 6 months , or both , if found guilty of repeat offences .
wham was involved in a protest in june by several blindfolded activists who held up books on a subway train in a call for justice for 22 people detained in 1987 under a tough internal security law .
wham is recalcitrant and has repeatedly shown blatant disregard for the law , especially with regard to organizing or participating in illegal public assemblies , singapore police force said in a statement .
he was also charged for vandalism and refusing to sign statements made during investigations , the police said .
he faces a total of seven charges stemming from public assemblies he organized dating back to november 2016 , the police said .
under strict public assembly laws , protests are allowed only at a designated downtown square called the speakers corner .
human rights watch on wednesday called on singapore to drop the case against peaceful protestor wham and to amend what it called a draconian law on public order to guarantee singaporeans the right to peaceful assembly .
prosecuting jolovan wham for holding peaceful gatherings demonstrates the absurdity of singapore s laws on public assemblies and the government s willingness to penalize those who speak out , its deputy asia director phil robertson said .
the singapore government should start listening to criticism , stop treating peaceful assemblies as crimes , and cease prosecuting their organizers , he said .
a pre-trial conference for the case will take place on dec. 13 .
