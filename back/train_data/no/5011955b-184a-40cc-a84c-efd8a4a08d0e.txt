edinburgh ( reuters ) - britain must strike a strong trade deal with the european union after brexit and avoid becoming a subordinate state of the bloc , foreign minister and leading brexiteer boris johnson has told the sunday times newspaper .
failure to ditch eu law would make the united kingdom a vassal state , johnson said in an interview to be published on sunday .
the government must aim to maximize the benefits of brexit by getting divergence from the bloc s rules so that it could do proper free trade deals with other countries .
prime minister theresa may this week secured an agreement with the eu to move brexit talks on to trade and a transition pact .
but she must now unite her deeply divided cabinet over what trade deal britain actually wants .
[ nl8n1of03w ] separately , in a measure of the difficulty may will face in bringing her side together , finance minister philip hammond caused a stir amongst some brexit supporters because he said that after britain formally leaves the eu in march 2019 , it will seek to replicate the current status quo in a transition period .
[ nl4n1og05l ] former work and pensions minister ian duncan smith criticized hammond , as did other leading brexit supporters , for making a statement which he said was not government policy .
johnson told the sunday times he would advance the case for a liberal brexit in a new intervention in the debate this week in which he would play up the advantages of leaving the eu .
