copenhagen ( reuters ) - an italian woman who ordered the murder of her boyfriend through a website and paid a hitman in bitcoin digital currency was sentenced on friday to six years in a danish jail .
the 58-year-old woman ordered the murder - which was never carried out - in march , transferring 4.1 bitcoin , then worth around $ 4,000 , to the hitman s virtual wallet , the court found .
bitcoin can be transferred electronically between users without an intermediary such as a bank , making it potentially attractive for buying illegal goods or services .
the woman , who has lived in denmark for 30 years , will be expelled after serving her sentence , the court said .
the intended murder victim was present at the court hearing north of copenhagen on friday and spoke with the woman after the verdict , the danish public broadcaster said .
