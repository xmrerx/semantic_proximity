MUNICH (Reuters) - France said on Saturday that U.S. Vice President Mike Pence would need to clarify his administration’s stance toward the European Union when he meets officials in Brussels next week, given President Donald Trump’s previous support for Britain’s exit.
Pence is due in the Belgian capital on Monday.
“I don’t want to prejudge Vice President Pence’s intentions ...
I hope that we will have a clear response, because Donald Trump has said he was overjoyed by Brexit and that there would be others.
So we are waiting clarifications.”
