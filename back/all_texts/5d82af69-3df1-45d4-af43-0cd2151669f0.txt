The GMA reporter shows several random people on the streets of Sevnica, Slovenia a picture of Donald and Melania Trump and asks, Do you know who this is?
Here are their responses: I have no idea.
Oh yeah.
That s Donald Trump s wife that is from Slovenia.
I don t particularly like Donald Trump, because she s also ashamed from being from Slovenia.
Oh it looks like to be the new American President, so that would be his quasi-English speaking wife.
I don t like this Trump Melania, she s there because she was searching for really better life.
So that s why she found a husband.
We are small nation, so everyone who succeeded in the world is a story of success.
She s a bad ad for Slovenia.
She talks like, I don t know, like she doesn t like us anymore.
I don t know, she s more for Hollywood than for the White House.
