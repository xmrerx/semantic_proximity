Republican nominee Donald Trump definitely has the worst surrogates out of anyone who has ever run for President.
They can barely keep their stories (lies) straight, and have a really difficult time talking positively about their candidate at this point in the race, after his campaign as been riddled with scandals, lawsuits, and sexual assault allegations.Something absolutely ridiculous happened today on Twitter when former Arkansas Gov.
Mike Huckabee decided to make a case for why Trump was the better candidate for President.
As expected, this pathetic attempt at some Trump praise went horribly wrong when Huckabee referred to Trump as a car wreck but at least one that s pointed in the right direction.
Huckabee tried to argue that this was better than Clinton, who he described as a drunk driver going the wrong way down the freeway.
TwitterNot only is the metaphor problematic as the former presidential candidate is already saying that Trump has ruined everything in a crash but it didn t take long before Twitter users tore the metaphor and Huckabee s reasoning to shreds:TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterHuckabee s weird compliment is so reminiscent of what happens with many of Trump s surrogates.
Another former rival-turned-supporter, Ben Carson, has become infamous for giving Trump back-handed compliments.
And as Trump s campaign continued on, we witnessed Trump s supporters having a more difficult time defending the business mogul s erratic behavior and insane statements.Huckabee and many other Republicans that continue to support Trump know that he s an absolute disaster for the GOP, but they d rather stay loyal to their party and worry about the Supreme Court than actually do what s best for America.
Huckabee called Trump exactly what he was in his tweet a wreck and any GOPer who is aware of this and continues to support Trump is as unethical and spineless as he is.Featured image via Christopher Furlong/Getty Images
