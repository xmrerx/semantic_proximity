Long before becoming President of the United States, Barack Obama was a constitutional law professor, and even before that, he was the editor of the Harvard Law Review.
In other words, he knows his way around academic writing, and on Monday, he became the first sitting president to ever publish in an academic journal.Obama s article, called United States Health Care Reform, has a modest byline of Barack Obama, JD, for Juris Doctorate.
In other words, for all the Republicans accusing the President of arrogance, the President didn t even tout the fact that he s the leader of the free world.
It was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, and it stresses the importance of the Affordable Care Act, along with the need to improve on his signature legislation.Twitter loved it.
There are few busier people in the world than Barack Obama, yet he finds time to do something no other sitting president has done.
That s pretty impressive, as is the impassioned case for improving Obamacare.
He even wants to include a public option:Policy makers should build on progress made by the Affordable Care Act by continuing to implement the Health Insurance Marketplaces and delivery system reform, increasing federal financial assistance for Marketplace enrollees, introducing a public plan option in areas lacking individual market competition, and taking actions to reduce prescription drug costs.
Although partisanship and special interest opposition remain, experience with the Affordable Care Act demonstrates that positive change is achievable on some of the nation s most complex challenges.Here are just a few of the tweets under the hashtag #ObamaJAMA:President publishes scholarly article.
