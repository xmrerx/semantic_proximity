WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Friday that North Korea s continuing missile tests threaten the entire world and stressed the United States was working closely with regional allies Japan and South Korea on the problem.
In East Asia, an increasingly aggressive and isolated regime in North Korea threatens democracies in South Korea, Japan, and more importantly, and more recently, has expanded those threats to the United States, endangering the entire world, Tillerson said to a gathering of the Community of Democracies.
We first look to our regional allies South Korea and Japan.
By working with them and other democratic partners, we continue to build consensus at the United Nations Security Council to create a united international front that upholds our values and strives to make us safer.
