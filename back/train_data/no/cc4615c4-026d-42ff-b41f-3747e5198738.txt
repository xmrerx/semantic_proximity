washington ( reuters ) - a powerful u.s. lawmaker on wednesday demanded secretary of state john kerry provide an explanation of a $ 1.7 billion claim settlement paid to iran just as tehran released american prisoners last month .
republican ed royce , chairman of the house of representatives foreign affairs committee , wrote that the timing of the settlement and the administration ’ s failure to brief congress “ has led some to express concern that the payment represents a de facto ‘ ransom ’ for the release of american hostages. ” royce asked kerry to provide by feb. 17 information including lists of all u.s. officials who participated in negotiations with iran over the settlement agreement , the prisoner release and the nuclear agreement announced in july .
he also asked for legal analyses of the dispute , a timeline of negotiations over the dispute and an explanation of how the interest payment in the settlement was calculated , among other information .
on jan. 17 , the state department said the united states and iran had settled a longstanding claim at the iran-u.s. claims tribunal , releasing to tehran $ 400 million in funds frozen since 1981 plus $ 1.3 billion in interest .
state department spokesman john kirby said kerry would respond to the letter .
he did not offer further specifics on when and how .
“ we can confirm receipt of chairman royce ’ s letter , and as with all congressional correspondence , we ’ ll respond as appropriate , ” kirby said .
u.s. republican lawmakers , who are strongly critical of democratic president barack obama ’ s iran policy , have been questioning the payment for weeks .
no republican supported the nuclear agreement when congress had the opportunity to review it last year .
after the settlement was announced , obama said it was a better alternative than letting more interest accumulate while waiting for a legal judgment .
