Steve Hilton rips the great geniuses on foreign policy who are patronizing the way President Trump speaks.
He says THEY are the ones who left the world in a mess!
Amen!!
!Hilton couldn t be more dead on in his assessment of the globalist attempt at a new world order that Trump just stopped.
These leaders are responsible for Korea, Iran and the entire Middle East mess Hello Hillary Clinton!
She and her husband have been whoring around the world grabbing up anything they can to amass a fortune off the backs of the American people.
Obama did NOTHING on foreign policy accept to apologize to our enemies his entire 8 years in office.
Remember the Apology Tour ?The world is in such a mess because of our past leaders who didn t put America first.
Thank goodness we have President Trump who will put America first.
It s about time!
