Mexican President Enrique Pe a Nieto may not be too happy once he hears of Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke s plan to make that border wall thing happen.
You see, the terrain on our southern border isn t exactly the most uniform thing in the universe and at times there may be complications like the Rio Grande River.E&E News reports that Zinke told a crowd at an event held by Public Lands Council this week that the Trump administration didn t want to build the wall on American soil because it would mean handing the entire Rio Grande river to Mexico so he just wants to take the land instead: The border is complicated, as far as building a physical wall.
The Rio Grande, what side of the river are you going to put the wall?
We re not going to put it on our side and cede the river to Mexico.
And we re probably not going to put it in the middle of the river.
Zinke stopped just shy of saying that we d take the land by force, but he made it pretty clear that the United States isn t going to give up the river and Mexico isn t going to hand over land on their side to build a gigantic ugly wall on the border.
First, President Trump proposed building a wall on our southern border and having Mexico pay for it.
Now his administration is planning to build a wall in Mexico and have Americans pay for it, Austin Evers, executive director of watchdog group Americans Oversight, said in a statement following the remarks.Will Trump s agenda lead us to war with one of our allies?
If the administration has its way, according to Zinke, that s exactly what will happen.featured image via screengrab
