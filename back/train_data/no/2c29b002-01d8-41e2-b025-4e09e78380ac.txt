seoul ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump said on tuesday that the united states is prepared to use the full range of military force to stop a north korean attack , but said he was focused on using all available tools short of military action to prevent conflict .
north korea is a worldwide threat that requires worldwide action , he told reporters at a joint press conference with south korea president moon jae-in .
the remarks came after the two leaders held formal talks at the presidential blue house in seoul , where moon told trump he hoped his visit would relieve some of south koreans anxiety over north korea and serve as a turning point in resolving the north korean nuclear issue .
