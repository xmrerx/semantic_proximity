Top GOP Official Ed Rollins was interviewed by a very angry Lou Dobbs.
He was furious with the ringside performance of John Kelly aka drama queen during President Trump s UN speech (some are saying it was before the speech).
The Chief of Staff should be behind the scenes How about he should be fired because he s not even a supporter of President Trump!
HE VOTED FOR HILLARY CLINTON!Ed Rollins: At least what I ve heard from sources inside who know Kelly, he is an honorable man and a good general.
He didn t vote for him.
He voted for Hillary.
So I don t think basically he is a Trump supporter or ideologically a Trump supporter.Whaaaaaat?????
How can President Trump have a Chief of Staff that doesn t even follow his belief in policy?There is controversy over whether Kelly was was drama queen during or before Trump s speech.
If it was before then this is a great case of the Democrats trying to sabotage Trump again.
No matter what happened, it s still shocking that Trump would have a Chief of Staff who isn t on bird with his policy.
