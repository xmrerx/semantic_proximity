As the #NeverTrump movement has become officially irrelevant, our hilarious friend Joe Dan Gorman of Intellectual Froglegs puts the state of Trump s winning campaign into perspective for Americans #NeverTrump is fading into the sunset now relegated to a few tassel loafered pockets of resistance .and social media trollers.
The Anger babies, if you will (a phrase coined by my friend Anthony Adams, I liked it so I stole it).
These folks like Ben Shapiro, Bill Kristol, Paul Ryan, etc believe themselves to be intellectually superior to all of us.
They represent purist of the pure the self-appointed guardians of conservatism, who for the most part are the biggest hypocrites on the planet.First.. where was their little #NeverRomney when we were forced to vote for the Grandfather of Obamacare?
Or #NeverMcCain?Apparently McCain-Feingold didn t infringe on our first amendment TOO much.
Via- Intellectual FroglegsThe Trump Train has officially left the station.
Get on or get out of the way.
Trump is winning.
It s all he knows how to do.
Either America accepts Hillary and Bernie s radical agenda for America, which includes gun control, as well as the loss of our First, and several other precious Amendments, or we support a man who is passionate about saving our nation from the evils of globalism and Socialism.#NeverHillary#NeverBernieIf you like LOVE Intellectual Froglegs videos as much as we do, consider giving Joe Dan Gorman (the guy who s in the video and works so hard to create these great illustrations that capture the true state of our nation) a donation HERE.
