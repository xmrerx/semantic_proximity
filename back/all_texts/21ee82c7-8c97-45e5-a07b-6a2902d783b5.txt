WATCH: Susan Rice insists I leaked nothing to nobody https://t.co/kAsbu4VJDN MSNBC (@MSNBC) April 4, 2017 I know nothing about this.
I was surprised to see reports from Chairman Nunes on that count today.
What she says is a lie but who is surprised by this?
We know that Susan Rice lied 5 times on 5 different morning shows the morning after Benghazi.
Why wouldn t she try and cover this spying up to protect herself and others including Obama.Susan Rice is also giving conflicting stories on what she did so it might be a good idea for her to lawyer up right now.
She claimed ignorance of the unmasking and spying but today she spoke about doing it.
Yes, red flags are everywhere on this!
The reality and truth is this was more of a political attack to destabilize the Trump presidency and embarrass him:Andrew McCarthy said it best: The national-security adviser is not an investigator.
She is a White House staffer.
The president s staff is a consumer of intelligence, not a generator or collector of it.
If Susan Rice was unmasking Americans, it was not to fulfill an intelligence need based on American interests; it was to fulfill a political desire based on Democratic-party interests.
The bottom line is that laws were broken when the names were unmasked Someone s in BIG trouble!
