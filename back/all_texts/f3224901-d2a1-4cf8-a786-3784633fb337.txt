That s the intention we set so his name will serve as a beacon of light and hope to push our culture forward in a better direction.
Brenda Martin Providence, a friend of Trayvon s mother, volunteered at the Peace Walk.
She didn t expect to see the high-profile rapper whose appearance hadn t been publicized.
It means a lot to the community when you see people like Jay-Z who come out to support your cause, Providence said.
