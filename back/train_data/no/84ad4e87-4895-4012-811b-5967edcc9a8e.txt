istanbul ( reuters ) - a turkish professor who has been on hunger strike since losing her job in a purge following last year s failed coup was convicted on friday of belonging to a banned far-left group but the court ordered her release pending an appeal .
nuriye gulmen , 35 , was sentenced to six years and three months in jail for being a member of the militant leftist dhkp-c group , deemed a terrorist organization by turkey , defense lawyers told reuters .
she was found not guilty of lesser charges including organizing illegal rallies .
the literature professor had been hospitalized before the trial began due to her worsening health after seven months of surviving on water , herbal tea and sugar and salt solutions .
primary school teacher semih ozakca , 28 , who has also been on hunger strike since losing his job in the crackdown , was acquitted on similar charges .
the ankara court had ordered his release on oct. 21 for the remainder of the trial , on condition that he wear an ankle monitor .
both deny any links to dhkp-c. a third defendant , acun karadag , was acquitted on a lesser charge of participating in illegal rallies .
the teachers have said their hunger strike aimed to highlight the plight of some 150,000 state employees including academics , civil servants , judges and soldiers suspended or sacked since the abortive coup in july 2016 .
the pair were detained in may and jailed pending the start of the trial in september .
on sept. 12 , days before the teachers were due in court , turkey issued detention warrants for the lawyers who were set to defend them .
