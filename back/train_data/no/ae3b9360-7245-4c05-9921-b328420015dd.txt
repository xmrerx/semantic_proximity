vatican city ( reuters ) - pope francis on wednesday chastised priests and bishops who take pictures with their cell phones during masses , saying they should focus on god instead .
the priest says lift up your hearts .
he does not say , lift up your cell phones to take pictures , francis told tens of thousands of people at his weekly audience in st. peter s square , referring to a communion prayer in the roman catholic mass .
in his improvised remarks , he called using cell phones during mass a very ugly thing , adding : it makes me very sad when i celebrate ( mass ) here in the piazza or in the basilica and i see so many cell phones held up .
not only by the faithful , but also by some priests and even bishops !
the mass is not a show ... so remember , no cell phones !
he said , prompting laughter and applause from the crowd .
francis , the leader of the world s 1.2 billion roman catholics , has regularly urged the faithful to be more spiritual and his priests and bishops to be more humble .
shortly after his election in 2013 , he said it pained him to see priests driving flashy cars and eager to use the latest smartphone .
the pope is driven around in a simple blue ford focus and is not known to have ever used a cell phone in public since his election .
