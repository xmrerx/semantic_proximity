Could someone please explain this?
I honestly don t think it s any accident.I stumbled onto this video via BadBlue, which linked to a site called Hyscience.
At first I thought it was a joke.
But the video is posted on the official AARP YouTube channel.In order for me to hear the not-so subliminal message on the radio playing in the background, I had to turn the volume all the way up and use headphones.
But this is what I hear: Riots nationwide have prompted local governments to declare martial law.
The president is asking that citizens find safety and remain calm.
Authorities are working their hardest to contain the outbreak.
It really does make one ask, what the hell?
Of all the messages that could be playing on a radio in an AARP ad, why this one?Via: The Right Planet
