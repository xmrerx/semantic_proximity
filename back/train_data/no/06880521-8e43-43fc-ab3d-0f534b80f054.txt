gen. john kelly surprised the white house press today when he walked out to speak with the them .
he set them straight and told them trump s biggest problem is their fake news stories .
he asked them to get better sources for their reporting lol ! the press has been speculating that kelly will quit his job as chief of staff i m not quitting today i don t think i m being fired today he came out and put that to rest !
he s not quitting but went on to say the job is not easy : this is the hardest job i ve ever had .
this is , in my view , the most important job i ve ever had .
`` i 'm not quitting today , '' white house chief of staff john kelly says adding , `` i do n't think i 'm being fired today . ''
