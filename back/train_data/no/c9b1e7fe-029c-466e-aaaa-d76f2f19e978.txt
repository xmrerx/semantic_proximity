wherein a piece of garbage is thrown into a receptacle with grace and artistry https : //t.co/l09bby8ghh jake tapper ( @ jaketapper ) september 28 , 2017this is how donald trump should have responded to the violent rally in charlottesville , virginia , which , by the way , was organized by richard spencer.spencer previously said that he felt proud after trump blamed many sides for the violence at the hate-rally which resulted in the murder of heather heyer , and left at least 19 others injured .
spencer is one of trump s very fine people who just got smacked down on twitter by a republican.you don t have to like his politics to admire that sasse was among the republicans who joined civil rights leaders and democrats who reacted angrily when trump said that he condemned this egregious display of hatred , bigotry , and violence on many sides on many sides .
of course , if sasse would call out roy moore over his bigoted remarks , that would be nice to see , too.photo : chip somodevilla via getty images .
