While on his radio show the other day, former Ku Klux Klan Grand Wizard David Duke doubled down on his support of Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump, even appearing excited at the comparisons being made to Adolf Hitler.While he tried to preface his diatribe against the media by stating that everyone is just trying to demonize Trump by associating him with Hitler, he then goes on to say: The truth is, by the way, they might be rehabilitating that fellow with the mustache back there in Germany, because I saw a commercial against Donald Trump, a really vicious commercial, comparing what Donald Trump said about preserving America and making America great again to Hitler in Germany preserving Germany and making Germany great again and free again and not beholden to these Communists on one side, politically who were trying to destroy their land and their freedom, and the Jewish capitalists on the other, who were ripping off the nation through the banking system.
We have the same thing going on here with Goldman Sachs.
It was a commercial, I saw that this morning and I was amazed by that commercial.
It was a commercial against Trump but I don t think it s having the effect that they want it to have.This war that s going on against Donald Trump is really a war going on against America, it s a war going on against the European-American majority.
The media has incited hatred and violence and repression of Donald Trump and the hundreds of thousands, the millions of people who support him, and that s what happened in Chicago.
And if that wasn t horrifying enough to listen to, he follows it up with this: If you re a European person, the government is purposefully wiping you out and your families and your children and your future.
They are purposefully transforming this country into a Third World nation.
Okay, first of all, if you re a European person, that means you live in Europe.
However, clearly this is code for white people who think being white is something to be proud of.
If you re an American, you embrace the beautiful melting pot that we are and have always been.Recent Trump rallies mirror the sentiments said by Duke, and that is outright horrifying.
It s one thing to have an extremist support you, it s another to embrace that support of those just like him on a daily basis making the bold claim that some how you re going to make America great again by utilizing their adoration and votes.America is great.
