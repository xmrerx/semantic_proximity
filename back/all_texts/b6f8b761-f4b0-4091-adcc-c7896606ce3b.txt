We are now in the finally days leading up to the 2016 presidential election, and if there s one thing everyone must do it s vote.
Donald Trump must lose, and he must lose, in his words, big league.Putting together the most epic music video of the entire election season is none other than the brilliant Rachel Bloom for Funny or Die with a cast of amazing talent a mile long.One of the most profound lyrics of the entire song is this: Look obviously only Hitler s Hiter but break out Mein Kampf into tiny parts and it reads like a Trump rant on Twitter.
Followed with this thorough explanation: And if you need a refresher on post World War I Germany, they had an authoritarian political outsider stoking xenophobia in a nation where the poor felt marginalized, and blaming complex problems on scapegoating minorities.
The song goes on, albeit in a silly way, to get the point across that Donald Trump would be absolutely devastating for not only the nation but the entire world.The final message is to vote for Hillary Clinton, and that a vote for a third party, while your right, is a conscience vote a lot of people don t have the luxury to have, because of how much they ll lose if Trump wins.Don t only vote, people.
Vote wisely and for everyone s benefit, not just your own.Watch here:Featured image via video screen capture
