juba ( reuters ) - south sudanese judges ended a five-month strike without a pay deal on thursday , saying they had to clear a massive backlog of cases .
president salva kiir , who in july sacked several striking judges , has told union representatives he would resolve their demands in the near future , arop malueth of the judges and justice union said .
the strike was over salaries that the judges say have been rendered practically worthless by hyperinflation in a country in civil war since 2013 .
courts already faced a huge backlog as the nation of 12 million people only had 274 judges on the payroll in the last government budget .
some have since resigned , some are off sick and others are on leave , the union said .
this strike has gone for five months but nothing has been done by the authorities and our citizens have been suffering every day because the courts are closed , malueth told reuters .
the union s general assembly agreed on wednesday to return to work on sept. 11 .
war has brought famine and forced more than a quarter of south sudan s population to flee their homes , creating africa s biggest refugee crisis since the rwandan genocide in 1994 .
