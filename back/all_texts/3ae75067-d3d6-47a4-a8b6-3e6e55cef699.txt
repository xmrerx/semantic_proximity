All the months of speculation that the modern day KKK does indeed endorse Donald Trump can be confirmed as the terrorist organization s Rebel Brigade Knights Grand Imperial Wizard endorses the GOP frontrunner on live national television.When asked by reporter Chris Thomas who would be the best one for the job of President of the United States, the Wizard answered: I think Donald Trump would be best for the job.
The reason a lot of Klan members like Donald Trump is because a lot of what he believes in, we believe in.
We want our country to be safe.
Under the guise of now being a political group, the word safe has now become synonymous with xenophobia, Islamophobia, racism and bigotry all tenets, still, of the KKK, no matter how they want to word it.And they re pretty much endorsing Donald Trump.To make it even better, the Klan has (apparently) had success in recruiting since President Obama has been in office and it has nothing to do with being black, so says the Grand Wizard.
It s merely a difference in politics.
Totally.And if that wasn t strange (and stupid) enough, the Grand Wizard also admitted should Trump lose the nomination, they would back Kasich, not Cruz, for President.
Why?
Because Ted Cruz wasn t born on American soil.
In their eyes, he s a foreigner who isn t fit to be president, even though they share a lot of the same views.Again, this is purely political and absolutely nothing to do with being a racist, xenophobic bigot.So now that there seems to be plurality of KKK members rushing to embrace Trump, is to fair to say he s the candidate for racist America?Let s see how long it takes him to disavow this endorsement.
It took Clinton one day to disavow the phony Koch endorsement.
If it s any indication, his rejection of David Duke took two weeks and much consideration.I wonder how much consideration this will take.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images
