JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - A relative of Zimbabwean minister Jonathan Moyo, purged from the ruling ZANU-PF party along with President Robert Mugabe, said on Monday that a tweet on his Twitter handle earlier saying that he was outside of the country was the work of a hacker.
While he remains safe, he is not the one who posted that, the family member told Reuters, adding that Moyo remained in Zimbabwe.
The tweet was subsequently deleted.
