hanoi ( reuters ) - a court in vietnam jailed dissident nguyen van oai for a further five years on monday for violating the terms of his probation after a spell in prison , his lawyer said .
human rights groups have expressed alarm over the communist-ruled country s biggest crackdown on activists in years .
oai , 36 , was arrested in january while on probation after a 2013 sentence for activities aimed at overthrowing the government .
he had been released in 2015 .
on monday , the people s court in nghe an , central vietnam , also found him guilty of resisting security personnel in performing their duty .
he was given another four years on probation as well as the prison sentence .
oai said he was innocent and he would appeal , his lawyer , ha huy son , told reuters .
the court made no immediate comment .
despite sweeping economic reforms and growing openness to social change , vietnam s communist party retains tight media censorship and does not tolerate criticism .
