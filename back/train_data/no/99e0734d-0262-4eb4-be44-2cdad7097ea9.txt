kabul ( reuters ) - the u.s. ambassador to afghanistan said on monday washington would never allow militants to use the country as a sanctuary , as american and allied troops in kabul commemorated the sept. 11 attacks .
u.s. president donald trump in august committed nearly 4,000 additional troops to afghanistan as part of an open-ended campaign against taliban insurgents who have made advances in recent years .

since then more than 2,400 american troops and more than 1,000 international allies have died in afghanistan .
today we remember how this conflict began but let us also remember how this must end , with afghanistan never again serving as an ungoverned space , sanctuary or base for those who are bent on attacking us and our allies , ambassador hugo llorens told a crowd of soldiers at the nato coalition s headquarters in kabul .
the united states would also completely annihilate islamic state militants in the region , llorens said .
