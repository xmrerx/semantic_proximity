the federal aviation administration lifted a ground-stop order after nearly two hours , allowing united planes to fly again.united did not immediately say how many flights were affected.united , the nation s second-biggest airline , has suffered similar technology problems before , also leading to mass delays and cancellations.the airline briefly halted all takeoffs in the u.s. on june 2 because of a problem in its flight-dispatching system .
united said then that about 150 flights were affected.united also struggled through a series of computer outages in 2012 after switching to the passenger-information system of continental airlines after that carrier merged with united .
those outages caused hundreds of flights to be delayed .
high-paying business travelers were outraged ; united ceo jeff smisek apologized for failing to provide good customer service.after a 2010 merger , united elected to combine many computer systems and frequent-flier programs all at once .
executives believed that any disruptions would thus be short-lived .

in april , more than 50 american flights were delayed when a software glitch prevented pilots from seeing some airport maps on their tablet computers.after wednesday s problems , united apologized to customers and said they could change travel plans without being charged the usual $ 200 reservation-change fee .
in some cases , the airline said it would also waive any difference in fare for the rescheduled trip .
