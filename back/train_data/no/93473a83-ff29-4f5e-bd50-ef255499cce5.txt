stuart varney asked hillary friend and adviser doug schoen if hillary plans on running in 2020 the answer he gives only confirms what we ve all been saying about hillary clinton she is firmly planted in the corner of delusion .
she is one woman who can t take the blame for her failures but behaves like a child angrily pointing fingers at everyone but herself .
introspection isn t in her wheelhouse.she plans on running again even though she just hammered the democrat party !
she just burned the bridge with all who could help her if she runs again ! we hope schoen is correct in his belief that she is running it s great news for the republicans .
it s like we have the geriatric wing of democrats with biden and clinton planning to run .
didn t someone tell them the old guard is pass ? stuart varney : is she running again ? doug schoen : oh yeah !
even if it s only in her own mind , she is running even if it s only in her mind ? ?
? run , run , run ! in case you missed clinton calling the email scandal a nothing-burger : hillary clinton continues on the path to complete and total denial .
# codecon 2017 included a blah , blah , blah session by clinton .
she spews ridiculous victimhood it s embarrassing !
nobody said don t do this https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=9_nkol4h0iuthis woman needs to go off into the woods for another walk .
