madrid ( reuters ) - a spanish court said on friday it has exchanged a 21-month prison sentence handed to soccer player lionel messi for tax fraud last july for a quarter-of-a-million-euro fine .
the barcelona player and his father were found guilty by a catalan court last year of three counts of tax fraud to the tune of 4.1 million euros ( $ 4.68 million ) over income earned from image rights .
the father also had his 15-month sentence exchanged for a fine of 180,000 euros , the court said .
neither messi or his father would have served time in jail following the original ruling as defendants without a previous conviction are permitted to serve any sentence of under two years on probation .
