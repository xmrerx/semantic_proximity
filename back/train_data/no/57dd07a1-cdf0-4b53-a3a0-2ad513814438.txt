tokyo ( reuters ) - japan is to acquire medium-range , air-launched cruise missiles , capable of striking north korea , a controversial purchase of what will become the longest-range munitions of a country that has renounced the right to wage war .
defence minister itsunori onodera did not refer to north korea when announcing the planned acquisition and said the new missiles would be for defence , with japan still relying on the united states to strike any enemy bases .
we are planning to introduce the jsm ( joint strike missile ) that will be mounted on the f-35a ( stealth fighter ) as stand-off missiles that can be fired beyond the range of enemy threats , onodera told a news conference .
japan is also looking to mount lockheed martin corp s extended-range joint air-to-surface standoff missile ( jassm-er ) on its f-15 fighters , he said .
the jsm , designed by norway s kongsberg defence & aerospace , has a range of 500 km ( 310 miles ) .
the jassm-er can hit targets 1,000 km away .
the purchase plan is likely to face criticism from opposition parties in parliament , especially from politicians wary of the watering down of japan s renunciation of the right to wage war enshrined in its post-world war two constitution .
but the growing threat posed by north korean ballistic missiles has spurred calls from politicians , including onodera , for a more robust military that could deter north korea from launching an attack .
japan s missile force has been limited to anti-aircraft and anti-ship munitions with ranges of less than 300 km ( 186 miles ) .
the change suggests the growing threat posed by north korea has given proponents of a strike capability the upper hand in military planning .
north korea has recently test-fired ballistic missiles over japan and last week tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile that climbed to an altitude of more than 4,000 km before splashing into the sea within japan s exclusive economic zone .
