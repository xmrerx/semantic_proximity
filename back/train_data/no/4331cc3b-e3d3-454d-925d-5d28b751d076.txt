cape town ( reuters ) - south african president jacob zuma said on thursday his government was considering the best time to launch a major expansion of its nuclear power fleet , after the finance minister said the country could not afford it .
zuma was responding to a question in parliament by opposition leader mmusi maimane who asked why finance minister malusi gigaba had said the expansion would be delayed while energy minister david mahlobo said the opposite .
we have a policy of mixed energy and that includes nuclear , zuma said .
we are not saying we have changed policy ... its a question of timing , when do we do it .
