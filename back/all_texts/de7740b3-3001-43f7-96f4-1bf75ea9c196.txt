After what seemed like an agonizingly long wait, Alec Baldwin returned to Saturday Night Live after a particularly humiliating series of phone calls with world leaders in which Donald Trump somehow managed to start an international incident with Australia a nation that has had our back since around World War I and probably threatened to send troops to Mexico.Baldwin s Trump tackled (with the aid of a skeleton masked and robed President Steve Bannon) The Donald s calls with world leaders, including ones that didn t happen but should have.
He also calls German Chancellor Angela Merkel (Trump would call her President based on his interactions with Australia s Prime Minister), who clearly desperately misses Barack Obama.
He also tells her about his upcoming memoir: My Struggle (we ll let you Google the German translation for that if you don t already know it).The highlight of the cold open is Baldwin s call with Zimbabwe s President Robert Mugabe, who called tells Trump : You think you are a real dictator?
I will rip out your spine and drink from your skull!
You cannot even walk down stairs, you little white b*tch!
Don t you ever call Zimbabwe again!
While Trump has not given him the courtesy of a phone call in the real world, Mugabe (the one who isn t played by Keenan Thompson) recently wondered if there are enough doctors in America to handle Trump, whom he says is Hitler s grandson.After Trump, with Bannon the dark specter who is really running the show whispering in his ear, had their fun, Bannon tells The Donald that s enough fun for tonight and asks for his desk back.
Yes, of course, Mr. President, the orange-skinned puppet replies as he slinks off to play with his toys.
