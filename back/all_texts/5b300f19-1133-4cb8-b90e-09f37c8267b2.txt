Well, well, well the left is trying pretty much anything to discount the Trump candidacy.
WaPo had a blurb earlier in the week that said Bill Clinton suggested Trump run for president.
Nope, nada, did NOT happen!
We can put this lie to bed Donald Trump s race for the White House has nothing to do with a phone call with Bill Clinton, according to a Hillary Clinton campaign spokeswoman.
They exchanged pleasantries.
Mr. Trump noted that he was thinking about running for president, and the president wished him well but didn t give him any advice, Jen Palmieri, the communications director for Clinton s campaign, told Andrea Mitchell of MSNBC on Thursday.
Donald Trump doesn t strike me as somebody who takes a big step like this because somebody else wants him to do; he seems to be somebody who very much operates under the premise of free will.
The Clinton campaign played no behind-the-scenes role in encouraging Trump s candidacy, Palmieri added.Earlier this week, The Washington Post reported Trump and former President Clinton spoke on the phone before the real estate mogul announced his 2016 bid.Sources in the story said that Bill Clinton urged Trump to play a larger role in the Republican Party.
Trump has taken the lead in the GOP primary in several polls and is in the No.
