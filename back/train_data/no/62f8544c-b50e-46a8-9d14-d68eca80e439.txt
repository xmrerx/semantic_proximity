president trump skipped the white house correspondents dinner to hold a rally in harrisburg , pennsylvania instead .
how could anyone blame him for wanting to be as far away from that group of piranhas as possible ? president donald trump railed against the media at a rally in harrisburg , pennsylvania , on saturday , just as the annual white house correspondents dinner was set to begin in washington , dc.in case anyone was wondering if trump had any facts to back up his assertion that he was and continues to be under siege by the media , he reminded the crowd of a recent poll from mrc : he then went on to mock the white house correspondents dinner by reminding his audience who he chose not to spend his evening with : a large group of hollywood actors and washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation s capital right now , he said .
they are gathered together for the white house correspondents dinner without the president .
he continued : and i could not possibly be more thrilled than to be 100 miles away from washington s swamp , spending my evening with all of you and with a much , much larger crowd and much better people .
he also proved that the american people who elected him have not grown any fonder or become more trusting of leftist attack dog media outlets like cnn and msnbc .
watch as he mentions cnn during their live broadcast and the audience chants , cnn sucks !
