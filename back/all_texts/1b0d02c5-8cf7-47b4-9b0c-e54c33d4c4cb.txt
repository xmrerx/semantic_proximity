Folks, violence is never the answer.
Certainly not in situations like the one that you re about to read about and watch.Two peaceful (and silent) protesters attended the infamous Donald Trump and Sarah Palin rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Tuesday.
As you ll be able to see in the first four seconds of the video, a Trump supporter pushes them when all they were doing was standing there.
For one, that s not their job (let security be the dicks).
Secondly, it was completely uncalled for no matter who it was, even if it was security that did it.Later in the video, a guy in a cowboy hat attempts to drag them out around the same time a uniformed cop arrives.
Instead of being retaliated against in a violent nature, the protester knocks the guy s cowboy hat off.
It wasn t exactly the most professional response, but hey, he was being dragged out by a man who had no business putting his hands on him.
He could have responded in a whole host of other ways that would not have been preferable, such as throwing a fist.
In any case, the cowboy deserved it.The cop that showed up didn t get violent and merely escorted the two guys out.
That, for once, was the correct way to do things.
Kudos to that man.
It s possible that the guy in the cowboy hat was, in fact, affiliated in some way to the event, but we re not sure as of this writing.
If he was, he certainly wasn t dressed for it.Just to show the ignorance of Trump supporters, you can hear a guy nearby say that the protester was the violent one for merely flipping off the guys hat.
It s absurd, and everyone that watches the video will know better.
Here s what he had to say, in full: Good job, buddy.
You f*cking idiot.
Get this mother f*ker out of here.
He s violent.
He must not have been paying attention until the very end.
Somehow we highly doubt that.
Trump s supporters aren t exactly the sharpest tools in the shed this is just further proof.Featured image via screen capture
