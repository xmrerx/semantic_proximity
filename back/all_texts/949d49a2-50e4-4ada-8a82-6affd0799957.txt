VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks with his South Korean counterpart Moon Jae-in on Wednesday after which he condemned North Korea s missile testing and called for talks to try to resolve the crisis.
Putin, speaking in the Russian Pacific port city of Vladivostok, said it was not possible to resolve the North Korean crisis with just sanctions and pressure alone.
Pyongyang s nuclear and missile program was a flagrant violation of United Nations resolutions, said Putin.
Without political and diplomatic tools, it is impossible to make headway in the current situation; to be more precise, it is impossible at all, Putin said at a joint news conference with his South Korean counterpart.
