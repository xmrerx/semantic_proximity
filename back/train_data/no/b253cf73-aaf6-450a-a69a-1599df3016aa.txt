helsinki ( reuters ) - finland did not pay a ransom for the release of a finnish aid worker kidnapped in afghanistan , the nordic country s foreign minister said on thursday .
finland has not paid , and will not pay ransom in the future .
if we did , we would only encourage further kidnappings , foreign minister timo soini told a news conference via videolink from washington .
the ministry confirmed earlier on thursday that the finnish woman , who was abducted in may and held captive for 118 days , had been released .
she was working for a swedish aid group in kabul and during her abduction a german colleague and their afghan guard were killed .
the foreign ministry gave no further details about the kidnapping or the release , but said the woman was in afghanistan and in good condition in light of the circumstances .
kidnapping is a longstanding problem in afghanistan , mainly affecting afghans abducted for ransom .
however foreigners have also regularly been targeted , either for ransom or to put pressure on their governments .
