( reuters ) - iraqi forces launched on thursday an offensive to recapture the last patch of iraqi territory still in the hands of islamic state , on the border area with syria , prime minister haider al-abadi said .
daesh members have to choose between death and surrender , he said in a statement announcing the offensive on region of al-qaim and rawa .
the iraqi airforce dropped thousands of leaflets on the border area calling on the militants to surrender and urging the population to stay away from their positions , according to a statement from the joint operations command in baghdad .
the militant group also holds parts of the syrian side of the border , but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a u.s.-backed , kurdish-led coalition and syrian government troops with foreign shi ite militias backed by iran and russia .
islamic state s self-declared cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in july , when u.s.-backed iraqi forces captured mosul , the group s de facto capital in iraq , in a grueling battle which lasted nine months .
the militants syrian stronghold , raqqa , fell to u.s.-backed forces last week .
islamic state leader abu bakr al-baghdadi , who declared the caliphate from mosul in mid-2014 , released an audio recording on sept. 28 that indicated he was alive , after several reports he had been killed .
he urged his followers to keep up the fight despite setbacks .
tell those among your children and relatives who took up a weapon against the state to throw it aside immediately , and to go to any house on top of which a white flag have been raised when the liberation forces enter al-qaim , said the leaflets dropped by the iraqi airforce .
regular army units , sunni tribal forces and iranian-backed popular mobilisation are taking part in the offensive toward the syrian border , the joint operations command said .
