Can you believe a first grader was investigated for whether she intentionally misgendered a fellow student who decided to identify from a boy to a girl?
This is just too much for a young child to process.
You really won t believe what this little girl went through.
What would you do as a parent of a child who was punished because of misgendering ?APPARENTLY, MISGENDERING IS A THING NOW A Californian first grader was sent to the principal s office this week after allegedly misgendering a transgender student.
The incident reportedly took place at California s Rocklin Academy, in the school playground, where the female student called her biologically male classmate by his given name apparently unaware that the boy now identified as a girl, according to Fox News.
This innocent little first grader sees a classmate, calls him by the name she knew him last year and the boy reports it to a teacher, claimed Karen England, from the Capitol Resource Institute.
The little girl gets in trouble on the playground and then gets called out of class to the principal s office.
During her visit to the principal s office, the child was reportedly investigated to determine whether or not she had bullied the transgender child by calling him by his original name.
After about an hour it was determined the little girl made an honest mistake and she was not punished or reprimanded.
But she was terribly traumatized by the incident, Fox News claimed.After the child returned home upset, her mother wrote a letter to the school.
I stressed over and over with the principal that I am all for protecting the rights of [the transgender child], but my children have rights as well, wrote the mother in her letter.
It makes me sad that my daughter felt like she was punished for trying to be kind to the kid.
In response, the mother was allegedly told that whenever there is a pronoun mishap with this biological boy who now claims to be a girl the school must investigate.
