When Caitlyn Jenner first announced that she was going to embrace her true self, the LGBT community was behind her and with good reason.
The former olympic athlete and longtime motivational speaker had the opportunity to be an amazing spokesperson for the transgender community but then she screwed it up.
Instead of supporting her new community by condemning the Republican Party s bigotry, she has stood firm and refused to acknowledge it.
Now, she has dug herself a hole that it seems like she may never get out of.Last week on the season premiere of I Am Cait, Jenner said that Republican men have never been anti-LGBT and are for everyone s rights.
We pointed out how ignorant a statement that was on Monday.
But it seems that she wasn t done being a dumbass, because on the previews for the next episode she said this about Donald Trump: Um, I m not a big fan because, I think, of his macho attitude.
I think he would have a hard time with women when he doesn t even realize it It doesn t mean he wouldn t be good for women s issues, I think he would be very good for women s issues.I don t think he s out there to destroy women or takes things away or do any of that kind of stuff.
Jenner is so out-of-touch with reality, it s almost sad.
Donald Trump would be absolutely horrible for women s issues.
He was once pro-choice, but now he s not.
He insults women all the time.
He doesn t support marriage equality.
And he s just an all around horrible human being.Meanwhile, in the same clip she called Hillary a, f*cking liar.
She s literally supporting a guy who Politifact has found to be dishonest seventy-six percent of the time, but has the audacity to call Clinton a liar.
Her ignorance is breathtaking and it s really no wonder the LGBT community wants nothing to do with her anymore.
With friends like Jenner, they don t need enemies like Trump.Watch:Featured image via video screenshot
