After last week s G-20 meeting, where Donald Trump was more pariah than world leader, he tweeted a video compilation from the meeting.
The amateurish editing isn t even the story, though.
It was all set to the most gawdawful, dictatorial sounding music you ve ever heard.The video shows several brief clips of a sour-faced Trump during the G-20 and the soundtrack was a group singing Make America Great Again in a way that would make most high school choir directors cringe.
Hell, it should make most Americans cringe.
Kim Jong-Un might be taking notes.MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 9, 2017The music was performed by the First Baptist Church of Dallas, and among some other random patriotic sounding BS, the words Make America Great Again is repeated ad nauseam (and you will feel nauseated), no less than nine times.
The creep factor didn t get by Twitter.Oh, and thanks First Baptist Dallas for this dreadful song.

Our 12 year old President needed a photo recap video to feel relevant while the rest of the world ridicules his presence at #G20.
