WASHINGTON (Reuters) - California Attorney General Kamala Harris said she is not interested in being nominated for the vacancy on the Supreme Court, the San Jose Mercury News reported on Tuesday.
“I do not wish to be considered.
I am running for the United States Senate,” said Harris, who is running to replaced retiring Democratic Senator Barbara Boxer in California.
