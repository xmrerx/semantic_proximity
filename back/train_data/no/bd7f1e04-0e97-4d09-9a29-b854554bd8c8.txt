london ( reuters ) - the british government needs to provide more clarity and less ambiguity on brexit for negotiations to succeed , french junior economy minister benjamin griveaux said during a visit to london on wednesday .
asked what impact a no-deal brexit scenario would have on france , griveaux told reporters that it would be felt by the whole of europe , but would be even worse for britain .
if it goes wrong , it will go wrong for everyone , he said .
griveaux , who helped president emmanuel macron set up the en marche political movement that propelled him to power in may , is part of the 39-year old leader s inner circle .
he was in london to meet company executives , predominantly in the financial services industry , with a view to persuading them to move some of their operations to france after brexit .
griveaux declined to give details of any potential corporate moves , saying that it was for companies to make announcements about their own plans .
griveaux said he was confident that paris , which has been a minor financial center dwarfed by london for decades , would be more prominent in future .
in five to 10 years , paris will be the first financial place in continental europe , he said .
london will remain an important and major financial place for sure .
