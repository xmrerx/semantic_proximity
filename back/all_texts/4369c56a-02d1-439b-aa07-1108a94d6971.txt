CEDAR RAPIDS, Iowa (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the United States had a “great relationship with China” as he stood beside former Iowa Governor Terry Branstad, the new U.S. ambassador to Beijing.
“We have a great relationship with China and I really like President Xi,” Trump said in a speech at an Iowa community college.
The comment came a day after Trump said Chinese efforts to persuade North Korea to rein in its weapons programs had failed.
