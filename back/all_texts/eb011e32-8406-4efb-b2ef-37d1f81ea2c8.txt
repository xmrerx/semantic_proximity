Democrats appear to be completely fed up with Donald Trump s bizarre conspiracy theory where he alleges without evidence that the presidential election will be rigged.
Trump has also called on his supporters to show up in minority-heavy voting precincts in a move that many believe is an attempt to suppress the vote, to rig things in his favor.Now Democrats are suing the Republicans.The Democratic National Committee is suing the Republican National Committee for aiding GOP nominee Donald Trump as he argues that the presidential election is rigged, claiming that Trump s argument is designed to suppress the vote in minority communities.The suit, filed Wednesday in US District Court in New Jersey, argues that the RNC has not sufficiently rebuked Trump for the line of attack, which he has used as a rallying cry and is assumed to be a way to explain away a potential loss on Election Day.The Democrats argue in the filing that Trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the November 8 election will be rigged based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in certain areas or certain sections of key states.
Republicans are still bound under a consent decree due to a previous court case, which limits their ability to officially send people to polling stations to intimidate voters.
At the same time, outside fringe right wing armed militia groups like The Oath Keepers have recently sent out calls to patrol voting booths on Trump s behalf.Knowing how vital the votes of Latinos, blacks, and others are to Democratic hopes especially with President Obama off the ballot Republicans appear to be highly invested in any and all schemes focused on cutting down the number of voters.
If they can suppress minority turnout, which has always been anti-Republican but could now form the foundation of a landslide, Republicans think they could pull out a (tainted) victory.Featured image via Flickr
