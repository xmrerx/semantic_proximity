whenever we have a terror attack in america , the media goes to great lengths to make sure no one assumes of the killer was a muslim .
meanwhile , the media has gone out of their way to convince americans that all hispanics hate trump .
isn t it interesting how quickly they print a story about the murderer of two muslim men who witnesses describe as a tall hispanic man and then blame trump ? an imam and his assistant were shot and killed in broad daylight as they walked home from a mosque in queens .
that s not what america is about , khairul islam , 33 , a local resident told the daily news .
we blame donald trump for this .
trump and his drama has created islamophobia .
another imam , whose name is unknown at the moment , also blamed the real estate mogul and former nyc mayor for the shooting .
for those in leadership like trump and mr. giuliani , and other members of other institutions that project islam and muslims as the enemy , this is the end result of their wickedness , the imam said at a gathering of muslims protesting the shooting.other muslim gatherings were chanting this is donald trump s fault , and muslim hate crime .
witnesses providing leads to the nypd described the shooter as a tall man of hispanic descent .
the nypd is currently conducting an extensive canvass of the area for video and seeking additional witnesses as the shooter remains at large .
