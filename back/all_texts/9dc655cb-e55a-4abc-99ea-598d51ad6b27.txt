It doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out one shouldn t dance at a funeral, but considering former President George W. Bush is a few sandwiches short of a picnic, he never seemed to learn that lesson.While at the funeral for the five slain officers in Dallas, Texas, Bush joined President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama, as well as Vice President Joe Biden, Dr. Jill Biden, and his wife Laura.At one point during the service, the choir began singing The Battle Hymn of the Republic and with its marching beat, the former president took this as a cue to begin to pretend to march.
He swayed from side to side and even seemed to try to get his wife and Michelle Obama to join in.It was at that point that the First Lady shot Bush a look that could burn a thousand homes, and Laura Bush seemed to whisper at him that he needed to stop.
Common sense would allow most people to realize that sort of behavior, especially from a former president, isn t appropriate, but President Bush has never been known for his common sense.Watch it all happen here:Laura Bush: George!
George!
Be reverent!
We re on TV!
