paris ( reuters ) - spanish and catalan leaders should open talks as soon as possible to safeguard civil peace , the head of france s occitanie region , which borders catalonia , said on saturday .
madrid on friday sacked catalonia s regional government to block its push for independence and called a snap election in the region on dec. 21 in a bid to draw a line under spain s worst political crisis in 40 years .
our region ... has a special history with spain , and we have had close ties with our neighbor catalonia for decades , occitanie president carole delga said in a written statement .
occitanie includes the pyrenees-orientales , whose territory was part of catalonia until the signing of a treaty to end a war between france and spain in 1659 .
the catalan language is still spoken by a few people living in the french region .
faced with this deadlock situation , i want to stress the need to find a way to open talks as soon as possible , notably to safeguard the civil peace , delga added .
occitanie is france s second-biggest region with a total population of more than 5 million people .
it was created in january 2016 and comprises two former regions , including the cities of toulouse and montpelier .
separately , the nationalist president of the corsican assembly , jean-guy talamoni , said on twitter that he recognized the birth of the republic of catalonia but called for european authorities to mediate between madrid and barcelona .
on the european side , what s troubling is this unfailing support for madrid , which has used extremely violent means to prevent peaceful people from voting , talamoni later said on france info radio station .
spain s prime minister mariano rajoy praised the police for carrying out their duties and upholding the law while they attempted to prevent the banned independence referendum taking place .
