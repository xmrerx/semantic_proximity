The spectacle of Donald Trump rejecting Fox News debate got even more ridiculous on Wednesday night as the network s highest rated host, Bill O Reilly, got involved in the clown show.Despite shunning Fox, Trump still decided to appear on The O Reilly Factor in a satellite interview with the host.
Discussing Trump s public tantrum, O Reilly all but got down on bended knee and asked Trump to reconsider his decision: I m trying to convince you that your tack is wrong, because it s better for the folks to see you in the debate format, Mr. O Reilly said.He pointed to Newt Gingrich using negative questions during the debate in South Carolina in 2012 to great effect as he pummeled the moderator John King of CNN in the Republican primary campaign.
Mr. Gingrich later won the primary in the state.
I m telling you, that s the way to go here, Mr. O Reilly said.
This has to do with the stupidity of Fox and what they did, Mr. Trump said.O Reilly even pointed to his cheek, asking the reality TV star and current Republican front-runner to turn the other cheek after being angered at the network for a combative press release reports indicate was personally written by network boss, Roger Ailes.Trump rebuffed the overture, telling O Reilly he is more in the mood for an eye for an eye, wounding Fox in his perspective by hurting the ratings for the network and its advertisers.In addition to Trump s direct refusal to engage, his campaign cronies have also been spreading the conspiracy theory that Fox is in cahoots with Hillary Clinton, despite the network s pivotal role over the last 20 years in attacking and smearing Democrats, particularly the former Secretary of State.Taking advantage of the chaos, fellow candidate Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) has asked Trump to hold a one-on-one Lincoln/Douglas style debate with him.
Trump has refused, and some believe the gambit is Trump attempting to opt out of debates even if he is the Republican nominee, an unprecedented cowardly move.Featured image via YouTube
