How much longer before cops stop coming into the neighborhoods to help the people who hate them?
The following is a statement from Ebonie Riley, Washington DC Bureau Chief of the National Action Network: We are disappointed in the decision of the court but unfortunately not surprised.
As we have seen throughout the years, when officers opt for a trial by judge rather than by a jury, acquittal is the result.
We have been through this with Sean Bell and far too many other cases in the past.
This is exactly the reason we are calling for lowering the bar for federal prosecution, and greater involvement of the federal government in cases like this.
In federal court, a jury trial cannot be waived without the consent of the prosecution and we believe that is a fairer, more just process.
We continue to stand with the Gray family as they fight for justice for their son.
