on wednesday , the gop in an effort to deflect from the fact that they have failed multiple times to come up with an acceptable alternative to obamacare began rage-tweeting democrats demanding that they supply them with a workable plan .
this , of course , is despite republicans decision to shut democrats entirely out of the process while they came up with their terrible replacement for the affordable care act .
we ve got to fix what s broken , the gop tweeted with a two second video of hillary clinton saying those words .
where s your plan , @ hillaryclinton ?

where 's your plan , @ hillaryclinton ?
pic.twitter.com/cmrb4mcszd gop ( @ gop ) july 5 , 2017the simple answer , of course , is that republicans could have googled to find her plan .
clinton s plan is still live on her website .
while it s far from complete , being a summary on a campaign website , it is a pretty good start .
she has also spoken in detail about various things she would do to improve our healthcare system.americans , who have been kept in the dark about the gop s various failed plans , joined together to roast the living f * ck out of the stupid party.uh , the ball s in your court , gop .
what s your plan ?
