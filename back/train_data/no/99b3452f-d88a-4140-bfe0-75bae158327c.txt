dubai ( reuters ) - saudi arabia welcomed the reconciliation of rival factions hamas and fatah and said it will help palestinians to gain their legitimate rights , the state news agency spa reported on friday .
citing an official source in the kingdom s foreign ministry , spa said saudi arabia hopes the reconciliation will realize the brotherly palestinian people s hope of ending divisions and achieving unity .
hamas and fatah signed a reconciliation agreement on thursday after hamas agreed to hand over administrative control of gaza , including the key rafah border crossing , a decade after seizing the enclave in a civil war .
