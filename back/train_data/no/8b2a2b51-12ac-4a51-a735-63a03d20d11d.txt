johannesburg ( reuters ) - south africa s association of mineworkers and construction union ( amcu ) said on saturday another member of its leadership had been shot dead , execution-style , this time at a lonmin owned-mine on the platinum belt in the west of the country .
a senior official of the union was shot and killed outside an impala platinum ( implats ) mine two weeks ago , and the union said five of its members had been killed since july .
amcu president joseph mathunjwa said mvelesi biyela , a health and safety officer at lonmin s wonderkop mine near marikana in rustenburg , was shot on friday evening in front of his wife and six-year-old daughter while they were on their way home .
this is the fifth killing of one of our members since about the end of july , mathunjwa said .
we will not fight back with bullets , guns and anonymous hit men but with mass action , amcu said in a press statement .
lonmin confirmed that biyela was employed at its rowland shaft , and that it was informed by police late on friday that unknown assailants had shot and killed him .
we have no idea at all what is behind these killings but it is very concerning , especially when it happens in such a brutal manner .
for now we are leaving it to the police to find out the causes , said lonmin spokeswoman wendy tlou .
a resurgence of violence in the same area that saw south africa s longest strike in 2012 and 34 amcu members gunned down by police has unnerved investors in the ailing sector .
labour and social strife in south africa s platinum belt , the source of more than 70 percent of known reserves of the precious metal , has piled pressure onto an industry already hit by depressed prices .
