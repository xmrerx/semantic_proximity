Saturday Night Live returned with a stellar cold open that featured Alec Baldwin s Trump heading to Kentucky for a town hall with a bunch of as Trump put it people who don t just whisper oh god what s happening after I leave the room.
The sketch featured The Donald listening to the concerns of his voters on healthcare, drug rehabilitation, and environmental hazards then explaining to them one by one that he s getting right of all of them but the last one.
And, of course, one by one, they expressed dismay that their Dear Leader would take away things they love (like medical care) but still threw their support behind him because Trump supporters are (as science tells us) not exactly the sharpest tool in a box containing a mixed metaphor.
It s like you found a finger in your chili and you re still going to eat the chili because you told everyone how much you love chili, Baldwin-Trump told his audience.This is probably the best insult that has ever been leveled at Trump s supporters by humankind.
As Trump once said, he could shoot someone in the middle of 5th Avenue and not lose a single voter.
No matter what he does, who he hurts, or which prostitutes urinate on his hotel room bed, his people will stand behind him because they are exactly as proud as they are stupid and they will never admit they made a mistake.Watch the cold open below: Featured image via screengrab
