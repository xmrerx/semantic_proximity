this is priceless !
president trump just gave the best response ever to a reporter s question !
he said he wanted to thank russian president vladimir putin for reducing his payroll by firing u.s. embassy staff in moscow .
hysterical and so quick !
watch how trump doesn t skip a beat with his response : after sanctions on russia were put in place in july , putin ordered 755 embassy personnel out of russia.president trump was asked today during a press conference what he thought of the firing .
his response was quick and decisive .
he said he wanted to thank putin for the firing : no .
i want to thank him , because we re trying to cut down on payroll .
and as far as i m concerned , i m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll .
he continued : there s no real reason for them to go back .
so i greatly appreciate the fact that they have been able to cut our payroll for the united states .
we ll save a lot of money .
awesome !
