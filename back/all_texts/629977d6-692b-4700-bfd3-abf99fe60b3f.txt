Daily Shooter 21st Century WireThe Dallas Sniper Production.
What was it really about?Dallas, like so many other mass shooting events, coincidentally triggers a familiar pattern of convenient political and social conditioning effects.Brasscheck TV says: It is odd, isn t it?High profile school shooting, followed by high profile church shooting, followed high profile gay nightclub shooting now this.
It s as if they re checking off all the demographic boxes and the conclusion is always the same:1.
Guns are the problem 2.
Domestic terrorism is out of control 3.
We need to assemble a list of risky people and take away their guns 4. Who do they want to put on these lists?
Veterans, blacks, anyone with political opinions, anyone deemed mentally unstableWe need to do all this to protect school children, church goers, gays, and cops.
What reasonable person can say no to this, right ?
