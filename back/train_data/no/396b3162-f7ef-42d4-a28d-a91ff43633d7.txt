paris ( reuters ) - french environment minister nicolas hulot said on friday extreme weather conditions like the powerful hurricane bearing down on florida risked becoming the norm , and took a dig at u.s. president donald trump s stance on climate change .
in an interview with france 2 tv about hurricane irma , hulot implied that trump - who has called global warming a hoax - was ignoring the reality of man-made climate change , which most mainstream scientists regard as an established fact .
trump said in may he was pulling the united states out of the landmark 2015 global agreement to fight climate change that was brokered in paris , saying it would harm the u.s. economy and cost jobs .
irma - described by trump as a storm of absolutely historic destructive potential - pummeled cuba and the bahamas on friday , and a second powerful hurricane was tracking towards the northeastern caribbean .
asked if the storms might force trump to rethink his climate change policy , hulot said : what will change in the united states are the federal states , the cities , a whole section of society .
i think that is what will make up for the reservations of the american president on the links between cause and effect .
