Jewelry designers Jill Martinelli and Sabine Le Guyader of Lady Grey in Brooklyn left Ivanka Trump a note with her recent purchase.
Let s just say the two designers aren t fans of her father s. In the note, the two thanked her for her order but added that they were donating the proceeds to the American Immigration Council, the Everytown for Gun Safety organization and the Hillary Clinton campaign.The handwritten note was signed, Best, Jill + Sabine, with the Instagram photo of the letter captioned, Dear @ivankatrump, #thanksbutnothanks #payitFORWARD.
While we were flattered to receive an order from Ivanka Trump, our social and political views couldn t be further from those of the Trump campaign, Marinelli told The Cut.
When we received her order, we instantly felt compelled to take the money and donate it to a few organizations that were more aligned with our ideals.
That was too much for Trump fans to handle so they besieged Lady Grey s Instagram and Facebook pages.One commenter went there, stating, Your company is f*cked!!
