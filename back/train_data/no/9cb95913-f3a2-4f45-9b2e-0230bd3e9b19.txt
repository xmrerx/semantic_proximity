donald trump just proved once again that he is unfit to be president.earlier this week , the chinese navy intercepted a united states oceanographic drone in the south china sea.the federal government formally and politely requested that china give us our drone back.trump , on the other hand , accused china of stealing the drone and demanded its return.china steals united states navy research drone in international waters rips it out of water and takes it to china in unprecedented act .
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) december 17 , 2016for some reason , donald trump is trying to pick a fight with china , which would be disastrous for our economy and national security if he ever pissed china off enough to provoke them into retaliating.anyway , china has announced that they are going to give our drone back to us , but that not good enough for trump anymore.whether drunk or sleep deprived , trump posted another tweet telling china not to bother giving it back and told them they should just keep the drone , which contradicts the united states government request that china give it back.we should tell china that we don t want the drone they stole back.- let them keep it !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) december 18 , 2016seriously , trump just doesn t know when to keep his mouth shut.but some twitter users were quick to mock him for his idiocy .. @ realdonaldtrump a ) complain ab the drone b ) get drone back c ) complain they gave it back d ) complete tantrum with punctuation error isaac saul ( @ ike_saul ) december 18 , 2016he s a damn child .

andrew w chamings ( @ andrewchamings ) december 18 , 2016donald trump is too unstable to be president .
clearly , he is desperately trying to distract us from the fact that he is illegitimate because russia helped him steal the election .
now he s trying to start a war with china , the most populous nation on earth .
someone needs to take trump s phone away before he starts a fight he can t finish.featured image : steve pope/getty images
