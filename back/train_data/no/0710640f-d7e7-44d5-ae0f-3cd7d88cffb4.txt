as a poll challenger who has witnessed unbelievable blatant voter fraud by democrats , i can only imagine what this poll worker might have done to cross this democrat chairman.the chairman of the essex county democratic committee in new jersey is accused of punching a blind army veteran following an argument at a polling location during east orange s council primary last month.video was released purportedly showing leroy jones punching 75-year-old bill graves , who was volunteering as a poll worker during the incident on primary day , june 2 .
i hear this rumbling , where the blank is bill graves ?

mr. graves told a local abc affiliate .
you can see on the tape it was intentional .
the suspect , identified by essex county prosecutors as mr. jones , is seen throwing several punches at mr. graves following what appears to be a heated confrontation.mr .
graves and his friends said mr. jones attacked him because he was backing a political candidate that mr. jones did not support , abc reported.mr .
jones , however , said he was defending his wife , who was also working at the polls .
mr. jones said the veteran got aggressive with his wife during an argument , and she called her husband for help , a local cbs affiliate reported .
this man threatened my wife .
this man assaulted my wife .
this man charged at my wife , mr. jones said.mr .
jones has been charged with simple assault , reports said .
mr. graves was not charged.mr .
graves , who is completely blind in one eye and legally blind in the other , said his vision has gotten worse since the attack .
angry , disgusted , because why should i have to run back and forth to the doctor because someone decided to hit me , he told abc .
