It is now clear why Donald Trump attacked the judge in the case overseeing lawsuits against his now-defunct Trump University.The judge ordered the company s internal sales documents to be released over Trump s objections, and what they have exposed is a business that preyed on people s dreams of wealth and success based on Trump s own image cultivated over the decades using trick language and sales gimmicks right out of the sleaziest boiler room.
The playbooks for the now-defunct business owned by Donald Trump, the presumptive Republican nominee for president, were unsealed Tuesday in a class-action lawsuit by customers who say they were defrauded.
Last Friday, a judge who has earned Trump s scorn sided with attorneys for The Washington Post who argued that the public had a right to know what was previously confidential.The documents outline how employees should guide customers through the roller coaster of emotions once they have expressed interest.
The motivation that they experienced can die quickly as the realities of their daily lives take over.
It is our job to rekindle that motivation to make them once again see the potential of achieving their dream, according to a sales playbook.
The documents show how, rather than a real estate sales course, the Trump University system was designed to push people to pay for ever-increasing levels which they were told would lead to more and more lucrative business.
In fact, as the lawsuits show, many were very unsatisfied with the experience.
Even more damning is the fact that the business doesn t even exist anymore, but is just another scheme that Trump slapped his name on in order to make a quick buck then ran away when it got complicated.Trump was apparently so concerned about the information in the sales documents coming out that he rescheduled the press conference he had to address his failure to give money to veterans groups to the same day the Trump University documents came out.Featured image via Flickr
