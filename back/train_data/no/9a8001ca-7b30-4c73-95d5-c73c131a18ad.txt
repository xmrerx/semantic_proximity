beirut ( reuters ) - russian air strikes killed 21 people in a village on the eastern side of the euphrates river in east syria , the syrian observatory for human rights said on wednesday .
the strikes in deir al-zor province were to support the kurdish-led u.s.-backed syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) fighting islamic state , which had attempted to launch an attack on the town earlier this week , the war monitor said .
russia has been carrying out air strikes in the province mainly in support of the syrian army which , alongside allied shi ite militias , has been waging its own assault against islamic state on the western side of the euphrates .
the separate assaults have advanced along opposite sides of the river , which bisects oil-rich deir al-zor , mostly staying out of each other s way .
the u.s.-led coalition and the russian military have held deconfliction meetings to prevent clashes between them , though the two offensives have sometimes come into conflict .
the observatory also reported on wednesday that the syrian army and its allied forces had finished the presence of islamic state on the western bank of the river .
on sunday , the syrian kurdish ypg militia , which spearheads the sdf , announced it had fully captured deir al-zor s eastern countryside from islamic state with the help of both the u.s.-led coalition and russia .
