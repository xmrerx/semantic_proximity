remember when comedians were funny ?
those were the good ole days , before the cancer that is liberalism exposed their hatred for anyone who doesn t agree with them actor-comedian george lopez sent a message to president donald trump : instead of deporting latinos to make america s streets safer , he should deport the police .
in a post published on his instagram friday , lopez is seen standing next to a caption that reads , the trump administration is deporting latinos to make the streets safer you wan na make the streets safer deport the police .
the former lopez tonight host also said , this is not an indictment of all law enforcement , some still just beat you # gacho # georgelopezonhbo # thewall ( @ momorodriguez # gracias .
lopez s instagram account is now set to private , but an archive of the post can still be found online.the instagram caption caused outrage among many of the comedian s fans .
this is a very irresponsible comment bro .
you have really disappointed me bro , i thought you were better than that , wrote one commenter , who claimed to be a police officer .
not cool @ georgelopez .
i m latina and i ve been pulled over more than enough times for speeding .
all but one cop were nice and respectful , wrote another user .
i realize there are some bad apples in the bunch but your statement puts all cops in the bad bunch category .
please stick to comedy .
you re not that funny when you bring politics into your posts .
another commenter wrote , keep calm george i got two brothers that are police officer .. and we are mexican/americans .. a couple weeks later at a show in phoenix , arizona , the comedian led a crowd in a chant of fuck that puto .
( puto is spanish slang for male whore . )
breitbart newsprior to the general election a tmz interviewer asked comedian and actor george lopez if trump had any chance of winning the election ( 2:20 mark ) .
lopez replied , yeah , sure .
there s enough racists in this country to get him elected it s unfortunate .
lopez then stated that if trump wins , he won t have to worry about immigration , we ll all go back .
lopez of course , chose to remain in the united states of america.feb .
2017 : lopez was just caught on tape making racist comments about black people during one of his comedy stints ( see video below ) .when a woman in the audience objected , lopez went off on an unbelievable , vile rant against her * * * warning * * * strong language * * * there are only two rules in the latino family .
don t marry somebody black , and don t park in front of our house , lopez said during his set , which prompted a woman in the audience to put up her middle finger.in a clip of the incident obtained by tmz , lopez is seen responding to the woman s gesture by calling her a bitch and telling her , sit your f * * king ass down or get the f * * k out .
sit your f * * king ass down , lopez repeated three times .
i m talking , bitch .
you paid to see a show .
sit your ass down .
you can t take a joke , you re in the wrong motherf * * king place .
sit your f * * king ass down or get the f * * k out of here .
you have two choices , he continued .
shut the f * * k up or get the f * * k out .
i ll tell you what .
i ll make the choice for you .
get the f * * k out of here .
i ll make the choice for you .
bye .
bye .
bye .
perhaps george lopez and kathy griffen can find one of those jobs americans won t do when nobody will hire the formerly funny comedians
