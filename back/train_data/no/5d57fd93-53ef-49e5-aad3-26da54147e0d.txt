the people of detroit are still fighting the perceived racism from anywhere and everywhere in republican governor snyyder s administration .
the democrats that ran the city into the ground with so much corruption and so many inept officials want the same-old same old back and want emergency managers put in place by snyder to go away .
the latest problem is with the detroit public schools and the water scandal in the city of flint .
here s the take from the detroit news : detroit hundreds of teachers , activists and students gathered wednesday outside cobo center in a combined effort to protest conditions in flint and at detroit public school buildings.the protest outside cobo came hours before president barack obama s scheduled visit to the north american international auto show inside the building .

it s about ( darnell ) earley , who was the emergency manager in flint when they switched their water over , and now he s being charged with looking over detroit public schools .
we re building toward a city-wide strike to restore the rights of the people of detroit now , and to get rid of the ( dps ) emergency manager , he said .
