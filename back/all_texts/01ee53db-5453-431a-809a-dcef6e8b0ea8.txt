(Reuters) - Former Democratic Senator and Indiana Governor Evan Bayh announced on Wednesday that he will come out of retirement to run for the U.S. Senate, a move that could determine whether Democrats can take control of the upper chamber in November.
“With the challenges facing Indiana and our country, I can no longer sit on the sidelines and watch as partisan bickering grinds Washington to a halt,” Bayh said in a statement announcing his candidacy.
Bayh served two terms in the Senate before announcing his retirement in 2010.
He has maintained a campaign account with more than $9.2 million cash on hand.
The Republican candidate, Todd Young, has a campaign account with more than $1 million.
Fellow Democrat Baron Hill cleared the way for Bayh to run on Monday when he announced that he was leaving the Senate race.
The Democratic Party needs a net gain of four Senate seats to take control of the 100-member chamber in the Nov. 8 election.
