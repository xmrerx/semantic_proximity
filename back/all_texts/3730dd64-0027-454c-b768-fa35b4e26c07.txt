Senator Al Franken tried his best to grandstand and corner Jeff Sessions in testimony on the Hill today.
Sessions came back reading exact quotes of what he said in past testimony destroying Franken s attempts to mischaracterize his testimony.
Sessions did a masterful job of shutting down Franken who twisted Sessions words like all lying Democrats have done.
Sessions called him out on it by insisting on having a chance to refute Franken s comments: Mr. Chairman, I do not have to sit in here and listen to his charges without having a chance to respond.
Give me a break, Fox News reported:Attorney General Jeff Sessions publicly and repeatedly clashed with Democratic Sen. Al Franken on Wednesday after being pressed over the accuracy of past testimony regarding his communications with the Russians during the 2016 presidential campaign.In one of several testy exchanges Sessions had with Democratic senators during testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee, Franken, D-Minn., grilled the attorney general and suggested his explanations have changed.
The goal post has been moved.
First it was I did not have communications with Russians which was not true.
Then it was I never met with Russians to discuss any political campaign which may or may not be true.
Now it is I did not discuss interference in the campaign which further narrows your initial blanket denial about meeting with the Russians, Franken said.A visibly frustrated Sessions responded that, Without hesitation, I conducted no improper discussions with Russians at any time regarding a campaign or any other item facing this country.
Franken attempted to begin a second round of questioning before Sessions could respond in full to the first, but Sessions fired back.
Mr. Chairman, I do not have to sit in here and listen to his charges without having a chance to respond.
Give me a break, Sessions said, noting that Franken s lead in to his questioning was very, very troubling, and that he needed more time to respond.
