PARIS (Reuters) - France is considering whether to host a meeting of the International Lebanon Support Group to discuss the political crisis in the country, a French presidential source said on Saturday.
The source said there was no decision yet on whether it would take place or whether it would be a ministerial meeting.
The group includes Britain, China, France, Russia and the United States - the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
