london ( reuters ) - the british government will grant lawmakers more oversight of the process of severing ties with the european union , a spokesman for prime minister theresa may said on monday .
the concession , designed to head off a potential rebellion in parliament , will be incorporated into the eu withdrawal bill - the legislation that forms a central plank of may s brexit strategy .
several lawmakers , including members of the governing conservative party , have challenged her administration over its plans to copy and paste eu rules into british legislation , saying they give ministers power to change laws without the agreement of parliament .
to address these concerns , a committee of lawmakers has proposed adding an extra layer of parliamentary scrutiny of such changes .
we have studied the procedure committee s report in detail and listened to the representations , and we are announcing today that we will be accepting this amendment , the spokesman told reporters .
the plan is to create a sifting committee to look at each of the proposed changes as they are published by the government and recommend how they are then approved by parliament .
although all changes will receive parliamentary approval , some can be recommended for more detailed scrutiny .
the transfer of eu law into british law is designed to give businesses legal certainty after britain s departure in march 2019 .
parliament has described is as one of the largest legislative projects ever undertaken in the uk .
