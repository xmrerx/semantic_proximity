brussels ( reuters ) - the belgian trial of a key suspect in the november 2015 islamic state attack on paris was postponed on monday for seven weeks , after saleh abdeslam s newly appointed lawyer asked for more time to study the case .
granting the request , the judge set a new trial date of feb. 5 .
a french national but a lifelong brussels resident , abdeslam fled back to belgium after the attacks in paris that killed 130 people , hiding from police for four months before being detained in march last year .
four days later , on march 22 , 2016 , brussels was hit by twin bomb attacks that killed 32 people .
investigators believe that those behind the paris and brussels suicide attacks were linked and that abdeslam , whose elder brother blew himself up at a paris cafe on nov. 13 , 2015 , is one of the few surviving participants .
held facing trial in france , he will be transferred to belgium to first stand trial there , with an alleged accomplice , for attempted murder as abdeslam evaded capture during a shootout with brussels police three days before his arrest .
abdeslam , who was not in court on monday , appointed a new lawyer only last week and his counsel asked for more time to prepare the defense .
