Police say Keith Lamont Scott had a gun.
Scott s family says he was just reading a book.But it doesn t matter what the facts are, racists are not only happy that another black man is dead, but theyalso want police to kill all of the people protesting the shooting.Protests broke out in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesday night and, as usual, Fox News went to great lengths to portray the protest as a full scale riot and that sent racists into a hateful frenzy on Twitter.FOX NEWS ALERT: At least 12 Charlotte officers injured in latest anti-police protests (via @HuntsmanAbby) pic.twitter.com/TW0wmvSSNM FOX & Friends (@foxandfriends) September 21, 2016And here are some of the worst remarks.

Tensions are already high enough as it is.
Adding this kind of racism to the mix won t help settle things down.Featured image via screen capture
