(Reuters) - More than 4 million homes and businesses have lost power in Florida, major utilities said on Sunday, as Hurricane Irma pummeled the state.
Most outages were in Florida Power & Light s service area in the southern and eastern parts of the state.
FPL, the state s biggest power company, said more than 3.3 million of its customers were without service.
As the storm moved up the coast, Duke Energy s outages steadily climbed.
Irma hit Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale.
It weakened as it moved up the state s west coast and by late evening, it was a Category 2 with maximum sustained winds of 105 miles per hour (169 kph).
FPL is a unit of NextEra Energy Inc (NEE.N).
Other big power utilities in Florida are units of Duke Energy Corp (DUK.N), Southern Co (SO.N) and Emera Inc (EMA.TO).
