sexist expect
surprising though bad
average u woman pay 79 every dollar men pay even work
trump pay woman work campaign 65 every dollar male staffer makenow make argument necessarily know female staffer versus male staffer
possibility people would say men get pay hold higher difficult position work hour better work general abovethat still blatantly sexistfor april woman trump staff earn 4500 men earn 6100
35 percent difference egregious even
supposedly believe equal pay say complicate issue legislation
