In case you are unaware (because Donald Trump is), the President-elect lost the popular vote by almost three million votes, and he is 27th on the all-time list of electoral college votes received by an individual.
In terms of popularity, he s the most hated man to ever find himself bumbling into the Oval Office in at least two decades.
In fact, he is near dead last in a list of popular votes by percentage of population among those who have been elected.Trump is oblivious to reality, immensely stupid, or an unabashed liar or all of the above because he seems determined to convince the world that he actually won in a (what did he call it?)
massive landslide.
Donald Trump may be our next President, but the truth is that the majority of Americans hate him.
On New Years Eve, he decided to let those people know what he thinks of them, wishing a sarcastic Happy New Year to his many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don t know what to do.
Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do.
Love!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2016Naturally, Americans don t like their incoming President calling them his enemies.
Not.
A.
Popular.

@realDonaldTrump Oh sweetheart I know you think this makes you look brave, but you need to stop fixating!
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) December 31, 2016@realDonaldTrump Okay.
Donald.
Now our imaginations are running wild.
Does Vladimir have video of you borking an underage kangaroo?
Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) December 31, 2016Also, @realDonaldTrump: in the popular vote, who was it again who "lost so badly"?

Maybe a new year's resolution for you Donny boy.
Anthony Domanico (@ajdomanico) December 31, 2016@realDonaldTrump we know what to do.
It's called impeachment.
I'd suggest you look it up, but you clearly don't know how to read.

@realDonaldTrump The American people are not your "enemies."
Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 31, 2016@realDonaldTrump it is sad it's always zero sum with you.
Winners, losers.
Kinda dumb really.
Not the way to unite a nation, that's for sure Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) December 31, 2016@realDonaldTrump We know what to do: Whatever it takes to remove you from office in 2017.
Happy New Year.

Doing anything special?
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) December 31, 2016@realDonaldTrump By "lost so badly", you mean the 2.8 million popular vote margin you LOST by, correct?
Tom Shafer (@TomShafShafer) December 31, 2016Trump may consider most Americans his enemies, but you know who he thinks of as a friend (best friend if you read through his old tweets)?
That s right Vladimir Putin, a man who slaughters journalists and gay people, and who personally oversaw an operation that involved hacking The Donald s political enemies and helping to swing the election in his favor, effectively installing a tiny-handed, orange-faced puppet in the Oval Office.
Trump loves that guy so much that Putin is waiting on a sensitive diplomatic issue (the United States expelling suspected Russian spies) until Trump is in office, in expectation of a more favorable result.Happy New Year to you too, you traitor!Featured image via Getty Images (Scott Olson)/screengrab
