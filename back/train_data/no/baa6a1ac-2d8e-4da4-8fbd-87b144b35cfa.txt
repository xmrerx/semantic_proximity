to be honest with you what donald trump is saying is factual .
again he may not address it in a manner that makes everyone happy but donald trump is being donald trump .
that speaking from the heart and not being politically correct but really just getting the truth out there .
under hillary clinton black lives really don t matter , black votes matter .
