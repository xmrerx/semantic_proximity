washington ( reuters ) - energy firm florida power & light ( fpl ) said on wednesday it could shut its four nuclear reactors in the path of hurricane irma before saturday if the storm stayed on its current path .
based on the current track , we would expect severe weather in florida starting saturday , meaning we would potentially shut down before that point , spokesman peter robbins said in an email .
the company , a subsidiary of nextera energy inc , is watching the weather and would adjust any plans as necessary , robbins said .
the trajectory of irma , a category 5 storm with winds of 185 miles per hour ( 295 km per hour ) , is uncertain .
irma , which the u.s. national hurricane center said was the strongest atlantic storm on record , was expected to pass near or just north of puerto rico on wednesday before scraping the dominican republic on thursday .
fpl operates the st. lucie nuclear power plant on hutchinson island , a barrier island on the atlantic about 55 miles ( 88 km ) north of west palm beach .
two reactors generate 2,000 megawatts of electricity , enough power to supply more than 1 million homes .
it also operates turkey point nuclear power station on biscayne bay , about 24 miles south of miami .
that has two reactors that generate about 1,600 megawatts of electricity , or enough for about 900,000 homes .
robbins said the plants were designed to withstand extreme natural events including hurricanes and serious floods .
