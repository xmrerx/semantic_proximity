Despite promising to release his tax returns all throughout his presidential campaign, Donald Trump still refuses to make good on his promise to concerned Americans.
Instead, he s gotten his lawyers to make a statement about the last ten years of his tax returns, and it went pretty much exactly how we thought it would it was a disaster.Raising more questions than they actually answered, Trump s lawyers told reporters that Trump s tax returns don t reflect any income of any type from Russian sources, however there are a few exceptions.
According to the Associated Press, Trump s lawyers sent a letter stating that the dishonest, shady POTUS didn t owe any money to Russian lenders and had no equity investment by Russians in entities controlled by Trump.
Of course, these lawyers didn t provide any copies of the tax returns to verify this, so it s very possible that this information is false.
However, the letter did state that Trump received income from the 2013 Miss Universe pageant held in Moscow and a property sold to a Russian billionaire in 2008 for $95 million.
Anyone with a decent brain can see how shady and weird this whole situation is, and it wasn t long before Twitter latched on to the statement with a few exceptions and made the hashtag #WithFewExceptions go viral.
People didn t hesitate to drag Trump and his lawyers for their disgraceful scheme to clear his name, even though they ve clearly stated that he s guilty as hell.Here are some of the best reactions: We could not have said it better.
The lengths that Trump and his team have gone to continue hiding what is in his tax returns should be cause for alarm.
Not to mention, Trump s erratic behavior whenever Russia is mentioned.
Something shady is definitely going on, and no one should believe anything that comes out of the mouth of Trump, his administration, or anyone he hires.Featured image via Mario Tama / Getty Images
