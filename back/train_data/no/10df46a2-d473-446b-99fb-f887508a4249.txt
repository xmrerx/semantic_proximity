washington ( reuters ) - u.s. debt held by the public will balloon to 150 percent of economic output by 2047 unless tax and spending laws are changed , the congressional budget office said on thursday , far exceeding the record level just after world war ii .
the new projections show steeper 30-year debt growth than last year ’ s long-term forecast by the non-partisan budget analysis agency , and could make it harder for some members of congress to support a tax reform plan that is partly financed with higher deficits .
last year , the cbo estimated u.s. public debt would grow to 141 percent of gross domestic product by 2046 , while the record was 106 percent of gdp in 1946 .
that level would be reached in 2035 , the cbo said .
under this year ’ s projection , cbo predicts public debt for 2017 to be about 77 percent of gdp , growing to 89 percent in 2027 , and 113 percent in 2037 .
the new forecasts assume that the affordable care act , the healthcare law known as obamacare that house republicans failed to replace last week , stays in place for the long term .
the projected debt growth reflects cbo ’ s estimates of the rising costs of caring for a growing population of people over 65 , growth in interest costs , and assumptions of slower economic growth due to reduced assumptions about productivity gains .
annual deficits are expected to average 8.6 percent of gdp in the 2038-2047 period versus 2.9 percent expected for 2017 and 4.0 percent for the 2018-2027 period .
the long-term projections extend cbo ’ s assumptions made in its 10-year budget outlook in january , which showed falling deficits for the next two years , but growth thereafter .
net interest costs in 2047 are expected to be 6.2 percent of gdp , compared with 1.4 percent in 2017 and about 1.2 percent in 1967 , the cbo said .
but the wild card in the cbo 30-year projections are real interest rates .
real interest yields on 10-year treasury notes are assumed to average 1.5 percent over 30 years , rising to 2.3 percent in 2047 .
much higher interest rates , coupled with different assumptions in productivity and healthcare cost growth , could produce significantly different outcomes , cbo said .
the cbo said that its debt-to-gdp ratio could range from 85 percent with low rates and strong growth , to 244 percent with weaker growth and higher rates .
