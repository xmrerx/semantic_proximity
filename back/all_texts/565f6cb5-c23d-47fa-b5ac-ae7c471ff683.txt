Donald Trump sat down for an interview with on CBS Face the Nation, where the Republican presidential primary front-runner fully embraced torture as a tool to fight terrorism.
During the interview, Trump repeatedly used the racist term savages.
Before that, though, Trump described himself as a great unifier of the people, saying: I mean, I get along with people.
I m a unifier.
I m very much a unifier, Trump told host John Dickerson.
And maybe people don t see that.
But they will see that.
We re not playing by we are playing by rules, but they have no rules.
It s very hard to win when that s the case, Trump said.
Isn t that what separates us from the savages?
Dickerson asks in response.
No, we have to beat the savages, Trump replied.
Obviously, all you have to do is take a look at what s going on.
And they re getting worse.
They re chopping, chopping, chopping, and we re worried about waterboarding.
I just think it s I think our priorities are mixed up.
Trump insisted that he would only advocate torture that is permitted under the law in the United States.
Then, like any good potential dictator, he said that laws regarding torture must be expanded.
We have to play the game the way they re playing the game.
You re not going to win if we re soft and they re, they have no rules.
Now, I want to stay within the laws.
I want to do all of that, but I think we have to increase the laws because the laws are not working, Trump said.This interview shows that he is trying to appeal to the most barbaric bloc of Republican voters.
The type of people who would gladly have the president drop a few nuclear bombs on civilian populations in the middle east.Torture does not work.
If Trump had any actual understanding of intelligence gathering, he would know that.
However, Trump and his followers appear to be impervious to facts, so it isn t all too surprising that they would advocate such tactics.You can watch the interview in full below.Featured image from video screenshot
