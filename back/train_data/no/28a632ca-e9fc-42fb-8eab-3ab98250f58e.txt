bill aukenthe day after us warships rained some 60 tomahawk missiles on a syrian government airbase , us officials made it clear that this unilateral and criminal attack against an oppressed former colonial country is merely the first shot in what is to be an escalating and widening campaign of american military aggression.the governor of syria s central homs province reported friday that the missiles killed at least 15 people , including nine civilians .
four of the dead were children .
many more civilians were injured by two of the missiles , which struck nearby villages .
six of the dead were syrian personnel at the al-shairat airbase.the missile strike was the first time that washington has carried out a direct military attack against syrian government forces since the us and its regional allies orchestrated a war for regime change utilizing al qaeda-linked islamist rebels as its proxy ground troops .
the attack on the airbase is a direct intervention in that war on the side of the al qaeda elements.russian prime minister medvedev warned on friday that the immensely reckless action had brought washington to the verge of a military clash with nuclear-armed russia , which had an air unit at the base struck by american missiles.washington seized on an alleged incident tuesday involving chemical weapons in the village of khan sheikhoun in idlib province as the pretext for thursday night s attack .
syria has denied any use of such weapons , and washington and its allies have presented no evidence to support their allegations in relation to the incident , which has all the earmarks of a provocation staged by the cia and its islamist proxies.the russian government and others have pointed out the obvious fact that the elaborate attack carried out thursday night from two us destroyers in the eastern mediterranean had to have been planned well before the alleged incident even happened .
the event was staged , with al qaeda-linked and us-funded media activists conveniently on hand to film it , in order to provide washington with the propaganda pretext it required for its aggression.in a heated exchange in the united nations security council friday , us ambassador nikki haley brushed aside denunciations by other diplomats that the unilateral us action was a gross violation of the un charter and international law , instead provocatively insisting that us imperialism is prepared to the do the same thing again and far more .
the united states took a very measured step last night , haley said .
we are prepared to do more , but we hope that will not be necessary .
knowing full well that the us attack was imminent , haley , who is acting as the council s rotating president for the month of april , postponed a vote on a compromise resolution calling for an objective investigation into the alleged chemical attack that was being drafted thursday by the 10 nonpermanent members of the security council.washington has no interest in such a probe , which would almost certainly reveal that the source of any chemical weapons incident was not the government of president bashar al-assad , but rather the al qaeda elements that control that area of idlib province .
there is also no doubt that the us strike provides the islamist elements in syria with every motivation for staging more chemical weapons incidents to provide the pretext for a spiraling escalation of us military aggression.the un security council session was convened at the request of bolivia , russia and syria .
bolivian ambassador sacha llorenti began the debate with a blistering denunciation of the us attack , declaring that the us officials believe that they are investigators , they are attorneys , judges and they are the executioners .
he called the us strike an extremely serious violation of international law , while stressing that this was not the first time .
llorenti held up a picture of then secretary of state colin powell delivering his february 5 , 2003 speech to the same un council insisting that washington had irrefutable proof of nonexistent weapons of mass destruction , the notorious pretext for the us invasion barely a month later.this war based upon lies , the bolivian envoy added , resulted in a million deaths and a series of atrocities throughout the middle east.llorenti denounced washington for its double standard , invoking human rights , democracy and multilateralism only when it serves its own strategic interests .
he recalled the series of military coups orchestrated by the cia in latin america and the pentagon s training of latin american security forces in the art of torture.russia s deputy permanent representative to the united nations , vladimir safronkov , similarly condemned the us bombardment as a flagrant violation of international law , warning that the consequences for regional and international stability can be extremely serious .
safronkov charged that washington had acted deliberately to derail any independent and unbiased investigation into the alleged april 4 incident in of khan sheikhoun .
you were afraid of it , he said , as its results might wreck your anti-regime paradigm .
the russian ambassador ridiculed the performance given earlier by us ambassador haley in which she held up the photographs of two syrian children and demanded , how many more children have to die before russia cares ?
i will not stage a cynical show and hold up photographs , he said , but asked why there was no such concern for the children of mosul , where a single us bombing raid killed over 300 civilians , most of them women and children , last month .
thousands more have been killed and injured in us airstrikes carried out in both iraq and syria.continue reading at wswsread more white helmet news at : 21st century wire white helmet filessupport our work by subscribing & becoming a member @ 21wire.tv
