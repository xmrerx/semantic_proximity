Bernie Sanders is not one to mince words when it comes to Donald Trump.
He has consistently denounced Trump s rhetoric and has warned of the ramifications of both Trump s statements and actions.
Sanders was recently asked about Trump s disturbing ideas about Muslims at a campaign rally and this time, he responded by invoking the Holocaust.
Sanders said: You know I m Jewish.
My father came to this country at the age of 17 from Poland.
He came over.
Other people in his family did not come over.
Those people died.
Children died, relatives of my father.
That is in my heart to see what a lunatic can do bringing up racial hatred and we re not going to allow that to take place in this country.
Sanders made the statement during the rally after a Muslim American woman echoed fears about the growing Islamophobia in this country.
The woman talked about how scared her young son is in today s anti-Muslim environment.
Sanders said: I m going to do everything that I can to stop those Islamophobic attacks so that kids in this country who happen to be Muslim aren t afraid.
Unfortunately, it s not just Donald Trump who has raised the specter of racism and fear.
Ted Cruz has also called for police patrols of Muslim-American neighborhoods after the attacks in Belgium so the rampant racism isn t exclusive to the demagogue Donald Trump, but it s infested the Republican party, which is need of some serious reforms if it is going to stay relevant, although it s been quite joyous to watch the party implode.Sanders, who has ignited an enthusiasm on the part of voters not seen in decades, continues to do do very well in his bid for the Democratic nomination for the presidency.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3k9C5fK6q4] Featured image via video screenshot.
