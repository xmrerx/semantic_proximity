President Trump is once again proving that he will be running the White House in a vastly different manner than his predecessor.For the past several years Barack Obama welcomed ESPN to the White House to fill out the NCAA tournament bracket.
The news called this Baracketology.
The Sports network reached out to the Trump staff, asking if the president would be continuing the tradition, but according to The Washington Post, the offer was declined.
We expressed our interest to the White House in continuing the presidential bracket.
They have respectfully declined, an ESPN spokesman said in a statement.Unfortunately, this tweet might be correct, Baracketology may be the best thing Obama did while in office.the best thing Barack Obama did in his 8 years.
