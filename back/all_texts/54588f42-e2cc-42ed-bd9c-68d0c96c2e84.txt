After signing a multi-million dollar book deal with Penguin Random House alongside his wife, Michelle, the former president is now set to write his memoir while staying on the exclusive island of Tetiaroa, the Washington Post reported.
The island is part of the Society Islands in French Polynesia and is an atoll composed of a dozen small islands surrounding a lagoon about 30 miles northeast of Tahiti.
It once served as a summer residence for former chiefs and kings of Tahiti until Brando purchased it in 1967 after falling in love with its beauty while filming Mutiny on the Bounty in 1962 on the nearby islands of Tahiti and Moorea.It s unclear if the former president will be joined by his wife during his stay on the island or exactly when he plans to travel back to Tetiaroa.Read more: Daily Mail
