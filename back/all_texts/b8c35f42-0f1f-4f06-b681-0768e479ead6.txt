BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Demonstrators, some carrying clubs, stormed the Iraqi Kurdistan parliament building in Erbil on Sunday, angry at the decision of Masoud Barzani to step down from the presidency of the region, witnesses said.
Gunshots were heard as protesters who claimed they were Peshmerga Kurdish fighters forced their way inside the building, they said.
