washington ( reuters ) - the draft bill introduced in the u.s. congress on tuesday to steer puerto rico through its economic crisis represents a constructive , good-faith effort but could be improved , the white house said on wednesday .
at a daily briefing , white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters the bill would benefit from improvements to a mechanism to boost oversight of puerto rico â€™ s government and by expanding the earned income tax credit .
( this story corrects to say improvements to pre-existing mechanism needed , not the bill , in paragraph 2 )
