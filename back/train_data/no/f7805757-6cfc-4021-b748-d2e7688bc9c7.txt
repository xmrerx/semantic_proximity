gaza ( reuters ) - two palestinian islamic jihad militants riding on a motorcycle in gaza were killed in an explosion on tuesday which the group implied was caused by an accidental detonation during preparations for an attack .
israel s military denied accounts by local residents that the militants were killed in an air strike .
violence along the israel-gaza border has flared since u.s. president donald trump s recognition last week of jerusalem as israel s capital and the israeli military s demolition on sunday of a cross-border tunnel it said was dug by hamas , the islamist group that controls the small coastal enclave .
on monday , israel s iron dome anti-missile system intercepted a rocket fired by militants in gaza .
shortly afterward , israel responded with tank fire and air strikes targeting positions of hamas .
in a statement after tuesday s explosion , islamic jihad said : we mourn the men - martyrs of preparation .
the group usually employs the term to refer to casualties caused by the accidental detonation of weapons or explosives used in attacks against israel .
