YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar and Bangladesh signed a memorandum of understanding on Thursday, a senior Myanmar official told Reuters, for the return home of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya refugees who fled to the neighboring country to escape a Myanmar army crackdown.
We are ready to take them back as soon as possible after Bangladesh sends the forms back to us, said Myint Kyaing, a permanent secretary at Myanmar s ministry of labor, immigration and population, referring to registration forms the Rohingya must complete with personal details before repatriation.
