donald trump junior was attending a rally when a heckler yelled out a question : protester : what about your dad s taxes ?
i want to see his taxes ! donald jr. : oh , i don t know .
i think rachel maddow released something that showed he made $ 150 million bucks and paid $ 45 million in taxes .
i think the ones that were released showed he paid a much higher percentage in tax than bernie sanders and barack obama .
and made a lot of money in the process .
so guess what ?
you can do it all !
you can be successful .
you can pay your taxes .
and i think that s what he did .
so i really appreciate it .
thank you for the intro to that because i wouldn t have gone there.kfbb.com news , sports and weathergreat answer !
