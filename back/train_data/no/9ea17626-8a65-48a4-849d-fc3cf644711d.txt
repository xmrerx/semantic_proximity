pelosi claims to have not had a meeting with the russian ambassador : pelosi with the ambassador in 2010 : pelosi had her spokesperson make a statement after twitter comments about the photo came out : leader pelosi s answer to the question today was clearly about private , one-on-one meetings , which she has never had with ambassador kislyak , hammill said .
the ambassador was incidental to the 2010 meeting between then-russian president medvedev and then-speaker pelosi .
clearly , one needs to remind politico that attorney general sessions lied under oath about a secret meeting amidst russia s hacking of our election , which he also didn t disclose in a written questionnaire .
