santiago ( reuters ) - center-left lawmakers in chile pledged on wednesday to unify and support a single candidate in any eventual runoff against conservative candidate sebastian pinera , who is leading in polls for this year s presidential race .
while pinera has consolidated support among the country s political right , six left-of-center candidates will be competing in the nov. 19 first round vote , amid fissures within socialist president michelle bachelet s coalition and the emergence of new left-wing leaders .
polls show pinera , a wealthy businessman who previously governed chile between 2010 and 2014 , has around 40 percent of voter intentions .
that would not be enough to win an absolute majority in the first round .
a december runoff is expected to be closer , meaning the left s ability to unite around a single candidate could be critical .
after the first round in which each of us will give our best effort for the candidate we most support , we promise that in the second round we will support the candidate that represents the forces of the left and center-left , some 300 politicians said on wednesday in a letter .
senator alejandro guillier , an ally of bachelet who is polling second , has previously said he would seek links with other progressive candidates to ultimately defeat pinera .
bachelet is constitutionally prohibited from seeking a second consecutive term .
the christian democrat party , a large centrist and socially conservative party that is putting forward its own candidate , has been hesitant to pledge unity to date , following deep divisions with the governing nueva mayoria bloc over elements of bachelet s policies in recent months .
but one of the party s lawmakers said on wednesday that it would support the best-performing nueva mayoria candidate .
the night of the 19th we are going to get behind the candidate who moves on to the second round , christian democrat congresswoman yasna provoste told journalists on wednesday .
