Thursday night marked the seventh GOP debate of this presidential election season.
Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton decided to take the opportunity to remind us all just what a GOP win in 2016 would mean for the country.
She took to her twitter account to make sure everyone knew not to be fooled by any seemingly rational statements made by the clowns on stage.First the former Secretary of State blasted the misogynist men and their equally misogynist policies:Here you go, @JebBush: https://t.co/CNTHWnBzMs #GOPDebate Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016With every Republican attacking safe and legal abortion, women need more than an ally in the White House: We need a fighter.
#ImWithHer Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016Reproductive rights are human rights.
Women not any of the politicians on stage should make decisions about their own health.

So is anyone who would protect DACA and DAPA.

#GOPdebate Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016And of course, she rightfully condemned the Islamophobia that GOPers are so well-known for:Muslim Americans: This is your country, too.
Islamophobic rhetoric isn't a tool against terrorism and it has no place in America.

You re out of luck at the #GOPdebate.

#GOPdebate Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016Of course, she had to mention Trump s absence, but reminded us all that his horrible ideas were still there, with the other equally regressive candidates:Donald Trump isn't on stage at the #GOPdebate but you can bet the same backwards ideas and out-of-touch rhetoric will be out in force.
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) January 29, 2016In the end, this fabulous woman just straight out insulted them.#GOPdebate: Lots of bickering, no real plans to strengthen families or keep us safe.

All in all, this is a very important message.
We need to remember what is at stake if we do not vote blue in 2016.
