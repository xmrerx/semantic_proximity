So who does Canada believe is the actual victim is here?Have you seen the cover of the new Maclean s magazine?
That s Rinelle Harper sitting down she s the Aboriginal woman who was attacked and left for dead in Winnipeg.She became a symbol for racist violence against Aboriginal women though her alleged attacker was himself Aboriginal.That girl on the right is Amanda Lindhout.
She was a waitress who decided she wanted to be a war reporter in Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia; she was kidnapped by Muslim terrorists and tortured and raped repeatedly.So you ve got two innocent women who were brutalized by violence and would never hurt a fly.And then you ve got Omar Khadr standing behind them, with a huge grin on his face.Omar Khadr is a confessed, convicted Al Qaida terrorist.
He plead guilty to five charges of war crimes.
He murdered Sgt.
Christopher Speer, leaving Tabitha Speer a widow, and their two children, Taryn and Tanner, fatherless.Omar Khadr has never renounced Al Qaida or said that he regrets what he did.Here s how Maclean s describes him, though: Omar Khadr was imprisoned in Guantanamo, captured in 2002 by American forces in Afghanistan and charged with war crimes.
So, no mention of the murder he confessed to or his conviction for war crimes.Would Maclean s magazine put a smiling, chatty Paul Bernardo on their cover, and say, he s suffered so deeply in prison all because he was charged with crimes.
Both are pathological murderers.
Why the celebrity treatment?This isn t journalism.This is propaganda.Via: The Rebelh/t Weasel Zippers
