It s pretty much common knowledge at this point that Republican presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz wasn t born in the United States.
In fact, he was born in Calgary, Alberta, Canada in 1970 to a Cuban immigrant.
Now, people have been saying that since Cruz s mother was an American citizen, this automatically makes the senator a citizen as well.
However, as Talking Points Memo has pointed out, Cruz s mom was eligible to vote in Canada, thus making it seem as though she was a Canadian citizen at some point.The entire scenario of Cruz being born in Canada and being considered a natural-born citizen as the Constitution stipulates has been a bit of a gray area for some time now.
While some say it s a closed issue, others say he s not eligible to run due to the true nature of natural-born meant as defined by the Founding Fathers.While all of this is still being discussed at great length, one person has come up with a pretty damn valid theory as to why so many think Cruz is a natural-born American.
Bette Midler took to Twitter to pose a very good question.
She asked: Are people ignoring the fact that Ted Cruz isn t a natural-born American because it s impossible to believe such a jackass came from Canada?

Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) February 1, 2016This could be entirely true.
Canadians are generally very kind-natured and not at all known to be the slimy, bigoted narcissists that Ted Cruz most definitely is.
After all, we re stuck with Justin Bieber, too.Since no one has come to a definitive conclusion regarding Cruz s citizenship status, Midler s theory holds as much weight as anything else.
Very good question indeed.
