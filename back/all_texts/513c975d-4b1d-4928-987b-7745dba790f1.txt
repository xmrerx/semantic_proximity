What a classy move by the Democrats In an attempt to get the ghetto rats interested in the election and back on the reservation for Hillary, Calvin Broadus , aka Snoop Dogg s latest act will be to bring together the Democratic Party.

Dogg announced that he would be supporting Hillary Clinton less than a month after she declared her candidacy in May 2015.
You know I like to be politically correct, but sometimes I m politically incorrect.
Watch What Happens Live.
But I ll say that I would love to see bitches a woman in office because I feel like we re at that stage in life to where we need a perspective other than the male s train of thought.
And just to have bitches a woman speaking from a global perspective as far as representing America, I d love to see that.
So I ll be voting for da bitch Ms. Clinton.
The groups also announced that the Grammy-winning group Los Lobos will perform.
And I would imagine a heavy presence of Police and Emergency Medical personal will also be in attendance.Via: DMF
