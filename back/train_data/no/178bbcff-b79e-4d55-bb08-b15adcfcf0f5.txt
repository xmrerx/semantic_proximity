sydney ( reuters ) - australia s high court on friday said nationalist politician and senator malcolm roberts was a citizen of britain at the time of his nomination to parliament s upper house .
australia s parliament has been rocked by revelations that seven politicians , three ministers among them , are dual citizens , potentially ruling them ineligible to hold elected office .
friday s ruling means that the parliamentary fate of roberts , like that of his counterparts with dual citizenships at the time of their election , will be decided next month by the high court .
even if the one nation senator is forced to step down , however , the ruling coalition will be unaffected , since the government does not control the senate .
i find that senator roberts was a citizen of the united kingdom by descent at the time of his nomination , justice patrick keane said in his findings on the high court website .
reuters telephone calls to roberts to seek comment went unanswered .
a 116-year-old law requires elected lawmakers to hold only australian citizenship .
but some politicians have discovered they hold dual citizenship by descent from a father born in another country , with a few born overseas , while one prominent lawmaker has said his mother obtained italian citizenship on his behalf .
