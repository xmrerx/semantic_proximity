WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mexico’s economy minister on Wednesday said the first day of talks to rewrite a trade pact between the United States, Mexico and Canada produced no surprises and the three sides did not yield any ground on their positions.
“I think it’s too soon to have the aspiration of narrowing, on the first day of negotiations, the differences that we obviously have,” Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo told reporters.
