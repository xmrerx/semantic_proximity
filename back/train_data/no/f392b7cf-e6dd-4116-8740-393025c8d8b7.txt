sen. bernie sanders ( i. , vt. ) could not say on wednesday where he got the information that thousands will die if obamacare is repealed.sanders made the claim while speaking with cnn s jake tapper but could not provide any specific sources that backed his assertion , instead referring to studies that have been done .
you ve said if this repeal and replace plan goes forward that thousands of americans will die , tapper said to sanders .
where do you get that estimate from ?
i get that estimate from the fact that studies have been done that people who do not have health insurance , who do not go to the doctor when they should , who do not go to the hospital when they need to go , in fact die , sanders said .
and thousands of people die every year because they don t have health insurance .
and if you throw 24 million people off of health insurance , there is no doubt that many thousands of people will die .
jake tapper then goes on to ask bernie sanders about the disastrous results of obamacare , making insurance unaffordable for so many americans .
tapper tells sanders , in many states obamacare is in dire straights .
the governor of minnesota , a liberal democrat said the affordable care act is unaffordable .
to his credit , tapper continues with his line of questioning and actually shocks sanders when he asks him , don t the democrats own this bill that in so many states is failing ?
no , i think what the american , look , what you re saying is true , sanders replied .
no one , certainly not me , that the affordable care act , obamacare , has many serious problems .
deductibles are too high , premiums are too high , we still have too many people who don t have any health insurance , sanders said .
it s too complicated , it s too bureaucratic .
