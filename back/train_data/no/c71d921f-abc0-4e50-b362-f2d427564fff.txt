manchester , n.h. ( reuters ) - two republican u.s. presidential hopefuls said on saturday they would implement quarantines of travelers if necessary to stop the spread of the zika virus .
new jersey governor chris christie , who garnered international attention in 2014 when he quarantined a nurse who returned to the united states after treating ebola patients , said he would not hesitate to do it again .
“ you bet i would , ” christie said during a debate in new hampshire with other republican contenders for the white house .
ben carson , a retired neurosurgeon , said using a quarantine is “ not a simple issue ” but if there was evidence that zika infection is spreading , he too would utilize a quarantine .
the zika virus is carried by mosquitoes , which transmit it to humans .
two suspected cases of sexual transmission in the united states also raise questions about other ways that zika may spread .
the virus is affecting large parts of latin american and the caribbean .
the world health organization declared the outbreak an international health emergency on feb. 1 , citing a “ strongly suspected ” relationship between zika infection in pregnancy and microcephaly - a condition marked by abnormally small head size that can result in developmental problems .
