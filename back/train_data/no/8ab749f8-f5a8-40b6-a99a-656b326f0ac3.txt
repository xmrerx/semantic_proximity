luxembourg ( reuters ) - the european union banned the sale of oil and oil products to north korea on monday , in a largely symbolic move aimed at encouraging countries that have more significant levels of trade with the country to follow suit .
eu foreign ministers also imposed a blanket ban on doing business with north korea in sanctions that go beyond the latest u.n. measures .
the eu does not sell oil to pyongyang .
following north korea s most powerful nuclear test , the u.n. security council capped north korean imports of crude oil , but china and russia resisted an outright ban .
eu ministers cited the persistent threat to international peace and stability posed by pyongyang .
as part of the measures , north korean workers in the eu - estimated to be about 400 , mainly in poland - now face a lower limit on the amount for money they can send home and their work visas will not be renewed once they expire .
the sanctions add three more top north korean officials and six businesses to a blacklist banning them from travel to the eu and freezing their assets .
that will take the total of those sanctioned by the eu to 41 individuals and 10 companies , a senior eu official said .
u.n. sanctions target 63 people and 53 companies and institutions .
