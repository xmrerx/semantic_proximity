Let s start by saying that abortion in the United States of America is a legal procedure.
However, so many small government conservatives have absolutely no problem inserting themselves into the health and well-being of women put into situations where they and their doctors should be the only ones discussing what s best for them.
Attacking this issue head-on is Last Week Tonight host, John Oliver.Oliver led into the segment saying that he wanted to talk about breast implants, saying: Some are against them, others believe they are fine in rare cases and some think you should be able to get them whenever the f you want.
Oh did I say breast implants?
I meant abortion.
It was then that Oliver delivered the most severe beat down of conservative restrictive policies on abortion likely ever witnessed on television.
It may actually leave you not only angry, but in tears over how horrific so many of these restrictions are.According to TIME: A new Gallup poll revealed that 19% of Americans think abortion should be completely illegal, while 36% think it should be allowed in some cases and 29% think it should be allowed on demand.
Despite the fact that abortion is legal in the United States, in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court s decision in Planned Parenthood v. Casey, there has been an increase in state regulation of abortion clinics, resulting in a decrease in clinics in some states.
North Dakota, South Dakota, Mississippi and Utah now only have one clinic per state.
Oliver s reaction to that is: Yes, Mississippi now has four times as many esses as it has abortion clinics.
These laws are not only restrictive, they are outright dangerous.
There are several cases of women and girls absolutely needed to get an abortion, and when those services are denied because some holier than thou zealots in government think that their way should be the only way, these women and girls will get hurt.
Not only physically, but emotionally.It is outright infuriating to think about young girls being forced to give birth to their rapist s baby.
And if you are in the 19% that thinks these restrictive laws are okay, John Oliver, as well as the rest of everyone who is humane and decent, has a question for you: What the fuck is wrong with you?!
