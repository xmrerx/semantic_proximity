mogadishu ( reuters ) - the government of somali will do all it can to pay salaries and buy equipment for its soldiers as it begins to lose international support , the country s president said on monday .
the statement came several days after reuters reported that the united states was suspending food and fuel aid for most of somalia s armed forces over corruption concerns .
that announcement was a blow to the military , who will begin losing the support of african peacekeepers when they start to withdraw this month .
islamist insurgents are striking with ever-larger and more deadly attacks in the capital and major towns .
i hereby certify that if a thing is halted , as a government we shall put effort five hundred percent so that the suspension does not affect anyone , president mohamed abdullahi mohamed said in an address to military officials at the defense ministry that was broadcast on local radio .
whether it is salary or equipment , the government will bring what it can , he said .
i am telling you that we should depend on ourselves .
we thank the foreigners who were supporting us .
if they mentioned criticism , we are required to rectify .
the president did not mention a specific donor s support , but added : if you have someone who is ready to lend you a hand , you have to avoid things that can bring suspicion .
reuters reported that the u.s. has grown frustrated that successive governments have failed to build a capable national army .
documents seen by reuters paint a stark picture of a military hollowed out by corruption , unable to feed , pay or arm its soldiers , despite hundreds of millions of dollars of support .
