dhaka ( reuters ) - bangladeshi counter-terrorism police said on monday they had arrested an islamist militant wanted for the 2015 killing of a u.s. blogger critical of religious extremism .
the militant , identified as abu siddiq sohel , 34 , a member of the al qaeda-inspired militant group ansar ullah bangla team , is suspected of taking part in the killing of writer avijit roy , deputy police commissioner masudur rahman said .
roy , a u.s. citizen of bangladeshi origin , was hacked to death by machete-wielding attackers in february 2015 while returning home with his wife from a dhaka book fair .
roy s widow , rafida ahmed , was maimed in the attack .
sohel , who was identified after analyzing cctv footage , was arrested in the capital , dhaka , on sunday night , rahman told reuters .
bangladesh , a deeply religious but moderate muslim-majority country of 160 million people , is struggling to control attacks by islamist groups on secular bloggers , atheists , foreigners and religious minorities .
the most serious recent attack came in july 2016 , when gunmen stormed a restaurant in the diplomatic quarter of dhaka and killed 22 people , most of them foreigners .
al qaeda and islamic state have also claimed responsibility for a series of killings over the past few years , including roy s. authorities have consistently ruled out the presence of such groups , blaming domestic militants instead .
however , security experts say the scale and sophistication of the restaurant attack suggested links to a wider network .
