White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer told reporters that Donald Trump is tough on Russia, even though he has heaped praise on Vladimir Putin and never condemned him as a murderous thug.
The irony of this entire situation is that the president has been incredibly tough on Russia, Spicer said.
He continues to raise the issue of Crimea, which the previous administration allowed to be seized by Russia.
His ambassador to the United Nations, stood before the U.N. Security Council on her first day and strongly denounced the Russian occupation of Crimea.
Spicer s comments come after Michael Flynn, Trump s national security adviser, resigned Monday night after reports surfaced showing that he lied to Vice President Mike Pence about conversations he had with the Russian ambassador to the United States in regards to sanctions.Following Spicer s comments, the Internet, as it is wont to do, pounced.He didn t even send Putin roses this Valentine s Day.

His praise of Putin, who has had his critics murdered, is appalling.Featured image by Sean Gallup via Getty Images
