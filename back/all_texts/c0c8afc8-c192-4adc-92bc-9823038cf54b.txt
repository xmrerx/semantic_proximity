MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday it was not yet known if Russian President Vladimir Putin will run for re-election when his term ends next year.
Peskov said Putin met former finance minister Alexei Kudrin to talk about a strategy for economic development up to 2024.
Asked if Kudrin was helping draft Putin s program for the next term, Peskov told reporters: It is now yet known if Putin will run for the next presidential term.
The next six-year term expires in 2024.
