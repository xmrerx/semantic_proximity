To be honest with you what Donald Trump is saying is factual.
Again he may not address it in a manner that makes everyone happy but Donald Trump is being Donald Trump.
That speaking from the heart and not being politically correct but really just getting the truth out there.
Under Hillary Clinton black lives really don t matter, black votes matter.
