salon went nuts : half windsor , all fiasco : trump s necktie-gate may undermine his statesmanlike gravitasas you might have already seen , donald trump was recently photographed emerging from his airplane as a gust of wind caught his necktie and revealed a dirty secret .
the president-elect , who is a man of substantial means , holds his necktie together with scotch tape a discombobulating mishmash of armani aesthetics and hobo fashion sense.as upsetting as this is , i really can t make head or tail of it .
clearly trump is concerned about how terribly embarrassing it would be to have the two ends of his tie flopping about willy-nilly .
and yet the solution he has landed upon or someone else in his inner circle has is to make a third-grade arts-and-crafts project out of his wardrobe.what the hell is going on here ?
