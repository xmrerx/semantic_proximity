A political reporter for the Los Angeles Times is under fire from all sides for making sexist remarks about White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders in his latest anti-Trump column .WHAT ABOUT THE CARTOON??
?While David Horsey issued a lame apology for his article, he still has a cartoon up with the article that s a disgusting portrayal of Sarah Sanders.
We hope you ll let Mr. Horsey know his lack of ethics is deplorable: David Horsey LA TimesEven left-leaning columnists ripped into Horsey for his body shaming and very snarky remarks against Sanders:California resident, Claire Adida, said: Hey, @latimes and @davidhorsey, you can do better.
How about you focus on what she says rather than how she looks?
While Adam Serwer, Senior Editor for The Atlantic, wrote: Genuinely confused as to how this column got past an editor.
Teen Vogue columnist, Lauran Duca, further added: Things that are true at the same time: 1) Sarah Huckabee Sanders is an unabashed enemy of the truth 2) This profile of her is sexist trash.
NASTY ARTICLE:In the article Sarah Huckabee Sanders is the right mouthpiece for a truth-twisting president published Wednesday morning, David Horsey compared Sanders to a chunky soccer mom who organizes snacks for the kids games.
Horsey criticized Sanders, who was appointed the role back in July, for not meeting up to Trump s standards, as he suggested the aide does not look like the kind of woman (he) would choose as his chief spokesperson.
While the columnist pointed out positive aspects of Sanders part in the Trump administration following the leave of Sean Spicer Horsey veered into the misogynist comments.He said: Rather than the fake eyelashes and formal dresses she puts on for briefings, Sanders seems as if she d be more comfortable in sweats than running shoes.
Then added: Yet, even if Trump privately wishes he had a supermodel for a press secretary, he is lucky to have Sanders.
WHAT A NASTY MAN!
