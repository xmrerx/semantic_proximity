Yeah that whole taking up arms thing seems to be working well in Chicago The president of a non-violent group established by MLK said that nonviolence is no longer working.At a press conference, the Rev.
Sam Mosteller, president of the Georgia Chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) said all African Americans should avail themselves of their Second Amendment Rights.
You know, the SCLC stands for nonviolence, but nonviolence hasn t worked in this instance, Mosteller said, Let me just say it this way, I am going to have to advocate at this point that all African-Americans advocate their Second Amendment right, he added.The SCLC was co-founded by Martin Luther King, Jr. in 1957 in reaction to the shooting of two black men.The Daily Caller is reporting that when questioned about what some might consider a turn away from non-violence, Mosteller backpedaled a little.
We re going to have to do something in our community to let the rest of America know that we are not going to be victimized by just anybody whether it be police or folks that decide that black people are thugs and we need to control that black community.
When asked to explain what appeared to be a call to arms, Mosteller backed off, saying that he was not advocating for members of the black community to start carrying guns en masse.When a reporter asked if his advocacy for the Second Amendment was at odds with SCLC s attitude towards nonviolence, Mosteller said, Listen, listen I didn t say that.
I said the Second Amendment right?
I didn t say pack weapons, I did not say that.
Do you have to carry a weapon to avail yourself of the Second Amendment?
he asked.
The answer is no, you don t have to.
