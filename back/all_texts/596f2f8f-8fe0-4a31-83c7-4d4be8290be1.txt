21st Century Wire says Our weekly documentary film curated by our editorial team at 21WIRE The 1995 bombing of the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City was an event that shook the United States domestic scene.
Up to that date, it was the largest act of domestic terrorism in America, killing some 168 people including nineteen children.
However, many have questioned the government s official account of events.
A Noble Lie re-investigates the bombing and re-examines the event s alleged perpetrators, as well as other unlikely role player on the periphery.
What this film reveals may shock many viewers who thought they knew what happened that day, exposing information never before examined or brought to the attention of the American public.
