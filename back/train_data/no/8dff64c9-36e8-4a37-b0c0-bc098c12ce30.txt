another stunning cover-up for # unfit hillary by her most committed media cheerleader one week ago , board-certified medicine specialist , tv personality and cnn employee dr. drew pinsky broke the mold of conformity , when he said that he is gravely concerned about presidential candidate hillary clinton s health , pointing out that treatment she is receiving could be the result of her bizarre behaviors.appearing on kabc s mcintyre in the morning , pinsky said he and his colleague dr. robert huizenga became gravely concerned .not just about her health but her health care , after analyzing what medical records on hillary had been released .
pinsky pointed out that after clinton fainted and fell in late 2012 , she suffered from a transverse sinus thrombosis , an exceedingly rare clot that virtually guarantees somebody has something wrong with their coagulation system .
what s wrong with her coagulation system , has that been evaluated ?
asked dr. drew.pinsky described the situation as bizarre , and said that hillary s medical condition was dangerous and concerning .
dr. drew also went on to add that it was a sign of brain damage when hillary had to wear prism glasses after her fall .
just as stunning as pinsky s assessment which promptly went viral and led to the immediate takedown of the original interview webpage by kabc-am radio , was that it came from an employee of hln , which is part of the pro-clinton cnn network.as such it is probably not surprising that earlier today , just one week later , cnn executive vice president ken jautz announced thursday that dr. drew and i have mutually agreed to air the final episode of his show on september 22 .
