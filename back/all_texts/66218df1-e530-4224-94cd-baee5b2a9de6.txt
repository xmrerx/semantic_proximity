Bill and Hillary Clinton have been married for 41 years today.
Obviously, their marriage has had its public ups and downs, but unlike about half of all Americans (and Donald Trump, who s been married three times and has proudly cheated on all of his wives), they have stuck it out.Bill took to Twitter to send his wife a love note of sorts:41 years ago I married my best friend and the finest changemaker I ve ever known.
And yes, I m still in awe of her!
Bill Clinton (@billclinton) October 11, 2016Of course, 41 isn t exactly a milestone anniversary, and Hillary is a bit busy, so she hasn t tweeted back yet, but last year, they had an adorable exchange.40 years ago, I married the cute guy from the library.
Happy anniversary, @billclinton you ve still got it!

@billclinton Where s the word love ?
Susan Reaney (@SSReaney) October 11, 2016Well, Susan, perhaps the word love is said multiple times a day, in private.
Or, perhaps it s not said at all.
Marriages based on friendships are not unusual, and often, they are the strongest marriages of all.
In other words, it s none of your business.Some got their talking points directly from Trump.

If they were, they would never vote for Trump.
They honestly don t care if a man cheats on a woman.
They re fine with Donald cheating on Melania.
Their only objection is if the woman in the marriage is strong and has her own ambitions.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images.
