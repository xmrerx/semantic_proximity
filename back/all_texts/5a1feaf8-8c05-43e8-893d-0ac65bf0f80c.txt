A longtime Clinton ally and donor has a theory about black Republicans: They re like the Jewish guards in concentration camps who tried to save their own skins by helping the Nazis kill Jews.
In a hidden-camera video released Wednesday by Project Veritas Action, author and academic Benjamin R. Barber compared black Republicans to the Sonderkommandos during a Sept. 19 fundraiser for North Carolina Senate candidate Deborah Ross.
He described the Sonderkommandos as Jewish guards who in effect helped murder Jews in the camps so they could live a little longer.
So there were even Jews who were helping the Nazis murder Jews.
So blacks who are helping the other side are seriously f***ed in the head, said Mr. Barber in undercover footage.
Mr. Barber, a Rutgers University professor emeritus and City University of New York senior research scholar, isn t some fringe figure: He served as an informal consultant on civic affairs to President Bill Clinton, wrote a book about the Clinton administration, and donated to Hillary Clinton s presidential bids in 2008 and 2016.Read more: WT
