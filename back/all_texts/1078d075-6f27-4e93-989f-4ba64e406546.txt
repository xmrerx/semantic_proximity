Roy Moore is desperate to paint all these child molestation allegations against him as nothing more than a smear campaign one that the media is busy amplifying for the sole purpose of taking him down.
His website roymoore.org even has a form people can fill out asking whether the media has contacted them, and to describe the contact.
So of course Twitter got hold of it, and now Moore is getting hilariously trolled.The blank form looks like this:An editor for Viewpoint Magazine tweeted it out, along with his response and a call for people to troll Moore this way.
Twitter has responded with gusto:Roy Moore has a snitching page on his site where you can report if the media has contacted you, join me in flooding it with trolling https://t.co/EfP1eJMN2t pic.twitter.com/7c6k6WeOHk Shuja Haider (@shujaxhaider) November 15, 2017pic.twitter.com/UOu2SndGh8 Jack (@jrkisbad) November 15, 2017pic.twitter.com/JrF4Cplgp7 CANCEL THE SUPERBOWL (@bornwithatail_) November 15, 2017pic.twitter.com/xukVyXc4FA Gen JC Christian, patriot ?
