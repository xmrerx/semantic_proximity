dnc chair tom perez is a fear mongering racist who likes to stir up fake concerns for democrat voters .
he s clearly afraid of the voter integrity policy of trump who wants to clean up voter lists .
what s wrong with that ?
tom perez has a long history of fear mongering and racism judge jeanine ripped into the dem chair tom perez for his blistering speech ( see video below ) on how donald trump doesn t stand for our values and that we must resist .
she asks the questions perez should answer !
judgejeanine : don t stand for our values ?
pray tell , perez , what are our values & what it is that you want us to resist ?
law & order ?
.
@ judgejeanine : `` 'do n't stand for our values ' ?
pray tell , perez , what are our values & what it is that you want us to resist ?
law & order ? ''
pic.twitter.com/vokbmnillw fox news ( @ foxnews ) april 2 , 2017 our previous report on perez and his speech attacking trump : perez has a long radical history connected to la raza and other open borders organizations .
his track record is full on radical .
e s in cahoots with obama to continue the fundamental transformation of america .
anyone who s a democrat should be shocked that he s taking the party in such a far left direction .
do your research and you ll know why he was the choice for dem chair.he just fired all democrat party staffers and is bringing in all new people .
the party is clearly taking a new direction and it s not a good one for any american .
donald trump didn t win watch entire video : republicans don t give a sh * t about people
