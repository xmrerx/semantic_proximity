If there s one thing that can likely unite all Americans regarding the 2016 presidential election, it s a general feeling of panic and uncertainty.
At this point in the race, everything is still relatively up in the air in regards to who will be the nominee from either party, and most certainly who will win the White House come November.Perfectly encapsulating the panic and uncertainty we re feeling are the folks over at The Simpsons.
They depict Marge Simpson waking up in the middle of the night anxious and annoyed.
She utters: I can t take it!
I m hyperventilating.
I can t take it anymore.
Basic manners are gone from politics.
What is it with these ding dongs?!
From there, Homer is able to calm her back down and get her to imagine all the candidates getting along, even doing a song and dance number with one another.
He says: Marge think good thoughts I know things look bad now, but just try to visualize another America.
One where Republicans, Democrats and Donald Trump ALL get along.
However, reality slowly creeps back in as the candidates start going relentlessly after each other.
This is when Homer chimes in, I m sorry, honey.
I guess dreaming doesn t work.
The reality of the situation for all of us actually living through this bizarre election is that things have the chance to change every single day.
So, when Marge Simpson utters, I want to see who wins, we can all be in agreement with Homer when he says, we all do.
