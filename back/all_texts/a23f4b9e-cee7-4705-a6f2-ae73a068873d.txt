Here s the cover via OC Weekly:Image via OC WeeklyThe cover is the perfect demonstration of what will happen on Election Day if the Republican Party makes Trump their nominee.While Trump is leading Democratic rival Hillary Clinton 54-41 among white voters, a CNN poll reveals that the GOP is in for a historic defeat among non-white voters who back Clinton 81-14.
Women are also backing Clinton in eager anticipation of seeing the first woman occupy the White House and, you know, the fact that Trump is anti-women and believes women should be punished for having an abortion.Hispanic voters in particular have every reason to vote against Trump in November considering how much he has been denigrating them over the course of his campaign.
For more than a year, the presumptive GOP presidential nominee has peddled all sorts of nasty myths against Mexicans, from painting undocumented immigrants as rapists and Typhoid Marias to insisting a massive wall on the U.S.-Mexico border will make America great again, Arellano wrote explaining why the cover was chosen.
Besides, Democrats violating Trump from behind is what he can expect when he faces Hillary Clinton come November.
Enjoy our package, and don t forget to register to vote!
he concluded.If Republicans seriously think they can win in November with Trump as their candidate they are delusional.
The fact of the matter is that Trump s campaign appeals to white racists who are whining about an imaginary persecution by society because they aren t allowed to discriminate against people they hate.For now, at least we get to watch how angry Trump gets after he sees this cover.
That reaction should be priceless.Featured Image: Getty Images/Mark Wilson
