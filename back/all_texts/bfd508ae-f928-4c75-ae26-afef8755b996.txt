WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton holds a four-point lead over Republican Donald Trump in the final NBC-Wall Street Journal poll released on Sunday.
The NBC-Wall Street Journal poll showed Clinton leading Trump by 44 percent to 40 percent.
Libertarian Gary Johnson was at 6 percent and Green Party Candidate Jill Stein had 2 percent.
Clintonâ€™s lead shrank from 11 points over Trump the last time the poll was conducted in mid-October, before the FBI said it was reviewing new emails in its investigation of the former secretary of state.
The poll also showed Clinton with a 12 percentage point lead over Trump - 51 percent to 39 percent - among people who have said they have voted early.
