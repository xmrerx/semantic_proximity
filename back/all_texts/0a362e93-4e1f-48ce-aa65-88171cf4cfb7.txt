North Korea has conducted two nuclear tests and dozens of missile tests since the beginning of last year, significantly raising tension on the heavily militarized Korean peninsula and in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions.

Faced with economic problems made harder by multiple sanctions, the Pyongyang government is keen to develop tourism to earn cash.
The most pricey tour, 15 days full immersion in the culture of North Korea costing 118,090 rubles ($1,997), includes visits to a farm, a mineral water factory, a Buddhist temple, walks in the mountains and an introduction to national cuisine.
Visits to numerous museums to founding leader Kim Il-Sung are also on offer.

It is unclear how popular these trips will be among Russians who have already developed a fondness for visiting Europe and the affordable resorts of Turkey and Thailand.
