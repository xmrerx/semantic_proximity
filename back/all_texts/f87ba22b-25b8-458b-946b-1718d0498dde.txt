In a desperate attempt to make Steve Bannon seem less like a crazed, apocalypse-obsessed maniac, Fox News played a little game with USA Today s deputy editorial opinion editor, David Mastio, who suggested in a recent piece that Steve Bannon and ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi shared similar world views, including apocalyptic visions of a clash between Muslims and the United States.It is true that both men share these viewpoints, but Fox took things to ridiculous levels in an effort to appear to disprove this theory.
Apparently, because Bannon (unlike he and Trump s friend Putin) has not slaughtered journalists or used chemical weapons, he s a swell dude.Tucker Carlson quickly went through the chart, ticking off many of Baghdadi s more horrible actions:See?
There you have it Bannon, who until recently ran a website aimed at a white supremacist audience and who describes himself as a Leninist who wants to destroy the state is just A-OK!This cringeworthy attempt to make Bannon seem appealing by comparing him to one of the few people in the world who is worse than he is wasn t lost on the internet.
Twitter users flocked to mock the right-wing news organization for this whatever this was.Here's another graphic you can use @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson pic.twitter.com/mMe56zG1QK Not My President (@missmayn) February 9, 2017BREAKING: Steve Bannon a pretty good guy when compared to AIDS @FoxNews @TuckerCarlson pic.twitter.com/8WTY3sRGLe Not My President (@missmayn) February 9, 2017@missmayn pic.twitter.com/GorzckBjNh Chris Rywalt ?

(((Dan North))) (@drnorth) February 9, 2017@missmayn That Fox News felt the need to make this hilarious graphic at all says a lot about the undercurrent of public sentiment.
Nick Stewart (@NickStewarting) February 9, 2017@missmayn @MelissaJPeltier so now not beheadings people and using child soldiers is the bar for a 'good person' ?
@FoxNews you are pathetic Fadi Antoun (@fadiantounn) February 9, 2017@missmayn @cafedotcom Wow, when you put it that way, I'm glad he's our POTUS.
Peter Drake (@peterjdrake) February 9, 2017@missmayn those are all super specificlike, maybe he hasn't beheaded any journalists, but maybe there are a few less fast food employees Thompson Kaa (@Thompson_Kaa) February 9, 2017@missmayn I feel like they added the "on Kurds" qualifier after realizing there's a possibility Bannon has used chemical weapons before.
Matthew Byrd (@SilverTuna014) February 10, 2017@missmayn Interesting degree of specificity here, eg.
"On Kurds", "of Chrstians" Sith Justice Warrior (@SithJW) February 9, 2017At no point was it suggested that Bannon has done any of the things Baghdadi has done.
The editorial speaks only of their ideological similarities, which Carlson carefully avoided mentioning but what else can expect from Fox News?
Honesty?
