Donald Trump, who notoriously called people who finish in second place losers, just had his words come back to bite him in the ass, and, as could be expected, the New York Daily News was right there to give him some much deserved mockery.
They referred to Trump as Dead Clown Walking in the headline, and went on to call him a bombastic Bozo in the article.The paper, which has become known for its brilliantly blunt covers, didn t cut Trump any slack at all.
They called it like they saw it once agains, and ran an absolutely delicious cover depicting Trump as a clown.
We all know that Donald Trump is far too thin-skinned to be running for any political office, much less that of the presidency, and will likely blow a gasket and throw his gazillionth childish Twitter tantrum, as he always does when anyone mocks or criticizes him.
Without further ado, here is the brilliant cover:via NY Daily NewsThis is nothing less than absolutely perfect.
Trump s campaign has turned an important part of the American political process for a major party into little more than a circus.
That s why people are calling them the GOP Clown Car.
That s exactly what they are, and Trump has been in the driver s seat the entire time, driving that car straight into a hell of humiliation.
Trump s remarks afterward may have been humble, but there was also a touch of fear to them.
He said he was really honored, and then remarked on going to New Hampshire: We love New Hampshire.
We will go on to win New Hampshire, we will go on to win the nomination.
He then seemed to admit that he may not win the general, and even mused about his post-defeat plans: Who knows, I think I might come back here [Iowa] and buy a farm.
Watching this buffoon lose is just the most delicious brand of schadenfreude imaginable at this point in time, and I, for one, will make sure to pop plenty of popcorn in anticipation of the inevitable Twitter tirade that is just waiting to burst forth.
