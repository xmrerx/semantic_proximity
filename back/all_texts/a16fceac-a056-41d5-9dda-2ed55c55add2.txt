A police officer in Texas has been caught on video making a racist comment to a black woman that he manhandled.
The video is the latest bit of proof of the malicious behavior exhibited by some police officers towards blacks that many whites, especially on the right, have often dismissed.Patrol car video publicly released Thursday shows a white Austin, Texas, police officer violently throwing a black woman to the ground during a traffic stop, followed by another white officer telling her black people have violent tendencies and whites are justifiably afraid.Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo condemned both officers actions.
He called the officer s comments on the video disturbing and said a criminal investigation has been opened against the officer who arrested Breaion King.The video only surfaced because the Austin American-Statesman newspaper published the video on Thursday.
The incident happened in June 2015.Both officers in the video have been put on desk jobs and suspended pending an internal investigation.In the video, Officer Patrick Spradlin also says that I don t blame white people for their feat of blacks because Some of them, because of their appearance and whatnot, some of them are very intimidating.
The woman he is addressing is employed as an elementary school teacher.
Since the incident she says, I ve become fearful to live my life and I would rather stay home.
I ve become afraid of the people who are supposed to protect me and take care of me.
At the Republican convention this week, many of the speakers have continued the conservative line of downplaying the Black Lives Matter movement, with some even equating them to terrorists and terrorist allies.By contrast, President Obama, Hillary Clinton, and other Democrats have condemned attacks on police officers but also made clear that there are very real and raw problems of racial bias and treatment in police departments that need serious reform.Featured image via YouTube
