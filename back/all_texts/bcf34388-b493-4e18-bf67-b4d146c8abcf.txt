Jeb Bush was, once upon a time in a land far, far away, assumed to be the shoo-in for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination.
Then, Donald Trump happened, and Jeb s dreams of presidential glory were crushed.
In fact, Jeb s campaign is in such trouble now that he had to get his mommy to appear in a political ad reminding everyone that her son should be the GOP s annointed one, and that Trump is just a big bully.Well, it s a good thing that as Jeb s campaign circles the drain and dies, he has other dreams to fulfill.
Bizarrely, it s to be a G-rated killer on the hit fictional drama about the U.S. government, Homeland.Apparently, the series The Circus caught Jeb admitting on camera that he d like nothing more than to kill people on television.
The thing is, though, Trump is right about one thing.
Jeb Bush is a lackluster dork who would be nothing more than a laughingstock on that series.
In fact, he very presence would likely make it jump the shark.
Nevertheless, it s highly entertaining to realize the revelation that acting in a television drama is the next best thing to really being POTUS in Jeb s feeble mind.Give it up, Jeb.
You ll never appear on Homeland, and you ll never be POTUS.
No worries, though.
You have plenty of time and money.
I m sure you ll find something constructive to do.Watch the video of Jeb s confession below:Featured image via video screen capture.
