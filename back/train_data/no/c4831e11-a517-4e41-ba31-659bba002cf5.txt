new delhi ( reuters ) - a hindu man in india tried to raise money for a campaign against minority muslims by issuing an appeal for donations with a video he took and posted online showing him killing a muslim , police said on thursday .
the killing last week is the latest to roil india s minority muslims who have faced attacks from mobs who accuse them of killing cows , which hindus consider sacred .
hindu fringe groups also campaign against muslim men marrying hindus .
the hindu man , shambu lal regar , has been arrested on suspicion of hacking and burning a muslim laborer in the western state of rajasthan , police said .
regar had posted a video of the attack along with his bank details for donations to finance his anti-muslim campaign , police officer anand shrivastava said .
more than 700 people from across india deposited 300,000 rupees ( $ 4,665 ) into the account .
the accused wanted to become a hindu hero after killing a muslim man , his main aim was to collect money after committing the hate crime , said shrivastava .
regar s video went viral on social media before authorities took it down .
police investigators had frozen the bank account and were tracking down donors , shrivastava said .
shrivastava said the video had showed regar claiming to be a proud hindu trying to stop love jihad - a term used by hindu hardliners who accuse muslim men of entrapping hindu women and girls on the pretext of love in order to convert them to islam .
the government of prime minister narendra modi , who leads the hindu-nationalist bharatiya janata party , has been criticized for failing to do enough to stop attacks on muslims .
the government rejects that .
modi has condemned violence in the name of protecting cows .
muslims account for 172 million of india s 1.32 billion citizens and modi s critics say hindu groups linked with his ruling party are trying to marginalize them .
the bjp denies any bias against muslims
