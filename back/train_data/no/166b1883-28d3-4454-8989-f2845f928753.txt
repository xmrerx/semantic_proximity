ankara ( reuters ) - turkey is determined to press on with its efforts to join the european union despite tensions with the bloc , the government said on sunday ahead of an eu summit which will discuss the frayed relations between brussels and ankara .
the eu , particularly heavyweight member germany , has become increasingly critical of turkey since president tayyip erdogan launched a crackdown on critics , including journalists and academics after the july 2016 failed coup .
erdogan accused berlin of nazi-like tactics in march when it prevented turkish ministers speaking at expatriate rallies in germany .
chancellor angela merkel said in an election debate in september that it was clear turkey should not join the eu and entry talks should end , despite it being a nato ally .
is there another country that has waited at the eu s doorstep since 1963 ?
there is not , deputy prime minister and government spokesman bekir bozdag was quoted as saying by the state-run anadolu news agency .
we are determined to continue this process despite all the setbacks .
we , as turkey , have no intention of pulling back , he said .
turkey s 12-year-long accession talks have ground to a halt since ankara s crackdown after the failed coup , in which more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the military , private and public sectors .
eu leaders will meet on oct. 19 to discuss deteriorating ties between the bloc and turkey in a two-day summit .
however , merkel was quoted as saying the summit will not make a conclusive decision on ankara s accession bid .
