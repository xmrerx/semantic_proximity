sochi , russia ( reuters ) - the size of russia s military force in syria is likely to be significantly reduced and a drawdown could start before the end of the year , the chief of the russian military general staff said on thursday .
russia s military support of syrian president bashar al-assad , notably through air strikes , has been crucial in defeating islamic state and syrian opposition forces .
there is very little left to do before the completion of military objectives .
of course , a decision will be made by the supreme commander-in-chief and the deployment will be reduced , valery gerasimov told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting between president vladimir putin and military top brass in the black sea resort of sochi .
gerasimov said forces would likely be substantially reduced but leave russia with two military bases , a ceasefire-monitoring center and a number of necessary structures to support the situation which has developed in syria .
putin hosted assad in sochi on monday and discussed moving from military operations to a search for a political solution to syria s conflict .

[ nl8n1ns5rq ] in march last year putin said russia had achieved its goals in syria and ordered the withdrawal of the main part of its forces .
however , a u.s.-led coalition operating in syria said that after that statement russia s combat power was largely intact .
