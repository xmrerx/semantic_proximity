If there s one thing about Donald Trump that isn t presidential (aside from literally everything) it s the people he has selected for top-level positions a raging anti-Semite and racist as White house chief strategist, a man who was too racist to be a judge for US attorney, and a guy who actually got caught holding plans for a national registry of Muslim immigrants in his hands during a photo-op with The Donald for Homeland Security secretary, for example.That a minority of Americans was able to elect someone like Trump is embarrassing enough but the people he is appointing to high-level roles makes us a laughingstock.
Recently, legendary actor John Cleese was watching it all unfold on American television and noticed that It looks as though Trump is assembling the crew for a pirate ship rather than people who will lead the United States.Watching US TV today reminded me of my remark on Conan O'Brien.

@JohnCleese More like a Borg cube.

Orangebeard?
Eddy Bruel (@ejpbruel) November 18, 2016@JohnCleese a pirate ship called the Titanic?

Christian McIntire (@XtianMcIntire) November 18, 2016@JohnCleese More diversity on a pirate ship, methinks.
Deborah M. Budd (@deb_budd_sw) November 18, 2016As Trump s children scramble to cash in on his presidency and The Donald himself has already openly used his position for his own benefit, one must wonder if Cleese is more right than he realizes.
In any case, we can surely expect conservatives to boycott Cleese s current stage show by (if Starbucks is an indicator) buying as many tickets as they can and writing Trump on them.Featured image via Getty Images(Clemens Bilan/Drew Angerer)/screengrab
