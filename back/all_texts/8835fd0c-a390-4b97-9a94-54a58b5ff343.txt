Donald Trump officially and depressingly takes over the White House today, but former George W. Bush speechwriter David Frum had some strong words for him on this Inauguration Day.Of course, Trump won t bother actually going on the job until Monday since he has decided to take a two day vacation first.So he ll have plenty of time to read a tweet Frum posted on Twitter and throw a temper tantrum about it.Frum called Trump the worst human being who has ever become president, and that includes every president who owned slaves.The worst human being ever to enter the presidency, and I include all the slaveholders.
David Frum (@davidfrum) January 20, 2017No doubt, if slavery still existed Donald Trump would definitely be a slaveholder.
Hell, he has his company s products made by cheap labor overseas.
Slaves would have to manufacture his products for free and we all know Trump would love that.
In fact, 20 percent of Trump supporters actually believe that freeing the slaves was a bad idea.
And let s not forget that white supremacist flocked to support Trump s campaign and Trump even made of them his top adviser.Frum then followed up with a tweet about how much of a coward Trump is.Andrew Jackson was at least physically brave David Frum (@davidfrum) January 20, 2017Indeed, Andrew Jackson fought duels and was a soldier for this country.
Trump, on the other hand, dodged the draft during Vietnam and only brags that he could kill someone.Donald Trump only fights for Donald Trump.
He doesn t care about this nation and he intends to destroy everything that made this country great.Americans across the country should be terrified.
The days of hope and change are gone.
Republicans are going to double down on their failed policies like never before and our country will pay a steep price for it.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
