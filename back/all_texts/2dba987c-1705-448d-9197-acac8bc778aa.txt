As Obama begins his campaign for UN General Secretary on the US taxpayer s dime, keep a close eye on the many responsibilities of our federal government he ll be ceding to a corrupt body of human rights violators and political whores.
Remember when people used to laugh at Americans who talked about a one world order?
It s not so funny anymore, is it?
The Obama administration is turning to the United Nations to help screen migrants fleeing violence in Central America, senior administration officials said Tuesday, and to help set up processing centers in several Latin American countries in the hopes of stemming a flood of families crossing the southern border illegally.Designed to head off migrants from three violence-torn countries in the region before they start traveling to the United States, the new refugee resettlement program will be announced by Secretary of State John Kerry on Wednesday in Washington.
Under the plan, the United Nations refugee agency will work with the United States to set up processing centers in several nearby countries, where migrants would be temporarily out of danger.As it does in other places, the United Nations will determine if the migrants could be eligible for refugee status.
The administration officials said thousands perhaps as many as 9,000 migrants each year from the three countries, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras, could eventually settle in the United States.
But some refugees would also be sent to other countries in the hemisphere, officials said.For entire story: NYT
