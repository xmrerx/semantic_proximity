Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA) is one of the loudest and most steadfast members of #THERESISTANCE in Congress.
He has called Donald Trump an evil man over the GOP s cruel approach to healthcare, and has even suggested that president #45 could use some mental health treatment.
Now, Rep. Lieu has posted a video to Twitter in which he doesn t speak at all, but doesn t need to.Lieu s latest target is White House Lying Mouthpiece Press Secretary Sean Spicer.
Of course, Spicer is in the limelight right now because of his treatment of veteran reporter April Ryan during Tuesday s press briefing.
He was condescending, he lied to her face, and basically treated her like she was beneath him.
Rep. Lieu s answer?
To print out a sign and tape it to his office name plate that identifies the space as an #Alternativefacts Free Zone.
In the two second video that he posted to Twitter, he simply shakes his head with regards to how he feels about anything Spicer has to say:This is my response to pretty much everything White House @PressSec @SeanSpicer says during his press briefings.
