Coexist, assimilation, religious tolerance these are all foreign concepts to Muslims immigrants and Muslims living in countries who refuse to offer them refuge in their countries .FIVE OF THE WEALTHIEST MUSLIM COUNTRIES HAVE TAKEN NO SYRIAN REFUGEES IN AT ALL, ARGUING THAT DOING SO WOULD OPEN THEM UP TO THE RISK OF TERRORISM.Lebanon, which has 1.1 million Syrian refugees, shut her borders to the Syrians in June of last year.
Jordan, host to another 630,000, followed suit in August last year, preventing more Syrians from abandoning their country.Sherif Elsayid-Ali, Amnesty International s Head of Refugee and Migrants Rights, has slammed their inaction as shameful .He said: The records of Gulf countries is absolutely appalling, in terms of actually showing compassion and sharing the responsibility of this crisis It is a disgrace.
