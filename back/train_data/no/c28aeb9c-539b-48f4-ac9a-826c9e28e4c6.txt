jerusalem ( reuters ) - the israeli military said on thursday that an aircraft and a tank had targeted two posts belonging to militants in the gaza strip after three rockets were launched at israel .
sirens sounded in israel at various locations on a day of heightened tension following demonstrations in the coastal enclave and the occupied west bank as palestinians protested at u.s. president donald trump s announcement on wednesday that he was recognizing jerusalem as israel s capital .
two rockets launched at israel from the gaza strip fell short inside the palestinian enclave earlier in the evening and a third , fired later , landed in an open area in israel causing no casualties or damage , an army spokeswoman said .
gaza residents said there were no casualties from the israeli attack and that two unmanned lookout posts were hit .
a jihadist salafi group in gaza called the al-tawheed brigades - which does not heed the call from the enclave s dominant force , hamas , to desist from firing rockets - claimed responsibility for the launches .
in response to ... projectiles fired at israel throughout the day ... an idf tank and an iaf aircraft targeted two military posts in the gaza strip .
the idf holds hamas responsible for the hostile activity perpetrated against israel from the gaza strip , an army statement said .
during the gaza war in 2014 , israel s iron dome rocket interceptor system largely protected the country s heartland from thousands of rocket barrages fired by militants .
