here we go again another student art contest that brings with it a controversial painting .
remember the cops as pigs painting that caused a stir in the capitol ?
this painting is taking the iconic symbol of the statue of liberty and making it a religious symbol of islam with the hijab .
congressman correa needs to take this painting down ! a student painting that depicts the statue of liberty wearing a muslim hijab , displayed in congressman lou correa s santa ana office , is being attacked as an unpatriotic violation of the separation of church and state by members of we the people rising , a claremont-based activist group that advocates stricter enforcement of immigration laws.the group , which includes several orange county participants , has asked without success that correa remove the painting , which hangs with other finalists from the democratic congressman s annual student art competition.because of the complaint , correa said he asked the house office of legislative counsel for advice and was told there was no legal issue .
that has not appeased the activists , who are tentatively planning a sept. 11 protest at correa s district office .
it s a bad example for our congressman , said orange resident mike mcgertrick , an activist with we the people rising .
he shouldn t have anything religious in his office .
i would like to see our congress people be right-down-the-line patriotic .
