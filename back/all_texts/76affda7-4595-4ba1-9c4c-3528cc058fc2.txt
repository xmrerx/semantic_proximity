What the f*ck is wrong with our country?
Republicans may say that racism ended with Rosa Parks (they actually say this), but a lot of people s words and actions seems weirdly racist given the complete lack of it in our society.An African-American man posted a video of an exchange he had with a white driver after he passed the apparently aggressive Caucasian man in traffic.
This is a prime example of why you should get out and vote!
Guy got heated and decided to share w/ me what him and his family thinks about me and my people because I didn t allow him to speed up and stop me from changing lanes in traffic, a man identifying himself as Skye Lev wrote on Facebook.
I could ve ended up doing 20 to life over this but instead I decided to show him respect, that he clearly didn t deserve, because I have children to be here for.
Lord thank you for this patience and self-control that you blessed me with!
GET OUT AND VOTE PEOPLE!!!!
The video is just horrible.
After Mr. White man apparently called Lev a n*gger, the African-American gentleman turned on his camera.
Trump, Trump all the way, Trump, Trump, Mr.
Deplorable says as the video begins.
He then informs the gentleman that Black lives don t matter.
There ain t no proof.
The white gentleman claims that Lev cut him off in traffic and made him slam on his breaks.
And that makes you a n*gger, Mr. Cracker says.
That proves that black lives don t matter.
The white gentleman then explains that he doesn t have a social media account because white lives matter (it probably sounded better in his head).Now if you thought that was bad, wait till you hear him teach this gentleman about black people!
We won t spoil it for you.
