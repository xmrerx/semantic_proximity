MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico will only remain within the North American Free Trade Agreement if the renegotiated treaty is good for the country, Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said on Tuesday, as trade negotiators gathered in Washington for talks.
The talks to update the 23-year-old NAFTA pact have turned increasingly acrimonious, with Mexico and business groups warning that several U.S. proposals would limit trade.
Videgaray said Mexico must be ready for the “different scenarios” that the talks could produce.
U.S. President Donald Trump was quoted on Tuesday as saying he believed NAFTA should be terminated.
