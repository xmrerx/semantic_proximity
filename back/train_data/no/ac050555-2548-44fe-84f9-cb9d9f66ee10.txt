tokyo ( reuters ) - almost two-thirds of japanese voters are opposed to prime minister shinzo abe calling a snap election , a kyodo news agency survey showed on sunday , a day before the japanese leader is expected to announce an october vote .
according to the survey , 27 percent of the respondents plan to vote for the ruling liberal democratic party in proportional representation districts in the expected lower house election , versus 8 percent who favor the struggling main opposition democratic party .
the poll also showed that 6.2 percent will vote for a new party aligned with popular tokyo governor yuriko koike , which is expected to be launched this week .
another 42.2 percent remain undecided .
abe is expected on monday to announce plans to call a general election for oct. 22 to take advantage of a rebound in his damaged approval ratings and an opposition in political disarray , ruling party and government sources said .
