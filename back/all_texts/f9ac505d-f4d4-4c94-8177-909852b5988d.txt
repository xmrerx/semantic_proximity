KUWAIT (Reuters) - Kuwait s ruling emir accepted the resignation of the prime minister and his cabinet on Monday, state news agency KUNA reported, asking them to continue important duties until a new cabinet is sworn in.
Prime Minister Sheikh Jaber Mubarak al-Sabah tendered his resignation earlier on Monday to the Emir, Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, who has the final say in state matters.
Local media, quoting members of parliament, said a cabinet shakeup had been expected.
Lawmakers were preparing this week to discuss a no-confidence vote in Information Minister Sheikh Mohammed al-Sabah after he was questioned over violations of budgetary and legislative rules, Kuwait Times said in a report.
The major oil producer has the oldest legislature among the Gulf Arab states and experiences frequent cabinet reshuffles.
The latest government was formed in February.
