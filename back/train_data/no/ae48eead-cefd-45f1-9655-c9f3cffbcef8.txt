former vp al gore told abc s george stephanopoulos weather reports are like the book of revelation from the bible .
can you believe this grifter ?
you wonder if he really believes his lies ! stephanopoulos asked gore about president trump s decision to withdraw from the paris climate accord .
he asked if it was significant , considering that former president george w. bush did the same thing with the kyoto treaty on climate change in 2001.al gore : we lost a lot of time when the u.s. did not join the rest of the world community then , and while it is true that we have this sustainability revolution under way , and it s very exciting .
it has the magnitude of the industrial revolution , but the speed of the digital revolution .
we re still not changing fast enough .
it s not just the scientific community warning us now .
it s mother nature .
every night on the tv news is like a nature hike through the book of revelation 70 percent of florida is in drought right now .
missouri just declared an emergency with another one of these historic climate-related downpours .
gore had the nerve to comment on president trump s leadership : we need presidential leadership .
since he s not going to lead , the american people are stepping up .
the fact is that al gore is a grifter who has made millions off of the global warming scam !
he s the ultimate grifter .
he needs to crawl back into his hole.via : wfb
