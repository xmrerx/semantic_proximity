the group says the demands are necessary to reduce the intolerable racism that students of color experience on campus every day .
salovey is given until nov. 18 to respond.as evidence of yale s hostile racial climate , the demands cite a widely debunked alleged exclusion of black women from a party hosted at sigma alpha epsilon ( sae ) fraternity .
there is substantial evidence this alleged segregation did not happen.of the yale student s demands , the most expensive is the third , which orders the school to increase the budget for yale s four cultural centers ( for asians , blacks , hispanics , and american indians ) by two million dollars each , a total expense of $ 8 million .
along with this increase to their budgets , the students demand that the cultural centers hire five additional full-time employees each .
