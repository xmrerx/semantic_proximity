what a nut !
new york s mayor deblasio gives the evil eye and stares down former mayor giuliani or criticizing him for the liberal policies that have lead to a surge of homelessness on the streets.mayor de blasio couldn t hide his feelings about nemesis rudy giuliani , giving him a piercing stare friday during the 9/11 ceremony at ground zero .
only hours before they shared the stage at the solemn event , giuliani for the second time this week criticized de blasio for misrepresenting the city s homeless crisis .
ok , here s how ignorant mayor de blasio is .
he said that there were 40 percent more homeless people during my administration , giuliani said on fox 5 , adding the mayor misquoted that statistic , which the new york times put at 32 percent .
giuliani also said the spike was only in the shelter population , not in the number of homeless on the street .
people who are in shelters , i would like to inform the mayor , are not homeless , giuliani sniffed .
the two mayors have been locked in a war of words since giuliani blasted de blasio and his progressive views for allowing vagrants to sleep on the streets in a post op-ed last sunday .
de blasio fired back , calling the ex-mayor delusional and saying homelessness rose by 40 percent under his watch between 1994 to 2001 .
[ giuliani ] clearly doesn t remember the fact that he chased as he said he chased and chased people , but he also deprived families of benefits they needed and health care they needed , de blasio said earlier this week .
but giuliani patted himself and his successor , ex-mayor mike bloomberg , on the back for cleaning up the streets .
all you had to do was live in this city and you know that when i was mayor , there was very little homelessness in this city .
they were in shelters , giuliani told fox 5 on friday.read more : nyp
