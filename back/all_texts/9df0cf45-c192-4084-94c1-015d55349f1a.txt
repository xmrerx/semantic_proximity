In a new video, Robert Reich breaks down the 10-step plan Donald Trump is using to turn lies into truths and how we can break the cycle.While many of us are inclined to think he is just a bumbling buffoon.
Reich notes that the Wall Street Journal has refused to call Trump s lies, lies.
Their reasoning?
He isn t doing it on purpose, so it doesn t really count.
He isn t lying intentionally.
He s just an idiot who doesn t know what he s talking about.
But Trump is actually succeeding at turning his many bogus falsehoods into near truths.Here s how:With this 10-step plan, Trump wins, Reich explains.
But he doesn t have to.
We each need to make sure we know the truth rather than just swallowing whatever lie Trump spouts out next.
Don t let him confuse you.
Trust the real facts, not the alternative ones.Reich also said that the media should stop mincing words and needs to report Trump s lies as lies.
