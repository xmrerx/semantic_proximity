The Democratic candidates for the presidency, Bernie Sanders and Hilary Clinton, have millions of people supporting them virtually equally.
Both have won primaries and caucuses and both have electrified and filled stadiums when invited to speak.
Soon, there will be a decision: will it be Bernie Sanders or Hillary Clinton for the Democratic nomination?Since support for the candidates seems to be equally split among the two, a Bernie/Hillary ticket may make the most sense.
Here s Bernie Sanders response to a question about whether he would be Hillary s vice-presidential running mate:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=heE143betU8]It makes perfect sense to have a joint ticket between the two contenders for the nomination.
While Clinton is a candidate who is popular with the Democratic establishment, Bernie Sanders has electrified younger generations to his camp.
Tens of thousands pack small arenas to see him on college campuses.
His ideas have resonated with a generation that will one day be the leaders of tomorrow and his promise to empower them bodes really well for the future of the country since they are the future.We should also keep in mind that they have been respectful to each other during the debates unlike the Republicans, who have destroyed one another.
Thus, there s no bad blood between the two.
In fact, their relationship seems to be pleasant and a Sanders/Clinton ticket would unite Democrats against the Republican nominee, likely to be that rather terrifying guy, Donald Trump.Featured image via image screen capture
