The story Clinton cited was from a website for the LGBT New Now Next Awards, and was posted in 2014.
When followers pointed out the story was old, Clinton deleted her tweet.Not only was the story old, but the actual premise was deeply flawed.
What the Michigan House actually passed was a garden variety Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), which would have exempted religious individuals from laws that infringed on their religious beliefs.Like most state RFRAs, the Michigan bill contained a clause that allows the state to infringe on religious beliefs when there s a compelling government interest.
