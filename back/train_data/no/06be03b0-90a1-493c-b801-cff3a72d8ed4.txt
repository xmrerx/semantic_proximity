another turn left for the hillster so no school choice and no teacher accountability .
would you vote for someone who favors the union over your kids ?
so much for liberating poor kids from failing schools while the media chase the bernie sanders rallies , keep your eye on the political crowds that matter .
on saturday the american federation of teachers ( aft ) endorsed hillary clinton 16 months before election day.this counts in the fight for the democratic party nomination because the 1.6 million member union boasts it can make a million phone calls and knock on 500,000 doors .
bernie s birkenstock irregulars can t match that political power and money.the endorsement is even more notable as another sign of hillary s left political turn .
