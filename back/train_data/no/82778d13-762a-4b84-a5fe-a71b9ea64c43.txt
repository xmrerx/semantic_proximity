yeah okay kanye noted jacka $ $ kanye west doesn t want white publications to write about his music anymore .
they just don t get it.and this isn t racist at all.the huffington post reported : on a far too cold thursday afternoon in new york city last week , kanye west finally debuted his album , the life of pablo , at madison square garden to over 20 million people tuning into a live stream on tidal.then he announced on twitter that the album he previewed wasn t the album.at the end of the week , on saturday night live , west eventually announced he had put the real album online .
but even then tlop was just on tidal .
although it s unclear whether the album currently streaming on tidal is the final version , publications such as the new york times and pitchfork put out their reviews just shortly after the release then , after letting that rack up retweets and hearts for about half an hour , west decided to go after white publications that try to review black music .
via : gateway pundit since white publications shouldn t cover black music , does that mean white billionaires , like facebook founder mark zuckerberg , shouldn t cover the debts of black musicians ?
