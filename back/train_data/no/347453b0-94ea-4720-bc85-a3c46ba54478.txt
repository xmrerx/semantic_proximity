santiago ( reuters ) - chilean conservative presidential candidate sebastian pinera maintained his lead in voter preference ahead of the nov. 19 election , and was seen beating his two closest rivals in a likely runoff , pollster cep said on wednesday .
pinera , a wealthy businessman and former president who governed from 2010 to 2014 , was seen as stronger on crime and job creation than his seven rivals , in the latest poll .
according to the poll , pinera would win 32.8 percent of voters in the first round , up from 31.3 percent in cep s last poll on sept. 1 .
center-left senator alejandro guillier polled 13.8 percent of support , up from 14.5 percent previously , while leftist beatriz sanchez slipped about three percentage points to 7.0 percent .
a pinera win would please chile s business community , which blames outgoing president michelle bachelet for sluggish economic growth in the world s top copper exporter .
but it would be considered a letdown for bachelet s center-left base and a younger generation of urban chileans , who hope for deeper changes to the country s longstanding , free-market economic model .
the election is scheduled for nov. 19 , but if no candidate receives more than 50 percent of the vote , a second-round runoff between the top two candidates will be held in december .
the poll of 1,424 chileans conducted from sept. 22 to oct. 16 has a margin of error of three percentage points .
