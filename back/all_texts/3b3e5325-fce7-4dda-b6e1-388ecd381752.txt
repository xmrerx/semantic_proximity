For the last few weeks, rumors have been swirling that delegates at the Republican National Convention have been concocting a plan to thwart Donald Trump s nomination and broker the convention, ushering in a candidate who isn t completely hated by the American people.Reince Priebus denied it.
Donald Trump denied it.
All Republican insiders denied it and said things were on their merry way to Columbus.But as it turns out, the delegate coup is concrete, and is currently in motion.
Anti-Trump delegates, concerned for the future of their party (and their power), are requesting a rule change for the convention that will allow delegates pledged to Trump to opt out, and instead vote their conscience.In other words, this rule change would turn every delegate into a super delegate.The letter, sent by Colorado delegate Kendal Unruh, asked the committee to adopt a conscience clause into the rules, thus circumventing the delegate rules and procedures set up by the states:If any such delegate notifies the secretary of his or her intent to cast a vote of conscience, whether personal or religious, each such delegate shall be unbound and unconstrained by these rules on any given vote, including the first ballot for the selection of the president of the United States, without the risk of challenge, sanction or retribution by the Republican National Committee (RNC).The letter went on to justify how a delegate, who is bound by the rules of the state to represent the will of the people, could possibly decide they want to vote another way:Allowable personal reasons shall include the public disclosure of one or more any grievous acts of personal conduct by a nominee candidate, including but not limited to, criminally actionable acts, acts of moral turpitude or extreme prejudice, and/or notorious public statements of support for positions that clearly oppose or contradict the policies embodied in the Republican Party s platform as established at the national convention.So far, 30 delegates have been in the works to thwart the presumptive nominee, but a rule change from the RNC could spur more action if delegates felt, all of a sudden, a change of conscience.Running a group called the Free the Delegates, Unruh is hoping to secure a majority vote from the 112 member Rules Committee.Such an action would expose a very real and very damning rift within the Republican party.
