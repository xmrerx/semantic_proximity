mark steyn on trump s move last night : @ marksteynonline pic.twitter.com/cm21gvlfww fox & friends ( @ foxandfriends ) april 7 , 2017gen .
jack keane said this is a major setback for russia and iran , close allies of the regime of syrian president bashar-al assad .
these airstrikes are a sign that the u.s. is open to taking a more aggressive role in the syrian civil war .
this is an incredible message .
it should have been sent many years ago by the obama administration .
mark steyn nails it on intervention in syria : mark steyn nailed it when he said that president trump should be cautious about using american power to overthrow a dictator without a very clear endgame : to go back to the democrats most notorious debacle , hillary thought knocking off gaddafi in libya would be easy and cost-free .
what we know now is that it left a power vacuum and further destabilized the middle east .
you ve got to have an endgame here .
you ve got to know what you want syria to look like after assad , or it s a waste of time .
trump has been very clear that he regards running around afghanistan for 15 years as a complete waste of time .
he doesn t want to get into a similar situation .
the comments begin on syria at the 3:00 mark :
