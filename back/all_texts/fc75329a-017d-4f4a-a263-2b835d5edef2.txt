For years, conservatives have been attacking President Obama for supposedly taking too many vacations and playing golf.
There was even a website set up to supposedly keep track of every outing.President Obama was even dubbed the Golfer-in-Chief as an insult.However, now that Donald Trump will be the guy who will sit in the Oval Office, being called the Golfer-in-Chief is suddenly a proud title.After Golf Digest did a piece on Trump, they made this the cover, and Eric Trump tweeted it out!Thank you to @GolfDigest for this incredible feature!
"Golfer-in-Chief" @RealDonaldTrump https://t.co/vpdY4jNbI4 pic.twitter.com/Q5fzH4fpmH Eric Trump (@EricTrump) January 17, 2017With dear old dad retweeting it, of course:via TwitterNow, Golfer-in-Chief is apparently a term of endearment and no longer an insult.Will hypocritical conservatives nationwide, who once slammed Obama for daring to take a moment off for 9-18 rounds of golf also slam Trump?
Highly unlikely.
They will likely say Trump deserves a little downtime to play a few rounds of golf whenever he pleases.After all, Trump is the hypocrite-in-chief so it s rather befitting.It s as if they are all goldfish, and nothing before today ever happened.
Everything is shiny and new and insults are now terms of adoration.
If Trump does it, it s magical.
If Obama did it, it was evil.
Even if it s the same f*cking thing.Featured Photo by Jeff J Mitchell via Getty Images
