It should be the easiest question in America to answer, especially in Massachusetts, but the Republican governor flubbed it and drew the ire of the audience.Massachusetts new Republican governor proved that he is just like every other bigoted Republican in the country after he failed to throw his support behind a bill moving through the state legislature that would provide anti-discrimination protection to LGBT people.As Governor Charlie Baker took questions during a corporate networking event, he was asked whether he would sign the bill into law unlike other Republican governors in the South who signed laws legalizing discrimination in their states.Again, this is an easy question to answer.
This is the United States and discrimination is not a value this nation holds.Of course, being a Republican, Baker chose to sidestep the question instead and refused to give a definitive answer.
We should not discriminate against anyone here in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, Baker said.
But then he declared that he would listen to both sides on the issue, which means he would allow bigots the chance to persuade him to enshrine bigotry in the state, likely using the guise of religious liberty as the excuse of choice.That s when the audience turned on Baker and began booing him and shouting him down until he left the stage and the building.Lorelei Erisis, who attended the event, slammed Baker for not distancing himself from the extremist Republicans in states like North Carolina and Mississippi, which passed anti-LGBT laws that have brought economic backlash.
I mean that s not even a very brave thing to say, to say that he would sign a bill, if it came before his desk.
And if he had done that, it would have given him the moderate Republican image that he s trying to have, Erisis said.Here s the video via YouTube.All Baker had to say is that he would sign a bill protecting LGBT people from discrimination.
That s it.But he didn t. Instead, he teeter-tottered and angered the audience.
And to add insult to injury, Baker s office issued a statement claiming to support a 2011 law that expanded protections but still refused to say that he would support the new bill, saying only that he would review it.To be blunt, Baker is a coward who had a chance to distinguish himself as a moderate Republican who has no connection to the bigoted Republicans who dominate his party at the moment.
Governor John Bel Edwards certainly didn t shy away when he had a chance to sign an executive order protecting LGBT people, and he s a Democrat in the deep red state of Louisiana.And when the Governor of Louisiana is more courageous on the issue of LGBT rights than the Governor of Massachusetts, that s a sign that Massachusetts voters picked the wrong candidate to lead them.Featured Image: Screenshot
