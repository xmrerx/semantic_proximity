Once again, Bette Midler has taken to her Twitter account to voice a political opinion.
It is widely known that the GOP has decided to block any SCOTUS nominee President Barack Obama might propose in the wake of Justice Antonin Scalia s death, and Midler, like all sane people, is none too happy about that.
In fact, she is downright furious.
This time, Midler has turned one of the GOP s favorite anti-liberal and anti-Democrat insults right back on them, and called House Majority Leader Mitch McConnell just what he is if you re religious that is the Anti Christ.
Here is the tweet:It' s official!
MITCH MCCONNELL IS THE ANTICHRIST!
In his latest insult to this President, he refuses to even MEET Mr Obama's SCOTUS pick!
Bette Midler (@BetteMidler) February 24, 2016This comes on the heels of even more blatant obstruction and disrespect on the part of McConnell, who has decided that he won t even trouble himself to go and say hello to any Obama SCOTUS pick.
Doesn t matter who it is the decision was Obama s, and therefore he can t stoop to the level of even putting up the pretense of caring what this person might have to say, what (s)he might be like, or what his or her credentials and qualifications might be.The Divine Ms. M then went on to say just what everyone knows the current crop of GOPers to be: criminals.
She sent out another fiery tweet:These obstructionists are criminals.
