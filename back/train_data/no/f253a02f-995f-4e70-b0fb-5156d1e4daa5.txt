toronto ( reuters ) - a canadian pastor whom north korea released this month after two years of imprisonment escaped execution and torture during his captivity because of his nationality , he told cbc news in his first interview since his return .
hyeon soo lim , the pastor from toronto , said in an interview broadcast on saturday that he was never harmed and that he would not hesitate to go back to north korea if the country allowed him .
a transcript of the interview was posted on the canadian public broadcaster s website .
if i m just korean , maybe they kill me , lim said .
i m canadian so they can not , because they can not kill the foreigners .
lim , formerly the senior pastor at one of canada s largest churches , had disappeared on a mission to north korea in early 2015 .
he was sentenced to hard labor for life in december 2015 on charges of attempting to overthrow the pyongyang regime .
he said north korea treated him well despite forcing him to dig holes and break coal by hand all day in a labor camp .
lim told cbc news that he was coached and coerced into confessing that he traveled under the guise of humanitarian work as part of a subversive plot to overthrow the government and set up a religious state .
north korea let him go on humanitarian grounds .
the announcement came during heightened tensions between washington and pyongyang , although authorities have not said there was any connection between his release and efforts to defuse the standoff over north korea s nuclear program .
lim said he felt no anger at the kim jong un regime for sentencing him to prison .
no , i thanked north korea , he said .
i forgive them .
