Following Michael Flynn s resignation after he was busted lying about the nature of his conversations with the Russians, Donald Trump came clean with America: he admitted that Flynn had discussed sanctions during those conversations and pledged to launch an investigation into the full extent of his dealings with a hostile foreign power in some alternate reality.
In this one, he threw a tantrum on Twitter because he s a child.
The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington?
Will these leaks be happening as I deal on N.Korea etc?
Trump tweeted Tuesday morning.The real story here is why are there so many illegal leaks coming out of Washington?

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 14, 2017That s right the fact that we, the American people, found out that Flynn had been colluding with the same government that hacked our election on Trump s behalf and ran an aggressive propaganda campaign to discredit Hillary Clinton, is the issue.
Not that it was happening in the first place.
Not that Trump fired the acting Attorney General shortly after she warned him that Flynn had lied.
To Trump, the real issue is that we are finding out what is going on.Ironically, he seems to be unaware that one of his guests at the Mar-a-Lago snapped photos of the guy carrying the nuclear football and named him on social media or, of course, that all of his guests had a full view of secure documents as Trump perused them over dinner by the lights of his minions cell phone flashlights.Bannon & Flynn used phone flashlights for Trump read most secure N Korea docs w/waiters serving.
Maybe Rs can scream more about HRC emails https://t.co/e7Dj8CaH8M Gene Sperling (@genebsperling) February 13, 2017The Verge recently published a video demonstrating how easy it is to hack a cell phone camera: The concern is a hot mic attack, in which a hacker uses the compromised phone to record private conversations.
But as our demo showed, it s just as easy to compromise the camera, allowing the attacker to see whatever is in front of the phone, the publication s Russell Brandom writes in an article on the North Korea dinner debacle.
That s usually not as useful, provided the target doesn t physically hold up the phone and point it at sensitive intelligence documents, but here we are.
In other words, the only problems are Trump and his team, and the only concern of compromised intelligence lies with him and the people he selected to run our country into the ground.Naturally, Americans reminded him who is the boss:@realDonaldTrumpYour administration got caught breaking the law then lying about it.Flynn didn t lie to Pence.You lied to us.

Ben Berkon (@BenBerkon) February 14, 2017@chrissyteigen @realDonaldTrump It's also what happens when you review sensitive info in crowded dining room w/ guests & staffers around Brian Leibforth (@bleibforth) February 14, 2017@realDonaldTrump and to answer your question: yes.
As long as you continue to try to treat America like the Titanic, the leaks will continue Alex Zalben (@azalben) February 14, 2017@realDonaldTrump YOU DEALT WITH NORTH KOREA IN PLAIN SIGHT OF ALL THE OTHER RICH KIDS AT MAR A LOOGEY YOU CHODE Sara Schaefer (@saraschaefer1) February 14, 2017You mean leaks like this @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/FSTl0XTO5K Khary Penebaker (@kharyp) February 14, 2017@realDonaldTrump hey if youre concerned about N Korea leaks maybe don't deal with international crises in the middle of a fucking restaurant i have died (@ChrisCaesar) February 14, 2017@realDonaldTrump You mean the leaks that are coming from your own staff?

Megarock Radio (@megarockradio) February 14, 2017@realDonaldTrump So you're saying Flynn would still be there, but for the leaks?
No, Twitler, your tweet just became the real story.
Skeller85 (@skeller85) February 14, 2017The Intercept notes that Trump makes the lives of foreign spies so easy that they must be bored :Tommy Vietor, a former National Security Council spokesperson for President Obama, pointed to another vulnerability exposed by the scene at Mar-a-Lago: the possibility that waiters at the club, who continued dinner service during the discussion of North Korea s missile test, could be recruited by foreign intelligence services.For a clue as to just how easy that might be, consider that the Palm Beach Post reported in December that Mar-a-Lago hires dozens of temporary foreign workers each year, using the federal government s H-2B visa program.It was not immediately clear where the foreign workers at Mar-a-Lago come from, but another club in the area told members that workers hired under the same visa program come from Romania, Ireland, and South Africa.Donald Trump represents perhaps the greatest danger our nation has ever faced and it is up to each and every one of us to oppose him in every way possible.#Resist.Featured image via screengrab
