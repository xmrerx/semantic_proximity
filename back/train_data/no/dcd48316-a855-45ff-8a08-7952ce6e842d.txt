one would think that conservatives would have figured out by now that they can t get people to turn out for their marches and protests .
that seems to be especially true with trump in office .
so many more people are against him than for him , yet these delusional trumpkins still think they re some kind of majority in this country.witness their enthusiasm for today s march 4 trump .
it was supposed to be a counter to the women s march on washington that happened all over the world the day after trump s inauguration .
the women s march drew well more than two million people just in the u.s .
the march 4 trump must have been overwhelming then , given all that support trump and his loyal subjects think they have.and overwhelming these marches were , in their own way the lack of support they showed for trump is actually what was overwhelming .
most of these protests drew dozens , rather than the thousands they seemed to think they were going to get .
for instance , in orlando , roughly 200 people showed up , compared to the 5,000 that showed up in january for the women s march.denver had just dozens , where 145,000 had marched in january .
in our nation s capital , trumpers were hoping that they could draw more than half a million , which would rival the women s march there .
they drew a few thousand at best , despite trump s claim that marches for him would be the biggest marches of all : here at the yuge rally for trump at the white house pic.twitter.com/aj5gcmicyr brian tashman ( @ briantashman ) march 4 , 2017the # trumptrain is in town and standing strong for @ potus.i will be articulating the case for # trump shortly , friends. # march4trump pic.twitter.com/zdh682s7vk michael johns ( @ michaeljohns ) march 4 , 2017here s the march at trump tower in new york city : literally the march 4 trump pic.twitter.com/of8vchb8nq eric grant ( @ ericgrant ) march 4 , 2017small crowd at the march 4 trump .

trump supporters keep trying to tell the resistance to get over it , and give up , and ultimately call us treasonous for daring to oppose a dangerous orange despot in the white house .
if they truly had the love and support they think , their protests would blow anti-trump protests out of the water every time .
doesn t look like we re the ones who need to get over anything.featured image via screen capture
