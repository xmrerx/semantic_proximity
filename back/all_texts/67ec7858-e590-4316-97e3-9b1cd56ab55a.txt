Eric Trump gives a great interview on Fox and Friends this morning.
Trump s kids always come across as very likable and respectful young adults who are, understandably incredibly proud of their father.
Eric covers a lot of territory in this interview.
He talks about Hillary, Ted Cruz, his dad s passion for fixing our nation, the Holiday Inn Express where Donald stayed in Iowa, and how he wasn t raised with a silver spoon in his mouth.
