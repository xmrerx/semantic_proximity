Hillary s been using churches across America as a backdrop to promote the violent Black Lives Matter movement in an effort to pander for black votes.
She proves every day how little respect she has for our religious institutions, the Christian community and more specifically, the Catholic church and it s backwards members.
Will Catholics finally see the writing on the wall this election, or will they elect a woman who will unquestionably nominate Supreme Court Justices who are hell-bent on destroying our religious rights?Outraged by the anti-Catholic bigotry displayed in leaked Team Clinton emails this week, the powerful Philadelphia bishop blasted both President Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton for their efforts to undermine church teachings.In his weekly column for the Archdiocese of Philadelphia, Archbishop Charles Chaput Thursday demanded that Clinton repudiate the emails then added that he doesn t expect her to.Mocking the theme in the emails that Catholics are backward thinking for views on abortion, marriage and other core issues, Chaput wrote, Of course it would be wonderful for the Clinton campaign to repudiate the content of these ugly WikiLeaks emails.
All of us backward-thinking Catholics who actually believe what Scripture and the Church teach would be so very grateful.
