One of America s most legendary journalists, Dan Rather, used his gift with words for a very special purpose on Wednesday: to blast Donald Trump and rally the press against the dangerous candidate.In a brilliant Facebook post, Rather urged his fellow journalists to keep holding Trump accountable and cornering the presumptive Republican nominee on the tough issues.
Rather had felt an obligation to write the post after watching The Donald attack the press during a news conference on Tuesday.
Rather said that when he watched Trump resort to bullying reporters to avoid questions about controversial issues like his suspicious donations to veterans organizations, he felt a shudder down my spine.
The legendary newsroom wrote: This is a dirty, nasty election.
And it is only going to get worse.
The reporters in the trenches need no lecture from me.
They are walking through daily minefields, bracing themselves against winds of discontent whose effects no one can predict.
Rather is speaking from firsthand experience.
In 1968, during the Democratic Convention, Rather worked through chaos and riots so that he could continue to question delegates and politicians.
His tireless dedication resulted in this famous clip, which captures Rather getting punched in the stomach on national television:Noting that today s reporters are up against the same accusations of press bias and hostility that has followed American politics over the years, Rather noted that this particular election is different thanks to the brash business mogul.
Rather singled out Trump for his air of violence and intimidation tactics that cause many press members to stay silent.
To those who might be afraid of getting caught in Trump s line of fire, Rather reminds today s journalists that the pen is still mightier than the sword and that they should not back up, back down, back away or turn around .
