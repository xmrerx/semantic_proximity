The Republican nominee just got owned by a fellow billionaire.To begin the Late Show on Wednesday night, Stephen Colbert introduced Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban for a special Take The Gloves Off segment.Cuban bragged that he is twice the billionaire that Trump is and then set out to roast him.And Cuban did NOT hold back as he dropped burn after burn with Colbert popping in and out to chime in with his own hilarious quips.
Donald, the gloves are off.
Speaking of gloves, I got you a pair for your birthday.
You re a child s medium, right?
Cuban began.
Donald, I ve got a travel tip for you.
When you re going through customs and they ask if you ve got anything to declare, try not to blurt out bankruptcy, he continued.
That s a billionaire bitch slap, Colbert observed.
Your companies fail so often, you must ve gone to business school at Trump University, Cuban said, to which Colbert replied, Oh, Donald he just dropped you like one of your first two wives.
Cuban then dropped the hammer on Trump.
Donald, do you know that to be a billionaire, you have to have the billion part in your bank account.
Not just the air.
And finally: Donald, the only way you re worth $10 billion is if I paid you $9.5 billion to wash my balls!
Here s the video via YouTube.Cuban went on to explain later in the show that he became a supporter of the #NeverTrump movement because while he initially believed Trump would bring a business perspective to the White House instead of just a typical politician he soon changed his tune after Trump opened his mouth.
Plus, Trump is just lazy.
Cuban also joked that Trump is so embarrassing that he and his fellow billionaires voted to kick him out of their club and that they even changed the secret handshake.Featured image via Screenshot
