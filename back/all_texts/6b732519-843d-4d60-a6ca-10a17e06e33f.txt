Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel is really working hard to make Chicagoans feel a part of the city the only problem is he s focusing his efforts on the illegal aliens who live there.
To add insult to injury, Chicago s murder rate is sky high with no end in sight but, but, but the illegals have a new fancy ID to give them the same benefits as everyone else in the city at a cost of millions to taxpayers.
The card is free to the freeloaders while the taxpayers foot the bill The name municipal ID was initially floated for the program, but Emanuel revealed that Chicago s city IDs would actually be called City Keys.
He said City Keys were designed to give a person who doesn t have an ID or a driver s license essentially the same benefits as those who do.
When somebody says, Can I see your driver s license?
what that unlocks and what that smooths out and all the speed bumps that literally get eliminated because you have a driver s license, Emanuel said.The mayor says the IDs will also provide benefits including discounts at cultural centers, on public transit and for veterans and senior citizens at locations across the city.
Chicagoans will be able to link their public transit and library card to the ID and potentially even open bank accounts with it.Critics of the program say it might be a way for undocumented workers or people illegally in the U.S. to obtain a valid ID.GREAT POINT!Read more: Fox News
