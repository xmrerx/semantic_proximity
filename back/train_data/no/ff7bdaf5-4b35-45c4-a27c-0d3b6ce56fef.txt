sarajevo ( reuters ) - a military helicopter lands to evacuate people wounded during a police raid against terrorists who took hostages at sarajevo airport - part of the first joint drill by the eu peacekeeping force ( eufor ) in bosnia and local army and police .
in the exercise , part of the drill dubbed quick response 2017 , sarajevo is hit by severe flooding , and eufor flies in to help the population .
there are also protests across the country and a risk of terrorist groups linked to organized crime rings smuggling arms and fake documents .
this was a realistic exercise and an opportunity to demonstrate that we have capacities , power and determination to quickly and efficiently respond to any security threat , said bosnia s security minister dragan mektic .
more than 20 years since the end of its war in the 1990s , bosnia is still troubled by ethnic politicking and external influences .
while separatist aspirations by the bosnian serb and croat nationalists grow stronger , there is also a threat of radicalization among traditionally moderate bosnian muslims .
the five-day drill , by the 600- strong eufor along with 400 british and nato troops , also includes reconnaissance and surveillance of wide areas across bosnia .
in 2015 , parts of bosnia were hit by the greatest flooding in a century , leaving thousands without homes and hurting the economy .
the same year , two soldiers and a police officer were killed in separate terrorist attacks .
eufor was deployed in bosnia in late 2004 , replacing nato s sfor force to maintain security after the 1992-95 war .
its mandate has been repeatedly extended .
while bosnia s central authorities want to join nato , bosnian serbs , who prefer stronger ties with russia , oppose that and have threatened to hold a referendum on the issue .
