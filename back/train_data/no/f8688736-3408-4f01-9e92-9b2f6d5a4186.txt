conakry ( reuters ) - a two-day skirmish between guinean and malian villagers over control of a gold mine that straddles the countries joint border killed at least 17 people , a government official in guinea said on tuesday .
villagers in both countries lay claim to the zone s rich underground deposits , which have lured thousands of people to work in unregulated small-scale mines along the border .
artisanal gold mining , conducted with rudimentary tools , is a key source of income in both mali and guinea , but poses numerous safety risks , including frequent mine collapses .
there are five dead on the guinean side and 12 dead on the malian side , said cheick mohamed diallo , prefect of the town of mandiana in eastern guinea .
a witness on the guinean side of the border said the villagers fought each other with firearms and bladed weapons .
the fighting has ceased , local resident cheikh keita said , but the situation remained tense on tuesday .
a similar incident occurred in february 2015 , when guinean miners killed three malian nationals in a fight over a gold discovery .
