Obama has filled his cabinet with radical yes men and women who hold similar anti-American, leftist views.
His radical Treasury Secretary, Jack Lew is no exception.Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced yesterday that Alexander Hamilton s face will remain on the front of the $10 bill and Harriet Tubman will replace Andrew Jackson on the face of the $20 bill.What the Left forgot in their haste to replace a racist white (Democrat) President on the front of the $20 bill was the fact that Harriet Tubman was more than just a black abolitionist, she also serves as an excellent example of why our Second Amendment is so important.Harriet Tubman (born Araminta Harriet Ross; 1820 March 10, 1913) was an African-American abolitionist, humanitarian, and Union spy during the American Civil War.
She carried a revolver, and was not afraid to use it .
.
.Once a slave agreed to join her expedition, there was no turning back; she threatened to shoot anyone who tried to return.
Tubman told the tale of one journey with a group of fugitive slaves, when morale sank and one man insisted he was going to go back to the plantation.She pointed the gun at his head and said, You go on or die.
Several days later, he was with the group as they entered Canada.
It is more than likely that Tubman carried the handgun as protection from ever-present slave catchers and their dogs.Via: The Truth About GunsBreaking: Treasury throws founder of the Democratic Party off $20 bill, replaces with gun-toting Republican pic.twitter.com/G9dVXpTaXv David Burge (@iowahawkblog) April 20, 2016Tubman s reliance on her firearms to fulfill her mission of freeing slaves was essential.
So it only seems fitting that the US Treasury would use this picture of Republican, Harriet Tubman to replace the first Democrat President of the United States, Andrew Jackson.
