Since most of the actors and producers in Hollywood will either be in treatment, or out of a job, for sexually harassing, or abusing women, men and children in the industry, the Academy Awards show will be taking on a new theme this year.Now that the culture of rot in Hollywood has been exposed, there will be a new awards ceremony to replace the once prestigious Academy Awards show.
The new show will be called the Biggest Groper Awards , and it will honor the creeps in Hollywood, who for decades sexually abused anyone in their paths while fawning over the politics of the most well-known sexual predator to ever roam the halls of the White House.
The award will also pay homage to all of the celebrities who recently supported Hillary s campaign for President, the woman who gave Bill Clinton the green light to sexually assault multiple women, while she threatened to harm any of the women who dared to come forward.
