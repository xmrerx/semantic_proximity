The outspoken liberal comedian posed for a photo shoot with controversial photographer Tyler Shields in which she was seen holding a bloodied mask of President Trump.Donald Trump was quick to condemn her on Twitter:TMZ later reported that 11-year old Barron Trump actually saw the image of his bloodied and decapitated father while watching TV.TMZ reports: Barron Trump was watching TV & saw @kathygriffin holding the severed head.
He thought it was his dad.
My heart is broken.
Liz Wheeler (@Liz_Wheeler) May 31, 2017Melania Trump weighed in on the horrific image her 11-yr old son was subjected to with this statement: As a mother, a wife, and a human being, that photo is very disturbing.
When you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today, a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it.
It s a question a lot of comedians are asking themselves lately: What should comedy look like during the Trump presidency?
Now more than ever we must absolutely go for all the absurdities, Kathy Griffin told Vulture at the Equality Now Gala Tuesday night.
For me, that s Trump and all things Trump.
It s not about trying to be an equal-opportunity offender anymore because Hillary got such a beat down.
It s his turn.
So I m happy to deliver beat down to Donald Trump and also to Barron.
You know a lot of comics are going to go hard for Donald, my edge is that I ll go direct for Barron.
I m going to get in ahead of the game.
So, of course, Griffin supported Rosie O Donnell when she tweeted a video asking if Barron Trump, 10-year-old son of Donald and Melania, was on the autism spectrum.
After the beat down he gave her, she can say whatever she wants to say to that piece of shit, Griffin said before correcting herself.
Oh, that s President Piece of Shit.
