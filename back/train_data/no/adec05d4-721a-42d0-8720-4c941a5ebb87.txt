baghdad ( reuters ) - the iraqi government has a series of conditions that the kurdish regional government ( krg ) must meet before agreeing to hold talks on the crisis triggered by last month s independence referendum , a government spokesman said on thursday .
the krg must first commit to iraq s unity , the spokesman told reuters , reacting to an offer for dialogue made wednesday overnight by the kurdish authorities .
the local authorities in the ( kurdistan ) region ( .. ) must accept the sovereign authority of the federal government on ( .. ) oil exports , security and border protection , including land and air entry points , he added .
the krg must also acknowledge the authority of the federal government over the so-called disputed regions , he said , in a reference to areas claimed by both the kurds and baghdad , including multi-ethnic oil-rich kirkuk , in northern iraq .
kurdish peshmerga fighters moved into kirkuk when the iraqi army collapsed in the face of islamic state in 2014 , preventing the region s oil field from falling into the hands of the militants .
iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi last week suggested that kirkuk be administered jointly , by the krg and the iraqi government , but under the authority of baghdad .
this is the basis for any dialogue requested by the local government of the region , the spokesman said .
