After a year and half of doing nothing but dividing Americans on the campaign trail, Donald Trump is now whining about how divided this country has become.Once again using Twitter as his platform to display his hypocrisy, Trump had the gall to forcefully and angrily complain that America is too untrusting and divided and declared that things will change when he takes office on January 20th.
You know, because Trump is delusional and thinks that he is the magic solution to all of America s problems.For many years our country has been divided, angry and untrusting.
Many say it will never change, the hatred is too deep.
IT WILL CHANGE!!!!

Matt Haig (@matthaig1) January 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump Also, if you want to stop people being angry, shouting in block caps at the end of every tweet may not be the best tactic.

paladine (@paladine) January 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump Could you please start by modeling empathy for groups who regularly face discrimination and hatred?
Many people are scared.
Raymond Braun (@raymondbraun) January 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump your rallies and words have given permission to your low-information voters to be angry, distrusting, and hate-filled Tony Webster (@webster) January 15, 2017Then one Twitter user really let Trump have it by listing all the things he needs to do if he wants Americans to take his call for unity seriously.
@realDonaldTrump You have not done ONE SINGLE THING to make this a credible statement.

Soleia (@soleia79) January 15, 2017But we all know Trump won t do that because he s a hypocrite.For eight years, Donald Trump has done nothing but divide this nation with his birtherism and attacks against President Obama.
Now that he is about to take over the White House, he deserves the exact same treatment.
And he only has himself to blame.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images
