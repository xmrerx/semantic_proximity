Bill Hemmer let Mitch McConnell have it but McConnell was looking like a deer in the headlights with a blank stare on his face: People on the outside see this and think that that s just Washington doing what Washington wants to do.
And, damn the laws.
And, you know what s going on in the campaign trail, Democrat or Republican.
That s why Bernie Sanders is getting 15,000 people at a rally.
That s why Donald Trump is at 32% of the polling right now.
People do not like what is coming out of Washington and they think the smell stinks.
