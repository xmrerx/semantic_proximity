With Trump in the White House, former CBS Evening News anchor Dan Rather has an awful lot to say, probably because he s been around the political block a couple thousand times, and Trump is a dangerous buffoon, the likes of which we ve never seen.
He doesn t comment on everything, and he apparently didn t want to comment on Trump s idea that Andrew Jackson was angry about the Civil War.
But he sees something in that absurdity that he felt he needed to point out.According to his Facebook post on the topic, the sheer craziness of this obsession by Donald Trump with Andrew Jackson and the Civil War is a carnival act unlike anything I have ever seen at the White House.
These are the rantings of someone who really should be focused on the job of governing.
Should we not conclude that he approaches policy decisions with the same half-baked conspiracies with which he apparently approaches history?
Trump, at the very least, has been approaching his presidency with the grand level of ignorance with which he approaches history.
He recently told Reuters that he didn t think being the president would be so hard.
He also said that nobody knew healthcare could be so complicated.Sure, Trump.
The only people who did know are, well, pretty much everyone with the most basic understanding of our current political situation.That isn t all Rather blasted Trump about.
He also dropped this truth bomb, with hell of a burn at the end, on Trump: To be President of the United States is to part of the great American story.
To not understand that story is to not understand the presidency.
Maybe Frederick Douglass can give Mr. Trump some advice.
Apparently, he s an example of somebody who s done an amazing job and is getting recognized more and more.
