The gay mafia has hijacked pretty much aspect of our lives.
They apparently won t be happy until every trace of gender identity has been erased.
When will Americans start fighting back?
Two daycare workers have been fired for refusing to go along with the center s transgender agenda.
Madeline Kirksey, one of the workers who is an author of a Christian book, says her religious liberty rights have been violated.
The two were fired after refusing to call a little girl a boy.The two male parents of a six-year-old little girl told employees at the school to refer to their daughter as a boy, and to call her by a new masculine name.
The little girl s hair had also been cut like a boy s.Kirksey told Breitbart Texas in an interview, that the problem was not so much with the transgender issue as it was with telling young children that the little girl was a boy when she was not, and with calling her John (not the name given) when that was not her name.She, and another worker who does not want to be identified, were fired from the Childrens Lighthouse Learning Center in Katy, Texas, a city just west of Houston.The school distributed guidelines to the teachers called How to Handle Transgender Students.
The printed guidelines were obtained from the internet and can be read at this link.The guidelines and the instructions given the teachers included six rules, one of which was Help defend their dignity.
Another, was to Educate yourself and your students.
The Christian worker said she did not believe it was our job, to thrust the issue on the small children of other parents.
She said the school should not force their beliefs on the children, or on her, or upon other parents.The author of the Christian book, In Pursuit of the Promise, said the other children should not be exposed at such an early age to the issue of transgender or gender identity, and felt that the two male parents were imposing the issue on their little girl.
I don t think we should be talking to other people s children who are under the age of 18 about being transgender, Kirksey said in an interview with Fox26 in Houston.
Both of the fired workers agreed on this point.Kirksey said that prior to this happening, she had been commended for the good work that she was doing at the school.
After she refused to call the little girl by her new masculine name, and to tell the other children to do so, and to say that the little girl was a little boy, the daycare worker was written-up for alleged infractions that she did not believe were based in reality.
She has worked at the school for over a year.The fired worker notified Child Protective Services that the little girl was being told that she is now a little boy.
She believes that it is up to professionals to determine if the little girl is just confused, or if the new gender is being forced upon the little girl.Kirksey says sometimes the little girl refers to herself as a little boy, and sometimes she tells the other children to not call her a boy or to refer to her by her masculine name.The Childrens Lighthouse in Katy is just one of the school franchise s that are all over the country.
The company is based in Fort Worth and according to its website, there are 37 learning centers in seven states.
The school cares for children ages six weeks to twelve years old.
