when former tea party congressman joe walsh decided to lash out at president obama over a u.n. resolution condemning illegal israeli settlements , it didn t go well.earlier this week , the united nations passed a formal resolution condemning israel s continued refusal to stop building settlements on palestinian land .
predictably , conservatives lost their sh * t and have been attacking obama and the united nations ever since.joe walsh , after having been praised for ripping donald trump a new one for refusing to acknowledge that russia meddled with the election , decided that he missed being despised .
so he accused president obama of being a muslim because he thinks only a muslim would refuse to block a resolution condemning israel.for the past week , everybody has been asking again why obama hates israel .
the answer is simple really : i think obama is muslim .
/1 joe walsh ( @ walshfreedom ) december 29 , 2016i ve been saying that for awhile now .
it makes the gop uneasy when i say he s a muslim .
it makes my radio stations uneasy when i say it .
/2 joe walsh ( @ walshfreedom ) december 29 , 2016i say it because i believe it .
look , i know there are many other radio talk show hosts , many other members of congress /3 joe walsh ( @ walshfreedom ) december 29 , 2016 many other fox news personalities who privately believe obama is muslim but are afraid to say it publicly in fear of losing ratings .
/4 joe walsh ( @ walshfreedom ) december 29 , 2016for better or worse , i m not afraid to say it publicly .
i think obama is muslim .
i think in his head and in his heart he has always been .
/5 joe walsh ( @ walshfreedom ) december 29 , 2016and i think it explains obama s hatred toward israel and explains his weakening of america these past 8 years.it s not complicated .
/x joe walsh ( @ walshfreedom ) december 29 , 2016and twitter users promptly buried walsh for his idiocy and bigotry .
