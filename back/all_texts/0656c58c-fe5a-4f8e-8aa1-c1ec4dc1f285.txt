We told you about the fancy affair Obama was planning to host at the White House for black rappers last week.
The latest development with the ankle bracelet on a criminal rapper makes you want to scream, Are you kidding me?
An attempt by President Obama to promote his My Brother s Keeper initiative, which aims to keep youths of color out of trouble, came to a farcical end when rapper Rick Ross s ankle bracelet which he received on a kidnapping and assault charge went off.Obama had invited a bevy of hip-hop heavyweights, including Niki Minaj, Common, Busta Rhymes, Pusha T and DJ Khaled, to the meeting at the White House Friday.But none of them least of all Ross himself expected the ankle bracelet to interrupt the president, according to TMZ.Obama reportedly invited the stars to the serious and fancy affair, which was not made public before the event, to promote the initiative.It was so serious, in fact, that Ross, who is typically photographed topless to show off his impressive all-over body tattoos, wore a smart suit and a pair of black Adidas sneakers.That suit conveniently covered the ankle bracelet that he received after last year s kidnapping, assault and battery charges.
Unfortunately, it wasn t able to block the sound of his new anklet s random beeps one of which went off just as Obama was finishing his speech.Even the self-styled Hood Billionaire was surprised at the sound, a source said.He later posted a picture of himself and DJ Khaled talking after the event on his Instagram account.
