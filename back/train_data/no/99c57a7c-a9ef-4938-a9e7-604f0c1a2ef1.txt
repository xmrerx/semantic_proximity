( this story corrects date of election to nov. 8 from nov. 3 in eighth paragraph ) by alana wise washington ( reuters ) - a federal judge on wednesday dismissed a lawsuit against republican presidential front-runner donald trump ’ s modeling agency , saying there was insufficient evidence a foreign-born model had been misled or was owed back pay .
u.s. district judge analisa torres found that alexia palmer had not provided proof that trump model management llc fraudulently applied for a u.s. visa for her or that she had been denied fair wages .
attorneys for both palmer and the modeling agency could not be immediately reached for comment .
lawyers for trump , who owns the agency but was not named directly in the suit , have called the case “ frivolous ” and “ without merit. ” palmer , a jamaica native , sued in october 2014 , alleging that for her three-year contract with the agency , she was promised a $ 75,000-a-year salary , but received just $ 3,880.75 .
she sought $ 250,000 in back pay .
the lawsuit also alleged palmer ’ s experience was part of a grander scheme to “ lure foreign models to the united states ” and cheat them out of their pay .
but torres said there was not enough evidence to prove that palmer had worked the requisite number of hours over the three years to justify a minimum hourly wage complaint or warrant back pay .
the case ’ s dismissal was a setback for attorneys who sought to bring a class action against the agency on behalf of models .
a group lawsuit could have drawn additional attention to trump ’ s employment of foreign-born workers as he seeks the republican nomination for the nov. 8 election .
trump , a billionaire new york businessman , has acknowledged legally using foreign workers in his businesses but has said his experience would allow him to reform a visa system that can be easily manipulated .
the case is alexia palmer v. trump model management , et al. , u.s. district court , southern district of new york , no .
