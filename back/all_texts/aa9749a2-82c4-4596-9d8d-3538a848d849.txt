The Inauguration was a beautiful day full of great images BUT the images of the hate coming from anti-Trump protesters will shake you.
Inaugural ball attendees were spat upon and had water thrown at them.
The people trying to just walk from one area to the next were assaulted.
Bar patrons were even taunted with images of an ISIS beheading from a phone video.
Sick!
Is this what the Democrats represent?
Anarchy and chaos rules the day for the lefty lunatics.
One woman even tried to light another woman s hair on fire DC police are now asking for anyone to ID her so they can arrest her.
Luckily, a man in the video was seen putting the fire out.
Please watch the video below and hopefully someone will come forward:
