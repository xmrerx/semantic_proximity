MOSCOW (Reuters) - Prominent Russian political commentator and writer Yulia Latynina has left Russia fearing for her life, she told a Moscow radio station.
Latynina s car was set on fire at the beginning of September, weeks after unidentified assailants sprayed a poisonous substance on her house outside Moscow and the car.
I m quite scared ...
I m terrified that the people who did it were prepared for fatalities, Latynina said of the arson.
I m abroad, my parents are also abroad.
It s unlikely I ll be going to Russia soon, she told the Echo of Moscow radio station late Saturday.
Latynina, who works as a columnist at the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, has been critical of the Kremlin s policy in the Chechnya republic in the Caucasus, as well as the local authorities.
Last year, Latynina was attacked in the center of Moscow.
