tucker carlson had the head of the white house press association on tonight .it was a slugfest ! this was a tense exchange because it was a personal gripe from carlson who was speaking about the business of journalism .jeff mason was a deer in the headlights : highlights from the interview : tucker hit him hard when he said he d never seen a lamer speaker at the event ouch ! he went on to say , the whole evening was arranged around a guy who wasn t there president trumpthe best part of the interview was when he confirmed with a question that there a no republicans in the wh press corp how many registered republicans in the white house press corp ?
zero !
let s just drop the pretense the press in washington hates donald trump you ve got ta love tucker s hard hitting interview style with people like this .
he hammered home the truth and made the guy come clean about the bias in the washington press .
