robert parry consortium newsif doubt hillary clinton favour neoconservative foreign policy performance thursday debate lay rest
every meaningful sense neocon become president american expect global tension conflict pursuit neocon signature goal regime change country get waybeyond share neocon regime change obsession former secretary state clinton also talk like neocon
one trademark skill use propaganda perception management demonize target romanticize ally call glue white hat side glue black hat otherso defend role libyan regime change clinton call slain libyan leader muammar gaddafi genocidal though gross exaggeration gaddafi effort beat back islamic militant 2011
approach fit neocon
realize almost one dare challenge characterization open accusation gaddafi apologist
similarly iraq war neocon know could level pretty much charge saddam hussein matter false absurd knowing would go uncontested mainstream political medium circle
one want saddam apologist
clinton like neocon also show selective humanitarian outrage

united state israel must closer ever stronger ever determined ever prevail common adversary advance share value
especially true time israel face brutal terrorist stabbings shooting vehicle attack home
parent worry let child walk street
family live fear

instead scold palestinian adult
palestinian leader need stop incite violence stop celebrate terrorist martyr stop pay reward family saidthen clinton promise put future administration service israeli government

nobody stand assad remove clinton say far greater disaster syria currently deal right libya
word clinton still harbor regime change goal syria
problem always antiassad force penetrate al qaeda call islamic state
likely result clinton goal remove assad would collapse syrian security force victory al qaeda nusra front andor islamic stateif happen horrific situation syria would become cataclysmic
million syrian alawites shiite christian secularist infidel would flee beheading sword terror group
might well force fullscale u european invasion syria bloody outcome probably similar disastrous iraq warthe reasonable hope syria assad regime le radical sunni oppositionists work powersharing agreement stabilize country neutralize degree jihadist hold election let syrian people decide whether assad must go
