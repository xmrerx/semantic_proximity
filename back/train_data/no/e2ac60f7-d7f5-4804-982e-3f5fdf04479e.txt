mumbai ( reuters ) - a blaze in a building under construction in a suburb of the indian city of mumbai killed at least six people , most of them laborers , and injured nearly a dozen , fire and police officials said on thursday .
the cause of the fire , which broke out late on wednesday , was being investigated , a fire service officer said .
it is likely to compound concern about safety in the financial hub after an old building collapsed last week killing 34 people .
laborers working on the building were living on the ground floor , some with families , and cooking gas canisters were believed to have exploded in the fire , fuelling its spread .
though the fire was brought under control immediately , all injuries and deaths occurred before the arrival of the fire brigade , said p.s .
rahangdale , chief officer at the mumbai fire brigade .
eleven people were injured , eight of them critically , he said .
mumbai has endured torrential monsoon rain and serious flooding over recent weeks .
the building collapsed last week in a congested neighborhood of the old city after two days of intense downpours .
