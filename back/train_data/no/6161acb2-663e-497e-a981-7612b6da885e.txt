21st century wire says while the us media continue to scrutinize president-elect donald trump s transition team over its numerous cabinet recommendations and nominations , powerful factions within american politics are vying for a seat at the table in a new trump administration and with that comes the power to nudge and influence policy objectives .
trump s cabinet picks will be a mine field for pursuing previous statements in favor of a common sense foreign policy .
will neoconservative relics and war hawks from the bush-cheney era like john bolton or rudy giuliani secure a place in the new cabinet , and what about the neohawks like sen. tom cotton ?
what would this mean for syria s assad and for bilateral relations with russia , china and iran ?
21wire s patrick henningsen speaks to sputnik radio international this past weekend with his analysis of where thing might be heading sputnik radio : syrian president bashar al assad said he would welcome donald trump s decision to fight terrorism .
in an interview with a portuguese tv channel the syrian head said damascus can not predict the policy of the 45th president of the us , but would ally with washington , if the 70-year-old republican decides to fight against terrorist groups such as the islamic state and the jabhat fateh al-sham formerly known as al nusra front .
during his election campaign donald trump said that the barack obama administration should give up the idea of regime change in syria and instead seek the diplomatic solution of the 5-year-old conflict .
the us has been conducting airstrikes against isis since 2014 , however without permission of damascus .
radio sputnik discussed the issue with partick henningsen , founder of the news website 21stcentury wire.com .
