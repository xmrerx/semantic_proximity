trump not only found a way around the iowa state fair restrictions and followed through on his plan to give kids helicopter rides in his luxury helicopter , he also found a way to shut down every gotcha question by the media the gop frontrunner , who was told last month he could not set up his $ 7million sikorsky s-76 helicopter at the iowa state fair , hired a nearby parking lot instead .
from there he gave free rides to youngsters at his own risk and expense as he had planned to at this weekend s fair.the luxury helicopter on which kids were able to see what cornfields look like from 5,000 feet in the sky was at des moines airport on saturday morning , preparing for its departure to the event.the 52-foot executive chopper which seats 12 people comfortably including the pilot reportedly flew at an altitude of 2,400 feet and took three refueling stops as it headed from new york to des moines airport .
