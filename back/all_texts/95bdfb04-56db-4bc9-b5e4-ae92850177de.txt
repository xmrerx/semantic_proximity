Another disturbing teen melee broke out inside a Brooklyn McDonald s Friday, and this time, the brawlers turned their violence on an innocent man trying to break the fracas up and on employees of the fast food joint.The brutality began at the McDonald s on Flatbush Avenue Extension in Downtown Brooklyn at about 3 p.m., just as schools were letting out.
In the video, a teen girl can be seen standing on a table taking off her top, apparently preparing herself for the fight.Two young girls begin trading blows, and people try to tear them apart.
An older gentleman in a hat tries to diffuse the situation, but is turned on by the teen boys crowding around, who seemed to have been enjoying the fight.
The narrator, Don Balmain, can be heard gleefully yelling, Kill him!
interspersed with laughs.Total chaos breaks out in the restaurant, with teens fighting with cashiers over the counter.The teens eventually chase the older man outside, with the goon behind the camera screaming, Kill him right now!
A woman stands in front of him to shield him from the mob.
The cameraman shouts, They can t help you!
Balmain later posted the video on his Facebook page and sardonically commented, They put that old man in the hospital I feel bad for telling them to kill him.
911 was called, and a woman was taken to Brooklyn Hospital, officials told PIX11.
Another man was aided at the scene, but refused medical attention.Via: Pix11.com
