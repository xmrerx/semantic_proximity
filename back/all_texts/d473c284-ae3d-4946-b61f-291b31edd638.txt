Is anyone else thinking what we re thinking about the violent riot that happened in Berkeley, California last night?
Where the hell were the police???
This was being reported on live TV and all you could see were protesters and NOT cops.
It s up to the local authorities to send in protection so it s not up to the cops.
Why were the local authorities not prepared for this?
