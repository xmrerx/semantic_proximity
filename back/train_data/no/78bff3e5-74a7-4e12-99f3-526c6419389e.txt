donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) may 16 , 2017sure , his explanation started out dumb as f * ck , but it gets better/worse : he says he gave code word material to russia for humanitarian reasons .

randy withers ( @ counselorinsite ) may 16 , 2017interestingly , trump national security advisor h.r .
mcmaster claimed on monday that trump did not reveal classified information something he just as good as admitted in his tweets.ironically , trump who leaked classified information directly to russia complained that he has been asking fbi director comey ( whom he fired after comey requested additional resources for the russia investigation ) and others to figure out who has been leaking information about his and his administration s misdeeds.i have been asking director comey & others , from the beginning of my administration , to find the leakers in the intelligence community .. donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) may 16 , 2017this administration is a joke so bad it s almost criminal .
ok , it is criminal .
in fact , we re left to wonder when not if , but when republicans will feel that they have no choice but to put their country first and impeach this orange motherfucker.featured image via getty images ( pool ) /screengrab
