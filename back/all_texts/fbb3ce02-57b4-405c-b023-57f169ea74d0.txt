It s official a child has been elected to the White House.
Rather than act like the professional leader he s meant to be, Trump just sinks lower and lower on Twitter.
This time, Trump has tweeted a fake-wrestling clip of himself filmed years ago, with the CNN logo superimposed on the man s face he was attacking.
The clip ends with the words Fraud News Network.

Rather than act as a professional with dignity we have this as a president.
I am flabbergasted.
It s so sad.Deadline reports that CNN has released its response to the clip, read by Brian Stelter on today s Reliable Sources: It is a sad day when the President of the United States encourages violence against reporters.
Clearly, Sarah Huckabee Sanders lied when she said the President had never done so.
Instead of preparing for his overseas trip, his first meeting with Vladimir Putin, dealing with North Korea and working on his health care bill he is involved in juvenile behavior far below the dignity of his office.
We will keep doing our jobs.
He shuuld start doing his.
I don t know.
At this stage, I don t think it s possible for Trump to focus on the real problems America is facing, let alone fix them with the people in mind.
Everything is about him even this presidency.
And what do people expect?
There s a celebrity in office, not a proper political figure.
Though rather than behave like most celebrities and ignore what they may not like written about them, he lashes out.Trump is, unfortunately, the representative of America for the world.
He can t, and shouldn t, behave like this when the entire world is watching him.
He shouldn t behave like this even if the world wasn t watching.
It s one big mess after another with America becoming a mockery to the world.Featured image via Jaap Arriens/NurPhoto via Getty Images
