mary j. blige has a beautiful voice but this sit down with hillary is just awkward .
it s really odd that hillary acts so phony and stiff during this singing interview .
we re not buyin it !
we re betting hrc is thinking she d rather be in her jammie onesie with a zippy cup of chardonnay by her side .
inauthentic doesn t even come close to what this is gag worthy but funny at the same time.like you ve never seen them before .
@ maryjblige sits down with @ hillaryclinton. # the411 coming september 30th.https : //t.co/hbawqfjjcp pic.twitter.com/p2qpm3h3pm apple music ( @ applemusic ) september 27 , 2016 moonbattery had this to say about the song american skin : the song , american skin ( 41 shots ) , is bruce springsteen s irritating exploitation of african immigrant amadou diallo getting shot by police who thought he was shooting at them in the bronx in 1999 .
the outrageously unfair and irresponsible song , which implies that diallo was killed on purpose for being black , inspired a boycott of springsteen s shows by the nyc patrolmen s benevolent association.shrillary appears to be going whole hog with the black lives matter pandering .
