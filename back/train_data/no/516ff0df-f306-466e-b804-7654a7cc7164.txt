you won t believe who was spotted in the special section behind hillary clinton at her rally yesterday in kissimmee , florida ?
the section behind a candidate is typically reserved so the campaign knew he was going to be there .
remember that after the orlando attack this man was awful and blamed the attack on guns .
he is a local politician and a total creep.what s up with these democrats ? it s seddique mateen , father of orlando terrorist omar mateen : mateen refused to speak to local reporters at the rally but they caught up with him at a rest stop on the road : via : wptv we ve been cooperating with the federal government , and that s about it , he said .
thank you .
mateen didn t want to answer any other questions , but just hours later , we ran into him by chance at a rest stop on the way back to west palm beach .
he wanted to do an interview and show us a sign he made for clinton .
hillary clinton is good for united states versus donald trump , who has no solutions , he said.he had a sign with him note the bullet point that reads good for national security .
