The astounding hypocrisy of the leftist media has been left unchecked for decades.
All of that is about to change.
And no matter what side of the aisle you find yourself on, forcing the media to do their jobs and report the news is a benefit to every single American.
It s not their job to be popular amongst their peers or to have opinions their readers agree with.
Their job is to report the news.
Perhaps this little video or nugget of truth slipped their minds?Despite mounting criticism for Donald Trump s failure to disavow former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke s support, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton once heaped praise for late Klan leader Sen. Robert Byrd.In a video uploaded to the State Department s official YouTube page on June 28, 2010, Clinton commemorated late Sen. Byrd by saying, Today our country has lost a true American original, my friend and mentor Robert C. Byrd.
Via: Daily CallerAnd when the former KKK member, Senator Robert Byrd died, Barack Obama gave the eulogy:President Obama lauded the late Sen. Robert C. Byrd today for keeping faith with his family, his state of West Virginia and his beloved U.S. Constitution.
He was a Senate icon, he was a party leader, he was an elder statesman, and he was my friend, Obama told thousands who gathered for Byrd s funeral on the steps of the golden-domed West Virginia statehouse.
That s how I ll remember him.
