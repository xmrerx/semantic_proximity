On Wednesday night s episode of Late Night, host Seth Meyers ripped Trump a new one for his continued support of Fox News and his defense of Bill O Reilly.
It s not only despicable that Trump (a known sexual harasser) would defend fellow sexual harasser Bill O Reilly, but he did this less than a week after he proclaimed that April would now be known as National Sexual Assault Awareness Month.
Meyers, not one to ever let Trump get away with anything, dedicated his popular segment A Closer Look to this very subject and it was glorious.
At the beginning of the segment, Seth focused on Trump s undying, and equally disturbing love and admiration for Fox News and his favorite programs on the failing network.
You probably have at least a passing familiarity with Fox News if you ve ever visited an elderly relative or gotten drunk at a bar in a small-town Applebee s, he said, introducing the segment, particularly with one viewer, the president of the United States.
He then went on to show pictures of Trump s free Twitter advertisements for Fox and said: The President literally just recommends TV shows now.
Instead of a Bible, Trump should have been sworn in on a TV guide.
That, of course, drew raucous laughter from the crowd, but it s so true!
He cannot stop plugging this network and along with himself, he s made Fox News more of a laughing stock than it was before he was elected!
Now, he s coming to O Reilly s defense, which is sure to make things worse for the network who has already lost over 20 advertisers amid the newest sexual harassment scandal they just can t seem to get away from, as much as they ve tried to sweep it under the rug.
Soon the only advertisers left on his show are going to be Ivanka Trump s clothing line and Steve Bannon s skin worsener, Meyers joked.Watch the full segment below:Featured image via video screenshot
