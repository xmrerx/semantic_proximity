Jesse Watters: GOP can t drain the swamp when their own members are plugging the hole.
Jesse Watters made an excellent point about Republicans and their failure to repeal Obamacare.
The GOP can t seem to get out of its own way.
The GOP can t drain the swamp when their own members are standing in the way.Watters nailed it!
This is so on point!MSNBC s Joy Reid confirmed what Watters said when she commented on the three women Watters mentioned and called them the resistance to Trump:Wednesday on MSNBC s Deadline: White House, network host Joy Reid said Sens.
Susan Collins (R-ME), Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) and Shelly Moore Capito (R-WV) stalled efforts in the Senate to repeal Obamacare because they are leading kind of the resistance to President Donald Trump.
(video below)Reid said, When it comes to politics I think it s such a man s world for so long it s so much of politics driven by men telling women what s best for them.
And that has not caught up to the 21st century in a lot of ways.
I think the most glaring spectacle we have seen is this 13 member, all male, all white commission deciding what s best for health care, including women s health care.
She continued, These three Republican women are saying no.
And these three Republican women are leading kind of the resistance to the bill, even within the GOP.
I honestly have to say that, Nicolle, on the trail last year covering the campaign I noticed among white women, in particular, there was not a drive a see a woman in the White House for its own sake.
But after the election, suddenly women are saying, wait a minute.
We are being taken advantage of.
And women are stepping up a little bit as well.
