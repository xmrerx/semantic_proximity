ironically , the two issues that catapulted trump past all of his competitors in the gop presidential race were building the wall on our southern border and not allowing unveiled refugees to enter our country .
we re gon na go out on a limb and guess that based on trump s popularity with a wide variety of americans , both issues are pretty important when it comes to our national security.hillary clinton will launch an attack on donald trump s national security policy thursday , focusing on an issue the likely democratic presidential nominee could use to her advantage over the billionaire new yorker.the address in san diego will make clear the threat that donald trump would pose to our national security and to put forth her own vision for keeping america safe at home and leading in the world , clinton s campaign said in a statement wednesday afternoon.for clinton , the move is part of an effort to paint trump as fundamentally unsuited to lead the world s most powerful military as she hopes to pivot away from the extended democratic primary and toward a general election match-up with the presumptive gop nominee.the attacks on trump s lack of national security bona fides have increased speculation that he might pick a running mate with more experience in the defense or foreign policy , such as senate foreign relations committee chairman bob corker ( r-tenn. ) .
throughout this campaign , trump has refused to outline any coherent foreign policy doctrine , failed to demonstrate a basic understanding of world affairs , and repeatedly proven he s temperamentally unfit to serve as our commander in chief , clinton s campaign said on wednesday.despite his apparent weaknesses , however , trump benefitted the most when the gop primary contest took on a national security focus following deadly terror attacks in paris and san bernardino last year .
notwithstanding their radical nature , trump s proposals to build a wall along the u.s.-mexico border and temporarily ban foreign muslims from entering the country have attracted a fair amount of support from fellow republicans .
