during a brief photo-op in the oval office , canada s prime minister was forced to ensure something most of us would never dream of doing : touching donald trump .
the two shook hands for the cameras a handshake that lasted a full 13 seconds less than trump s recent one with japan s prime minister shinzo abe .
all in all , it was an inconsequential moment but the moments leading up to the moment justin trudeau realized he had to make skin-to-skin contact with the donald caught the attention of the nation.as trump extended his hand , trudeau stared at it like it was a pile of sh * t he had just been asked to eat on a reality show.an accurate representation of what canadians think of us # trudeaumeetstrump pic.twitter.com/pwvnmxsvgo elisabeth ashlee ( @ lis_ashlee ) february 13 , 2017justin trudeau is looking at trump 's hand like he just read the russian dossier pic.twitter.com/xgpgf7o7lg matthew a. cherry ( @ matthewacherry ) february 13 , 2017this is hilarious !

# trudeaumeetstrump pic.twitter.com/s2uzbgka2g chris daniels ( @ sirchrisdaniels ) february 13 , 2017trudeau was pretty clearly embarrassed by having to shake trump s hand , but he was doing his best not to ruffle any feathers so he took that moment like a champ .
while canada s leader acted in a manner befitting his office ( unlike a certain orange buffoon we know ) , he has been quite critical of the donald in the past.asked about trump before he was sworn into office , trudeau told reporters , there are things that we hold dear that the americans haven t prioritized .
then he explained what some of those things are : and i m never going to shy away from standing up for what i believe in , he said , whether it s proclaiming loudly to the world that i am a feminist , whether it s understanding that immigration is a source of strength for us and muslim canadians are an essential part of the success of our country today and into the future .
trudeau added that he hoped to nevertheless have a constructive working relationship with the incoming american administration , saying , these are issues that are things we can have discussions on and respectful disagreements on with our neighbors to the south , if indeed we have to have disagreements on them .
the last thing canadians expect , trudeau said during his visit , is for me to come down and lecture another country on how they choose to govern themselves .
trudeau was polite , but he may be our greatest ally in opposing donald trump s hateful agenda that s the fear expressed by right-wing vomit-bin and unofficial trump propaganda outlet , breitbart , anyway.trudeau is everything an american president should be .
can we just , you know , surrender to canada ? featured image via screengrab
