If you ve never had to suffer through any of Trump s surrogates trying to participate in debates on CNN, consider yourself lucky.
Even Donald Trump Jr. had something nasty to say about the surrogates incompetence, and he delivered some epic bashing that might even make his own father say You re fired!
In an interview on Sean Hannity s radio show, Trump Jr. threw his father s surrogates under the bus for being absolutely awful at defending his father.
Claiming that these people couldn t do their jobs correctly, Trump Jr. seemed to think that the media was conspiring and going out of its way to make Trump supporters look stupid (as if they need any help with that).In Trump Jr. s diss, the younger Trump was not only speaking about the professional, experienced Trump-loving pundits that CNN regularly has on its shows such as campaign spokeswomen Katrina Pierson, Kayleigh McEnany, and former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski (although he didn t call out any specific names).
Trump Jr. also accused CNN of picking Trump fans from the street to go up against professional Democrats in debates.
Trump Jr. said: The worst [segments] are when they have a panel of eight professional liberal, but professional people on a panel, and they find like one Trump supporter from the street, who has no real political knowledge, and they just happen to be a supporter.
And they put that person up against 8 people who do this for a living and try to make it seem like that s a fair fight.
Apparently, Trump Jr. was so upset about people not being able to defend his father properly that he said the campaign had gotten so ridiculous I can t even watch it anymore.
Unfortunately, Trump Jr. is oblivious to the fact that he should probably include himself amongst the pundits that continue to fail miserably at saving Trump s image.You can listen to the interview below:Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images
