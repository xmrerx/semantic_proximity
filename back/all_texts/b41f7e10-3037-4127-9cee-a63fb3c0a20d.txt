WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate on Monday blocked a Republican plan for keeping terrorism suspects from buying weapons by establishing a 72-hour review period for delaying the transactions.
The Senate fell seven votes short of clearing the way for approving the measure.
The Senate is now set to vote on a more sweeping Democratic proposal to keep guns out of the hands of people on terrorism watch lists.
