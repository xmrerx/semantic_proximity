A couple of days ago a woman in Washington was shot while watching the Benghazi movie 13 Hours and thanks to the United States obsession with guns.
We are now learning that the shooter, Dane Gallion, 29, had a gun on him during the movie because he was terrified of being killed during a mass shooting.According to the Seattle Times:Dane Gallion, 29, told officers he took the gun to Regal Cinemas 14 at the Landing on Thursday night because he was concerned about recent mass shootings in public places, according to a police account in a probable-cause statement released Saturday.That same anxiety prompted him to keep the gun unholstered in his waistband, the statement says.Think about that for a minute: our country has had so many mass shootings that this man was so scared to go to the movies, he felt he had to bring a weapon to protect himself.We all know that the good guy with a gun rhetoric that the National Rifle Association and Republicans like to spew is complete nonsense, but not everyone is as educated as those of us who want stricter gun laws.
A great number of people are willfully ignorant and just believe the lines they are fed from the gun lobby and their supporters.This, of course, doesn t excuse the shooting.
It definitely should have never happened.
A gun owner should know how to properly handle a gun so that things like this do not happen.
Frankly, Gallion should have never been allowed to carry a gun if he was that paranoid; After all, paranoia makes people do reckless things.However, it certainly proves how damaging the last decade or so s mass shootings have been on the psyches of the people in this country.
Personally, I have a little ball of fear in the pit of my stomach every single time I go to the movies too, or when I drop my elementary school aged child off at school.
How sad is that?
