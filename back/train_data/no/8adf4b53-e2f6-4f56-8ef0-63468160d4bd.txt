new york ( reuters ) - connecticut ’ s governor signed on wednesday legislation to close a $ 220 million budget gap by the end of the fiscal year on june 30 , as the state battles a fiscal crisis set to worsen next year with a projected budget deficit of nearly $ 1 billion .
the bill , which received bi-partisan support , comes on top of a series of budget cuts during the current fiscal year after revenue projections failed to meet projections , a fact officials blamed partly on weak capital gains tax receipts .
the administration of governor dannel malloy , a democrat , has been fighting fires around the budget for most of the year .
indications are that the fiscal situation will worsen before it gets better .
one report predicted the deficit could be as high as $ 900 million in the next fiscal year .
last month , connecticut canceled pay increases for almost 2,000 managers at state agencies .
the raises , which had been postponed twice , are now frozen indefinitely .
officials have said there will be reductions in staff numbers in the months ahead .
the amount connecticut pays to borrow has risen in relation to other municipal bond market borrowers , a sign investors see greater risk .
connecticut now pays 0.58 of a percentage point more than top-rated muni bond issuers to borrow for 10 years , up from 0.3 of a percentage point last year .
connecticut has a high investment grade rating at the major ratings agencies , although moody ’ s ( aa3 ) and standard & poor ’ s ( aa ) have a negative outlook on the state .
