Tuesday morning, Donald Trump started off his day by tweeting yet another outrageous lie about President Obama, apparently unsatisfied with his weekend tweetstorm accusing his favorite Muslim Kenyan socialist nemesis who totally isn t an American citizen of tapping his wires at Trump Tower.
122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield.
Just another terrible decision!
Trump claimed after apparently seeing a Fox News report that 122 have returned to the battlefield except not even Fox News was stupid enough to attempt to pass that off on President Obama.122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 7, 2017In reality, 113 of those who have returned to their old ways were released under George W. Bush, while 9 were released under President Obama.This is something anyone even The Donald can easily fact check, but for some reason we will never understand he is so committed to the lie that he ignores verifiable data that proves him wrong.
Naturally, the American people stopped by to tell him where he can stick his fabrications:Trump's Gitmo tweet is a boldfaced LIE.111 prisoners released under GEORGE BUSH returned to the battlefield pic.twitter.com/rOpYog3177 Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) March 7, 2017Without even digging into it, Trump took what he saw on Fox News and blamed Obama.Except, it was Bush.

He has even demanded and Republicans have acquiesced that any probe into his Russia contacts be bogged down by an investigation into his stupid claims about President Obama tapping his wires.
You re not campaigning anymore, Trump.
