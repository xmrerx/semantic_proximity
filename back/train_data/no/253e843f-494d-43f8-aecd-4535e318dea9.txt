beijing ( reuters ) - china understands and supports the spanish government s efforts to protect the country s unity and territorial integrity , china s foreign ministry said on thursday , amid moves by catalonia to declare independence .
the wealthy region s intention to break away has plunged spain into its worst political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 , with madrid threatening to sack the catalan government if it goes ahead .
china was paying close attention , foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying told a daily news briefing .
china understands and supports the spanish government s efforts to protect national unity ... and its territorial integrity , hua said .
china believes spain has the ability to guarantee social order and people s interests in accordance with the law , she added .
china says it adheres to a policy of non-interference in other countries internal affairs , but it generally takes a dim view of independence or secessionist movements around the world .
at home , it contends with what it says are separatist movements in its western regions of tibet and xinjiang , and also insists that the self-ruled island of taiwan belongs to china .
though it generally remains officially agnostic on such issues abroad , beijing has expressed more openness toward independence votes when both sides have agreed to them , such as scotland s unsuccessful 2014 referendum to leave the united kingdom , and south sudan s 2011 vote in favor of independence from sudan .
