(Reuters) - Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin met on Monday with President-elect Donald Trump and Vice President-elect Mike Pence and discussed the possibility of serving in the new administration, including in the Department of the Interior, her spokesman said.
“It was a wonderful discussion ...
I was not offered a position,” Fallin told reporters in the lobby of the Trump Tower in New York.
“It was just an initial meeting to address a wide range of topics.” A spokesman said they discussed the possibility of Fallin serving at the Interior Department.
