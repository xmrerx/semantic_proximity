dubai ( reuters ) - iran s air defenses have forced an approaching u.s. spy plane and a reconnaissance drone to change course near its air space over the past six months , a military official was quoted as saying on sunday .
brigadier general farzad esmaili , commander of the iran s air defense force , said an unmanned rq-4 drone was intercepted last week and a u2 spy plane was warned away in march , the semi-official fars news agency reported .
when the warning was given to the pilot of this ( u2 ) plane at the strait of hormuz , he knew that he was being targeted by two separate radars ... and missile systems , esmaili said .
iran will never allow such hostile planes to approach its airspace and would not hesitate to bring them down if necessary , said esmaili , quoted by the tasnim news agency .
u.s. officials have frequently complained of what they call unsafe and unprofessional interactions by iranian maritime forces in the gulf this year .
iran has said its forces act within their rights to protect iranian territorial waters .
the trump administration has recently struck a hard line on iran , accusing tehran of violating the spirit of an accord with world powers that lifted sanctions and sought to curb the islamic republic s nuclear program .
