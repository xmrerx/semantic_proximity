BEIJING (Reuters) - China reiterated on Monday its opposition to the deployment of a sophisticated U.S. anti-missile system in South Korea.
Foreign Ministry spokesman Lu Kang voiced China’s opposition to the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) system at a regular briefing in Beijing, and also urged all parties to work together to maintain peace and stability in the region.
South Korean acting President Hwang Kyo-ahn and visiting U.S. Vice President Mike Pence on Monday reaffirmed their plans to go ahead with the deployment of the system.
China says the system’s powerful radar is a threat to its security.
The United States and South Korea say it is only aimed at defense against North Korean missiles.
