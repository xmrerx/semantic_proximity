kabul ( reuters ) - the commander of the taliban s special forces branch , known as the red unit , was killed last week in helmand province by afghan forces , according to afghanistan s main intelligence agency .
the national directorate of security ( nds ) said mullah shah wali , also known as mullah naser , was killed in an air operation in helmand .
the province is a taliban stronghold in the heartland of afghanistan s lucrative drug trade .
wali became the commander of the taliban s red unit as well as deputy shadow governor of helmand province three years ago and was directly involved in taliban offensives , the statement said .
the red unit is thought to be equipped with advanced weapons , including night vision scopes , 82mm rockets , heavy machine guns and u.s.-made assault rifles , according to the afghan military .
wali was killed alongside a suicide bomber and two other taliban commanders in helmand s musa qala district , according to the nds .
the united states has worked hard to build up afghan air support and attack capabilities since they were found inadequate after most foreign forces withdrew three years ago .
