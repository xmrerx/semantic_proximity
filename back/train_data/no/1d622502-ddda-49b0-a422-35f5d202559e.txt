donald trump needs to stop whining before someone puts him over their knee.in addition to claiming that s he s the reason why the stock market rose after christmas and complaining about the united nations , trump whined about the media because they won t call the trump foundation a legitimate charity.i gave millions of dollars to djt foundation , raised or recieved millions more , all of which is given to charity , and media won t report !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) december 27 , 2016and then he continued to rant by claiming that all of the the money goes to charity and pays for nothing else.the djt foundation , unlike most foundations , never paid fees , rent , salaries or any expenses .
100 % of money goes to wonderful charities !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) december 27 , 2016the problem is that the media has extensively reported on the trump foundation for many years and there have been so many irregularities and ethical and legal issues surrounding the alleged charity that twitter users immediately called trump s claims bullshit .
