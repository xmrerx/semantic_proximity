For months, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has claimed that his innovative use of social media and his vast personal fortune will allow him to dominate Hillary Clinton and the Democrats in the fall.
But in reality, as the key fight in the battleground states that will likely determine the next president begins, Trump is getting destroyed by Secretary Clinton s campaign and allies.Democrats have $23 million worth of advertising on the air; Trump has NONE.Every single 2016 presidential TV ad currently airing in a battleground state is either from Hillary Clinton s campaign or the Democratic outside groups supporting her.The opposition, by contrast, hasn t spent a dime in these same battlegrounds whether it s Donald Trump s campaign or Republican-leaning Super PACs.So far in June, Clinton and the outside groups backing her have spent a total of $23.3 million on ads in the battleground states of Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Nevada New Hampshire, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia, according to ad-spending data from SMG Delta.By comparison in 2012, the advertising in battleground states at this point was 54%-46% in favor of President Obama against Mitt Romney.
Even with that single digit edge, Obama went on to win every battleground state and secured a landslide in the electoral college for his second term.Despite having the same amount of time to plan for the election and a primary that wrapped up about a month before the Democrats were done, Republicans have still lagged behind.
They don t have as many campaign staff on the ground in key swing states, as Trump often didn t set up staff there and has dismantled much of what he had.Trump has also had issues with raising money, as reports indicate he has been too lazy to make the critical calls to the financiers that finance party activities and advertising.
Despite his claim to be a billionaire, there has been little sign that Trump is actually willing to put his own money where his mouth is and finance his presidential campaign.Behind the scenes reporting has shown Republican insiders worried about their inability to compete this fall, while major Republican donors like the Koch Brothers are reluctant about donating to a campaign that could lose in a major landslide.Featured image via YouTube
