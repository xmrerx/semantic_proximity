WASHINGTON (Reuters) - House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday very good progress was being made on a bill to help Puerto Rico tackle its $70 billion debt, but gave no timetable on when the legislation would be advanced.
“They’re working with the Treasury on technical details on how restructuring works right now.
I think they’re making very good progress,” Ryan, a Republican, told reporters.
He said he would leave the timing on advancing of the legislation to Rob Bishop, chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee.
