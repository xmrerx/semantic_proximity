the constitution in everyday life causes people pain wendy kozol , oberlin collegeadministrators at vassar college and oberlin college agreed to personally shred a pocket constitution after an undercover reporter posing as a student complained that she felt triggered by its distribution on campus.the video was produced by project veritas , a non-profit established by conservative journalist james o keefe , and employs a similar style to the undercover acorn videos that first brought him to prominence .
last week something kinda happened on campus that kind of really upset me and i ended up having a panic attack , the reporter tells vassar college assistant director of equal opportunity kelly grab .
it s just i ve been kind of hiding out in my room ever since kind of scared , so , finally somebody told me i should maybe come talk to you about it and see if there s anything that can happen or anything they were handing the constitution out on campus .
oh , cato institute , grab murmurs while looking the booklet over .
they were handing it out and as soon as i saw it you know i started to not be able to breathe , hyperventilating , the reporter elaborated .
my vision went blurry and i just kind of just lost control .
after establishing that the reaction was triggered merely by the offering of copies of the constitution and not by anything the group had said , grab offers her sympathies to the reporter.via : campus reform
