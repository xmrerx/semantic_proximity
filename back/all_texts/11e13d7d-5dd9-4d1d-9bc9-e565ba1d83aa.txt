No word yet on plans to de-fund State Department s Refugee Resettlement Program, that brings hundreds of thousands of Muslims to America from countries who hate us Reeling from the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Democrats will try to force the Senate to vote Thursday on legislation to stem gun violence.The specific measures are still being considered, but they would be proposed as amendments to a GOP package to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Passage of any effort to limit access to firearms appears unlikely, as Congress has been unable to build support for toughening the nation s gun-control laws in the face of opposition from the Nation Rifle Assn.
Even in the aftermath of the mass shooting of elementary schoolchildren at Newtown, Conn., a measure to beef up laws failed.Other measures, including one to provide funding for federal health officials to study gun violence, may find broader support in Congress.We're going to force the Senate to vote today on amendments that do something to stop gun violence.
Senator Harry Reid (@SenatorReid) December 3, 2015Sen.
Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader, said after Wednesday s shooting in California that gun violence has become a cancer on the nation.
We are better than this, Reid said.
This madness must stop.
