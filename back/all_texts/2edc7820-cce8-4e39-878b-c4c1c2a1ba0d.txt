OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canada will make an announcement about fighter jets at 1 pm ET (1800 GMT) on Tuesday, a government official said on Monday, declining to give more details.
Sources told Reuters last week that the Canadian government is scrapping a plan to buy 18 Boeing Co Super Hornets and will instead acquire a fleet of second-hand Australian jets.
