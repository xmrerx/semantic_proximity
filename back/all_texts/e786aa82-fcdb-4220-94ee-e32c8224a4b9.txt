Legendary singer and great patriot Charlie Daniels has been an outspoken critic of the Obama administration in the past but THIS is the best ever overview of the drip, drip, drip of Muslim refugees coming to every town in the U.S: If what happened in Cologne and other cities in Germany on New Years Eve, when young Muslim men insulted, groped, robbed and raped German women who were on the street celebrating the holiday doesn t wake Germany up, they are in for a long and probably irreversible ride.Angela Merkel s reckless act of allowing one million refugees into the country may seem like a great humanitarian gesture to some, but as the ramifications of such a foolish move begin to reach street level, Germany will be in for a long, national nightmare.The grotesque acts that occurred on New Year s Eve were not isolated incidents, but happened nationwide with the earmarks of single intentioned flash mobs operating in numbers too large to control and overtaxing the law enforcement personnel available to deal with it.Some of the ones who were detained told police that they couldn t do anything to them, that they had been invited into Germany by Ms. Merkel, as if that was a license to harass and abuse the girls without consequences.A million people from another culture, who practice another religion, who have no regard for women s rights and who believe that Western Society is decadent, who refuse to assimilate and don t believe they are bound by the laws of the host country, is a lot to turn loose on any society at one time, and New Year s Eve was just a small harbinger of things to come.
Even if the troublemakers represent just 2 percent of the population of refugees, that is still approximately 20,000 people that can cause a lot of problems for Germany.This is before the terrorist component has made itself known.
Merkel, in her rush to out politically correct other world leaders has imported the agents of death into her country.
The genie is out of the bottle, and German children will suffer the ramifications of Angela Merkel s folly for generations to come.
In rejecting a 200,000 limit on the number of refugees entering the country, it seems Merkel plans to allow even more refugees in 2016.It s too late for Germany.
They have opened the zoo, and lions walk among them.
Soon the terror attacks will begin, and the Muslim population explosion will, in relatively few years, create a significant voting block that will grow exponentially.
Unlike native Germans who abort millions of their unborn each year, most Muslims don t practice abortion, and their tradition of having multiple children per family only accelerates the process.And once again, we are beaten over the head with the truth that not all Muslims are terrorists, but it doesn t take a majority to be dangerous.It s not too late for America, despite the fact that Obama seems determined to expose our society to the same dangers that Germany faces.This president has a weak spot for things Muslim.
Whether it s his father s heritage, his upbringing, his education at an Indonesian madrassa or a combination of all of the above, I just don t know.
It s apparent every time he talks about the holy Koran or the Prophet with such reverence, and it also reveals itself in his insistence that Islam has absolutely nothing to do with terrorism.He got taken to the cleaners by the Mullahs in Iran, who actually did little besides promise not to develop a nuclear device for 15 years, and since their word has all the value of a Zimbabwean penny, nobody but Obama believes they ll honor the terms of his incredibly weak deal a deal that unfreezes billions of dollars which Iran will no doubt use to continue funding terror.In fact, Iran may have already violated the treaty by taking United States sailors, whose boats reportedly drifted into Iranian waters, into custody and subjecting them to humiliation, even broadcasting it on television all over the Islamic world to show how impotent the Great Satan really is.By the time they freed our sailors, they had pulled off a public relations coup farther emphasizing their disrespect and their opinion of just how weak, ineffective and disengaged they consider Obama to be.All of this doesn t seem to bother Obama though.
He is determined to turn over one hundred and fifty billion dollars to this bunch of loose cannons, and he seems bent on bringing in thousands (tip of Obama s iceberg) of Muslim refugees, when we have already been told that ISIS has infiltrated operatives into the numbers.I believe that the only thing that protects America from further insults and aggression from Putin, China and anybody else who has an ax to grind with us is the grace of God and the fact that our enemies are afraid that America may elect a president with some backbone and the courage and guts to protect our interests.While there is a whole world out there that respects only power and those willing to use it, Obama extended a limp olive branch, which has been snatched out of his hand and is being used to beat him with.Never send a boy to do a man s job.What do you think?Pray for our troops and the peace of JerusalemGod Bless AmericaCharlie DanielsCharlie Daniels is a legendary American singer, song writer, guitarist, and fiddler famous for his contributions to country and southern rock music.
