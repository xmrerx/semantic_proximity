A former Saturday Night Live cast member has just spilled the beans about one of Donald Trump s secrets.Taran Killam, who left SNL in 2016, completely destroyed Trump in an interview published in Brooklyn magazine, putting to rest the massive amount of speculation about whether or not Trump actually knows how to read.
Apparently, Trump cannot.
According to Killam, Trump struggled to read even the simple jokes the writers had given him.Trump made an appearance on the show in December 2015, right after he announced he was entering the presidential race.
Killam said that particular episode was not fun and most of the cast and writers were not excited to have him there.
However, having Trump there taught the cast something interesting about him.
During the table read prior to the rehearsal, the host of the week is supposed to read through the jokes they re given.
Killam said Trump struggled to read at the table read, which did not give many of us great confidence.
Didn t get the jokes, really.
He s just a man who seems to be powered by bluster.
I didn t get the feeling that he was excited to be there.
When Killam was asked if Trump was unpleasant to work with on the show, Killam said: He was everything you see.
What you see is what you get with him, really.
I mean, there was no big reveal.
There have been rumors circulating about Trump s inability to read before, and now this confirms it.
From Trump s refusal to read through documents in front of people to his tendency to ditch his teleprompter during his speeches, Trump s erratic behavior raised suspicions that he was hiding something.
And when you look at a video like the one below, it certainly confirms Killam s confession that Trump is challenged when it comes to literacy.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images
