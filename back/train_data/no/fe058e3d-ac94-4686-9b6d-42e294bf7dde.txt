nairobi ( reuters ) - kenya s opposition coalition has asked supporters to boycott three big companies it says benefit from ties to the government of president uhuru kenyatta , who won last week s repeat election after an opposition boycott .
wearing hats embroidered resistance , and speaking against a backdrop showing a clenched fist , members of parliament gave their supporters a week s notice to stop using products from telecoms giant safaricom , dairy products from brookside and bidco cooking oils .
we are calling for a boycott that will be painful , a boycott that will bring these companies to their knees until they stand for electoral justice , said nakara lodep , turkana central lawmaker .
opposition leader raila odinga has called for a national resistance movement to protest the outcome of the repeat election , which was ordered by the supreme court after it annulled the results of an august poll over procedural irregularities .
president uhuru kenyatta won a second , five-year term with 98 percent of the vote after odinga boycotted the contest .
only 39 percent of registered voters took part .
lawmakers said safaricom was targeted because it had helped transmit election results .
brookside dairy is partly owned by kenyatta s family and partly by french dairy giant danone .
a spokesman for safaricom said the company had no immediate comment .
brookside and bidco did not return messages seeking comment .
odinga has until monday to file a supreme court case seeking to overturn the election .
if there are no outstanding legal proceedings , kenyatta will be inaugurated on nov. 14 .
