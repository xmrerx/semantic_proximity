Liberal Delaware Sen. Chris Coons caused a stir last week when he indicated during a televised interview that yet-undisclosed transcripts of recorded phone conversations conclusively prove that elements of the Trump campaign explicitly colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 presidential election.

Therefore, it s understandable why this statement from Coons a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee touched off a fresh, feverish round of breathless speculation and rumors.
