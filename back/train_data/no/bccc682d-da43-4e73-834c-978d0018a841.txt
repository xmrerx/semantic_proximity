in this video white people are asked how they feel about the black lives matter sign .
while they may not agree with its sentiment for whatever reason , they walk away and choose not to engage the sign holder , allowing him his right to freedom of speech .
they may not agree , but they respect that he is within his rights to hold the sign or even to question them about it .
when blacks are confronted with an all lives matter sign , their reaction becomes violent .
they attempt to threaten the white guy with the sign .
one guy was even nice enough to warn him that holding a sign that says , white lives matter might cause people passing by to harm him.this little social experiment tells us more than just how people feel about those words .
it shows us how people on the left are not only willing to openly shut down free speech in america , but they threaten you with violence if you don t conform to their beliefs .
this is a real problem today .
obama has silently condoned the use of physical violence to threaten someone who doesn t agree with you .
he has made it clear by his unwillingness to condemn the violence that you need to take whatever steps necessary to shut down the opposition to your cause , and that the end always justifies the means.watch :
