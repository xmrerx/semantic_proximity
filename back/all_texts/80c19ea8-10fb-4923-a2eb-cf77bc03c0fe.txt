CAIRO (Reuters) - Saudi Arabia has called for an urgent meeting of Arab League foreign ministers in Cairo next week to discuss Iran s intervention in the region, an official league source told Egypt s MENA state news agency on Sunday.
The call came after the resignation of Lebanon s prime minister pushed Beirut back into the center of a rivalry between Sunni kingdom Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran and heightened regional tensions.
