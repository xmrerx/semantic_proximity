moscow ( reuters ) - general valery gerasimov , the chief of russia s general staff , on thursday used a meeting with general petr pavel , the chairman of the nato military committee , to reassure him about upcoming russian war games , the interfax news agency reported .
the zapad-2017 war games this month have stirred unease in some countries because russian troops and military hardware will be training inside belarus , a russian ally which borders ukraine as well as nato member states poland , latvia and lithuania .
interfax said gerasimov , during a meeting in azerbaijan , had told pavel that the war games were purely defensive in nature , not aimed at any third countries , and designed to help secure the security of belarus .
