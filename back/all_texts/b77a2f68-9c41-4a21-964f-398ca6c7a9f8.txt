The DeKalb County Georgia School Superintendent, Stephen Green, has issued a warning to all teachers against making statements in support of President Donald Trump or his policies.
Since the warning was given, two teachers have already been forced to tender their resignation.Via World Net Daily: Green is now taking it a step further, warning teachers not to inject their personal beliefs into the classroom if they line up with those of the president of the United States.Green told a local newspaper, the Champion, that his Jan. 30 statement sought to grant students assurance that DeKalb County Schools officials remain committed to being culturally responsive, diverse and supportive of DeKalb County s immigrant population.
Our schools will be safe places for learning and teaching, he wrote in the statement.
We will not tolerate any form of bullying or discrimination on or off district property that interferes with learning or the rights of others.
Apparently teaching jobs in some Georgia public schools now include furthering the superintendent s personal political views.
