Donald Trump has frequently been compared to authoritarian leaders, but this recent comparison by Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe is just the thing we need to hear after Trump s horrendous performance on Monday night s presidential debate.Radcliffe happens to know a lot about evil leaders, having become an expert on them in Harry Potter.
Especially after spending a lot of time with the film s own Lord Voldemort, the villain who is hellbent on putting non-magical humans in servitude forever.
Hmm that sounds an awful lot like a horrible time period in American history that Donald Trump would like to return this country to In an interview with the U.K. s Sky News, Radcliffe actually compared Trump to Voldemort, stating that the Republican nominee has a lot in common with the Dark Lord however, there are also big differences.
And as a matter of fact, that s actually a BAD thing for Trump.
It turns out, Radcliffe thinks that Trump is worse than Voldemort.
The actor said: I sort of think Donald Trump might not be as ideologically pure as Voldemort.
My thing on Trump is that he feels like more of an opportunist, like I don t know how much of this stuff he s saying he actually really, really believes.
Radcliffe also called out Trump s racism, stating that Trump is an opportunist that uses his divisive rhetoric to gain power.
