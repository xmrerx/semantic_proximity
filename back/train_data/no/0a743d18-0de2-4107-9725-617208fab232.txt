he even questioned why primaries and caucuses are held.haugland is one of 112 republican delegates who are not required to cast their support for any one candidate because their states and territories don t hold primaries or caucuses.even with trump s huge projected delegate haul in four state primaries tuesday , the odds are increasing the billionaire businessman may not ultimately get the 1,237 delegates needed to claim the gop nomination before the convention.this could lead to a brokered convention , in which unbound delegates , like haugland , could play a significant swing role on the first ballot to choose a nominee.most delegates bound by their state s primary or caucus results are only committed on the first ballot .
