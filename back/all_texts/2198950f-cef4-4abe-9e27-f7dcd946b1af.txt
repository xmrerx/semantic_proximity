With the news dropping that supposedly Trump isn t under an investigation for obstruction of justice, we re all scratching our heads.
Especially since Trump admitted he s under investigation himself.ABC This Week with George Stephanopoulos has an idea of what s going on.
The President wants to take down Bob Mueller.
His lawyer wants to take down Bob Muller and the question is why?
And I think the answer is they wanna lay the foundation to discredit whatever Bob Mueller comes up with, Stephanopoulos said in a video posted on Twitter.Given that Trump himself has admitted on Twitter that he is under investigation and that it s a witch hunt , it sounds like a very plausible answer.Stephanopoulos goes on to say that They re essentially engaging in a scorched-earth litigation strategy that is beginning with trying to discredit the prosecutor.
He closes the video by saying that Mueller is just doing his job and is only just getting started, so we shouldn t just automatically dismiss Mueller or that Trump is being investigated.Stephanopoulos has a point.
It does seem likely that Trump and his team would try to cover an investigation up.
They don t want the public to know it would damage his reputation (not that he has a glowing one in the first place).Why shouldn t we believe what Trump tweets?
He knows what he s tweeting.
Why shouldn t we believe the other sources?An excerpt of This Week shows Pierre Thomas, ABC News Senior Justice Correspondent saying Now, my sources are telling me he s begun some preliminary planning.
Plans to talk to some people in the administration.
But he s not yet made that momentous decision to go for a full-scale investigation.
If that s the case, it s possible that Mueller is backing off on the idea of investigating Trump.
Why?Obviously, something is going on behind the scenes.
