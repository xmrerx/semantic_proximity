ankara ( reuters ) - turkish president tayyip erdogan called on friday for the united states to step back from its decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital after the united nations voted against the move despite what he called ugly and unforgivable u.s. threats .
more than 120 countries defied president donald trump on thursday and voted in favor of a united nations general assembly resolution calling for the united states to drop its recent recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital .
despite threats , the u.n. took an honorable stance , erdogan said at a meeting of his ak party in istanbul .
the u.s. should turn back from this wrong step .
trump had threatened to cut off financial aid to countries that voted in favor .
a total of 128 countries backed the resolution , which is non-binding , nine voted against and 35 abstained .
twenty-one countries did not cast a vote .
the u.s. attitude ahead of the u.n. vote will be remembered in the history of democracy as an ugly and unforgivable act , erdogan said .
trump s warning appeared to have some impact , with more countries abstaining and rejecting the resolution than usually associated with palestinian-related resolutions .
the white house picked up the phone and called these countries one by one , threatening them blatantly , erdogan said , without elaborating .
