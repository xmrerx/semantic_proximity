dubai ( reuters ) - saudi authorities said on wednesday they had arrested 22 people , including a qatari national , for using social media to spread dissent .
another 24 people were detained in the northern hail region for stirring tribal divisions , the state news agency spa reported .
neither report went into the details of the offenses .
the announcements came days after a order from king salman lifting a ban on women driving in the conservative islamic kingdom .
saudi arabia , alongside the united arab emirates , bahrain and egypt , has also cut diplomatic and transport ties with qatar accusing it of supporting militants and iran - charges doha denies .
citing a source in the newly-created presidency of state security , the counter-terrorism and domestic intelligence body , spa said the 22 had been detained after authorities spotted videos on social media inciting against public order .
the online postings stirred up feelings towards issues that are still under consideration , and incited people to commit crimes , spa said .
separately , spa carried a statement from the interior ministry saying that during unspecified investigations in hail , people linked to the case were promoting lies and exaggerations about their circumstances in order to provoke sedition and tribal tensions .
soon after the two reports , saudi arabia s top clerical body , the general secretariat of the council of senior religious scholars , issued a statement saying : anyone who tried to harm the kingdom security and the unity of its people has committed a dangerous crime .
