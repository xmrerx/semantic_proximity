the congressional budget office s review of the republicans replacement plan for the aca is out , and it s not good news .
under the plan , 24 million people will lose their healthcare coverage by 2026 .
14 million of those people will see their insurance ripped from them just in the next two years .
in total , this plan will result in 52 million uninsured people in 2026 .
over the next four years , premiums are expected to rise by as much as 20 percent more than they would under the aca .
premiums might fall for younger people after 2020 but would continue to rise for older people.and on it goes.paul ryan , however , sees the report as a resounding endorsement of the plan because it will reduce the deficit by a whole $ 336 billion over a decade and is supposed to maybe lower premiums at some point in the future.cbo report confirms it american health care act will lower premiums & improve access to quality , affordable care .

the gop s first priority should be the uninsured and the risk of people becoming uninsured .
instead , they re worried about deficits and getting lower premiums at some point for some demographics .
twitter is being merciless in their evaluation of his response .

dennis perkins ( @ dennisperkins5 ) march 13 , 2017the cbo s report shows a bloodbath that republicans are couching in pretty flowers , and ryan is busy trying to convince us that the pretty flowers are all that exist here .
perhaps , in his mind , the scent of the flowers will cover the scent of blood in this if he just says it will enough times.featured image via win mcnamee/getty images
