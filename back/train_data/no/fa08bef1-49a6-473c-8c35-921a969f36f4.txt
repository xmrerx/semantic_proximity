every american should demand nothing less ! hundreds of veterans have died while waiting to get care from the department of veterans affairs , all while the department spent millions of taxpayer dollars on high-end art.according to an investigation by cox media washington , d.c. and american transparency , the va has spent $ 20 million on high-end art over the last 10 years , $ 16 million of that spent during president obama s tenure.the investigation found one particularly egregious example : $ 670,000 combined spent on two sculptures at a va center for the blind.other examples include $ 21,000 spent on an artificial christmas tree , $ 610,000 spent over five years for a new facility in puerto rico and more than a million dollars combined on three art projects in palo alto , calif .
instead of hiring doctors to help triage backlogged veterans , the va s bonus-happy bureaucracy spent millions of dollars on art , andrew andrzejewski , founder and ceo of openthebooks.com , writes in forbes .
