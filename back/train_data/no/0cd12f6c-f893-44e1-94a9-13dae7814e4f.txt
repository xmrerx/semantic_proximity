the muslims faith must be protected at all costs it s the obama way during a news briefing delivered at the all dulles area muslim society mosque in washington , d.c. , following the san bernardino shooting , secretary of homeland security jeh johnson vowed to protect muslims from the same sort of fear , suspicions and prejudice that haunted suspected communists during the era of mccarthyism.and in making this vow , johnson specifically pointed to his grandfather , reported the government watchdog group judicial watch , whose members managed to observe the briefing despite the mosque s leaders attempting to kick them out .
in 1949 , during the mccarthy era , my own grandfather was called upon to testify before the house un-american activities committee , to deny he was a member of the communist party and defend the patriotism of african-americans , johnson said .
today his grandson is responsible for the homeland security of this entire nation .
johnson sees a connection between the actions of deceased sen. joseph mccarthy , who used unsubstantiated accusations of communism to target anyone who dared criticize either him or the federal government , and the burgeoning movement to clamp down on radical islamic terrorism .
as muslim terrorism hits closer and closer to home , our homeland security chief views the war on islamic terrorism as a another red scare , where muslim terrorist suspects are red-baited like his grandfather , the editorial board for investor s business daily wrote regarding this revelation .
no wonder this administration isn t interested in monitoring radical muslims for terrorist connections .
the irony seems thick , given that the only ones behaving like mccarthy have been president barack obama and his cronies , including johnson , all of whom use disingenuous labels like islamophobe and bigot to shut down anyone who dares speak critically about islam or point out its obvious ties to radical terrorism .
