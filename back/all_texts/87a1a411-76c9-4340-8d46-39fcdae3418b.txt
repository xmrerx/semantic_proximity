JERUSALEM (Reuters) - An Israeli court on Saturday freed without charge three Turks who had been arrested on suspicion of assaulting police outside a Jerusalem holy site contested by Jews and Muslims, a police spokesman said.
The men - described by police as tourists - were taken into custody on Friday, as Israel confronted a weekly surge in protests against U.S. President Donald Trump s Dec. 6 recognition of Jerusalem as its capital.
Bystander video appeared to show Israeli police detaining several fez-wearing men and boys in the walled Old City of East Jerusalem, which Israel captured in a 1967 war and which Palestinians want as capital of their own future state.
Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the three Turks had tried to reach Al Aqsa Mosque, Islam s third-most important shrine, where they planned on taking part in a demonstration .
Jews revere the site as the vestige of their two ancient temples, and sometimes visit under the protection of Israeli police who also guard the compound entrances - a presence resented by many Palestinians.
Rosenfeld said the three Turks carried out an assault on police officers there .
He did not elaborate on the circumstances, other than to say there were no casualties.
Brought before Jerusalem Magistrate s Court on Saturday, the men did not speak from the dock.
Two of them flashed four-finger hand gestures that appeared to be the so-called Rabia sign of solidarity with Egypt s ousted Muslim Brotherhood.
The Turks Israeli defense lawyer, Nick Kaufman, said police asked the court to keep them in custody so charges of assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest could be brought.
It was obvious that this was a politically charged case and the judge rightly released them, Kaufman told Reuters.
