WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to ban transgender individuals from the U.S. military amounts to a “shocking and ignorant attack on our military and on transgender troops,” a leading advocate said on Wednesday.
“The President is creating a worse version of ‘Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell.’ As we know from the sad history of that discredited policy, discrimination harms military readiness,” said Aaron Belkin, director of the Palm Center.
