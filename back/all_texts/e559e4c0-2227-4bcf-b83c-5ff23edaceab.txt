BERLIN (Reuters) - German Social Democratic Party (SPD) members voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to allow their party s leadership to enter talks with Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives on forming a government.
The party congress s vote means leaders can discuss options including a renewed grand coalition , an informal cooperation or a formal agreement to tolerate a conservative minority government by not voting down certain parliamentary motions.
