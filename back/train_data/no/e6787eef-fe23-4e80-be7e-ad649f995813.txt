our justice department is beyond out of control to give 6 months extra to those who ve let their permission to work in america expire !
how in the world is being negligent rewarded ?
do these people have a personal responsibility to renew papers themselves ? the goal ultimately is to make it harder and harder for companies to fire anyone.sounds good for workers right ?
well , it s a double edged sword .
if it s harder to fire it s much harder to hire .
companies fearing being stuck with poor performers will choose to not hire or to automate.and check this video out : this is the sort of thing employers have to concern themselves with these days .
good luck keeping all the rules straight .
but you d better or you might find yourself subject to a government inquiry.the video is shot in a dimly lit office , where two actors discuss whether their fictional company should let go of some salvadoran employees who have failed to provide updated paperwork on their immigration status.after a discussion about whether retaining the workers would violate the law , a woman says , i think this is an exception to that rule , and recommends that they contact the the office of special counsel for immigration related unfair employment practices before making any decisions .
we want to follow the rules but we don t want to lose these workers or discriminate against them , she concludes .
they are too valuable .
