the electoral map is being redrawn in hillary clinton s favor as donald trump plunges into near total self-destruction.while the american people continue to wake up to what trump is a loud , vile , jackass the more they flock to hillary clinton , and the evidence is striking when taking into consideration two states where republicans have dominated for decades , arizona and georgia.georgia hasn t voted democrat since 1980 ( when jimmy carter ran against ronald reagan ) and arizona hasn t voted democrat since 1996 ( when bill clinton trounced bob dole ) .so for over thirty years these states have not been friendly to democrats .
but thanks to donald trump , they could come back around.a recent poll from oh predictions based out of arizona has clinton beating trump by three points , 45-42 , the second poll from the same nonpartisan organization to show clinton ahead of the blowhard billionaire .
when factoring in the two polls from oh , with others showing a close competition , realclearpolitics has the two evenly tied in their average for winning .
in 2012 , romney won arizona by 9 points.and how is it that clinton could be beating trump in arpaio-brewer county ?
his feud with the khan family.across the country , in georgia , a new poll from the atlanta journal-constitution newspaper shows hillary clinton leading donald trump in the state by four points , which is still within the margin of error , but a surprising lead nonetheless in a southern red state run by nathan deal.a poll from july 31 showed the two tied , and when coupled with the new poll showing clinton ahead , the realclearpolitics average has trump leading by 2.4 percent .
in 2o12 , romney won georgia by eight points.while facing a loss in the swing-state of colorado , politico has summed up the issue currently facing trump : for trump , it s a worrisome sign of a narrowing electoral path to victory .
at the outset of the election cycle , the gop nominee already confronted what appeared to be a democratic advantage in the electoral college .
the potential loss of a key western swing state leaves even less margin for error in november , increasing the urgency of winning the big prizes of ohio , pennsylvania and florida.with a loss in arizona and georgia , and losing colorado , trump is looking at a prospective tail spin in the american electoral process , and it s glorious.imagine how much of a surprise the trump campaign would get if they lost georgia and arizona on election day , completely throwing off their trajectory ?
