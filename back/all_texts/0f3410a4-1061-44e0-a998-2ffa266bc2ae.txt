He clarified that protesting in the United States is a right, but he also challenged the players taking a knee: If there s somewhere better, why don t you leave?Broncos defensive end Derek Wolfe explained Sunday why he stands for the national anthem, referencing the troops and the ideal vision of America.
Wolfe, who is white, did not reference whether he agrees with the basis of the protest that gained steam Sunday following President Trump s condemnation: to object to the treatment of minorities in the United States.Entering Sunday, only one white player, Seth DeValve of Cleveland, had joined the movement.
I stand because I respect the men who died in real battles so I have the freedom to battle on the field, Wolfe, 27, told ESPN in a statement.
Paying tribute to the men and women who have given their lives for our freedom is why I stand.
But everyone these days likes to find a reason to protest and that s their right.
It s America and you are free to speak your mind.
I just feel it s disrespectful to the ones who sacrificed their lives and it s the wrong platform.
But like I said to each their own it s AMERICA!
The greatest country in the world and if you don t think we are the greatest country in the world and you reside here, then why do you stay?
A lot worse places in the world to call home.
Proud to be an American.
Several of his Broncos teammates took a kneel Sunday, days after Trump urged owners to kick the son of a bitch who protests off the team.
Wolfe s teammate Brandon Marshall knelt throughout last season.Wolfe, in his sixth NFL season, grew up in Ohio and played at the University of Cincinnati.
He skipped visiting the Obama White House following the Broncos Super Bowl win in 2016, saying, I just had a lot of stuff going on, things to do.
