maxine waters made an appearance on cnbc trying to push the term kremlin klan to push the russia scam.she tried to name the offenders in the group but drew a blank after naming a few people .
it s always interesting to hear her talking points and hear what the democrats are lying about every day .
notice that the anchors repeat the term at the end do you think they might want this term to stick ?
clever waters is on the financial services committee that s scary !
