I have to say that I just don t believe it.
If it is true, I have to question the sanity of both of these people.
It s not even the least bit funny except for result they called a truce!Via: The HillDemocratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton says she once went head-to-head with Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) in a drinking contest.
I haven t been in many [drinking contests], but the most famous one, I suppose is the one I engaged in with Sen. John McCain when he and I were on a congressional delegation and he kind of challenged me, Clinton said in a video posted on her Facebook page Thursday.
We have our political differences, but we sat there drinking vodka.
Clinton said that no winner was declared that both contestants agreed to pull out before things got out of control.
We both I think agreed to withdraw in honorable fashion I think after having reached the limits that either of us should have had, she said.// <!
