geneva ( reuters ) - the united nations urged sudan to end violence and human rights abuses against the 2.6 million people displaced by its long conflict in darfur , a u.n. report documenting the abuses said on tuesday .
conflict in darfur began in 2003 when mainly non-arab tribes took up arms against sudan s arab-led government .
progress on resolving the conflict was a key demand made by the united states before it lifted 20-year sanctions last month that had long-isolated the country .
sudan said last month that it would extend a unilateral ceasefire with rebels that has been in place since october 2016 until the end of december .
the u.n. report found that despite a ceasefire between the government and various armed opposition groups ... violence against internally displaced people continues to be widespread and impunity for human rights violations persists .
i urge the government to address fundamental issues that are preventing the return of displaced people , such as continued violence , including from armed militias , which raise continuing and justifiable fears for their safety and the lack of basic services that leave them dependent on aid , u.n. high commissioner for human rights zeid ra ad al hussein said in a statement .
people displaced by the conflict face outright absence of law enforcement and judicial institutions and serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law , the statement said .
