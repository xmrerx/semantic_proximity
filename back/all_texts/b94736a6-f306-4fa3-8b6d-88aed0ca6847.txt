Professional douchebag Ted Nugent took his love of guns way too far on Monday, demonstrating how conservatives really feel about Jews.Much in the way Adolf Hitler scapegoated the Jews to justify World War II and the Holocaust, Nugent scapegoated Jews to justify an extreme pro-gun agenda.On his own Facebook page, Nugent plastered several photographs of Jewish activists and politicians, and warned his followers to memorize who they are and gave them marching orders to give them hell and shut them down.
Know these punks, Nugent wrote.
They hate freedom, they hate good over evil, they would deny us the basic human right to self defense & to KEEP & BEAR ARMS while many of them have tax paid hired ARMED security!
Know them well.
Tell every1 you know how evil they are.
Let us raise maximum hell to shut them down!

They hate freedom, they hate good over evil, they would deny us the basic human right to self defense Posted by Ted Nugent on Monday, February 8, 2016In a comment below his own post, Nugent wrote, NEVER AGAIN in reference to the Holocaust.Conservatives often use the Holocaust as a prop in their argument to oppose gun control laws.
The problem with that argument is that it assumes the minority Jewish population would have been able to stand up to the powerful German military, which included the brutal SS.When Ben Carson made the same claim last year, Politifact ripped him a new one by pointing out that the Nazis actually loosened gun laws significantly for the population, but restricted Jews from owning firearms.German citizens as a whole were not disarmed by the Nazis.
Jews and other supposed enemies of the state were subject to having their weapons seized.
But for most German citizens, the Nazi period was one in which gun regulations were loosened, not tightened.Second, a lack of guns was not the issue.
If the majority of Germans had wanted to use these guns to fight the Nazis, they could have.
But they didn t.In other words, the only form of gun control the Nazis really liked was keeping Jews from owning them.But even if the Jews were well-armed and willing to fight back, the fact remains that the German population supported the Nazis and Hitler had powerful military forces under his command.
It is highly unlikely that the Jews could have prevented the Holocaust by themselves.Despite the facts, Nugent wrote another rant aimed at those who criticized his first post, referring to Jews who don t agree with him as Nazis in disguise.

This is nothing short of conspiratorial anti-Semitism.
Regardless of one s views on gun control, this kind of scapegoating of an entire religious group is completely unacceptable and completely divorced from reality.
It should go without saying that anti-Semitism has no place in the gun control debate.
You should be ashamed for promoting anti-Semitic content, and we hope that good people on both sides of the gun control debate will reject his tactics and his message.
We hope you will have the good sense to remove this share immediately so that it does not spread virally across the internet.
Ted Nugent talks tough about his dad, but apparently the apple fell far from the tree.
Let s not forget that Nugent dodged the Vietnam war by pooping in his pants.And this isn t the first time Nugent has attacked a people that suffered through genocide.
Nugent once referred to Native Americans as unclean vermin who don t qualify as people.
And let s not forget his anthem to child rape that must drive family values Republicans wild.Also, keep in mind that Ted Cruz is Nugent s favorite Republican presidential candidate in the 2016 race.
Perhaps someone should ask Cruz how he feels about what Nugent thinks about Jews who support reasonable laws to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. Because that s what we re really talking about here better background checks that most Americans, including NRA members, support.
Nobody in our government has suggested seizing the guns of every American.
And there have certainly been no suggestions of banning certain ethnic minorities from owning firearms.
This is all in the imaginations of conservatives who have used such claims to push a guns everywhere agenda that has only opened our society up to more gun deaths and mass shootings than ever before.But if anyone should have their guns taken from them, it s Ted Nugent, considering the fact that he has openly called for the assassination of President Obama and other government officials on several occasions.
