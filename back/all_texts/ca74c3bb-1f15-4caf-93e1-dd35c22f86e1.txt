Donald Trump thinks he s qualified to be president of the United States primarily based on what he always touts as his business acumen, continuously propagating the idea that he s a good deal maker and a great negotiator, traits that he and his blind followers believe make him qualified to be the most powerful person on the planet.
Not so says Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren, who appeared on The Late Show with Stephen Colbert to point out that Trump is not only a bad business man but a loser business man.
The always passionate Warren said: You inherit that kind of fortune from your father.
Do you know what some of the analysts say?
If all the money he d inherited from his dad, he d just put it into index funds, he d be just about as rich as he is today.
In other words, he wasn t out there doing these fabulous deals.
He started out rich, he cheated his way to getting richer.
That is not going to build an America for hard-working people.
Warren makes excellent points.
According to analysts, if Trump, who is the ideal trust fund baby just left his inherited wealth alone in index funds, he would be worth the same today.
Thus, his supposed dealings and negotiating skills are all a bunch of bulls**t in an attempt to present himself as qualified to be president.The hope is that people can see through the buls**t come November to ensure that this nutjob, who is the likely nominee for the nuttier Republican party never gets to the Oval Office.Watch video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O7rWXURt6PI] Featured image via video screenshot.
