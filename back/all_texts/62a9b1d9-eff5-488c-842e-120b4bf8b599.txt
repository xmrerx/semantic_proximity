As Trump s first 100 days in office come to a close, the administration is desperate to put together a list of accomplishments that looks like a showcase of Trump s sheer leadership prowess.
This desperation comes because Trump has accomplished pretty much nothing at all.
Most of those so-called accomplishments are executive orders that do squat, he hasn t managed to get any legislation through Congress at all, and his approval rating is at a record-low 41 percent.Other presidents fared much better during their first 100 days, and some people, like Jimmy Carter s presidential library, won t hesitate to needle Trump with their own statistics.
Observe:Jimmy Carter s first 100 days..Laws passed: 22 Executive orders: 16 Approval rating: 63 percent Jimmy Carter Library (@CarterLibrary) April 24, 2017By contrast, Trump has signed 23 executive orders that he s claiming are accomplishments, such as a federal hiring freeze.
Wow.
Putting a halt to hiring federal workers is so difficult, is it not?He s also trumpeting his job creation successes, which include greenlighting both the Keystone XL and Dakota Access pipelines, and his buy American, hire American initiative.
Neither of these orders is really going to accomplish anything.
Nor will his buy American steel initiative considering that the pipelines have long since purchased their steel, and most of it isn t American.He s touting the wall as an accomplishment too, even though Congress isn t likely to fund it, and he s listing his Muslim ban, which has been halted in federal court and has likewise done nothing.Indeed, all he can really claim as an accomplishment at all is getting Neil Gorsuch confirmed to the Supreme Court.
Carter had a tumultuous first 100 days, too, but at least he managed to get an economic stimulus package through Congress.
