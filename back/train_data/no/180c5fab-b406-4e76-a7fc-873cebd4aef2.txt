the timing couldn t have been better .
just as gary tuckman , a reporter for very fake news cnn , was in the middle of a hit piece on president trump , he was literally hit with tear gas being used by law enforcement to keep the radical alt-left protesters from harming innocent people who came to support our president at his phoenix , az rally last night.very fake news cnn s gary tuckman , can be seen clearly struggling to speak to cnn host don lemon in the video below.tuckman told very fake news cnn host don lemon , all of our faces are burning , all of our throats are burning .
he also relayed what was very likely bad intel , to lemon : there were some water bottles thrown at police and the next thing we felt were the burning tear gas .
but how does tuckman know they were they bottles filled with water ?
the radical , and very violent antifa group that cnn is working so hard to redefine as a kinder , gentler resistance group , was accused of throwing bottles of urine at free speech advocates and law enforcement in charlottesville less than 2 weeks ago .
so how does tuckman know for certain that the bottles the non-violent group he is so quick to defend , were only filled with water ?
and since when is lobbing anything at police officers who are protecting our president and his supporters considered non-violent ? earlier in the evening , another cnn reporter nearly got hit by the lit end of a smoke grenade.cnn may want to rethink this whole bunkering with antifa thing during what appears to be ongoing , violent protests by the democrat partys soros funded alt-left groups.the alt-left came prepared last night , as they were seen proudly displaying their ar-15 s .
