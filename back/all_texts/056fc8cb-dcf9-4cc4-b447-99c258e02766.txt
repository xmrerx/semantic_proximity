MADRID (Reuters) - Spain s government on Friday passed a law to make it easier for companies to move their operations around the country just as some businesses consider leaving the region of Catalonia amid a rising conflict over a plan for independence.
The new law loosens the bureaucratic red tape needed for a company s board to take the decision to move the company s base, unless the group s statutes expressly say otherwise, the government said in a statement.
The law had been discussed with the opposition political parties, the Socialists and business-friendly Ciudadanos, Economy Minister Luis de Guindos said in the press conference following the weekly cabinet meeting.
