Zero Hedge reported:If there was a time Hillary needed to make a public appearance in the key battleground state of North Carolina to drum up voter support, it was today, if for no other reason than a just released Elon University poll finding Trump now has a modest 44% advantage among likely voters in the Tar Heel State, with 43% going to Clinton.According to the poll, most voters felt Trump would be better for rich people, white people and men, while most believe Clinton would be better for poor people, women and minorities.
This election is so tight right now, that small swings of a few points should be expected between now and November, said Jason Husser, assistant professor of political science at Elon and director of the Elon University Poll.
North Carolina has been extremely important over the last several election cycles with very tight election outcomes.
These numbers suggest that will continue to be the case, and both campaigns would do well to continue to focus on the Old North State.
It s not just the closeness of the poll that makes NC so critical; it s also Trump s recent rebound, which as shown in the following chart from Real Clear Politics has him taking the lead for the first time since late June.Which is why we find it surprising that with Hillary s desperately needing to make an appearance, overnight CBS reported that Clinton campaign officials said that a Tuesday fundraiser in Chapel Hill was postponed.
