Donald Trump may want to rethink his wall idea because his entire presidency is crumbling down around him.
With Kellyanne Conway on her way out the door because she advertised his daughter s goods during a Fox News interview and Michael Flynn getting caught secretly talking sanctions with the Russian ambassador and Sean Spicer just being Sean Spicer, The Donald is already dealing with a lot but now CNN reports that his campaign staff was in constant touch with high-level government officials in Russia.According to multiple current and former intelligence, law enforcement and administration officials, high-level advisers to candidate Trump raised red flags with U.S. intelligence because they were apparently calling each other more often than a middle school couple who has been dating for three days (that s a lot):Intelligence officials say they are still determining the intent of the frequent communications, but they are concerned that Trump associates were coordinating with Russian intelligence to release information that would damage Hillary Clinton.
If that were the case, then that would escalate things, one official briefed on the investigation told CNN.More than a baker s dozen intelligence agencies have previously confirmed that Vladimir Putin personally spearheaded a massive hacking and propaganda/ fake news campaign targeting Clinton in an effort to get Donald Trump elected.Since assuming office, Easy D has been nothing but friendly to Russia, even easing sanctions that targeted the very intelligence agencies that hacked our election and constantly praising Putin (including on the same day that Flynn spoke to his ambassador friend).
Trump also may have disabled the recording during his first phone call as President with Putin.Things are not looking good for President Asterisk, and they seem to get worse by the day.
It s time for Republicans to put country before party and get this lunatic out of office before he gets us all killed.Watch CNN s report on this new development below:Featured image via Getty Images
