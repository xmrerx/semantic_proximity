You know when you re told to smile for a photo but the person next you just let one rip?
Well, that s pretty much the expression on Ted Cruz s face right after being told by a person taking a photo with him that she is gay.This new Wonder Woman was able to snag a photo with Cruz at one of his events and clearly took the anti-gay Republican Texas senator completely off guard, and it is spectacular.According to Pride.com: At a Ted event, a young queer hero approached him, and said, I am gay.
Flash forward to .02 seconds later, she took a selfie with Mr. Cruz, where he looks frozen in his awkward and uncomfortable face via pride.comHe looks as though he is literally about to catch gay cooties.
And her face is absolutely amazing.
It reads, Yeah, I just punked you, you bigoted jerkface.
As you may or may not be aware, Cruz is steadfast in his hatred of all things gay.
Not only is he against marriage equality and the protection of LGBT citizens from discrimination, but he even hates Pride parades.
What kind of monster hates a joyous parade?
Apparently the guy who looks like the ignorant fool in this picture next to a new brand of American hero.Kudos to this young woman who was courageous enough to come out to Cruz s face and then be even braver to snap the photo less than a second later.
It may be the best thing seen from this entire election season yet.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)
