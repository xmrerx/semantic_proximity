Thinking before you speak is basically a required skill if you want to be a lawmaker, but Missouri GOP Senator Roy Blunt didn t get the memo.In the wake of the Orlando mass shooting, Republicans have been accusing President Obama of being weak against ISIS because he won t say the words radical Islamic terrorism.
It s as if the GOP believes saying the words will magically make the terrorists go away.
What exactly would using this language accomplish?
President Obama demanded to know in remarks made last week.
What exactly would it change?
Would it make ISIL less committed to try and kill Americans?
Would it bring in more allies?
Is there a military strategy that is served by this?
The answer is none of the above.
Calling a threat by a different name does not make it go away.
But Republican Senator Roy Blunt is now accusing his Democratic opponent of being weak on terrorism because he also hasn t said the words.Blunt, who cowardly dodged the draft during the Vietnam War through the use of student deferments posted the accusation against Jason Kander on Twitter.
Despite Ft.
Hood, Boston & Orlando, @JasonKander won t acknowledge the root of threats we face: radical Islam, he wrote on Monday night after being criticized for voting to kill several gun control reforms that would ban suspected terrorists from buying guns.Despite Ft.

I volunteered to serve in Afghanistan to fight radical Islamic terrorism, Kander wrote while also including the words Blunt accused him of refusing to say.
Think before you tweet.

@JasonKander @RoyBluntMO Big tough @RoyBlunt .
How many deferments did you apply for #coward?
Manhattan Project (@spconcannon) June 21, 2016 Some actually fight terrorism (@JasonKander) some only talk about fighting terrorism (@RoyBluntMO) #VoteWiselyMO https://t.co/quZYq3mCey Jane Dueker (@JaneDueker) June 21, 2016@JasonKander @jonfavs @RoyBluntMO Sen. Blunt is a coward; your vote sided with terrorists and you disparage a hero who actually fought them!

@RoyBluntMO Erm, pretty sure @JasonKander Volunteered to serve in Afghanistan.

Cale Miller (@Cale_Miller) June 21, 2016Roy Blunt should be ashamed and embarrassed, and he should definitely think about who he is talking to before he writes something so ridiculous on Twitter.
Because right now, karma is biting him hard on the ass.Featured Image: Flickr
