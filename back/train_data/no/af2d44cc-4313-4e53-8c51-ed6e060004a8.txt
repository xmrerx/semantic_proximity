“ it seems clear that president obama made this nomination not with the intent of seeing the nominee confirmed , but in order to politicize it for purposes of the election , ” mcconnell said on the floor of the senate after obama , a democrat , announced his choice at the white house .
“ instead of spending more time debating an issue where we can ’ t agree , let ’ s keep working to address the issues where we can , ” the senator from kentucky said .
“ the senate will appropriately revisit the matter when it considers the qualifications of the nominee the next president nominates , whoever that might be , ” mcconnell said .
obama ’ s second four-year term ends in january 2017 and the campaign to choose his successor has been hotly contested .
