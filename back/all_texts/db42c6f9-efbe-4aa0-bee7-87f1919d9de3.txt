The last two weeks of Donald Trump s presidency have been riddled with bombshell after bombshell over his Russia scandal, and it s definitely taking a toll on his administration.
Apparently, things in the White House have gotten so grim that staffers are looking forward to the end and have already started to send out their resumes.The Washington Post reported that ever since Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the mood in the White House has been worse than ever.
The staffers have felt paralyzed and senior officials have been moping around with funeral looks on their faces.
While Trump s staffers feel absolutely helpless as their boss continues to become more erratic and create more PR nightmares, the POTUS has only become more furious and frustrated at his staff for not being able to keep up.The Post wrote:Some White House staffers have turned to impeachment gallows humor.
Other mid-level aides have started reaching out to consultants, shopping their resumes.
And at least one senior staffer has begun privately talking to friends about what a post-White House job would look like, according to two people close the staffer.Another report by TIME magazine said something similar, stating that West Wing aides have started shopping r sum s to think tanks, super PACs and corporate communications firms.
And when you think of what these staffers have had to deal with, it s no wonder.
According to one mid-level aide, staffers are exhausted and have no hope that conditions under Trump s chaotic leadership will improve: Just when you think the pace is unsustainable, it accelerates.
The moment it gets quiet is when the next crisis happens.
This news also comes on the heels of rumors that Trump is considering a major staff turnover in the near future which may include senior aides like chief of staff Reince Priebus, press secretary Sean Spicer and communications director Mike Dubke.
Clearly, the chaos is far from over.Featured image via Pool / Getty Images
