House Republicans voted on Thursday to rip healthcare away from millions of Americans.
Among those who are slamming the GOP for this despicable act are doctors, who know just how bad this will be for their patients.Following the passage of the American Health Care Act, the American Medical Association issued a scathing statement.
The AMA, which is the largest group of its kind in the U.S. and represents more than 20,000 physicians, slammed the bill for leaving millions without access to medical care.
The bill passed by the House today will result in millions of Americans losing access to quality, affordable health insurance and those with pre-existing health conditions face the possibility of going back to the time when insurers could charge them premiums that made access to coverage out of the question, AMA President Andrew Gurman said.The group conceded that action is needed to improve the current health care insurance system.
After all, no one has ever claimed that Obamacare was perfect.
However, the GOP s bill is not the answer we need.
The AMA urged the White House and the Senate to work toward bipartisan solutions.
The AMA urges the Senate and the Administration to work with physician, patient, hospital and other provider groups to craft bipartisan solutions so all American families can access affordable and meaningful coverage, while preserving the safety net for vulnerable populations, he said.The CBO has estimated that 24 million people will lose their healthcare coverage under the Republican plan.
The elderly and sick (you know, the people who need medical care the most) will be hit the hardest by the GOP bill.
Under the AHCA, states will be able to gut protections for pre-existing conditions and tell insurance companies that they can charge sick people as much as they want, even if that means these people are priced out of coverage altogether.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
