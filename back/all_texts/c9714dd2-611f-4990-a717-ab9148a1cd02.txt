Just yesterday, amateur president Donald Trump made an ass out of himself by failing at history, and today, he s calling for a future government shutdown.
Only Trump could f*ck up the past and the future, all in 24-hours.
Trump wants to shut down the very government he s leading, which is a thing a real president would try to avoid.
Former President Barack Obama made concessions in order to avoid a government shutdown, but the man-baby POTUS is whining on Twitter over the deal which was reached on a $1 trillion-plus bill to fund the government for the final five months of this fiscal year.Even though Republicans control Congress, the Senate and they have installed a Republican president, Trump did not get funding for his ineffective border wall, taxpayer dollars will not be spent on a deportation force, the bill includes $295 million for Puerto Rico s Medicaid program and Congress budget will not defund Planned Parenthood.
And that s just the short list.Obviously, this has upset the former reality show star, who previously deemed himself to be a great negotiator.On Twitter, he wrote, The reason for the plan negotiated between the Republicans and Democrats is that we need 60 votes in the Senate which are not there!

Our country needs a good shutdown in September to fix mess!

Our country needs a good "shutdown" in September to fix mess!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 2, 2017So, if he doesn t get his way he wants to change the rules.
There s a reason the prospect of a government shutdown is hugely unpopular, so one Twitter user schooled him.
@realDonaldTrump You're reckless.
Shutting down the government isn't like closing a casino.
The last government shutdown cost the economy ~$24B/0.6% GDP.

Joseph Amodeo (@josephamodeo) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump @NatlParkService @USTravel @realDonaldTrump, if the government does in fact shutdown, it means you didn't do your job.
The American ppl cannot afford a shutdown Joseph Amodeo (@josephamodeo) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump @NatlParkService @USTravel and while we're at it: We cannot afford an increase in gas tax.
These consumption taxes disproportionately affect low/middle income ppl.
Joseph Amodeo (@josephamodeo) May 2, 2017It s true that Trump is literally calling for an increase in gas tax.
We remember when conservatives blamed Obama for gas price increases when that was not in his control, but now a Republican president wants to deliberately raise the price of gas through a tax increase.Twitter users were not amused by Trump s reckless tweet.
@realDonaldTrump Wait.
You put "shutdown" is quotes so according to Sean Spicer, you don't really mean it.
david nuzzy nussbaum (@theNuzzy) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Maybe attempt to be a president for ALL the people and reach across the aisle for a bipartisan agreement like EVERY PRESIDENT BEFORE YOU.
david nuzzy nussbaum (@theNuzzy) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Last week you were blaming democrats for shutting down the government Jail Donald Trump (@DTrumpExposed) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump You sound like a toddler throwing his trucks (we know you like them) out of his playpen because other kids are being mean.
Grown the fuck up Mike P Williams (@Mike_P_Williams) May 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Well, now you're at least being consistent with your earlier, positive views on government shutdowns https://t.co/07wlKUr1cS Simon Hedlin (@simonhedlin) May 2, 2017Trump is more unpopular than any other president during their first 100 days in office.
I wonder what he s trying to distract us from this time (cough, cough, Russia).Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
