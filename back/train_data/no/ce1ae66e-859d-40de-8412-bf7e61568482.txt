in case you missed this earlier today a woman was hit by an anarchist and then dragged by her american flag .
she ran to find the attacker and came upon a group of black lives matter girls who taunted her .
it s sickening to watch but shows just hoe hateful these people are .
she explains in the second video down fox news : woman waving american flag hit , dragged by antifa at # bostonfreespeechrally .
