You would think that a businessman would understand math.
Not Donald Trump.Democratic congressional candidate Jon Ossoff narrowly missed an outright victory in Georgia on Tuesday.As Republicans poured money into the race, Ossoff s anti-Trump campaign soared and nearly cruised to an easy win in a district that is considered a Republican fortress.In other words, Ossoff should not have been able to even get close to winning.
But Donald Trump s increasing unpopularity combined with his incompetence gave Democrats a strategy to become competitive in even the most conservative areas.After being upset in Delaware and nearly losing in Kansas, Republicans had much to be worried about on Tuesday as election results flowed in.Even Trump recognized that the race in Georgia represents a backlash against his administration and Republican power in Congress, which is why he attacked Ossoff repeatedly on Twitter.It s a test of what Republicans could expect in 2018 when the midterm election rolls around.Instead of a Republican wave, however, the current party that controls Congress could be swept out of power by a Democratic wave, paving the way for Trump s impeachment and the reversal of the destructive policies he and his Republican friends in Congress have put in place so far.In the end, Ossoff did not secure the 50 percent of the vote needed to win.
The election now heads to a runoff in June between Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel.But that didn t stop Trump from declaring that race a victory for Republicans and taking credit for it.Despite major outside money, FAKE media support and eleven Republican candidates, BIG R win with runoff in Georgia.
Glad to be of help!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2017Dems failed in Kansas and are now failing in Georgia.
Great job Karen Handel!
It is now Hollywood vs. Georgia on June 20th.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 19, 2017The problem is that Democrats did not fail.
Ossoff captured 48 percent of the vote in a district that should have easily been won by Republicans.
Handel only got 19 percent of the vote and Ossoff got more votes than just about every Republican on the ticket combined.Twitter users were more than happy to humiliate Trump s math skills.
@realDonaldTrump Dems didn t fail in Georgia.
The super liberal Democrat @ossoff got more votes than every single Republican by far.

Erich McElroy (@erichmcelroy) April 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump He got 48% of the vote twice as much as Handel.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) April 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump By failing you mean how well Ossoff did despite tons of dark money spending by the Reps in Rep territory.
Alright.
Anirvan Ghosh (@anirvanghosh) April 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump Just for the record, Ossoff won twice the number of popular votes as Handel.
That s called a win .
Anirvan Ghosh (@anirvanghosh) April 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump You should ask Ossoff how it feels to actually win the popular vote.
Mark Pygas (@MarkPygas) April 19, 2017@JordanUhl @realDonaldTrump Just gotta love the fact that a reality tv star is whining about Hollywood Patricia Zh.
(@ljtost) April 19, 2017@Mike_P_Williams @realDonaldTrump I don t ever remember @BarackObama repeatedly bashing every person that didn t vote for him.
Probably because he was a decent person, though Dana Smith (@Brady5thOrBust) April 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump Are you kidding me?
Are you unable to comprehend basic math?
Dems have the most votes in GA. What is wrong with you?
?

You keep using this word.
I do not think it means what you think it means.
