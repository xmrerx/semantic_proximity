WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S.
Senator John McCain, who bucked Republican leadership to help quash a healthcare measure in an overnight vote, said on Friday it was time for Republicans and Democrats to work together for a fresh start on healthcare reform.
“Our inability to address the pressing health care needs of the American people with meaningful and lasting reform is inexcusable,” he said in a statement.
“The vote last night presents the Senate with an opportunity to start fresh.” “It is now time to return to regular order with input from all of our members – Republicans and Democrats – and bring a bill to the floor of the Senate for amendment and debate.”
