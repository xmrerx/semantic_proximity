london ( reuters ) - the european union is entirely confused since britain voted to leave the bloc and it needs to revisit its vision for enlargement and turkey s place in that , turkish prime minister binali yildirim said on monday .
launched in 2005 after decades of seeking the formal start of an eu membership bid , ankara s membership negotiations have long been sensitive for france and germany because of turkey s status as a large , mainly muslim country .
the large purge that president tayyip erdogan has carried out following a failed coup attempt in july 2016 has worsened relations between brussels and ankara .
during a visit to london , yildirim said the european union needed to look again at its plans to expand the bloc .
after the brexit decision the eu is entirely confused .
they need to revisit their vision for the future , how far they are going to enlarge and what place turkey will have in that .
we are here .
we are not going anywhere , he said .
yildirim also reaffirmed that turkey did not believe that the crisis in neighbouring syria could be resolved whilst president bashar al-assad remained in power .
the current regime is responsible for the way things have evolved in syria ...
i don t think it s a realistic prospect to build lasting peace in syria with assad ( in place ) , he said .
