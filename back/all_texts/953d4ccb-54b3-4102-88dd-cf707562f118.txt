Buckle up America.

Chicago politics can get really ugly, and when we have a Chicago community organizer lives in our White House all bets are off.
It doesn t help that we have a Congress who is willing to sit back and watch him trample our Constitution When President Obama spoke in reaction to the heinous October 1 attack on Umpqua Community College, he went beyond his usual calls for more gun control and suggested instead that America consider following the path blazed by Australia and Great Britain.In the mid-1990s Australia and Great Britain both instituted what were virtually complete bans on firearm possession.Obama referenced the bans thus:We know that other countries, in response to one mass shooting, have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings.
