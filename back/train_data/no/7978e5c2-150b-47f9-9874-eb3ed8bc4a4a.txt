paris ( reuters ) - right-wing heavyweight xavier bertrand quit france s main conservative party , the republicans , on monday , highlighting the challenges its new chief will face in trying to keep the party together .
the move comes a day after party members overwhelmingly elected laurent wauquiez as a their new boss , following a campaign during which he said president emmanuel macron was too weak on security and immigration .
i don t recognize my political family , so i decided to leave it , bertrand , a former health minister and current head of hauts-de-france , a region in northern france , said on france 2 tv station .
bertrand s move underlines growing concern among moderate members of the republicans about the party s direction , after a disastrous presidential campaign that saw its candidate eliminated in the first round .
some have said wauquiez was hauling the party too far to the right and running after the national front , whose leader marine le pen made it to the second round of the presidential election last may .
xavier bertrand obviously considers that he has no place ( in the party ) .
it s his choice .
i respect it , wauquiez said on tf1 tv station , in reaction to the news .
i move forward , i look to the future and what i want is to make a new generation emerge , this new right that live to its ideas , he said .
