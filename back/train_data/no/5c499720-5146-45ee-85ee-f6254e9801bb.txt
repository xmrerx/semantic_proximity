moscow ( reuters ) - kremlin critic alexei navalny called on his supporters on wednesday to hold street protests this weekend across russia , in defiance of an official ban , to demand that navalny be allowed to run in next year s presidential election .
navalny , a vocal critic of president vladimir putin , was jailed for 20 days on monday for repeatedly violating laws governing the organization of public meetings and rallies .
his arrest , the third this year , means that he will miss a campaign rally planned in putin s hometown of st petersburg on oct. 7 - the russian leader s birthday .
appealing to his supporters via his facebook page , navalny called on them to attend protests in both st petersburg and moscow on saturday , adding that 80 of his support groups were meanwhile organizing protests across russia .
our task is to make oct. 7 the day when every decent person will pronounce aloud or to himself at least these two demands : political competition and navalny s admission to the polls , he said in the appeal , which he said he had dictated from jail .
the authorities have banned the planned weekend rallies in moscow and st petersburg , and the kremlin warned on tuesday that those calling for the protests would be prosecuted .
putin said earlier on wednesday that he had not yet decided whether he would run for re-election in march 2018 , something he is widely expected to do .
opinion polls show that if both putin and navalny were running , the incumbent would win by a wide margin .
