It can easily be said that Donald Trump is not the most honest person in the world.
In fact, he s made a career out of being a conman.
From scamming businesses in real estate ventures to hosting a reality television show to his most recent and brutal scam getting people to think he s actually qualified to be *president (he s not).Even Trump trying to get folks to believe that the news is fake is more proof that he s a conman.
You see, if the news reports on everything he is doing wrong, people will stop believing him, and he can t have that.
So, what does he do?
Make the phrase fake news!
popular.Hitting back on Trump s attack on the free press was none other than legendary author Stephen King, and he says what we re all thinking when it comes to Trump.King kept it short, brutal and directly to the point.
He wrote: The news is real.
The president is fake.
The news is real.
The president is fake.
Stephen King (@StephenKing) July 9, 2017And he s absolutely right.
Trump wants you to think the news is fake and for you to believe him because then you won t notice how horrible of a *president he is.
But not only that, you won t notice all the investigations that surround the fact that he may not even be the legitimate winner of the 2016 election.Trump is a conman.
Conmen lie.
So, to reiterate King s point, The news is real.
The president is fake.
