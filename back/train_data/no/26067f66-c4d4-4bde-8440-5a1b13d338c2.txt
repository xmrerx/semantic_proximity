almaty ( reuters ) - an uzbek dissident who was detained this week on return from exile has been charged with two public security crimes that each carry a possible five-year sentence , news website gazeta.uz quoted police as saying on thursday .
nurulloh muhammad raufkhon , the first prominent dissident to return to uzbekistan since the death of its long-time leader islam karimov , was detained on arrival on wednesday , raising questions about the new president s efforts to change the country s image .
doniyor tashkhojayev , deputy chief of tashkent police , told local media raufkhon had been charged in absentia and put on a wanted list after a criminal investigation launched in may .
the charges include making public calls for unconstitutional change of the state order and producing and disseminating materials containing threat to public security and public order .
each is punishable by up to five years in prison .
the interior ministry did not respond to requests for comment .
raufkhon was in exile in turkey after publishing in the spring of 2016 a book critical of karimov who had run the former soviet republic with an iron fist since 1989 .
the authorities then raided raufkhon s house and put him on a blacklist of potential extremists and dissidents , which forced him to stay abroad .
karimov died last september and his successor , shavkat mirziyoyev , last month ordered the removal of 16,000 people , including raufkhon , from the blacklist , as part of a broader liberalisation campaign .
but raufkhon s detention and possible conviction could indicate that uzbekistan s powerful security apparatus is putting limits on such reforms .
according to privately-owned gazeta.uz , deputy chief of police tashkhojayev said police would investigate raufkhon s case and also see if his alleged crimes could fall within the scope of an amnesty .
