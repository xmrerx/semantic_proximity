LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May said on Monday she expected any deal with the European Union to be struck close to the end of the two-year negotiating period and only then would Britain know the costs or benefits.
We are negotiating a deal.
We will not have negotiated that deal until, I suspect, close to the end of the period (which has been set aside), May told parliament.
