Almost every well-known celebrity will likely get a moment where a gossip magazine does a feature on them telling the public what we may not know about them.
So, keeping with the tradition of doing the same for politicians that may not have been featured, Bill Maher on HBO s Real Time just did 25 Things You Don t Know About Donald Trump.
Many of them were funny: I don t drink alcohol, I cause others to drink alcohol.
Not only do I read the Bible, the Book of Revelations mentions me by name.
Mar-a-lago is Spanish for House of Douche.'
I saved the box Melania arrived in so I can return her when she turns 50.
I never actually believed Obama was born in Kenya.
Because I thought the name of the country was Kanye.
Yet, some were all too real: Sometimes, late at night, I worry that my obsessive self-aggrandizement and self-promotion are symptoms of a inner weakness and a transparent, childish impulse that everyone can see.
I worry they re laughing at how obvious it is that I m an abandoned, frightened child swirling in a black emptiness.
Or hitting Trump on his obvious racism: I cry at movies because they re integrated.
And, of course, going back to the oldie, but a goodie where Maher calls Trump an Orangutan: I can peel a banana with my feet.
Maher hits the nail on the head, and I don t care who you are, this segment is beyond hilarious, because most of them are probably true.Watch the full segment here:Featured image via video screen capture
