donald trump s inaugural address received poor reviews for it s divisive and negative tone , not to mention the countless lies and promises he won t keep .
but apparently , fox news liked it that way.trump portrayed america as a dystopian wasteland where inner cities are run by criminals , the military is crippled , and poverty is a plague across the land even though crime is down , the economy is strong with unemployment below five percent , and the military is the most funded in the world.trump also suggested that president obama was a tyrant who kept control of the government away from the people even though president obama was duly elected by the people in 2008 and 2012 with a bigger popular vote and electoral vote margins than trump received in 2016.fox news , however , loved trump s speech and trump appreciated them kissing his ass so he tweeted about it on saturday morning.a fantastic day and evening in washington d.c.thank you to @ foxnews and so many other news outlets for the great reviews of the speech !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 21 , 2017and twitter users had no problem trashing trump for it .
@ realdonaldtrump @ foxnews the speech had such a 1930s classic feel to it .
