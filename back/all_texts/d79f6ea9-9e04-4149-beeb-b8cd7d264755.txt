Donald Trump continues to give American voters important clues and hints as to why we shouldn t vote for him.
He fits the typical prototype for a demagogue, and his comments about minorities and women have rendered him the most divisive presidential candidate in modern history.
His most recent act of idiocy came when a man confronted him with concerns over Trump s tendency to swear during debates and on the campaign trail.The man first asked Trump about a new ad targeting him over his use of words like, motherf*cker, p*ssy and a** to describe his opponents and wanted to know whether Trump thought that was presidential.
Trump said: I was a little concerned with that ad until I saw it.
I think it s better than any ad I ve ever taken for myself.
The man then pressed Trump more saying, A lot of parents are trying to figure out how to explain some of the language they re hearing on the campaign trail.
That s when Trump threw a hissy fit and shot out a typical red herring, preferring to attack the man rather than address his valid question: Oh you re so politically correct, oh look at you.
Oh I know, you ve never heard a little off-language.
Aren t you just a perfect young man.
You know it s stuff like that, that people in this country are tired of.
I don t have children but one can only imagine the parenting skills required to explain Donald Trump, to explain how this individual is actually running for the most powerful position in the world and has support.
The hope is that Americans can send a powerful message to their children and to the world by ensuring this character does not become president.Watch video here:Donald Trump responds when asked whether his use of vulgar words, highlighted in a critical new ad, is presidential.https://t.co/ht2rbbZPiS NBC Nightly News (@NBCNightlyNews) March 10, 2016 Featured image via video screenshot
