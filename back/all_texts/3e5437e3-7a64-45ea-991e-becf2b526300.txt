You might ve noticed that Donald Trump didn t really care for President Obama s final State of the Union address.
During the address, the billionaire Twitter troll noted the following:The #SOTU speech is really boring, slow, lethargic very hard to watch!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 13, 2016See, first of all, State of the Union addresses aren t supposed to be like President Camacho s speech in Idiocracy.
In fact, they re not supposed to be like literally any of Trump s nonsensical, lie-filled, stream-of-consciousness pander shows.Also, Trump s talking about Obama here arguably the greatest political orator in modern history.But here s another explanation for Trump s ridiculous tweet.
Hours earlier, Trump held another one of his spoken-word performance art pieces in which he satirizes a hackish, frivolously conducted presidential campaign wait, correction.
He s not satirizing anyone.
On purpose.
During the address, Trump got a taste of his own medicine by a pair of comedians who infiltrated the auditorium and hectored Trump from the crowd.In addition to pretending to support Trump, Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler began to get restless, eventually shouting Boring!
and We re bored!
We came here to be entertained!
at the presumptive Republican nominee.
Naturally, Trump can dish it out but he can t take it so, reacting to the comedians, Trump gestured to his security and muttered, Get em outta here.
If only we could do the same to Trump.So, like so many others before him, the comedians were escorted out of the room.
Of course, this brings up yet another example of Trump being incapable of personally dealing with someone he doesn t like, while simultaneously expecting us to believe he can stand up to Putin and ISIS.Frankly, after Obama pledged to lead an effort to cure cancer, I m shocked Trump didn t come out against curing cancer.
