Recently, Donald Trump shocked even his critics by openly offering to destroy a Texas state senator for a Sheriff who didn t like his opposition to the corrupt practice of civil asset forfeiture that s when police can take your stuff regardless of whether or not you have been convicted of a crime and you often have to prove your possessions innocent to get them back.After Rockwall County, Texas, Sheriff Harold Eavenson, told Trump about a lawmaker who had proposed asset forfeiture legislation he thinks would aid drug cartels, Trump straight-up offered to destroy the guy: Who is the state senator?
Do you want to give his name?
We ll destroy his career.
The room erupted in nervous laughter, but Eavenson refused to name names.
I m not into assassinating his character, he said.Sheriff tells Trump that state senator is doing something he doesn't likeTrump: "Do you want to give his name?
We'll destroy his career."

Ultimately, it appears that Trump s sheriff was lying to him.Whether or not Trump s buddy was lying, one state senator from Pennsylvania who also opposes the practice has something to say to Trump: Bring it.
Hey @realDonaldTrump I oppose civil asset forfeiture too!
Democratic Senator Daylin Leach wrote on Tuesday.

Thank you for the laughs and the spine.
Laurel McNair (@yamdothprotest) February 9, 2017Konni Burton also spoke out against Trump and his sheriff friend., pointing out that she didn t even know who the hell the latter was until he opened his mouth and appeared to issue a veiled attack against her.
I have never met with Sheriff Eavenson, nor even heard of him before yesterday.
However, I take exception to his comments on asset forfeiture reform, she said in a statement, adding that she will not be discouraged nor deterred by the attack.No matter who Trump offered to destroy, even if he was a figment of Eavenson s imagination, it is clear that we have an unstable, vindictive, tangerine menace in the White House one that needs to be removed by any legal means available as soon as possible.Featured image via screengrab
