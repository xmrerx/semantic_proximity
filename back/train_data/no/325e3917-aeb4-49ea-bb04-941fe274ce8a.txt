( reuters ) - moody ’ s investors service on tuesday slapped a negative outlook on kansas ’ aa2 credit rating , citing the state ’ s reliance on one-shot measures to balance its budget .
that followed action late last month by standard & poor ’ s , which put kansas ’ aa rating on review for a possible downgrade after the state lowered its revenue estimates for the current and next fiscal year by $ 228.7 million .
governor sam brownback plans to divert $ 185 million in sales tax revenue from the state ’ highway fund to the general fund and delay a $ 96.5 million fiscal 2016 pension payment to help fill the gap .
“ by continuing to balance its budget with unsustainable , nonrecurring resources , including pension underfunding , it is accumulating large and expensive long-term liabilities that it will be paying off for a long time , ” moody ’ s said in a statement .
the credit rating agency also revised the outlook on $ 2.1 billion of aa2-rated kansas highway revenue bonds to negative from stable .
the kansas budget is feeling the effects from action taken by brownback and the republican-controlled legislature in recent years to cut corporate and other income taxes to help the state compete with bordering missouri and other states for business development and jobs .
the state ’ s fiscal year begins on july 1 .
