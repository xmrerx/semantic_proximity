this is hysterical and sad at the same time .
watters world discusses the democrat debate with democrats who discuss hillary s pantsuits deep stuff here are a few of the comments : i didn t watch it actually i saw that lincoln chafee was in the debate and that just turned me off immediately .
i just found it very boring .
i had a hard time staying awake .
i actually missed donald trump .
i can t believe it .
