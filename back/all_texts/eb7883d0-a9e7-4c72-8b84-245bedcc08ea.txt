New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is catching heat on Twitter after he spent Sunday soaking up the sun with his family on a state beach that was closed to the public.
The outrage was caused when the state legislators couldn t agree on a budget so they closed down 11 miles of state beaches to the general public during 4th of July weekend BUT the rules apparently don t apply to Christy!Christie hosted a private beach party!
He was caught lounging at the beach with his entourage which catapulted the hashtag #ChrisChristie to the top of Twitter trends on Sunday night into Monday morning PHOTOSHOP GOLD!

The citizens of New Jersey deserve someone who doesn t think he s above the rules and regulations.
It s banana republic behavior at best.
He didn t help himself when he said if people want to enjoy the beach then they could try and be governor OUCH!
