Donald Trump and his entire administration seem to be nothing more than Russian stooges.
And no, this is not merely rumor; after all, even the intelligence community is so sure that the Kremlin has infiltrated Team Trump that they are withholding key intelligence from the White House.
Now, it seems that things have gotten so hot that Trump s loyal and treasured national security adviser, Retired General Michael Flynn, has resigned.This move comes after a flurry of reports concerning Flynn s pre-inauguration contacts with Russian officials.
At first, the Trump team including Mike Pence went on national television and gave the whole nothing to see here speech regarding the phone calls.
Flynn even flat-out denied speaking about important matters, such as sanctions, with the Russians.Then, within the last few days, it was revealed that there were transcripts of the calls, and indeed, they reveal that Flynn discussed the sanctions that the United States had leveled against Russia in retaliation for interfering in the presidential race in order to help elect Trump.
Apparently, Flynn lied to Pence about this, thus forcing Pence to lie to the American people.
All of this seems to be too hot to handle for the Trump White House, so late Monday night, the news that Flynn was gone broke via CNN:CNN: Two sources tell CNN Michael Flynn has resigned.

There needs to be a thorough vetting of everyone in the Trump White House, and if there is evidence of criminal activity of any kind, those people need to prosecuted and yes, that includes the president, Donald Trump.
