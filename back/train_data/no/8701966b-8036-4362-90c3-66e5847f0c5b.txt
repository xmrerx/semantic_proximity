nairobi ( reuters ) - the u.s. embassy in eritrea said it has received reports of gunfire in several parts of the capital , asmara , after protests erupted in one of africa s most secretive nations .
the embassy advises u.s. citizens to avoid the downtown area where protests appear to be more prevalent , it said in a statement late on tuesday .
avoid areas where demonstrations are taking place and exercise caution when in the vicinity of any large gatherings , protests , or demonstrations .
it was not immediately clear what had caused the protests .
opposition outlets said the incidents were triggered after the government tried to close down an islamic school in a predominantly muslim district .
in some footage posted online , shots are heard being fired to disperse crowds .
via twitter , information minister yemane ghebremeskel downplayed the protests , saying : small demonstration by one school in asmara dispersed without any casualty .
eritrea , which sits on the red sea coast next to one of the world s busiest shipping lanes , seceded from ethiopia in 1991 after a three-decade war for independence .
conflict broke out once again seven years later over a border spat with neighboring ethiopia , and the un has since accused the government in asmara of committing crimes against humanity under the guise of national security .
a u.n. commission of inquiry report last year said that atrocities - including an indefinite military national service program that amounted to mass enslavement - had been committed since the country s independence and were ongoing .
eritrea denies the charges .
