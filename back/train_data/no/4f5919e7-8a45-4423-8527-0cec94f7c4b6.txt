new york city begs to differ of course , this is just another way of obama saying , screw trump and screw america , we re building muslim communities in your hometowns and communities with or without your permission .
in an official statement on the eve of ramadan , an islamic holy month , barack obama said the united states would continue to welcome muslim refugees despite voices that seek to divide us .
i stand firmly with muslim american communities in rejection of the voices that seek to divide us or limit our religious freedoms or civil rights , he said in the statement .
i stand committed to safeguarding the civil rights of all americans no matter their religion or appearance .
obama s speech regarding ramadan , the monthlong holiday observed by muslims through fasting during daylight hours , did not mention donald trump by name , but clearly seemed to be directed towards the republican nominee .
here in the united states , we are blessed with muslim communities as diverse as our nation itself .
there are those whose heritage can be traced back to the very beginning of our nation , as well as those who have only just arrived , he said .
