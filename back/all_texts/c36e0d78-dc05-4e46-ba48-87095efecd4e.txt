Donald Trump s heavily-conservative base is filled to the brim with stupid people.
It s one thing for polls and studies to prove that TrumpFans are absolute morons, but it s another for the billionaire 2016 hopeful to actually admit it.On Saturday at an Iowa campaign rally, Trump told his fanatical followers to their faces that they are so stupid they would even support him if he shot someone in broad daylight, in front of a crowd of people.
I could stand in the middle of 5th Avenue and shoot somebody and I wouldn t lose voters, ok?
It s, like, incredible.
Yes, it is incredible.
It s incredible in the first place that anyone regardless of political leanings could support a man who wants to ban Muslims from entering the United States (even if they are returning from vacation), waste taxpayer dollars to build a gigantic wall, make followers of Islam register in a national database and wear special badges to let everyone know their religion, and throw them in concentration camps as a temporary measure.
It s almost baffling.But what is more baffling is that Trump standing before a crowd and telling them they are so stupid they would continue to support him if he murdered someone in cold blood in a scenario in which there is no question of his guilt does absolutely nothing to dissuade them from supporting him.He is right the loyalty of his fans is iron-clad, and it is clear that they love him no matter what he does or says, no matter how horrible.Trump is probably right: He could probably shoot someone in front of a crowd of people, and his followers would defend him especially if the victim was black, gay, Muslim, Jewish, or anyone who wasn t a white Christian conservative.
Even then, it is unlikely their support would waver Because they re f*cking stupid.Watch Trump tell his followers how stupid they are below:Featured image via screengrab
