DHAKA (Reuters) - A truck carrying relief supplies for Rohingya Muslim refugees skidded off a hilly road in Bangladesh and plunged into a paddy field on Thursday, killing nine people and injuring 10, police and aid workers said.
The accident happened in a district near the Myanmar border where refugees have been arriving since late last month to escape a Myanmar military offensive against insurgents that the United Nations has described as ethnic cleansing.
Six died on the spot while three died on the way to hospital, A. K. M. Jahangir, a senior official with the Red Crescent relief group, told Reuters.
Some of the injured were in critical condition, he added.
The dead and injured were laborers, traveling in the truck to help distribute the aid supplies.
About 422,000 refugees from Myanmar have poured into Bangladesh since Aug. 25, when attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts triggered the Myanmar army offensive in response.
Buddhist-majority Myanmar denies ethnic cleansing, saying its security forces are tackling Rohingya terrorists.
