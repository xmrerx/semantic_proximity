paris ( reuters ) - the right of lesbian couples and single women to have access to assisted reproduction was a matter of social justice and will likely be legislated next year , a french government minister said on tuesday .
the move would mark a significant extension of gay rights in france , where violent protests preceded the legalization of same-sex marriage and adoption by homosexual couples in 2013 .
it was a campaign promise .
it will be honored , marlene schiappa , minister for gender equality , told bfm tv .
she said a bill would likely pass through parliament in 2018 .
current legislation means that gay women with sufficient funds travel abroad for artificial insemination while other women without the financial means can not .
schiappa said that was unjust .
french law still restricts techniques such as artificial insemination using donated sperm to heterosexual couples .
a national ethics committee said last june that it backed the idea of medically assisted procreation for female couples and single women .
macron , president since may , had set such a recommendation as a prerequisite to any legislative action .
