While Democratic and Republicans candidates continue to battle it out for who will win their respective nominations, new polling has suggested some very likely outcomes.
It looks as though if Donald Trump is the Republican nominee, not only will it tear the GOP into shreds, but they also won t stand a chance of winning the general election in November.According to a new CNN/ORC poll, both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders would crush Donald Trump in the general election.
In fact, the only candidate that may give either Democratic candidate a run for their money would be Marco Rubio, but so far in this primary process he has yet to win one state, so the chances of that happening are little to none.
Clinton and Sanders would also beat Cruz, Carson and Kasich.It looks as though Hillary would best Trump 52 percent to 44 percent and Sanders 55 percent to 43 percent, and the pattern of polling suggests for both Democrats that this will only increase for both of them as the months go on.
Needless to say, a Trump Republican nomination would handily lead to another Democrat in the White House.Here s the thing, though.
To make sure of this much-needed defeat of Donald Trump, who is looking more and more like the potential nominee, liberals are going to need to unite behind whichever candidate gets the nomination.
This would mean Hillary supporters backing Sanders, and Sanders supporters backing Hillary come November.
Basically, no matter who vote blue.
Unless, of course, you d like to see a racist madman instill fascism into the nation, because in that case, by all means, stay home and have yourself a pity party.All things considered, it s looking remarkably good for Democrats and painfully desperate for Republicans.
If Democrats are able to unite while the Republican party disintegrates before our very eyes, we will have a Democrat in the White House.Featured image: Instagram/Flickr/Flickr
