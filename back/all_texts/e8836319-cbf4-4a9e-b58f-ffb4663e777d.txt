Look, I know how hard this job can be.
That s why I know Hillary will be so good at it she s got the courage, the compassion, and the heart to get the job done.
And I say that as someone who had to debate her more tan 20 times.
The President went on to thank the Democratic nominee for serving her country as Secretary of State, praising her judgment, toughness and commitment to American values: So I want those of you who have been with me from the beginning of this incredible journey to be the first to know that I m with her.
I am fired up and I cannot wait to get out there and campaign for Hillary.
Wrapping up, President Obama thanked the millions of voters who came out in the primaries, and promised Democratic unity.
But Obama specifically thanked Senator Bernie Sanders, who he says ran an incredible campaign, for bringing out thousands perhaps even millions -of new, young voters and energizing the party.
He also thanked the Senator for bringing the issue of income inequality and big money to the forefront of the debate, something he thinks will be good for November.Thanking these two patriots, President Obama is calling on Democrats to get out and vote for a brighter future.With poll numbers high, and his promise to take on Trump head on, could Clinton ask for a better campaign surrogate than President Obama?Watch President Obama s endorsement here:Featured image via video screen capture
