What a great idea!
Sheriff Joe Arpaio is considering a run against unpopular Senator Jeff Flake He s got lots of support from the people of Arizona after serving as Maricopa County sheriff for 24 years.
He d be a straight shooting senator, if elected.
He would also be on board with the Trump Train unlike Jeff Flake.We think it s a possibility that if he runs he d win!
He is 85-years old but sharp as a tack unlike some senators we know.
Would you vote for Sheriff Joe?
The bottom line is there s no way I m going to go fishing.
I have no hobbies Sheriff Joe ArpaioAfter receiving President Trump s first pardon, Joe Arpaio s plans have gone from possible prison to book-writing, speeches and potentially another run for office in Arizona, with Sen. Jeff Flake s seat one opportunity he is eyeing.The former Maricopa County sheriff told the Washington Examiner he s upset at negative reaction to the Friday pardon, and that he feels Republican politicians are insufficiently supportive of the president, who he calls a great man.
I could run for mayor, I could run for legislator, I could run for Senate, Arpaio said Monday.
One particular race, however, is likely to gain significant attention: the GOP primary next year facing Flake, R-Ariz., a forceful Trump critic.
I m sure getting a lot of people around the state asking me to challenge Flake, said Arpaio, who served 24 years as sheriff before losing reelection in 2016.
All I m saying is the door is open and we ll see what happens.
I ve got support.
I know what support I have.
