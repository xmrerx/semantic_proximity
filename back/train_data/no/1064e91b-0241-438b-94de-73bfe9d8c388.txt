hong kong ( reuters ) - a hong kong appeals court on monday ruled that a british lesbian whose partner works in the city should be granted a spousal visa , a landmark decision that could lead to expatriate same-sex partners moving to the chinese-ruled financial hub .
the british national , known as qt , had been refused a dependant s visa on the grounds that she was not a spouse , even though she had entered a civil partnership in england .
marriage in hong kong is defined as a monogamous union between a man and a woman , but discrimination based on sexual orientation is against the law .
the former british colony returned to chinese rule with wide-ranging autonomy , including a free judiciary , in 1997 .
in a unanimous decision reached by three judges , the court of appeal found that the director of immigration failed to justify the indirect discrimination on account of sexual orientation that qt suffers .
while the legal definition of marriage was not challenged in the appeal , chief judge andrew cheung wrote that times have changed and an increasing number of people are no longer prepared to accept the status quo without critical thought .
excluding a foreign worker s lawfully married ( albeit same-sex ) spouse or civil partner ... to join the worker is , quite obviously , counter-productive to attracting the worker to come to or remain in hong kong to work in the first place , he added .
the court ordered qt and the department of immigration to work together on an agreement and submit it to court within 28 days .
hong kong s lgbt advocates welcomed the decision , with the city s first openly gay lawmaker , ray chan , calling it a big win for same-sex dependants to apply for a visa to stay in hong kong .
same-sex marriage was legalized in taiwan in may , a first in asia .
in mainland china , homosexuality was listed as a mental disorder until 2001 , but it is not illegal to be gay .
