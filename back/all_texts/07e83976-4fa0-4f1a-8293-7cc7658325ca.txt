A teacher in Maryland is apparently gunning for a chance to be Donald Trump s pick for Secretary of Education.

the teacher can be seen putting her hands on the woman s son as she ejects him from class but it s what happened after that that has people up in arms.

Do you wanna be a punk-ass n*gger who s going to get shot?
