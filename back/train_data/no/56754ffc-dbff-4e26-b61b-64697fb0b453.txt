kellyanne conway was trying to discuss the accomplishments of president trump with alison camerota of cnn but camerota was having none of that .
she kept referring to russia .
conway finally let it rip : alisyn , i know that we just like to say the word russia , russia to try to mislead the voters .
and i know that cnn is aiding and abetting this nonsense as well .
alisyn camerota : but my question for you is , what is the white house , what is president trump now doing to prevent russia from doing this again ? kellyanne conway : this report is new , and we ll discuss it with him later .
but he s been very clear , on the record , that he believes in any type of numbers of measures to make sure that democracy flourishes and that voter integrity is intact.camerota : such as ? conway : he has an entire commission on that.camerota : i mean , against russia .
what is he doing specifically to try to stop this ? conway : alisyn , i know that we just like to say the word russia , russia to mislead the voters .
and i know that cnn is aiding and abetting this nonsense as well .
but you ve asked me the same question three times now camerota : kellyanne ! conway : and i ve answered it.camerota : but you re not answering it , kellyanne.conway : yes i am .
