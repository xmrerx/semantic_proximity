Amateur president Donald Trump s hostility towards the Environmental Protection Agency is revealing by his pick to head the EPA who attacked his own agency during an address to the Conservative Political Action summit last week.
The former reality show star is hell bent on raping the environment, this time with an executive order directing the Environmental Protection Agency and the Army Corps of Engineers to consider rolling back a regulation aimed at protecting America s waterways from pollution.Apparently, the alleged president doesn t realize that humans need water to live.
There s a price to pay for such action, such as lawsuits and that s something Trump is familiar with.
But, he s about to get a ton of sh*t coming down on him via Democratic Attorney Generals for rolling back that protection on clean water.Talking Points Memo reports: We strongly oppose President Trump s action today that undermines Clean Water Act protections and the public health and environment of our states, the attorneys general in New York, Hawaii, Massachusetts, Oregon, Vermont and the District of Columbia said in a statement.The group of attorneys general, led by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, suggested taking legal action against the Trump administration in the statement.
We won t hesitate to protect our people and our environment including by aggressively opposing in court President Trump s actions that ignore both the law and the public s paramount need for clean water, the AGs wrote.
Abandoning the Clean Water Rule will allow uncontrolled pollution of these critical water resources.
It could also harm the competitiveness of our state economies by forcing us to spend more to clean up the pollution of deregulated waters coming from upstream states that refuse to control such pollution, they added in the statement.As for Scott Pruitt, Trump s pick as Environmental Protection Agency Administrator, it was recently revealed that he used a private email to conduct state business while he was attorney general in Oklahoma and lied about it under oath.
