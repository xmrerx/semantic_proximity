Did you know that a record number of illegals crossed our border last month?
While we re focusing on the Syrian refugee influx, our southern border is wide open.
Donald Trump has said that he wants to stop the invasion of illegals with a wall which is what our government promised they would do in 2006.
Now we have immigrant rights activists promising to throw the 2016 election because Trump wants to put an end to open borders.
George Soros and his Open Society are behind this effort.
Wasn t this Obama s plan all along?Immigrant rights activists have vowed to sign up 1 million immigrants mostly Mexicans for citizenship and then quickly register them to vote in time to punish Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans at the polls in November for their harsh rhetoric.The advocates say the new voters could make a difference in the presidential race, where most of the Republican field has tacked to the right in word and policy, and in key Senate races in Illinois and Florida, where Republicans will be reaching to hang on to critical seats.With nearly 9 million legal immigrants already eligible to become citizens, the 1 million goal is not far-fetched.
The activists say they are counting on energizing another 2 million Hispanic citizens who have turned 18 since 2012 and who they believe will turn out to vote to defend fellow Dreamers, or young illegal immigrants, against Republican calls for their deportation.
This is a huge amount of latent power, said Joshua Hoyt, executive director of the National Partnership for New Americans, the group he and other leaders announced Thursday at the National Press Club.The effort is funded in part by the Open Society Foundation, the project of liberal billionaire George Soros.Hispanic leaders insist they are ready to flex political muscles commensurate with their size as the second-largest racial or ethnic group in the country behind whites.Via: WT
