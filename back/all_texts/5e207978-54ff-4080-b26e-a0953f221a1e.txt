TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said on Wednesday that he wants North Korea to understand it has no bright future if it continues on its current path and that the reclusive country needs to change its policies.
Abe told reporters he wants to discuss the North Korea situation with Russian President Vladimir Putin and South Korean President Moon Jae In separately when they meet this week in Vladivostok.
Abe and Putin are also expected to discuss economic cooperation and a peace treaty between the two nations.
