While this election was undeniably (from one side) meaner and more divisive than perhaps ever before, most elections do become mean and divisive, but the winning party usually calls for unity while the losing party licks its wounds.Non-Trump voting Americans are licking their wounds in their constitutionally (for now) protected way, by protesting.
The media, of course, generally only reports on the worst of the protesters, while less attention has been paid to the rising violence and hate crimes from Trump supporters.Trump had this to say about the protests:Just had a very open and successful presidential election.
Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting.
Very unfair!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016One Trump supporter (and perhaps the worst person in the entire f*cking world) has strong opinions about the protests.
Instead of blaming them on the usual suspects, like those who have darker skin, Ann Coulter is blaming the protests on fat girls.
Yes, really.Without fat girls, there would be no protests.

Fat shaming people for voicing their opinions.
Shame on you.

The Rust Belt wants them but these yahoos forget it UN-Deplorable AB (@on_the_gulf_2) November 10, 2016Trump supporters, listen up, you won.
We admit it.
We (for the most part) aren t claiming the election was rigged (unless you count the FBI and WikiLeaks), but win in grace you a**holes, not that Trump supporters and especially Coulter have any idea what grace is.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
