One Donald Trump supporter just realized that she voted for the wrong candidate.Teena Colebrook knew she had made a terrible error in judgment after Donald Trump picked former Goldman Sachs partner Steven Mnuchin to head the Treasury Department.
I just wish that I had not voted, Colebrook said.
I have no faith in our government anymore at all.
They all promise you the world at the end of a stick and take it away once they get in.
Colebrook believed Trump when he said he would drain the swamp, his term for getting rid of all the Washington insiders and elites.
She believed he would keep his promise to look after and take care of ordinary Americans like herself.
But Trump s choice of a billionaire big Wall Street banker changed her mind about Trump.Colebrook bought a triplex in 1998 in Los Angeles for $248,000.
She rented out two units to make extra income and lived in the third.
She kept up the payments but then the recession hit and her two tenants lost their jobs.According to the Associated Press,Over five years, she tried unsuccessfully to adjust her loan with OneWest through the Treasury Department s Home Affordable Modification Program.
But she said that One West Bank lost paperwork, provided conflicting statements about ownership of the loan and fees and submitted charges that were unverified and caused her loan balance to balloon.
By the time she lost her home in foreclosure in April 2015, the payoff balance totaled $517,662.OneWest Bank was owned by Steven Mnuchin, and Colebrook is not the only person he screwed over.
Two years ago, Mnuchin s vulture bank literally tried to take a house away from a 90-year-old woman over a 27 cent bill.That s how petty and greedy Mnuchin is, and that makes him unfit to be in a position that is supposed to serve the American people and protect them from economic predators like himself.Featured Image: Screenshot
