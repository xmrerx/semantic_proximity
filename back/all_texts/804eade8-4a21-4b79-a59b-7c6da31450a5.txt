WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump voiced caution on Wednesday on his relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying he would wait and see about future ties with Moscow.
But Trump, at a White House news conference, said that Secretary of State Rex Tillersonâ€™s meetings in Moscow this week, which included a meeting with Putin, went better than expected.
