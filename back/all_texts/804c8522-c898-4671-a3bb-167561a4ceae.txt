With absolutely no shame or apology, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump finally admitted to the American public that President Obama was, in fact, born in the United States of America despite his repeated efforts to prove otherwise.
It s now not as politically convenient for Trump to still push this issue considering he now has to try to win over the opposing side of the topic.Trump said: President Obama was born in the United States.
Period.
Now, we want to get back to making America strong and great again.
Profound, really.
And absolutely pathetic.Here s the thing, though, Trump is full of absolute horseshi*t because he was the Birther-in-Chief back half a decade ago, even going so far as to claim credit for the fact that Obama released his birth certificate.
And even after that, Trump still had his many doubts over its authenticity.There s even video of him from 2011 stating how much he believes this is a very valid issue that needs to be looked into.
He even went so far as to say calling those who wanted to see the birth certificate birthers was derogatory because they re actually on to something.
And ever the political opportunist, he said: People love this issue especially in the Republican Party.
So, when you hear Trump say that President Obama was born in the United States.
Period, remember what he really thought and likely still thinks.
You can also tell he s doing it for pandering purposes because he ended his announcement with his damn campaign slogan.Those who haven t caught on to how absolutely smarmy Trump is, need to wake up and wake up fast.Kyle Griffin of MSNBC s Last Word posted the video on Twitter:Trump on birtherism in 2011: "People love this issue especially in the Republican Party."
