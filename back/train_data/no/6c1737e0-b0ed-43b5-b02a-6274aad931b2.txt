abuja ( reuters ) - nigeria s president muhammadu buhari said the country can not afford to go back to dark days of insecurity in the oil-producing niger delta region .
in a speech to present the 2018 budget , buhari called on all sides to maintain dialogue .
last week , the militant group niger delta avengers threatened a brutal and bloody return to the violence that last year slashed oil output .
oil minister emmanuel ibe kachikwu will visit the region this week in an attempt to maintain the ceasefire .
buhari also said the country s exemption from production cuts organized by the organization of the petroleum exporting countries was a significant help to the country during its most challenging time .
