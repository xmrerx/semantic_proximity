vienna ( reuters ) - an international nuclear test-ban body that runs a global network of listening posts designed to check for secret atomic blasts detected an unusual signal underwater last week near where an argentine submarine went missing , it said on thursday .
the vienna-based comprehensive nuclear test-ban treaty organization ( ctbto ) runs monitoring stations equipped with devices including hydrophones - underwater microphones that scan the oceans for sound waves .
two of its monitoring stations detected the unusual signal , the ctbto said in a statement , adding that it was passing the information on to the argentine authorities coordinating the search for the ara san juan , which had 44 crew on board when it went missing last week .
an argentine navy spokesman said earlier on thursday that an abnormal sound detected near the submarine s last known position in the south atlantic was consistent with an explosion , but the ctbto was more guarded on the possible cause .
it could be consistent with an explosion but there is no certainty about this , ctbto hydroacoustic engineer mario zampolli told reuters .
he agreed with the navy spokesman s description of the signal as unusual and short , adding that the cause was non-natural .
we can also calculate the time when the event happened in that location and that time is about three and a half hours after the last contact that the sub apparently had , according to what s out in the news , he said .
the stations that detected it are far apart , in the atlantic and indian oceans , he added .
