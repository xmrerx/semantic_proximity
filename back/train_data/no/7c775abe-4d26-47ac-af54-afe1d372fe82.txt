this story of courage and conviction by a small town in alabama who is fighting back , will make you want to stand up and cheer !
this is about a city council who is actually putting the safety and well-being of 99.80 % of the population before the .2 % of transgenders in america .
as expected , the gay mafia descends on oxford , al .
please call the mayor of oxford , leon smith at 256-831-2660 and let him know you support him and the city council s decision to keep our women and children safe.the oxford city council on tuesday made it illegal for anyone to use a public bathroom that doesn t align with the gender they were born with.the new law , approved unanimously by the council s members , restricts a person s use of public bathrooms and changing rooms to the facilities designated for use by those of the gender listed on his or her birth certificate .
the law applies within both the city s limits and police jurisdiction.after members approved the new city ordinance , council president steven waits read from a prepared statement.waits said he and the council sought the law not out of concerns for the 0.3 percent of the population who identify as transgender , but to protect our women and children .
he said the measure isn t meant to be discriminatory , and comes in direct response to the bathroom and changing-room usage policy put forth by supermarket chain target , which has a store at oxford s exchange shopping center.the company posted that policy in a blog on its website last week , referencing recent debate around proposed laws in several states .
that debate has been heated in north carolina , where news outlets report that scores of protesters have been arrested this week while demonstrating for or against a statewide law that extends similar restroom restrictions .
we welcome transgender team members and guests to use the restroom or fitting room facility that corresponds with their gender identity , read the company s post , put online last tuesday.waits said he s received an overwhelming number of complaints from city residents regarding the company s policy since it was announced.under the new law , alleged violations must be reported by a witness or committed in front of a police officer to be prosecutable.those found to have violated the law would be fined $ 500 , or sentenced to six months in jail.there are some exceptions to the new rule , though : adults are allowed to accompany children under the age of 12 into the restroom .
those who need to do janitorial or maintenance work , to offer emergency medical assistance , or to assist the disabled , likewise are permitted to enter any bathroom.via : anniston star
