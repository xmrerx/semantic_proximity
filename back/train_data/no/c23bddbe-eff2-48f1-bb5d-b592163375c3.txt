america does not have a king .
america is not a monarchy .
but donald trump apparently thinks otherwise and the american people are not happy about it.when president obama visited england for the first time , he declined the gold-plated carriage the royal family offered for his use during the state visit , opting instead to ride in a motorcade .
the motorcade was not only easier to provide security for , it was less expensive and demonstrated that obama was truly a man of the people.donald trump , however , is demanding that the horse-drawn gold-plated carriage be rolled out for him and that a parade be organized down the mall to buckingham palace in october.of course , we all know that trump is not a man of the people no matter how much he makes that claim .
after all , we re talking about a man who continues to live in a gold-plated penthouse in trump tower.trump literally thinks he s a f * cking king and he is demanding to be treated like one even though the constitution makes it clear that such titles of nobility are not recognized in this country.the cost of security is going to be massive and it s the american taxpayers who are going to be picking up the tab.as news of trump s ridiculous demand spread , americans took to twitter to virtually tar and feather him in the public square of social media.while enjoying the spoils of stealing an election , the trump royal crime family requests a gold-plated carriage ride with the royal family .

https : //t.co/fkh5sf0cmy erik huey ( @ erikhuey ) april 15 , 2017at this point , the world and the american public should all tell trump to f * ck off .
he s an embarrassment who has turned our nation into a laughingstock around the world .
trump is not acting like a president , he s a petulant child pretending that he is a monarch .
that s as un-american as it gets.featured image : alex wong/getty images
