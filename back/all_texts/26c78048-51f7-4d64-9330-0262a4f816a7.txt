Former NH Governor John Sununu let Alison Camarata have it when she asked about the Russia investigation and Robert Mueller.
Sununu said that Trump should have been notified if he was under investigation and then he slammed Mueller for hiring all Dems.Camerota: Should the White House know if the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice?
Sununu: If the President is being investigated for obstruction of justice, the White House should have been officially notified.
Sununu: What bothers me the most and there must be a reason for it, is Mueller making four of his first hires so blatantly biased lawyers, pro-Democrat lawyers with a bias certainly against the President.
Maybe Mueller has decided internally that this isn t going anywhere and that the only way he can have credibility on a decision saying that there s nothing there is to have that decision come from a group of lawyers that are so blatantly biased against the President.
CNN Reports Three members of the legal team known to have been hired so far by special counsel Robert Mueller to handle the Russia investigation have given political donations almost exclusively to Democrats, according to a CNN analysis of Federal Election Commission records.
