President Obama was asked during a press conference what his thoughts were on the likelihood of a Donald Trump presidency.
Pulling no punches, he laid out exactly why Donald Trump will never be president: I continue to believe Mr. Trump will not be president, and the reason is because I have a lot of faith in the American people, and I think they recognize that being president is a serious job.
It s not hosting a talk show or a reality show, it s not promotion, it s not marketing, it s hard.
And a lot of people count on us getting it right, and it s not a matter of pandering and doing whatever gets you in the news on a given day.

Trump has no qualifications for being president, and Obama knows it.
Most of the American people know it.
His only supporters are about a third of the Republican fringe who run on pure emotion and are otherwise clueless about civics, and how government works.President Obama didn t restrict his criticism only to Trump.
He also took the opportunity to dig hard at Marco Rubio with a blistering comment about his flip flopping in order to pander to the Trump effect: The other countries around the world, they kind of count on the United States being on the side of science and reason and common sense.
There is not a single candidate in the Republican primary that thinks we should do anything about climate change, that thinks it s serious.
Well that s a problem.
