The Democratic infighting between Bernie Sanders and his supporters and Hillary Clinton and her supporters is about as useful as a fart in a jar.
We re all on the same side, fighting for the same changes, fighting to make sure everyone gets a fair shake, fighting for the American people and against Republicans who want to tear us further apart.So, when false narratives are spoken that Hillary Clinton is somehow copying Bernie Sanders on some of his policy platform ideas, it serves absolutely no purpose other than to divide what needs to be a united front.
Tell everyone what you re for, instead of trying to be ridiculously petty and disparaging in an effort to bring someone else down.One of the latest lies about Hillary Clinton is the remark that she somehow is copying Bernie Sanders on raising the minimum wage.
However, if anyone has access to the internet, they can easily find a record of her accomplishments, as well as what she s proposed and advocated for including a minimum wage increase.Watch the video below and you will see Hillary pushing for a raise in the minimum wage back in 1995 that s over 20 years ago.
She s clearly been pushing for a better standard of living for workers nationwide long before she even remotely dreamed of running for president.This election needs to be about what each candidate brings to the table; their experience, their plans, their ability to get it done.
What this election should not be about, is trying to dissuade people from voting based on lies.And if we re going to really try to get real about wages, we need to think about solutions that will actually work.
A flat minimum wage increase, while sounding great on paper, simple to understand, and is a great place to start, won t be as effective as tying wages to the cost of living nationwide.
MIT even put out a living wage calculator to help the process along.
This may mean higher than a $15/hr wage in some regions, and lower in others.
The cost of doing business is different in different regions as well, and that also always needs to be taken into consideration.
If businesses are shuttered because they can t afford to stay open, that doesn t help anyone.
But it is true that more money in people s pockets puts more money back into the economy, and is the trickle up economy that will serve to help everyone.
That s just basic economics.Solutions are there if we re willing to look for them, and we need to figure this out, but that s not going to happen through the noise of trivial political games.// < !
