blacks in america are seeing the writing on the wall with the push for mass immigration to america and it s not a pretty picture .
barack hussein obama , america s first black president will do more to harm the black community in his reckless attempt to create a one-party system in america than any president in the history of the united states.the unnamed activists representing the lost american network group makes some great points : we in the black community we have seen videos of ( senator ) hall calling other organizations out there that are predominately white , racists .
we would like to send a message to him .
we feel that he is not representing the black community , so therefore , we feel that he is racist .
we wan na know why black politicians like him have turned their back on the black community .
