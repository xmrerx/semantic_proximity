Can you believe this?President Obama s old revolutionary pal, Bill Ayers, was front and center in the middle of a protest staged outside the Chicago Board of Trade/CME Group blocking entrances to the building and demanding a transaction tax on trades made through the exchange.Ayers can be seen in this Fox Business live coverage emerging from the center of the of the crowd blocking the entrance.
He remains center frame for almost a minute.
