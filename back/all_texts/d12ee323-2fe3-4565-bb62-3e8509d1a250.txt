WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The president of Microsoft Corp expressed deep disappointment on Tuesday with President Donald Trump’s decision to rescind a program for immigrants brought into the United States illegally as children and urged Congress to protect these so-called Dreamers before embarking on tax reform legislation.
“We say this even though Microsoft, like many other companies, cares greatly about modernizing the tax system and making it fairer and more competitive.
But we need to put the humanitarian needs of these 800,000 people on the legislative calendar before a tax bill,” President Brad Smith said in a statement.
“As an employer, we appreciate that Dreamers add to the competitiveness and economic success of our company and the entire nation’s business community.
In short, urgent DACA legislation is both an economic imperative and a humanitarian necessity.”
