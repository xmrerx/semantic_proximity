Hillary Clinton has a long history of violence and abusing and men, women and security officers.Of course, you ll never see any of these quotes from the condescending former First Witch in the mainstream media, but that doesn t mean they didn t happen.
Hillary has a reputation for having a vulgar potty mouth and a nasty disposition.
Wouldn t it be nice if the GOP leaders cared as much about her negatives as an 11 year old Trump story.Here are a few of her more memorable lines: Where is the G-damn f**king flag?
