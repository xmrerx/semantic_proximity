Judy Woodruff has been a staple on liberal leaning PBS for so long that it s hard to remember she started out in Atlanta just decades ago LOL!
Here s the best clip of the week where Woodruff tries to bait our good friend Jessica Vaughn of The Center for Immigration Studies in answering this question: Did Pres.
Trump send a message that every one of the undocumented immigrants in the U.S. is a threat?
I ve called Jessica Vaughan my hero because she s simply brilliant with facts on immigration and doesn t get off message when interviewed by the left.
Watch how she stays calm and just states the facts to Woodruff AWESOME!If you haven t heard of the Center for Immigration Studies, please go check them out: CENTER FOR IMMIGRATION STUDIES.
They are THE BOMB THE TRUTH BOMB!Did Pres.
Trump send a message that every one of the undocumented immigrants in the U.S. is a threat?
