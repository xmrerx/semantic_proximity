istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish police have detained prominent activist and businessman osman kavala at istanbul s ataturk airport , turkish media and a senior european parliamentarian said on thursday .
kavala , whose anadolu kultur center says it campaigns for rights and cultural diversity including kurdish issues , was taken to the city s counter-terrorism police department , the t24 news website cited his lawyer as saying .
istanbul police declined to comment and there was no immediate statement from the government .
very disturbing news that osman kavala has been detained in istanbul , the european parliament s rapporteur on turkey , kati piri , wrote on twitter .
t24 said he was detained on wednesday evening as he returned from a meeting in the southeastern city of gaziantep after an order was issued for him to be detained for seven days .
police took computers from anadolu kultur s offices , it added .
u.s. state department spokeswoman heather nauert said kavala s arrest was an example of a very alarming trend of detention of civil society leaders , human rights defenders , journalists , academics and activists in turkey .
we have expressed to the turkish government our concerns on many occasions about this trend ...
it remains a major concern of ours , she told reporters in washington .
france s foreign ministry said on thursday it was worried by the arrest of kavala , calling him one of the most important and respected figures of the turkish cultural scene and of civil society .
france like other european countries , regularly cooperate with mr kavala , who is a regular interlocutor to our embassy .
( we ) will be very attentive to developments in this case , foreign ministry spokeswoman agnes romatet-espagne told reporters .
