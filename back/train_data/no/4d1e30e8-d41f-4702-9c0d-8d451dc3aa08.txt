washington ( reuters ) - president barack obama will make his first visit as president to a u.s. mosque next week in a defense of religious freedom , the white house said , following a rise in anti-muslim rhetoric in the united states .
obama will visit on wednesday the islamic society of baltimore mosque , where he will hold a roundtable with the community and deliver remarks , a white house official said on saturday .
at the mosque , the president will “ reiterate the importance of staying true to our core values – welcoming our fellow americans , speaking out against bigotry , rejecting indifference , and protecting our nation ’ s tradition of religious freedom , ” the official said .
he has visited mosques outside the united states on his trips abroad .
obama , a democrat in his last year as president , has appealed to americans to reject anti-muslim comments by politicians , most notably republican presidential hopeful donald trump .
trump , who is leading the republican field in opinion polls , called for a ban on muslim visitors to the united states after a muslim couple inspired by islamist militants killed 14 people in a shooting in san bernardino , california , in early december .
according to a gallup poll in december , americans are now more likely to name terrorism as the top issue facing the united states than any other issue .
