washington ( reuters ) - democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton has won the missouri primary , the associated press reported on thursday , with rival bernie sanders conceding the contest .
results for the contest , which was held on tuesday , were slow to roll in because of the razor-thin margin separating the number of votes received by clinton and sanders .
ultimately , clinton ’ s win was declared by just 1,531 votes .
the sanders campaign had previously weighed the option to request a recount in the tight race , but in an interview with the ap , sanders said he would “ prefer to save the taxpayers of missouri some money , ” as the winner is awarded just two additional delegates of the otherwise nearly evenly split spread .
