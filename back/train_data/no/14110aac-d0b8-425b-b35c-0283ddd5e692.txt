baghdad ( reuters ) - iraqi forces are about to launch an offensive to recapture the last patch of iraqi territory still in the hands of islamic state , the military said on wednesday .
your security forces are now coming to liberate you , said leaflets dropped by the iraqi air force on the western border region of al-qaim and rawa , according to a statement from the joint operations command in baghdad .
the militant group also holds parts of the syrian side of the border , but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a u.s.-backed , kurdish-led coalition and syrian government troops with foreign shi ite militias backed by iran and russia .
islamic state s self-declared cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in july , when u.s.-backed iraqi forces captured mosul , the group s de facto capital in iraq , in a grueling battle which lasted nine months .
the militants syrian stronghold , raqqa , fell to u.s.-backed forces last week .
islamic state leader abu bakr al-baghdadi , who declared the caliphate from mosul in mid-2014 , released an audio recording on sept. 28 that indicated he was alive , after several reports he had been killed .
he urged his followers to keep up the fight despite setbacks .
god is with us in this last assault on daesh members , said the leaflets dropped by the iraqi forces on the border area with syria , referring to islamic state .
tell those among your children and relatives who took up a weapon against the state to throw it aside immediately , and to go to any house on top of which a white flag have been raised when the liberation forces enter al-qaim .
