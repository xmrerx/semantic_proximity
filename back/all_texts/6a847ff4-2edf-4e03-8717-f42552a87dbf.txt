The election of former reality television star Donald Trump has many people Democrats and Republicans alike upset that our country will soon be led by a complete moron with zero experience and an unpredictable temper.
Now that we re facing a Trump administration, there have been many emerging theories as Americans reflect upon why Trump was able to win the vote over a much more qualified candidate, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.A popular suggestion for why Clinton failed to win the presidency is the idea that she didn t appeal to white working class the way that Trump did.
While Trump connected to this demographic with fear mongering tactics and false promises, many feel that Clinton completely abandoned the middle class.
However, President Barack Obama disagrees and weighed in on what he really things cost the Democrats the election in a revealing interview with former advisor David Axelrod.During this interview, Obama not only accurately stated that he could have easily beaten Trump if he d been able to run for a third term, but he shattered the notion that the Democrats have abandoned the working class.
Obama couldn t have been more spot on when he said, the Democratic agenda is better for all working people.
He continued: I think the issue was less that Democrats have somehow abandoned the white working class.
I think that s nonsense.
What Obama believed was the real issue during this election was that the Democrats weren t on the ground in rural communities.
He also revealed that Clinton had faced a double standard that none of the other candidates were faced with.You can listen to Obama weigh in on the election below, via CNN:Obama: Democrats need to show Americans they care and are bleeding for these communities https://t.co/6bH8yY0qIo https://t.co/cmeuzDx0iv CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) December 26, 2016Featured image via Drew Angerer / Getty Images
