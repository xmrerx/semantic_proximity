beirut ( reuters ) - lebanon s army said on friday it had arrested islamist militants who were planning attacks in the country after foreign embassies warned their citizens to avoid public places .
army intelligence carried out several raids arresting 19 people linked to a cell belonging to islamic state , the army said in a statement .
security forces were taking extra precautions , it added .
the cell which had planned and prepared to carry out terrorist action was led by egyptian fadi ibrahim ahmed , who was based in the ain el-hilweh palestinian refugee camp in southern lebanon , the army said .
lebanon s interior ministry said earlier it was looking into warnings issued by foreign embassies over potential attacks in the country , but that there was no need to panic .
these warnings are based on information from a foreign intelligence agency , the ministry said .
lebanese security services are following up to check its authenticity and accuracy ...
there is no cause for fear or exaggeration .
the french embassy in beirut urged french citizens in lebanon on friday to be vigilant over the next 48 hours , citing an elevated risk of attack targeting public places .
the u.s. embassy said earlier in the week it had barred staff from visiting the casino du liban in jounieh , north of beirut .
canada also warned its citizens on thursday to avoid that area .
