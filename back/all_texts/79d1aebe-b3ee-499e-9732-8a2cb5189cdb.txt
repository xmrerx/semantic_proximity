Children are proof that hate is taught and learned.
We are not born with prejudice.
It is our upbringings that make us hate those unlike ourselves.
Case in point a 7-year-old boy and his little sister, who is 5, who are protesting North Carolina s sweeping anti-LGBT legislation, because their best friend, who is transgender, is being directly affected by it.
The children s story was so inspiring that it was picked up by the popular Facebook page Have a Gay Day.

She posted to the Have a Gay Day Facebook page:Now that I went through all the posts This is my son in the picture.
His name is McCartney, he is 7 years old.
He asked me to take him to this rally because his best friend is Transgender and for her privacy and age, she was not able to attend.
My son is a beautiful, kind and intelligent soul.
He was fully aware of why he was there this day and not only did he know what his sign said, he knew which song it references and can tell you every word of that song and just about any other Beatles song you can throw at him for that matter.
That s his dog in the picture behind him.
HIS name is Rigby, after the Beatles song.
He s our newest rescue and he was proud to be mistaken for a girl all day while my Daughter Starkey Jude was mistaken for a boy.
She didn t mind either and knew why she was there as well, she s 5.
Guess I got pretty lucky to get the amazing, loving, accepting children I was blessed with.
Oh, and they are both vegetarians and go to animal rights protests too.
I m pretty sure I m winning at Momming these 2 amazing humans.
If you doubt that feel free to ask them their opinions, they will definitely tell you.We need more citizens like Janna Harris Cadenas and her children.
The sweep of anti-LGBT legislation across the southeast by bigots in power is nothing short of shameful.
These lawmakers need to take a cue from these children, and realize that hate is not the way.
It is not a family value or a Christian value, and it is certainly not an American value.You re awesome, Mrs. Cadenas, and thank you and your children for your support of our vulnerable community.Featured image via screen capture from The Gaily Grind
