mogadishu ( reuters ) - an air strike hit a village south of somalia s capital mogadishu on wednesday and a local official said the attack targeted islamist al shabaab militants fighting to topple the country s central government .
it was not immediately clear who had carried out the air strike but the united states frequently conducts such attacks to bolster somalia s army in its fight against al shabaab .
a local government official told reuters the strike occurred in ilimey village , about 130 km ( 80 miles ) southwest of mogadishu .
the area is mostly controlled by al shabaab .
the target , he said , was a car used by the militants to transport supplies to a squad preparing bombs .
the strike hit the car ... but we do not know details of casualties , ali nur , deputy governor of somalia s lower shabelle region told reuters .
but mohamed abu usama , al shabaab s governor for the same region , denied that al shabaab personnel had been attacked and instead said the strike had killed civilians .
the strike hit a makeshift tea shop and thus killed 7 civilians and injured three others , he said .
somalia has been trapped in chaos and lawlessness since 1991 when dictator siad barre was toppled .
al shabaab wants to topple the western-backed central government and establish its own rule based on its strict interpretation of islam s sharia law .
an african union peace keeping force amisom pushed the group from mogadishu and other former strongholds .
but the islamists remain a formidable force , carrying out frequent bombings and other assaults on amisom , somali army and civilian targets .
in october over 500 people died in one of somalia s deadliest bombings when a truck bomb exploded outside a busy hotel at mogadishu s k5 intersection lined with government offices , restaurants and kiosks .
a second blast struck medina district two hours later .
