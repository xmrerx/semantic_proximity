The Republican party has become the butt of nearly every single political joke, and they have only themselves to blame for turning the GOP into a laughing-stock.
With the ridiculous antics of the party s presidential candidates and politicians, there isn t a day that goes by that conservatives aren t making Americans shake their heads in either shame or disbelief.Comedy Central s late-night show @midnight decided to have fun with the GOP by challenging Americans to come up with new titles for classic movies, but with a Republican spin.
Using the #hashtagwars segment of the show, host Chris Hardwick asked his guests to come up with new GOP-related movie titles on the spot, and it was absolutely hilarious.
