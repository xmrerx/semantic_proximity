An African-American man made a late night trip with a friend to a CVS in Carytown, Virginia when he managed to do something so terrifying that it sent the staff scrambling to the back room while they waited for police to arrive he asked if they sold cheese.
That particular CVS does not, in fact, sell cheese, but Ricky Berry (who made the voyage de fromage with his roommate) says that the staff disappeared after one of them explained that they don t sell sandwich cheese.
We looked around for probably 30, 45 minutes and we couldn t find anybody, Berry s roommate said, adding that they had encountered another customer who wanted to buy Orajel but could not find anyone to help.
After a while, a police officer showed up and searched the store with the duo of cheese-loving men.
He was laughing with us because, like, this is how weird, apocalyptic movies start.
They found the employees cowering in the back room.
The officer then made some calls and told them they would have to leave.
We re being kicked out because they were scared of us and hiding, Berry said, He just told us that we need to leave premises or else we would be arrested for trespassing and that flipped the script on all of us.
We had no idea what was going on.
The men were unsuccessful in their attempt to contact the store manager but did receive a fauxpology from CVS, who explained that the racist employee was being counseled and retrained rather than fired.Watch a report on this latest example of what will become normal with Donald Trump as President below:Featured image via screengrab
