No actual verifiable evidence is available, but hey in a world where PC rules the day who needs to verify a story?
****Strong language warning (video)****Here s the WWE s statement:WWE terminated its contract with Terry Bollea (aka Hulk Hogan).
WWE is committed to embracing and celebrating individuals from all backgrounds as demonstrated by the diversity of our employees, performers and fans worldwide.Why is not completely clear yet, although obviously the statement points to him saying or doing something that they found offensive.Some have speculated that it is due to this video from 2012, in which he talks about people s use of the term nigga :https://youtu.be/oVyTgh_kBD0One would hope that they would not act so thoroughly and completely to sever the 30 year relationship over something as benign as that.
But in present PC climate, one wouldn t doubt it.Others are pointing to another story, that he supposedly used the terminology fucking n**gers repeatedly on a tape filed in a deposition in a Florida court, this one would be much more problematic, where he calls himself a racist:At that point on the tape, the former Hogan Knows Best star bemoaned how a black billionaire guy had offered to fund his 27 year old daughter Brooke s music career.He also attempts to use bizarre, twisted logic in an attempt to justify his bigotry at the man.
I don t know if Brooke was f*cking the black guy s son, Hulk raved, the sources add.
I mean, I don t have double standards.
I mean, I am a racist, to a point, f*cking n*ggers.
But then when it comes to nice people and sh*t, and whatever.
Then, in a tirade to rival the racism embarrassments suffered by Mel Gibson and Dog The Bounty Hunter, Hulk unloaded even more hatred!According to sources, he said: I mean, I d rather if she was going to f*ck some n*gger, I d rather have her marry an 8-foot-tall n*gger worth a hundred million dollars!
Like a basketball player!
I guess we re all a little racist.
Fucking n*gger.
Of course, according the original news source, THE NATIONAL ENQUIRER, these records are sealed in a Florida court so there is no actual evidence available to the public that can be used to verify this story.Via: Weasel Zippers
