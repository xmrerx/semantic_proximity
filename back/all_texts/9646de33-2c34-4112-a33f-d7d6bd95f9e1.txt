At this point, hearing that there has been violent attacks at rallies held by GOP presidential frontrunner Donald Trump is hardly surprising.
His supporters are notoriously fanatical, and woe betide anyone who gets on their bad side especially when they are all riled up and in the midst of listening to another blistering speech by the leader they look up to so much.
So, to that end, here we are again, reading another news cycle of things gone awry at yet another Trump rally, this time in Tucson, Arizona.It appears that, as is par for the course at Trump events these days, there were bunches of protesters.
Cell phone video has been making the rounds on social media that shows a man, apparently a protester, being brutally attacked by Trump s brute-like supporters.
First, it appears that the man is punched, and then, when he is actually on the ground, he is stomped and kicked, until the authorities show up and break up the altercation.All the while, Trump continues to speak, making his already volatile crowd even more so.
Here is the video, as tweeted out by NBC reporter Frank Thorp:VIOLENCE at another Donald Trump rally, this time in Tucson, AZ.

This, ladies and gentlemen, is Donald Trump s America.
Be afraid.
Be very afraid.Featured image via video screen capture via Twitter
