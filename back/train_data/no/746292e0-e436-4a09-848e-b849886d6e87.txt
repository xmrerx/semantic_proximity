hanoi ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump said on saturday that an agreement with russian president vladimir putin on syria would save many lives after the two met at a summit of asia-pacific leaders .
we agreed very quickly , trump told reporters aboard air force one as he flew from the apec meeting in the resort city of danang to vietnam s capital hanoi .
it s going to save tremendous numbers of lives .
the kremlin earlier said trump and putin had agreed on the sidelines of the asia-pacific economic cooperation ( apec ) summit that a political solution was needed on syria and that they would continue efforts to fight islamic state .
we spoke intermittently during that roundtable .
we seem to have a very good feeling for each other and a good relationship considering we don t know each other well , trump said , adding that he and putin had two or three very short conversations .
trump said putin had reiterated that he did not meddle in last year s u.s. presidential elections , which brought trump to the white house .
trump said a good relationship with russia was important .
in fact it would be a great thing ... because he could really help us in north korea .
we have a big problem with north korea and china is helping us , trump said .
if russia helped us in addition to china that problem would go away a lot faster .
trump said chinese president xi jinping was a good man who wants to do right , but he wanted xi to ratchet up more pressure on north korea .
