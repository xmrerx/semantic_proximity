sao paulo ( reuters ) - brazilian president michel temer said on friday that the pension reform bill that is indispensable to reduce the nation s budget deficit must be voted on this year in the lower house of congress before the 2018 election year .
speaking at a chemical industry event , temer appealed to businessmen to lobby congress for approval of the unpopular pension overhaul that is seen by investors as crucial to restoring brazil s fiscal health .
rodrigo maia , the speaker of the lower house , said this week he would not put the bill to the vote until the government had secured the 308 votes the measure will need for passage .
to allow more time for negotiations with reluctant lawmakers , temer agreed with congressional leaders on thursday to delay the lower house vote on the bill until the week of dec. 18 , the last before the christmas recess .
once it clears the lower chamber , temer expects the legislation to be voted on in the senate in february .
reform of the pension system is indispensable .
it will allow brazil to move forward , temer said .
but this must be the work of all of us .
we need to show that we support this bill .
temer acknowledged that lawmakers facing re-election next october had legitimate concerns about supporting the bill .
the reform proposal seeks to increase the age at which brazilians can retire and collect social security .
it would also make pension payouts in brazil , among the most generous in the world , more modest .
if a vote is further delayed until next year , its chances of approval will be limited as lawmakers become more sensitive to the demands of voters when the election campaign gets underway .
