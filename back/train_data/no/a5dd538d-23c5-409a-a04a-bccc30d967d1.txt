lili bayer and larry cohler-esses haaretzsebastian gorka , president trump s top counter-terrorism adviser , is a formal member of a hungarian far-right group that is listed by the u.s. state department as having been under the direction of the nazi government of germany during world war ii , leaders of the organization have told the forward.the elite order , known as the vit zi rend , was established as a loyalist group by admiral miklos horthy , who ruled hungary as a staunch nationalist from 1920 to october 1944 .
a self-confessed anti-semite , horthy imposed restrictive jewish laws prior to world war ii and collaborated with hitler during the conflict .
his cooperation with the nazi regime included the deportation of hundreds of thousands of jews into nazi hands .
strange character : people are now questioning why trump hired bizarre hungarian author as his terrorism expert.gorka s membership in the organization if these vit zi rend leaders are correct , and if gorka did not disclose this when he entered the united states as an immigrant could have implications for his immigration status .
the state department s foreign affairs manual specifies that members of the vit zi rend are presumed to be inadmissible to the country under the immigration and nationality act.gorka who vit zi rend leaders say took a lifelong oath of loyalty to their group did not respond to multiple emails sent to his work and personal accounts , asking whether he is a member of the vit zi rend and , if so , whether he disclosed this on his immigration application and on his application to be naturalized as a u.s. citizen in 2012 .
the white house also did not respond to a request for comment.continue this story at haaretzread more trump news at : 21st century wire trump filessupport our work by subscribing & becoming a member @ 21wire.tv
