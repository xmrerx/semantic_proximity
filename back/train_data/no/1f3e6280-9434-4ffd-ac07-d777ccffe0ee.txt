his body was found on friday .
the navy was able to recover the body of a foreigner who had been snatched by a crocodile on september 14 , the sri lankan navy said in a statement .
the bbc quoted an eyewitness as saying local people had heard him screaming for help as he was pulled into the river .
by the time they went to the spot where the croc attacked , they couldn t save him because already the crocodile had pulled him inside the water so they couldn t see what was going on , it quoted fawas lafeer , the owner of a surf school , as saying .
mcclean , an oxford university graduate with a first-class degree in french , joined the ft as a graduate trainee two years ago and worked most recently for the fastft news service .
