HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, who is due to be sworn in to replace Robert Mugabe as president on Friday, told a cheering crowd in Harare on Wednesday that the country was entering a new stage of democracy.
The people have spoken.
The voice of the people is the voice of God, Mnangagwa told thousands of supporters who had gathered outside the ruling ZANU-PF party s offices.
Today we are witnessing the beginning of a new and unfolding democracy.
Mugabe resigned as Zimbabwe s president on Tuesday, a week after the army and his former political allies moved to end four decades of rule by a man once feted as an independence hero who became feared as a despot.
