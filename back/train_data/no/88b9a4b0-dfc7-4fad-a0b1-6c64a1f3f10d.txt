baghdad ( reuters ) - the u.s. embassy in iraq cautioned its citizens that there may be unrest during a referendum on independence planned by the kurdish authorities in northern iraq , opposed by the central government in baghdad .
in particular , u.s. citizens should avoid travel into and within territories disputed between the kurdish regional government ( krg ) and the government of iraq , the travel warning said .
the krg has resisted calls by the united nations , the united states and britain to delay the referendum .
iraq s powerful neighbors , iran and turkey , strongly oppose the vote as they fear could fuel separatism among their own kurds .
