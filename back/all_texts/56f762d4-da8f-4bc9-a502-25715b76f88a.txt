Just start asking questions and the Obama administration reverses course very interesting.
The validity of the claim that prisoners don t like pork was called into question by Sen. Chuck Grassley and then the quick reversal on the prison pork ban.
The Obama administration wouldn t be lying?
Haha!
Hummm The Obama administration did a rapid U-turn on its decision to remove pork products from federal prisons after a few questions from Iowa Sen.

To corroborate the validity of the claim that prisoners indicated a lack of interest in pork products, I am requesting copies of the prisoner surveys and responses that were used to support the determination to no longer serve pork in federal prisons, the Republican senator wrote to the agency on Thursday, the Washington Post reported.
Please provide any economic evaluations the Bureau of Prisons has relied on that detail the cost of pork as compared to beef, chicken, and non-meat products such as tofu and soy products.
Pig products were back on the menu within hours of the letter s publication.Grassley also happens to be the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, which oversees the federal prison system.Read more: WND
