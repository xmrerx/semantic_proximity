Despite all the evidence otherwise, Donald Trump is still claiming that he doesn t believe Russia actually hacked our election.
A report in the Wall Street Journal reveals that even though 17 intelligence agencies agree that Russia was behind the hacking of the Democratic National Committee during the 2016 election, Trump still isn t convinced.According to the WSJ, sources say that there is a memo of conversations between Trump and NSA Director Adm. Rogers which detail Trump s refusal to acknowledge that Russia meddled in the presidential election.
This memo reveals that the president questioned the veracity of the intelligence community s judgment that Russia had interfered with the election and also tried to persuade Adm. Rogers to say there was no evidence of collusion between the campaign and Russian officials.
But On June 7, just one day before fired FBI Director James Comey told the Senate Intelligence Committee all about how Trump tried to obstruct justice in every way he could, Adm. Rogers said he felt zero pressure from Trump to push back against allegations of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia.
Trump refuses to say that Russia interfered with our election for obvious reasons.
Admitting that Russia did all they could to rig the election in his favor is the very last thing he wants to do.There hasn t been any doubt that Russia meddled in the election for months now.
Way back in January, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence released a report that pins responsibility for the election attack directly on President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, ruling out the possibility that it was ordered by intelligence officials or simply carried out by Kremlin supporters.
A whopping 17 intelligence agencies agree on this matter.
It isn t up for debate anymore.
Russia.
Hacked.
Our.
Election.However, Trump just can t bring himself to say that.
