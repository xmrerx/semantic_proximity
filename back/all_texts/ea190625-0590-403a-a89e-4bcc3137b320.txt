The White House is finally wising up and realizing that America s current president is a toddler, and Donald Trump literally cannot be left alone for a moment because he might further incriminate himself or cause another PR disaster.Many people have remarked that while Trump s first overseas trip has been filled with several embarrassing moments and blunders, his activity on Twitter has been uncharacteristically calm.
There s a reason for that, and it might become a more permanent thing in the future.According to the Wall Street Journal, Trump s Twitter account may be going under a sort of lockdown that could be implemented long term.
This includes a team of lawyers whose sole task is to vet Trump s Twitter activity to make sure he doesn t make himself or his administration look bad.
Seriously, how sad is it that a POTUS has so little self control that he needs a team of lawyers to monitor his social media activity?!
This is what the WSJ reported:One major change under consideration would vet the president s social media posts through a team of lawyers, who would decide if any needed to be adjusted or curtailed.
The idea, said one of Mr. Trump s advisers, is to create a system so that tweets don t go from the president s mind out to the universe.
In its report, the WSJ gave some cringeworthy examples of how Trump s tweets have gone astray, such as the time he accused former president Barack Obama of wiretapping him, and the time he implied that his conversations with former FBI Director James Comey were taped.Former campaign aide Barry Bennett doubts that this plan will work, as he said I would be shocked if he would agree to that when told about Trump s proposed Twitter surveillance.
However, that s not all the lawyers will be sought out for.
It s being reported that Trump will also meet with attorneys to help deal with the legal ramifications of the Russia investigation.
