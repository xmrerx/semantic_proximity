On Friday, Amy Schumer released a sketch that had been cut from her Comedy Central show, Inside Amy Schumer.
It s a simple but incredibly dark set up: A commercial for an injury lawyer that has given up on helping the victims of mass shootings because the gun industry is almost completely protected by the law.H.
Jon Benjamin, the voice of Sterling Archer on FX s Archer, introduces himself: Have you ever been injured in a mass shooting or other gun crime?
Do you want justice?
Hi, I m Toby Shrak of the law firm of Shrak and Murphy, but don t call me, because there s nothing I can do.
And it gets darker from there.
We re introduced to Shrak s twin brother that was killed in a mall shooting.
We also meet two victims of gun violence that were, shit out of luck.
One of them even had to pay for the ammo company s legal costs because the law prevents them from being sued in the first place!
Isn t America grand?Schumer, fed up with the inaction of the GOP, felt it was time for this particular sketch to be seen.
It highlights the cruel absurdity of American gun laws that protect an entire industry from the consequences of their actions while they rake in billions from selling death and promoting a culture of violence.
It s dark satire at its finest and most necessary.Shrak closes out the commercial with a perfect depiction of the miserable despair the country is forced to live with because Republicans have whored out their souls to the NRA and gun lobby: I ll get the money you deserve.
Unless it s a gun tragedy.
In which case, you can call me just to talk.
I m here and my brother s chair is always empty.
Because he s dead.
And I am getting old.
As funny as it is, it s hard to laugh because the commercial simply cuts too close to the truth:Inside Amy SchumerFeatured image via screen capture
