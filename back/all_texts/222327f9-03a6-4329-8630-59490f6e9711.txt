The Left has called for a boycott against LL Bean after discovering the granddaughter of the founder contributed to Donald Trump s campaign.
Conservatives decided to counter the protest by intentionally purchasing merchandise from LL Bean to counter the efforts of the Left.
Even President-elect Donald Trump came to the defense of L.L.
Bean Inc. on Thursday after a group called for the boycott of the outdoor clothing maker because a granddaughter of the founder supported his campaign for president.
Thank you to Linda Bean of L.L.
Bean for your great support and courage, Mr. Trump tweeted.
People will support you even more now.
Buy L.L.
Bean.
