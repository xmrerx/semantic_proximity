BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian army and its allies reached an air base besieged for years by Islamic State militants on the outskirts of the eastern city of Deir al-Zor on Saturday, said a commander in the alliance fighting in support of President Bashar al-Assad.
Forces this week also broke the siege of a separate government-held enclave in the city in swift advances against the jihadists.
