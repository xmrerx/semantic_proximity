After failing to denounce or renounce an endorsement from the Ku Klux Klan, Donald Trump topped off his Sunday with the announcement of an endorsement from Senator Jeff Sessions (R-Alabama).Sessions said he would be backing Trump thanks to his harsh anti-immigration policies.
You have asked for 30 years, and politicians have promised for 30 years, to fix illegal immigration, said Mr.
Sessions at the rally, held at an outdoor stadium filled with thousands of Trump supporters.
We have an opportunity Tuesday it may be the last opportunity we have for the people s voice to be heard.
He concluded, I am pleased to endorse Donald Trump for the presidency of the United States.
But Senator Sessions has a history of alleged racial insensitivity that fits right in with Trump s white supremacist campaign.In 1986 Sessions was nominated for a federal judgeship, but the nomination failed after allegations of racial insensitivy surfaced.
J. Gerald Hebert, a lawyer from the Department of Justice who had worked with Sessions, testified to the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee that Sessions had referred to the NAACP and the ACLU as un-American and Communist-inspired because they had forced civil rights down the throats of people.
Hebert also testified that Sessions had complained that a white lawyer was a disgrace to his race because he had litigated voting rights cases.Sessions himself admitted that he described the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as a piece of intrusive legislation.
Another assistant U.S. Attorney testified that Sessions told him he used to think the KKK was okay until he found out some of them were pot smokers.
The same attorney said Sessions called him boy and told him, be careful what you say to white folks.
Sessions racial problems resurfaced during the nomination of Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor.
Sessions whined that the judge had referred to herself as a wise Latina, then complained that she did not vote like other Puerto Ricans.Featured image via YouTube
