the banality of evil is how ann mcelhinney , co-producer of the gosnell movie describes meeting with serial murderer , dr. kermit gosnell .
in her emotional interview with dana loesch , ann describes her visit as chilling and sitting in the presence of evil .
ann mcelhinney recently interviewed kermit gosnell , an abortionist sentenced to life in prison for first-degree murder , for a movie she and her husband are making about the man .
she said she couldn t speak for more than an hour after the interview concluded because of how profoundly disturbing the experience was .
he has an answer for everything , mcelhinney said on theblaze tv s dana .
he lives in his own world .
every word that comes out of his mouth is a lie .
he lies so easily .
mcelhinney said she has met many criminals throughout her journalistic career , but with gosnell she said you are really sitting in the presence of evil .
it s almost like all of those literature references to evil and to the devil .
he smiles all the time , mcelhinney said , visibly shaken .
he touched my leg .
he was physically inappropriate sat far , far too close in my personal space .
extremely disturbing .
mcelhinney said gosnell is really happy and relaxed in prison , and started singing twice during the interview in which she asked him about the baby who was born alive during a botched abortion , whose neck he then snipped with a scissors .
i haven t met anyone who chilled my blood to that extent ever before , she concluded .
this man has no sense of guilt .
