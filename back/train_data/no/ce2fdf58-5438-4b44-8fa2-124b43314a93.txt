the idea that a tax-exempt radical organization in the united states of america with ties to the muslim brotherhood , a terror organization can influence our vote by suggesting muslims register voters in mosques should be shocking to every american.could anyone imagine the outrage if non-profit groups were advocating churches register voters to support the republican party ? the last time the muslim brotherhood got involved in an election , it ended with a tyranny , church burnings , terrorism , a civil war , mass sexual assaults on women and a popular uprising against it.presumably the local muslim brotherhood crew is hoping for a better outcome in the united states than they ended up with in egypt , as sharona schwartz at the blaze reports.the head of the council on american-islamic relations said that muslims could comprise the swing vote in the presidential elections if 1 million of them register to vote , as he urged them to turn mosques into polling stations this november .
i believe we have at least 1 million muslim eligible voters in this country .
we have to register every single muslim to vote in 2016 .
the muslim vote can be the swing vote in major states , cair executive director nihad awad said at the muslim american society ( mas ) and islamic circle of north america ( icna ) annual conference in chicago , according to video posted earlier this month.awad explained that cair which is prohibited from engaging in political activity due to its registration as a tax-exempt organization would not be the vehicle by which a candidate would be endorsed .
he said another organization would be set up to promote the muslim-friendly presidential candidate.awad urged all muslims to register to vote and to use islamic centers as polling stations .
turn your centers , islamic centers , mosques into registration centers for voters , into polling stations during the election time , he said .
