If one were to best describe Donald Trump, especially at one of his campaign rallies, he would be the living embodiment of a Fox News Facebook comment section just full of vile, fear-filled, xenophobic, racist, hate-filled rhetoric.Making sure he lives up to this reputation while on the campaign trail in Delaware, Trump decided he would tell people about his experiences with call centers, primarily those that are overseas.
And while these call centers are taking away American jobs, the people who work in these centers overseas are human beings trying to make an honest day s wage for themselves, and should be treated as such.However, Trump decided to do what he always does, and with no regard for who s he s throwing under the bus because he has a point to make, decided to imitate a call center worker from India.Trump said that he called the center to pretend he was checking on his credit card, then asked the worker, Where are you from?
and that s when he did the impression, saying We are from India, in his disgusting attempt to pander to his racist and xenophobic crowd.
Trump then supposedly said to the call center, Oh, great.
That s wonderful.
Thank you very much, that s all I need to know, and proceeds to pretend to hang up the phone.Did he make this story up?
Probably, but it doesn t make it any less racist.Here s the thing, Trump doesn t care who he s offending as long as he s winning.
He s fanning the flames of racism and hatred everywhere he goes, because it s clearly working, and that should terrify all of us.We need to make sure Trump gets nowhere near the Oval Office come November.
He s not only bad for the nation, but it would be devastating for the entire world.Donald Trump says he called his credit-card company just to see if an Indian call center answered https://t.co/Cdv0korqNo ABC News Politics (@ABCPolitics) April 22, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
