Let the mocking commence.On Wednesday evening, conservatives across the country noticed a familiar face sitting in the audience at the DNC Convention.
They may have thought that it was Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, but he s dead and it was actually the actor who portrayed him in the American Sniper movie.That s right, Bradley Cooper and his girlfriend attended the DNC Convention to show their support for Hillary Clinton and conservatives are super pissed about it.Here s some of their reactions on Twitter:Bradley Cooper s DNC appearance indicates his next role as a suicide bomber will be a massive hit in Trukey.
Liberal piece of ?

Mikki Kendall (@Karnythia) July 28, 2016Republicans actually think that because Bradley Cooper played the role of Chris Kyle in a movie that it means he must be a Republican like them.
That s the kind of stupidity that got Trump chosen as the GOP nominee.Of course, it didn t take long for people to mock conservatives for said stupidity.
