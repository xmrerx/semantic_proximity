judge jeanine commented this morning on the fbi director s testimony yesterday and in true judge jeanine style she didn t hold back !
why is he so comfortable with leaking ?
the answers were hogwash !
judge jeanine is spot on in her assessment of comey : james comey comes across as someone who is so wily and so calculating he gets to the point that he says , i m going to start leaking this stuff now .
what is is about his time his background as a prosecutor .
and , what i would like to know is , is he the leaker ? is he the guy who was so comfortable .
and the answer is why did he didn t leak it himself , and the seagulls and the beach , is hogwash the fact that he is so comfortable , that he leaks this to a liberal professer , tells me he was a predator.he was looking to take donald down .
what he wanted to do is take the president down .
he is an operator .
he is part of the liberal elite .
