vienna ( reuters ) - a french businessman said he would pay all fines imposed on women wearing a full-face veil in austria under a law banning it from oct. 1 , an austrian broadcaster reported .
the reported remarks from rachid nekkaz , who already pays fines for women who wear muslim niqabs and burkas despite bans in france and belgium , provoked criticism from austria s foreign minister sebastian kurz .
the austrian ban makes public wearing of the arab-style niqab , which leaves the eyes uncovered , and the afghan-style burqa , which covers the face with a cloth grid , liable to a fine of 150 euros .
i am reaching out to all women in europe and especially to women in austria who voluntarily wear the burqa , i will always be there and pay the fines , nekkaz was quoted as saying in a servus tv interview , which will be aired thursday evening .
if one accepts freedom of religion , one also had to accept a religion s visibility , he said .
the property dealer with algerian roots said he had already spent around 300,000 euros ( $ 360,000 ) covering relevant fines .
foreign minister kurz , who is the conservative front runner for next month s national election with his people s party , said austria would not tolerate symbols aimed at establishing a parallel society .
whoever wears niqab or burka in austria has to deal with the consequence , kurz said .
he threatened to fine nekkaz if he followed through with his plans .
