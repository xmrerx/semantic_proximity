hillary clinton 9/11 nyc pic.twitter.com/q9ynsjtxss zdenek gazda ( @ zgazda66 ) september 11 , 2016update on what went on but still silence from the press : the democratic presidential nominee appeared to faint on her way into her van and had to be helped by her security , the source said .
she was clearly having some type of medical episode .
clinton s stumbled off the curb , her knees buckled and she lost a shoe as she was helped into a van during her unexpected early departure , a witness told fox news.the nypd retrieved her shoe.the lapdog media is downplaying this medical emergency ( as expected ) but would we even know about this had it not been for people recording her departure ?
this was an area that press isn t allowed into .
the clinton campaign came out with a statement saying she felt overheated and is now resting at chelsea s apartment .
do you believe this reason or are you skeptical like me ?
even if it was a fainting spell , this woman seems unwell with all the coughing .
your thoughts ?
