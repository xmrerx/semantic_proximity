these assholes were taken to the woodshed and they deserved it.after british diver tom daley failed to make the final round of the men s 10m platform , a right-wing christian group called christian voice cheered on twitter and used the occasion to claim that being gay somehow prevents athletes from being successful.turning gay doesn t seem to have done tom daley any favours at # rio2016 https : //t.co/tdbt0y5acx christian voice ( @ ukcv ) august 20 , 2016well , harry potter author j.k. rowling refused to let that slide and slammed them on her twitter feed .
can t decide which is more offensive in this tweet , the stupidity or the spite .
