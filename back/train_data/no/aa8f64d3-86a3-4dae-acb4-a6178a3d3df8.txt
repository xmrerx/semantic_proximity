in a lame effort to score political points for hillary clinton , the new york times published a portion of donald trump s 1995 tax return .
they re now promoting the idea that trump could have not paid taxes for decades .
could have doesn t mean he did !
does anyone care that a man with a huge business empire might try and pay less taxes or work the tax system to his advantage ?
isn t that what most people do and it s legal to do it !
i would question trump s sanity if he begged to pay more taxes !
the front pages of the tax returns themselves are essentially a non-issue , representing the 1995 gross business loss incurred by candidate donald trump who operates a massive conglomeration of business entities.the anti-trump political angle is easily identifiable within the extensive article use of : could have , might be , may have , phrases used throughout the woven narrative .
journalistic narratives are rarely based on facts.the identified $ 916 million single year operating income loss is no different than current losses of amazon , facebook , twitter and a host of other corporations and businesses.actually , donald trump s 1995 loss is smaller than the operating loss the new york times reported when it sold the boston globe in 2013 for a net loss of $ 1.03 billion.the times purchased the boston globe in 93 for $ 1.1 billion and sold it in 2013 for $ 70 million , a loss of $ 1.03 billion .
however , for some reason it s doubtful the times will publish their own 2013 tax returns .
that doesn t meet the political need.the trump campaign released this statement : read more : conservative treehouse
