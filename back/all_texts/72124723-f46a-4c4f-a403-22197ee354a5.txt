It looks as though two police officers in Memphis, Tennessee think it s hilarious to take a picture of themselves pointing their gun down a hallway pretending to shoot a black person running.
This, after countless people of color have been killed by the police, including several this past week.The officers have yet to be identified, but according to The Daily Mail: The two unidentified Memphis Police officers were suspended Friday for a picture on Snapchat showing a white person pointing a gun at a cartoon of a young black person.
Memphis Police Department Interim Director Michael Rallings said: At this point two MPD officers have been relieved of duty.
The image is disgusting and will not be tolerated.
We will conduct a thorough investigation and the individuals responsible will be held accountable.
I just spoke to a group of young people at LeMoyne-Owen about decisions and we are responsible for the decisions we make and we are held to a higher standard.
He added: We will not stand for this.
Here is the image:via Facebook (The Daily Mail)It s absolutely unbelievable (yet, sadly believable) that this would be what anyone would post, let alone from a law enforcement officer who is paid to protect and serve the people, all people.
It is clearly racist imagery, and hopefully the officers involved will be properly scrutinized and given the proper consequences.Featured image via Facebook
