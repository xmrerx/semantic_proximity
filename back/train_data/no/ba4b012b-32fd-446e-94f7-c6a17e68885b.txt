brussels ( reuters ) - british prime minister theresa may will meet european commission president jean-claude juncker and his chief brexit negotiator in brussels on monday , dec. 4 , the eu executive confirmed on thursday .
eu officials hope that may will make new offers to unblock negotiations on a treaty on britain s 2019 withdrawal from the union .
they say any british move needs to come by around dec. 4 if leaders meeting at a dec. 14-15 are to be able to endorse a move to a new phase of talks , to include future trade relations .
on friday , may will meet european council president donald tusk in brussels as part of what eu officials describe as a bid to agree the choreography of a deal in december .
confirming the juncker-may meeting , the commission s chief spokesman told reporters they would discuss brexit but declined to comment further on the state of negotiations .
everyone is talking to everyone , already , at all levels , he said .
no comment was immediately available from may s office .
envoys from the 27 other member states agreed on wednesday to delay by a week until wednesday , dec. 6 , a meeting to prepare the drafts of the summit conclusions , diplomats said .
those conclusions will determine whether leaders agree that britain has made sufficient progress toward agreeing divorce terms for the summit to approve new talks on a post-brexit relationship .
