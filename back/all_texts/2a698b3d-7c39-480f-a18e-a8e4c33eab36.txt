Donald Trump turned a tragedy into an opportunity to do some heavy fear mongering after news broke that a truck had driven into a Christmas market in Berlin, Germany, killing 12 and injuring dozens.As expected, Trump s response was highly inappropriate and reckless, as he jumped to conclusions and blamed ISIS and other Islamist terrorists before any concrete facts about the incident had been reported.Here s what Trump said: Our hearts and prayers are with the loved ones of the victims of today s horrifying terror attack in Berlin.
Innocent civilians were murdered in the streets as they prepared to celebrate the Christmas holiday.
ISIS and other Islamist terrorists continually slaughter Christians in their communities and places of worship as part of their global jihad.
These terrorists and their regional and worldwide networks must be eradicated from the face of the earth, a mission we will carry out with all freedom-loving partners.
Likely another effort by Trump to distract the nation from Russia s involvement in the election, Trump jumped at the opportunity to refresh his anti-Muslim rhetoric and remind everyone why he wants to ban Muslims.
There was zero hard evidence to support how Trump reacted, and we can expect much more of this carelessness in January, when he takes office.In contrast, Germany s interior minister gave a much more measured, cautious response: There is a psychological effect in the whole country of the choice of words here, and we want to be very, very cautious and operate close to the actual investigation results, not with speculation.
Those are words that Trump could certainly learn from.
Whether or not ISIS sympathizers were actually behind the Berlin attack is irrelevant to Trump, as he is trigger happy and quick to point blame, even if he doesn t have the evidence to back it up.
This raises massive concerns, and Trump has approximately one month before he begins his role as Commander in Chief.
If he doesn t start practicing some restraint, this country is going to be in big trouble.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
