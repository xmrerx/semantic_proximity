also stop trump reverse course presiding next escalation u involvement countrywith taliban control territory since u first go afghanistan 2001 suppose appearance isi country one wonder last 16 year really aboutsurge 40for past week american mainstream press report pentagon plan send additional troop afghanistan
although number 4000 widely circulate official announcement regard number strategy yet make
new strategy set publicly announce midjuly look though u troop send afghanistan add 8500 american troop already country
similarly fifteen twentynine nato member nation far also agree send troop afghanistan add current nato presence 5000 troop
note currently u nato combat mission afghanistan instead foreign troop mission train afghan force
serious doubt among informed observer whether additional thousand troop make difference
number 4000 suggest general jack keane former vice chiefofstaff u army suggest 10000 20000 additional troop need make difference
similarly past day former cia director defense secretary leon panetta also weigh echo keane opinion 4000 troop would change momentumas danny sjursen author article point upcoming surge troop level would fourth move make u follow three similar increase bush obama year 20082010

afghanistan exactly havea flaw strategyin recent article independent journalist gareth porter point u strategy afghanistan fatal flaw go long way toward explain war win real reason fundamental weakness usnato war fact united state empower rogue gallery afghan warlord whose militia impose regime chaos violence oppression afghan population steal kill rap utter impunity
porter view american objective method oust taliban may shortsighted taliban come power partly response sexual violence predatory behaviour afghan warlord
organization taliban appear 1994 response desperate plea population south especially kandahar province divide four warlord stop wholesale abduction rape woman preteen boy well uncontrolled extortion toll warlord troop
taliban portrayed stand order elementary justice chaos sexual violence immediately win broad popular support drive warlord power across south finally take kabul without fight
ever since invasion 2001 u play favorite warlord pit various leader one another help select one become powerful allow become regional governor put others cia payroll eventually turn private militia national police
year several different u commander take rein war afghanistan strategy use warlord militia persist since adequate source manpower provide security general population afghanistan also usnato coalition troop themselvesthe occurrence greenonblue attack afghan police military uscoalition force one last month kill three american soldier may largely attributable strategy use warlord militia worth mention taliban also actively infiltrate afghan national army afghan national police
moreover helmand kandahar province particular profit drug trade provide temptation every element society

coincidence area taliban strongest country highest level opium poppy cultivation help fund insurgency
although frequency greenonblue attack decline correspond reduced u presence afghanistan number different group interest represent ground make exceedingly complex web relationship always easy see attack comingcoupled flawed fail u strategy alliance unwillingness admit defeat amongst civilian military manager afghan war
combination two factor could significant contributing factor conflict show sign end

porter agree contribute factor war seemingly unending unwinnable career u officer serve bureaucratic stake joint special operation command cia huge program facility country political cost admit futile effort start
plus pentagon cia determine hold afghan airstrip use carry drone war pakistan long possible
word frequently get use regard afghan conflict stalemate
nearly 16 year taliban exercise control 40 territory afghanistan
ally haqqani network resupplying border pakistan consider something safe terrorist despite u ally
danny sjursen write go well exactly surefire thing likely best surge 40 produce long painful tie
criticism may sound harsh hop come surge make difference problem question regard america involvement afghanistan far deeper broader present abovefraud waste abuseon financial level corruption waste rule day afghan american side u involvement astound amount money stake
overall war cost u taxpayer around trillion dollar far fund appropriate reconstruction stand 117 billion
usual look like money form government contract may reason little urgency end war
