beijing ( reuters ) - china urged france on monday to take more effective measures to ensure the safety of its nationals visiting the country , after a group of 40 chinese tourists was tear-gassed and robbed in paris .
attacks on chinese , japanese and korean tourists are relatively frequent in the french capital , as robbers believe they carry large sums in cash and their luggage is stuffed with expensive products .
four men targeted the chinese travelers in the parking lot of their hotel in the val-de-marne suburb southeast of paris on thursday , on their return from a city tour , the state-run xinhua news agency said , citing french media .
the assailants stole nine bags thought to be filled with luxury goods , it said on sunday .
china s embassy in france had contacted police and told them to crack the case , chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying told a news briefing , adding that chinese visitors should be alert to the security situation .
we will urge french police to crack this case as soon as they can and bring the criminals to justice , and take even more effective measures to ensure the safety of chinese citizens in france , hua said .
she said the tour group had already returned to china , and the case was still being investigated .
in august 2016 , 27 chinese tourists were assaulted by six men who boarded a bus that was to take them to paris charles de gaulle airport .
paris is on track this year to welcome more tourists than ever before , the city s tourist board said in august , a recovery from a lull following islamist attacks in november 2015 that killed 130 people .
chinese travelers spent $ 261 billion overseas last year , making them a key demographic for retailers and hotel chains around the world .
but growth in chinese outbound tourism is slowing , with attacks in europe , instability on the korean peninsula and political uncertainty in the united states prompting some chinese to opt instead for domestic trips .
