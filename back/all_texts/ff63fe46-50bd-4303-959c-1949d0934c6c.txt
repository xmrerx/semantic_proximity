IF YOU HAVEN T FIGURED IT OUT YET THE LIBERAL MAIN STREAM MEDIA IS WORKING OVERTIME TO LITERALLY DESTROY TRUMP The American people are rebelling against the lies and distortions from liberal rags like USA Today and other local news organizations.
In this day of social media pushing the news, it s great that people can get the truth from other sources like Twitter or Facebook.Trump now leads in Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, Ohio and North Carolina all states Barack Obama won his first term according to Real Clear Politics averages.
THEY TRY TO DESCRIBE TRUMP BUT END UP DESCRIBING HILLARY CLINTON TO A TEE!
IT S HYSTERICAL!WHO MAKES UP THESE EDITORIAL BOARDS ANYWAY?It didn t go so far as to endorse Hillary Clinton or, for that matter, libertarian Gary Johnson but what USA Today wrote Thursday night about Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump made it clear who the publication s editorial board does not, under any circumstance, want in the White House next year.In its 34 years of existence, USA Today has had a no-endorsement policy.
In a historic first that breaks 34 years of tradition, the board decided this election season to revisit its no-endorsement policy then threw it out and penned a scathing critique of the GOP nominee that read more like an anti-endorsement.Trump, they wrote, is unfit for the presidency.
From the day he declared his candidacy 15 months ago through this week s first presidential debate, Trump has demonstrated repeatedly that he lacks the temperament, knowledge, steadiness and honesty that America needs from its presidents, the board wrote.
Whether through indifference or ignorance, Trump has betrayed fundamental commitments made by all presidents since the end of World War II.
THIS DESCRIBES HILLARY TO A TEE:The editorial calls him her erratic, ill-equipped to be commander in chief and a serial liar.
