kabul ( reuters ) - islamic state claimed responsibility for an attack on monday near a training facility of afghanistan s main intelligence agency in the capital , kabul .
a group of armed men seized a building under construction in a heavily populated area of the city before being killed by security forces , officials said .
aside from the attackers , no significant casualties were reported .
the afshar area of kabul where the attack occurred is close to a training facility of the national directorate of security , the main afghan intelligence agency , as well as a private university .
islamic state claimed responsibility in a statement on its amaq news agency , in which it said two of its fighters had attacked an intelligence agency center in kabul .
the group , which first appeared in afghanistan in 2015 , has claimed responsibility for a number of attacks in kabul over the past several months .
but much remains unknown about how it operates and many observers are skeptical about its ability to mount complex attacks on its own .
