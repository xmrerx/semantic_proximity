So much for the most transparent administration in history Because the step-daughter of Theresa Heinz-Kerry, a woman who is reportedly worth a cool billion, needs her daddy to steal from US taxpayers to help fund her non-profit?
It looks like John Kerry is using his position as Secretary of State to enrich his family, just like his predecessor Hillary Clinton did.More than $9 million of Department of State money has been funneled through the Peace Corps to a nonprofit foundation started and run by Secretary of State John Kerry s daughter, documents obtained by The Daily Caller News Foundation show.The Department of State funded a Peace Corps program created by Dr. Vanessa Kerry and officials from both agencies, records show.
The Peace Corps then awarded the money without competition to a nonprofit Kerry created for the program.Initially, the Peace Corps awarded Kerry s group now called Seed Global Health with a three-year contract worth $2 million of State Department money on Sept. 10, 2012, documents show.
Her father was then the chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, which oversees both the Department of State and the Peace Corps.Seed secured a four-year extension in September 2015, again without competition.
This time, the Peace Corps gave the nonprofit $6.4 million provided by the Department of State while John Kerry was secretary of state.Seed also received almost $1 million from a modification to the first award, as well as from Department of State funds the group secured outside the Peace Corps.The Peace Corps program called the Global Health Service Partnership (GHSP) sends volunteer physicians and nurses to medical and nursing schools in Malawi, Tanzania, Uganda and Liberia, according to Seed s website.
More than 40 clinical educators worked at 13 sites in the 2014-2015 program.Kerry and government officials colluded to launch the program and ensure that Seed would get the contract.Is there anyone in this administration who s not using their power and influence to enrich themselves?Rich, liberal elitists pretend they re all about helping people while engorging themselves at the troth on the taxpayer s dime.Time for them to go.
