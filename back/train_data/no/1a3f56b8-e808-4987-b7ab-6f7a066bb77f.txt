the video begins with a clearly agitated pro-illegal alien female approaching trump supporters .
after a few of the agitators who were part of her group began to act in a hostile and threatening manner , police officers stepped in to form a barrier between the groups .
the human barrier they formed was clearly not okay with the agitators who were looking to use physical force to shut up and shut down their opponents .
shortly after the police officer explained that the trump supporters had a permit ( which means nothing to people who have no regard for the law and are actually protesting on behalf of lawbreakers ) , another man who appears to be hispanic , wearing a hoodie began to aggressively approach the crowd .
we re not sure if these people were being paid to threaten the pro-trump supporters or if they just happened to be angry supporters of illegal aliens , and were in the area.the hispanic man on the pro-trump side in the background , who was holding a deport illegals sign can be heard telling the pro-illegal agitators that he s a legal american citizen and he stands by president trump .
he hilariously follows up his comment with , homies for trump .
the same man can be seen last night at a pro-trump rally on hollywood blvd .

the legal hispanic american seen in the video above is also present at this rally :
