The NYT allegedly wouldn t run Alan Dershowitz s op-ed because of his views on President Trump pic.twitter.com/gXgNzGpI1H FOX & friends (@foxandfriends) July 19, 2017Mr.
Dershowitz told the Washington Examiner in an interview Monday that he s tried to get in touch with the The New York Times editors, to no avail.
He said he wanted to publish an op-ed last month arguing that President Trump likely didn t attempt to obstruct justice when he fired former FBI Director James Comey.
I said that I thought the readers of the New York Times were entitled to hear or read the other side of the issue whether there were crimes committed, he said.
And I really do think The New York Times does not want its readers to hear an alternative point of view on the issue of whether or not Trump administration is committing crimes.
A Times spokesperson declined to comment, telling the Examiner that the paper does not discuss the editorial process for op-ed submissions.Dershowitz lays out his case on Anderson Cooper s 360 show on CNN, as he attempts to explain the constitutionality of President Trump s actions in how he handled former FBI director James Comey.
Watch leftist legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin attempt to argue the protections afforded to our president in the Constitution don t matter if you hate Trump and that he should be impeached:Mr. Dershowitz has made headlines recently for arguing that there was likely no crime committed by Donald Trump Jr. in June 2016 when he met with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya in order to get potentially damaging information on Hillary Clinton.
Mr. Dershowitz has stuck by his claim that the younger Mr. Trump s conduct was likely protected by the First Amendment.
