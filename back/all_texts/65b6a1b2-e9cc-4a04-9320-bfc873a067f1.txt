Don t affiliate me with nothing, he said.
Yeah, I was also a Nation of Islam member, I m not affiliated with it They ll try to put you with ISIS or some other terrorist group no.
Among the five BLM members named in the suit is DeRay Mckesson, 31, a former school administrator turned civil rights activist.The suit claims that Mckesson, who took part in nightly protests after Sterling s death on July 5, was in charge of a march on July 9 that turned into a riot.
