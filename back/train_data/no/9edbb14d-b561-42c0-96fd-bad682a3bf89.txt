baghdad ( reuters ) - iraqi forces have taken control of areas previously held by kurdish forces in mosul s nineveh province in northern iraq , a military statement said on wednesday .
the areas were evacuated by kurdish peshmerga fighters before the arrival of the iraqi forces on tuesday , the statement said .
the peshmerga had taken them over the past three years as part of the war against islamic state militants .
the mosul dam , northwest of the city , is among the positions retaken from the peshmerga , the military statement said .
responding to a kurdish referendum on independence held last month , iraqi government forces backed by iranian-trained paramilitary groups captured the kurdish-held oil region of kirkuk on monday , transforming the country s balance of power .
prime minister haider al-abadi ordered the retaking of kirkuk on monday , as well as all disputed areas claimed by both the semi-autonomous kurdistan regional government and the central authorities in baghdad .
