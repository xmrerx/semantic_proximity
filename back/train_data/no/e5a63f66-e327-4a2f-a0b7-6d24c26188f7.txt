even the most hardened cruz supporters will be switching their votes when they hear about all of the sick liberals who are willing to leave america if trump gets elected .
think of it as a public service donald trump said tuesday that he would be doing a great service to the united states if celebrities , including lena dunham and whoopi goldberg , follow through with threats to move to canada if he is elected president , and joked that he would campaign even harder as a result.on monday , dunham told attendees at an event in new york that she would 100 percent move to canada if trump were elected president , and in fact already had a beautiful and appealing area of vancouver in mind .
other celebrities including miley cyrus , samuel l. jackson and raven-symon have similarly vowed to move to canada in the event trump wins .
well , she s a b-actor .
she has no mojo , trump said of dunham during a tuesday interview with fox and friends .

that would be a great , great thing for our country .
