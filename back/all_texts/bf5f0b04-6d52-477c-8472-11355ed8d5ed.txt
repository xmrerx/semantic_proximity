Donald Trump s hypocrisy was thrown square into his face.For eight years, Trump and conservatives repeatedly called President Obama weak, not to mention just about every other negative word in the book.But now Trump has the gall to call someone a traitor for criticizing President Obama exactly the same way Trump criticized him all these years.Just before President Obama left office, he commuted the sentence of Chelsea Manning, an army whistle-blower who was sentenced to serve 25 years in prison for leaking classified documents.Manning has been a critic of Obama, but despite that, President Obama signed off on the commutation anyway.
He didn t expect thanks or loyalty in return.But Trump says it is treason to not kiss a president s ass after the president does something nice for you, which gives us a glimpse of what he will expect when it comes time for him to issue pardons and commutations.Ungrateful TRAITOR Chelsea Manning, who should never have been released from prison, is now calling President Obama a weak leader.
Terrible!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 26, 2017And Trump just revealed himself as a hypocrite since he has also called Obama weak several times in the past, and the Internet response was humiliating.
@realDonaldTrump shut the fuck up talia jane (@itsa_talia) January 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump Just like you always have.
The people know Obama.
The people love Obama.
Worry about America and not your ego.

Christoph Rehage (@crehage) January 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump Ur standing up for Obama?, never thought i d see the day after how you and your band of nazi warriors degraded him 8 years Diva (@sammypolsen12) January 26, 2017.
@realDonaldTrump Notice Obama isn t tweeting about it?
Sometimes you do the right thing without expecting praise.
It s called leadership.

@realDonaldTrump Let s work on getting your emotions under control when someone makes you mad.
You re leader of the free world now, hun!
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump haven t you called Obama a weak leader repeatedly on numerous occasions?
AJ Joshi (@AJ) January 26, 2017By Donald Trump s own logic, he is also a traitor for repeatedly calling President Obama weak.
And the way he is dismantling this country piece by piece, Trump should be arrested and charged for treason against America.
