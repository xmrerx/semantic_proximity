There is a hashtag trending on Twitter in protest of Maureen Dowd, a prominent, white op-ed columnist for The New York Times who called President Obama Barry.
The op-ed is called The Clinton Contamination, but makes a point of disrespecting President Obama with that racist, derogatory nickname.
Right-wingers decided they needed to co-opt the tag to attack the left on Twitter, proving that they really do think everything is about them.Some of them insisted that they were just trying to keep the conversation on Hillary and her many imagined crimes, while others went full birther, and full racist on Obama himself.
There are plenty of tweets from liberals attacking conservatives, too, but it s very telling that conservatives refuse to see that Dowd s use of the nickname, Barry, is intentionally spoken with racist overtones.#FraudBarry grew up Muslim, mass imported Muslims, & facilitated terrorHe s a terrorist#PresidentObamaNotBarry pic.twitter.com/AZXNWgztpV Jared Wyand (@JaredWyand) July 10, 2016 I will not show respect to Barry as he is someone who routinely disrespects my intelligence, history, and people#PresidentObamaNotBarry Appalachian Son (@KinFolkFirst) July 10, 2016(Because white Southerners are such an oppressed group of people, are they not?

)#PresidentObamaNotBarry is a hashtag that offends people?
People should be more offended by a POTUS that lies constantly & divides you.

#PresidentObamaNotBarry 01000110 01010101 (@hitman0321) July 10, 2016 BARRY Hussein Obama doesn t deserve respect.
He s a traitor.#PresidentObamaNotBarry Patrick Henry (@FightNowAmerica) July 10, 2016There are, of course, some saying that calling George W. Bush Dubya, Bill Clinton Slick Willie, and Richard Nixon Tricky Dick are exactly the same as calling Obama Barry.
Here s why they aren t: Barry is what the birthers were calling Obama way back when they started their racist birther horse pucks.
It carries a racist connotation because the birther movement made it that way.Besides that, W. may have been created as a way to distinguish George W. from his father, George H.W.
way back in the 1970s.
Tricky Dick and Slick Willie, while disrespectful, weren t created with racist intentions.
But racists can t be expected to understand that.
They re the most put-upon demographic in the nations.So after Dubya, Slick Willie, Tricky Dick, etc., you re telling me Barry s off the table?
Go find better outrages.
#PresidentObamaNotBarry Thomas Keister (@thomaskeister) July 10, 2016 So can we also not use Honest Abe, Bill, or Dubya?
Just saying.
#PresidentObamaNotBarry Amanda Johnson (@ama_ro_jo) July 10, 2016Didnt everyone call Bush Dubya ?
Dont Obama s own supporters call him Barry ?
Yall need to calm down & make memes.
#PresidentObamaNotBarry Jackie From Allstate (@AllstateJackie) July 10, 2016 George Bush was called W and not a fuck was given.
Get over your silly-assed outrage #PresidentObamaNotBarry Brian Hammons (@BriHam8) July 10, 2016The creator of the hashtag, Peter Daou, stuck around on Twitter to explain why he created it in the first place, as well as defend it.
There were others, too, who pointed out that this is possibly the worst time to run an op-ed that uses an intentionally racially-charged nickname for our first black president.I created #PresidentObamaNotBarry because a prominent white NYT columnist calling our first black POTUS Barry is profoundly disrespectful.
Peter Daou (@peterdaou) July 10, 2016 It s demeaning, disrespectful of the office, belittling and racially-tinged.
Does that help?
#PresidentObamaNotBarry https://t.co/TFbusVzn3I Peter Daou (@peterdaou) July 10, 2016Considering profound race issues facing U.S., @nytimes should APOLOGIZE for allowing @NYTimesDowd to refer to @POTUS as Barry.
A disgrace.
Peter Daou (@peterdaou) July 10, 2016 After this week in America?
No, @NYTimesDowd Just No.
#PresidentObamaNotBarry Gnu Bangs (@GopSux2) July 10, 2016Dowd referring to POTUS as Barry in The Clinton Contamination attempts to further divide us after a tragic week.
#PresidentObamaNotBarry Kaivan Shroff (@KaivanShroff) July 10, 2016 Tell Maureen Dowd she ought to refer to President Obama with respect, especially at a time like this #PresidentObamaNotBarry@NYTimesDowd Millennials4Hillary (@StillWithHer) July 10, 2016As of the time of this posting, #PresidentObamaNotBarry had well over 28,000 tweets, and was the second top trending hashtag on Twitter.
By contrast, #ClintonContamination was a distant fourth.
