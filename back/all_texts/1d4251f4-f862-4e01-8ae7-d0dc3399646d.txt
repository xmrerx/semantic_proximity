I was wondering if I could get a cake that says: Gay marriage is wrong.
The tolerant answers that follow this question show the astounding hypocrisy of the left.Say that Bestiality Is Wrong or Polygamy Is Wrong and it s not considered hate speech, but if you have the opinion that Gay Marriage Is Wrong the whole world jumps up and down screaming racism bigotry and hatred .This is becoming the politically-correct norm, but no matter what one argues, this is suppressing free speech.No one targeted pro-gay bakeries, but gay activists target Christian bakeries.
Support Gay Marriage is one Christian bakery was sued for refusing to put that slogan on a cake for an event to support the gay agenda.
Yet Christian bakeries that refuse to make pro-homosexual marriage cakes are getting sued left, right, and center.
They get fined, they get death threats, and they lose their businesses.
This experiment proves beyond doubt that the gay agenda is not just about their freedom to practice a sexual orientation, but the suppression of free speech.To make our case we provided 3 video clips, the third one is a video showing homosexual activists in Ireland used the state to force a Christian bakery to make a cake with the slogan Support Gay Marriage for a pro-gay marriage event, but he refused which added a tremendous loss to his business.
Several Christian bakeries were sued in the United States with several who lost their businesses and we said enough is enough.So Shoebat.com decided to call some 13 prominent pro-gay bakers in a row.
Each one denied us the right to have Gay Marriage Is Wrong on a cake and even used deviant insults and obscenities against us.
One baker even said all sorts of profanities against Christians and ended the conversation by saying that she will make me a cookie with a large phallus on it.It was all recorded.
It will stun the American people as to how militant and intolerant the homosexual bakers were.
Even after we completed our experiment we got a ton of hate messages saying that we were hateful for simply giving them a taste of their own medicine.
They argued that the slogan Gay Marriage Is Wrong is not the same thing as Support Gay Marriage as if an opposite view of a view is hateful.
This would mean that the majority of Americans who oppose gay marriage are bigoted and hate filled .
Support Polygamy or Polygamy is Wrong are views, yet the first which the Muslim supports and the second most Americans would never support, but both are opinions and are considered free speech.Watch what happens when a customer wants to buy a cake for his pro-traditional marriage event:****WARNING****STRONG LANGUAGE ALERT*** Language used by baker to customer on phone is extremely vulgar:https://youtu.be/AJaroR_qTNshttps://youtu.be/ptgAKywiHG0The homosexual activist in this third video said you can t choose who you serve, as though he is taking a purely objective position, but when we ask for the reverse of the same message, all of a sudden the saying of you can t choose who you serve, does not apply to us, the Christians.OUR POINTHere is our point.
A Christian making a homosexual cake with Support Gay Marriage goes against his faith and a homosexual putting Gay Marriage Is Wrong goes against his faith as well.
Now of course we honor their right to say no, this is not the issue, but what about honoring the Christian right to also say no?CONCLUSIONThe big lie of the homosexual agenda is this: They claim that they are only fighting for equality and tolerance.This is false.What then is their agenda?Via: Christian Patriot
