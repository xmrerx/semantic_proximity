It s no secret that team Trump is all in a tizzy over Jill Stein s recount attempts in multiple states, but Eric Trump may have just entered a whole new level of idiocy with what he just said and posted on Twitter.He tweeted a link to a Forbes article entitled, The Cost Of Stein/Clinton s Wisconsin Vote Recount Could Have Saved At Least 5,000 Children s Lives, which says nothing about the legitimacy of the recount at all, and is simply a fun clickbait fallacy for the right wing to circlejerk around.
And he tweeted it with the caption, The Sad Truth: The Cost Of Stein/Clinton s #Wisconsin Vote Recount Could Have Saved At Least 5,000 Children s Lives.
