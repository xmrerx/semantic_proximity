beijing ( reuters ) - china and sri lanka should focus on strengthening cooperation over key investment projects , foreign minister wang yi on monday told his visiting counterpart from sri lanka , amid strong local opposition to some major chinese-invested schemes .
in july , sri lanka signed a long-delayed $ 1.1 billion deal to lease its southern hambantota port to china , ignoring an appeal by opposition parties to debate the pact in parliament .
the $ 1.5-billion port , close to the main shipping route from asia to europe and likely to play a key role in china s belt and road initiative , has been mired in controversy since a chinese firm agreed to take an 80 percent stake in it .
the pact signed last year sparked widespread public anger , as chinese control of the port , which included a plan for a 99-year lease of 15,000 acres ( 23 sq miles ) to develop an adjacent industrial zone , provoked fears it could be used by chinese naval vessels .
meeting in beijing , wang told tilak marapana that the two countries should take this year s 60th anniversary of establishing diplomatic ties as an opportunity , china s foreign ministry said in a statement .
both should emphasize strengthening traditional friendship and political mutual trust , major infrastructure projects , investment and trade to upgrade their relationship , wang added .
the short statement did not mention any specific projects .
as one of the first countries to help in sri lanka s post-war reconstruction after the 2009 end of its 26-year civil war , china s ties with sri lanka have unnerved india , traditionally the island nation s most important partner .
by 2014 , chinese navy submarines were also docking in colombo , raising alarm in new delhi and prompting a push by the administration of prime minister narendra modi to claw back influence in the region .
