vatican city ( reuters ) - if you ever wondered how to say fake news in latin , it s nuntii fallaces - and pope francis is writing a document on just that .
francis announced it himself in a tweet to his nearly 40 million followers on friday , saying the theme of his message for the roman catholic church s next world day of social communications will be the truth will set you free .
fake news and journalism for peace .
in latin , one of the nine languages the pope uses to tweet , that would be veritas liberavit vos .
nuntii fallaces et diurniariorum opus ad pacem .
a vatican statement said the issue was important enough for the pope to address because fake news contributes to generating and nurturing a strong polarisation of opinions .
a distortion of facts , it said , can have repercussions at the level of individual and collective behaviour .
francis said in an interview last year that media that focus on scandals and spread fake news to smear politicians risk becoming like people who have a morbid fascination with excrement .
the vatican statement said the leader of the 1.2 billion member church wanted to offer a reflection on the causes , the logic and the consequences of disinformation in the media , and helping to promote professional journalism , which always seeks the truth .
the church s next world day of social communications will be celebrated on may 13 .
the pope s message will be released on january 24 , feast of st francis de sales , the patron of journalists .
( this version of the story corrected day of day of social communications to may 13 from jan. 24 ) .
