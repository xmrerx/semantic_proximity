The Internet is going crazy after photos, videos and .gifs have been circulated of Melania Trump with her husband at a press conference on Monday.
Will the real Melania Trump please stand up?
Don t look at me like that.
Trump circulated conspiracy theories about our country s first black president in order to delegitimize his presidency so this is fair game and also, it s hilarious.And if this is not Melania, we have to ask, what has he done with his wife?
Blink twice next time you re on the air if you need help, girlfriend.
We might be there for you.
Maybe.It all started with this tweet from social media user @JoeVargas, then it went viral.
My wife, Melania, who happens to be right here, Donald Trump is heard telling reporters.This is not Melania.
To think they would go this far & try & make us think its her on TV is mind blowing.

Instead, let s just enjoy getting away from the Trump swamp and the former reality show star s outbursts on Twitter.The Internet is sure that Melania has a body-double.

https://t.co/9NNpZzy4CK Sir James The Second (@JKH2) October 18, 2017Donald Trump is a conspiracy theorist who was elevated to power by his gullible base.
Trump supporters seem upset on Twitter that Melania is trending on the social site over this conspiracy theory, but the ones their president circulated are OK by them.
Also, what happened to Melania Trump s nose?
There s something funny going on there.
And why isn t Alex Jones all over this?
Hmm maybe he s a part of it.
I mean, if NASA had to step forward to deny that it is running a child sex slave ring on Mars because of Jones s conspiracy theory then we can ask what part he played in switching a body double for the First Lady.
Jones and Trump are buddies, after all.
WHAT HAVE Y ALL DONE WITH MELANIA?Stop looking at me like that.Featured image via video screen capture
