brussels ( reuters ) - luxembourg s prime minister on thursday said british counterpart theresa may s ability to negotiate her country s withdrawal from the european union is complicated by her need for parliament s approval at home .
this is not good for theresa may because the agenda is not going to move , xavier bettel told reporters on arrival to a summit of european leaders in brussels .
as soon as she negotiates something she will need to go back to london and get approval from parliament .
this is not making her life easier .
this does not change the agenda , it just makes it more difficult for the uk government .
