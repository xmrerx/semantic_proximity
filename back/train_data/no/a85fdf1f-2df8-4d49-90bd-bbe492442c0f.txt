zurich ( reuters ) - nuclear proliferation watchdog ctbto is examining unusual seismic activity in north korea that took place around 50 km ( 31 miles ) from previous nuclear testing in the isolated country , it said on saturday .
analysts looking at unusual # seismic activity of a much smaller magnitude in the # dprk , ctbto executive secretary lassina zerbo said in a twitter post .
korean peninsula unusual # seismic activity : lat=41.36 lon=129.76 mb=3.5 about 50km from prior tests .
# ctbt analysts investigating , he said in a subsequent post .
china s earthquake administration said it had detected a magnitude 3.4 quake in north korea that was a suspected explosion , raising fears that pyongyang might have conducted another nuclear bomb test .
a ctbto spokeswoman said zerbo s remark about a smaller magnitude referred to its monitoring of an event in north korea on sept. 3 which the agency described as consistent with a man-made explosion but stopped short of calling a nuclear blast , pending testing for airborne radioactivity .
north korea has described the sept. 3 incident as a test of an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long-range missile , marking a dramatic escalation of the regime s stand-off with the united states and its allies .
the ctbto ( preparatory commission for the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty organization ) was founded in 1996 to monitor compliance with an accord negotiated in the 1990s that bans nuclear explosions .
the treaty has not come into effect because eight countries with nuclear technology have yet to sign it .
