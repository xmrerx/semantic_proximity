Audience members and viewers watching MSNBC s Commander-in-Chief Forum were treated to a rare, once-in-a-lifetime moment last night when Donald Trump actually told the truth for a few seconds about his plan to defeat ISIS.Host and moderator Matt Lauer had been grilling the Republican nominee on the insanity he s been spewing about having a secret plan to defeat ISIS that he can t reveal (supposedly because it would just tip-off the terrorist group).
While Trump has previously been quick to find creative ways to dodge or turn around questions in a way that confuses people and avoids having to actually provide an answer, The Donald slipped up this time.
By complete accident, Trump revealed that regardless of what he s said in the past, there is no plan at all.In trying to clarify a contradictory statement that Trump had made in a speech earlier that day in which Trump had said he d give military leaders 30 days to devise a plan to defeat ISIS, Lauer asked Trump: So, is the plan you ve been hiding this whole time asking someone else for their plan?
Trump stumbled over this question right away, unintentionally showing Americans that Trump has yet to come up with a strategy: No.
But when I do come up with a plan that I like, and that perhaps agrees with mine or maybe doesn t I may love what the generals come back with Lauer continued to question Trump about releasing the plan, and criticized him for taking a plan from generals even though Trump has previously said that he knows more about ISIS than they do.
This part of the interview was completely bizarre as Trump loses his footing and Lauer knew the Republican nominee was vulnerable but it was perfect.
Trump was finally being exposed for the liar he is.You can watch this part of the interview below:Is Donald Trump s counterterrorism plan to ask for someone else s plan?
