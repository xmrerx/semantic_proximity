Here we go, again.Another supporter of Donald Trump openly shouted at a Trump rally held in New Hampshire on Tuesday that President Obama was a Muslim.
And, this time, the only difference we got from Trump was a sarcastic reply, which in essence all it did was show his supporters that it s funny to be a racist.Here s Trump pretending to go after one of his supporters for the hateful comment: Oh, I m supposed to reprimand the man.
Who was the man that said that?
I have to reprimand.
How dare you.
Okay, I reprimanded him.
I reprimanded him, now the press can t be angry.
Is anyone surprised?
We re not.
Trump has become such a joke that we re tired of even using the word joke.
It s long played out so is the media.
Even when he shows a penchant for hateful rhetoric, all the media can do is laugh about it.
The shock factor is over.
And, the thing is, there was nothing funny about this.All CNN and crew could do when announcing this latest B.S.
was to smile.
Below is an actual pic taken in context showing what they thought of this latest incident.
It s like we re all in some twisted, twilight zone waiting for the rapture.

See for yourself.Pic via CNN.The truth is hate sells.
Trump takes care of the media, and they scratch his back in return.
Trump didn t lie when he said he was good for business cheap reality TV.
and political theater, calling the president a Muslim, it s all good for shits and giggles.
And, frankly, this writer is tired of it.The real truth is, Trump wouldn t go after his supporters for being racist even if he wanted to.
That s because, the majority of his supporters are racist.
He can t alienate his base.
According to a major poll done, a full 66% of his supporters think Obama is a Muslim.
That s pretty insane.
Maybe that s why CNN is laughing.
They still can t believe this is still actually happening, either.
