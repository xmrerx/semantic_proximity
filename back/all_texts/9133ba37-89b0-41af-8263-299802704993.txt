Conservative Hollywood actor, James Woods, is known for his brilliant wit and his great sense of humor on Twitter, but today he really outdid himself when he posted two hilarious videos on Twitter, proving, beyond a shadow of a doubt, that liberalism really is truly a mental disorder.
His first video was a retweet of Democrat Rep. Hank Johnson, who, in 2010 actually questioned Admiral Robert Willard, commander of the U.S. Pacific Command, about a proposal to move 8,000 Marines from the Japanese island of Okinawa to the U.S. Pacific island territory of Guam.
Johnson expressed his concern over moving too many US troops to the very small island of Guam because too many people on the island may cause it to tip over and capsize .Here is the transcript of the unbelievable exchange between Democrat Rep. Hank Johnson and Admiral Rober Willard:Johnson: This is a[n] island that at its widest level is what twelve miles from shore to shore?
And at its smallest level uh, smallest location it s seven miles between one shore and the other?
Is that correct?Willard: I don t have the exact dimensions, but to your point, sir, I think Guam is a small island.Johnson: Very small island, about twenty-four miles, if I recall, long, twenty-four miles long, about seven miles wide at the least widest place on the island and about twelve miles wide on the widest part of the island, and I don t know how many square miles that is.
Do you happen to know?Willard: I don t have that figure with me, sir, I can certainly supply it to you if you like.Johnson: Yeah, my fear is that the whole island will become so overly populated that it will tip over and capsize.Willard: We don t anticipate that the Guam population I think currently about 175,000 and again with 8,000 Marines and their families, it s an addition of about 25,000 more into the population.How the Admiral was able to keep a straight face during this question and answer session is beyond our comprehension.
Here is what Woods had to say about the tweet from Based Monitored : My favorite #LiberalTribute video ever My favorite #LiberalTribute video ever https://t.co/afHPsh9flM James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) December 10, 2017Here is the video originally tweeted by Based Monitored :Rep.

Recently, during an interview, the not-funny comedian and unhinged liberal Chelsea Handler, called Sarah Huckabee Sanders a harlot with summer-whore lipstick and a trollop.
James Woods didn t waste any time reminding Twitter users about the disgusting video of Chelsea Handler, where she s swimming in the water while actor and comedian Jason Biggs is standing above her on a boat, peeing all over her face.
Handler seems unfazed by Biggs peeing on her face, as she looks around smiling, and acting like a human urinal.Woods tweeted about Handler: This person berates the character of @SarahHuckabee on a daily basis.
#ChelseaHandlerHumanUrinalThis person berates the character of @SarahHuckabee on a daily basis.

Handler, who claims she was fleeing from her home, took time from her daring escape, to tweet about her unfortunate circumstance, and to blame President Trump for setting the world on fire , because well, why not?Just evacuated my house.
It s like Donald Trump is setting the world on fire.
Literally and figuratively.
Stay safe everyone.
Dark times.
