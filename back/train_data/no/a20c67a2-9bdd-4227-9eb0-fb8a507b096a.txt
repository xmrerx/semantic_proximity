hayley geftman-gold , a professional , a wife , and a mother of 3 young children , is a perfect example of someone most people would tend to think has it all , but in reality , she is the poster child , for all that is wrong with the intolerant , and hate-filled left today cbs has parted ways with one of the company s top lawyers after she said she is not even sympathetic to victims of the las vegas shooting because country music fans often are republican , when discussing the tragic mass shooting that occurred in las vegas late sunday night .
this individual , who was with us for approximately one year , violated the standards of our company and is no longer an employee of cbs .
her views as expressed on social media are deeply unacceptable to all of us at cbs .
our hearts go out to the victims in las vegas and their families , a cbs spokeswoman told fox news.hayley geftman-gold , the network s now-former vice president , and senior counsel took to facebook after a gunman opened fire at the route 91 harvest music festival in las vegas , killing at least 58 people and sending more than 520 others to hospitals .
if they wouldn t do anything when children were murdered i have no hope that repugs [ sic ] will ever do the right thing , geftman-gold wrote in a now-deleted message that was first reported and captured by the daily caller.geftman-gold continued : i m actually not even sympathetic bc [ sic ] country music fans often are republican gun toters [ sic ] .
