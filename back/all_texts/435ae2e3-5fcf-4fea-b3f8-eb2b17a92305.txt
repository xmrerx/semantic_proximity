White House chief of staff Reince Priebus said on Sunday that Donald Trump and the swamp monsters in his administration have looked at how they can change the Constitution so that he can sue the press.
Because f*ck the First Amendment.During an interview on ABC s This Week, host Jon Karl asked Priebus about Trump s threats to change libel laws so that he can sue the New York Times for running stories that hurt his feelings.The failing @nytimes has disgraced the media world.
Gotten me wrong for two solid years.
Change libel laws?

Is he really going to pursue that?
I think it s something that we ve looked at, and how that gets executed or whether that goes anywhere is a different story, Priebus replied.
So you think the President should be able to sue the New York Times for stories he doesn t like?
Karl continued to press.
I think that newspapers and news agencies need to be more responsible with how they report the news, Priebus responded.
I am so tired.
I don t think anyone would disagree with that, Karl said.
It s about whether or not the President should have the right to sue them.
And I already answered the question.
I said this is something that is being looked at, Priebus said.
But it s something that, as far as how it gets executed, where we go with it, that s another issue.
