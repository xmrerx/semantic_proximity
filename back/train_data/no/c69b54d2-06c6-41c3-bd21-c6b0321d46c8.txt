tennessee lawmakers have something to say to their counterparts in california and it s perfect !
we could love this more tennessee hits back at the loony state that banned all state travel to places that they think don t have the right policy in place .
the response is epic : whereas , california has passed legislation banning state sponsored travel to tennessee and certain other states ; andwhereas , the ban stems from legislation enacted by tennessee that allows counselors to refer patients to other counselors who can better meet their goals , which the california state legislature has judged to be morally reprehensible ; andwhereas , california s attempt to influence public policy in our state is akin to tennessee expressing its disapproval of california s exorbitant taxes , spiraling budget deficits , runaway social welfare programs , and rampant illegal immigration ; andwhereas , tennessee is pleasantly surprised that california will not be sending its economic development teams to tennessee to recruit our businesses , but we can still send our teams to recruit their businesses ; andwhereas , tennessee is puzzled why california thinks it is a good idea to prohibit its state colleges and universities from participating in athletic competition in tennessee ( march madness comes to memphis this year via the south regional ) , kansas , mississippi , and north carolina ; andwhereas , this type of ban , the result of legitimate disagreements about government policy , is neither persuasive nor productive for either party and will lead to economic warfare among states , as one sovereign entity attempts to tell an equally sovereign entity how to conduct its affairs by restricting travel thereto ; andwhereas , the united states constitution provides for a strong federal government for the common defense , but the tenth amendment grants the several states sovereignty in addressing issues solely within their jurisdiction , and all states should respect this most basic precept of american government ; andwhereas , if states such as california persist in banning travel to tennessee as a punitive action for this body conducting its constitutionally mandated duties as its members see fit , our state leaders should consider strong reciprocal action in banning state sponsored travel to those misguided states ; now , therefore , be it resolved by the senate of the one hundred tenth general assembly of the state of tennessee , the house of representatives concurring , that we urge and encourage the governor , the speaker of the senate , and the speaker of the house of representatives to ban state -sponsored and state funded travel within their respective jurisdictions to any state of the union that has banned state sponsored travel to tennessee in a selective way , so that the other states feel the pain and not tennesseebe it further resolved , that we urge the other forty-eight states to refrain from imposing their unfounded moral judgment on their sister states as california has done in order to prevent escalating foolishness.oh boy !
isn t that great !
