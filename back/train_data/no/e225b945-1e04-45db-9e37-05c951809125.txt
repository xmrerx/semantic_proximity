she says the recommendations will include measures to expand background checks.jarrett spoke wednesday night at a vigil for the victims of the newtown shooting , according to a summary provided by the white house.after the mass shooting in roseburg , oregon , obama said his team was looking for ways to tighten gun laws without a vote in congress .
white house officials have said they re exploring closing the so-called gun show loophole that anti-gun advocates claim allows people to buy weapons at gun shows and online without a background check.the move comes following the deadly terrorist attack in san bernardino , california , that left 14 people dead .
all of the guns used in the massacre were purchased legally .
opponents of new gun control regulations have argued that the proposals being pushed by obama would not have prevented the tragedy or recent mass shootings .
