Last Friday, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie decided that endorsing GOP presidential front-runner Donald Trump was a good idea.
Since then political pundits have all been asking, What was he thinking?
Well, on Tuesday night when Trump was giving his Super Tuesday victory speech, Christie seemed to come to the realization that he made a BIG mistake and that sudden awareness came as he stood behind the billionaire on stage.
The governor s facial expressions as he listened to his candidate spew his usual nonsense created a Twitter storm, talks of a hostage situation and an epic hashtag: #FreeChrisChristie.Christie introduced Trump after the votes were tallied and he was declared victorious in six states.
The NJ governor welcomed the next President of the United States onto the stage, stood behind him and promptly upstaged the GOP front-runner:Pop quiz: New York billionaire takes New Jersey governor hostage.
What do you do.

#SuperTuesdaypic.twitter.com/sSDnCXgxBE The Daily Show (@TheDailyShow) March 2, 2016Christie did look like he was Donald Trump s hostage and we don t feel bad for him at all.
The governor knew what he was getting himself into, he has said what a liar and horrible president Trump would be on multiple occasions.
The only reason he even endorsed him is because he loves the media attention just as much as the billionaire loudmouth does.
Now, he gets to live with the consequences of endorsing a racist, egotistical fool.On a side note, Trump is going to be soooo pissed that Christie stole the show.
I wouldn t be surprised if we didn t see the two of them on stage together again.Watch a mash-up of his faces below:https://www.facebook.com/Vox/videos/488810047973269/ Featured image via Twitter
