Hillary Clinton delivered an amazing speech on Thursday night and the DNC Convention was a unifying success, so of course Donald Trump threw a temper tantrum about it.
Our country s motto is e pluribus unum: out of many, we are one.
Will we stay true to that motto?
the former Secretary of State asked Americans before going after Donald Trump s agenda of fear and division.
Well, we heard Donald Trump s answer last week at his convention.
He wants to divide us from the rest of the world, and from each other.He s betting that the perils of today s world will blind us to its unlimited promise.
He s taken the Republican Party a long way from Morning in America to Midnight in America.
He wants us to fear the future and fear each other.Well, a great Democratic President, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, came up with the perfect rebuke to Trump more than eighty years ago, during a much more perilous time.
The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.
Hillary went on to slam Trump for claiming that he alone can fix America and blasted him for claiming that he will put America first, which led to one of the best passages of the night.
He also talks a big game about putting America First.
Please explain to me what part of America First leads him to make Trump ties in China, not Colorado.
Trump suits in Mexico, not Michigan.
Trump furniture in Turkey, not Ohio.
Trump picture frames in India, not Wisconsin.Donald Trump says he wants to make America great again well, he could start by actually making things in America again.
The Democratic nominee also questioned Trump s temperament to be president, which also led to one of the best lines of the night.
He loses his cool at the slightest provocation.
When he s gotten a tough question from a reporter.
When he s challenged in a debate.
When he sees a protestor at a rally.
Imagine him in the Oval Office facing a real crisis.
A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.
Indeed, and Trump not only lost his cool during Clinton s speech, he clearly went to bed enraged because he continued throwing a temper tantrum on Friday morning with a series of tweets attacking just about anyone, including the media, Michael Bloomberg, and General John Allen.
But he began his temper tantrum on Thursday night by whining about Hillary not saying certain magic words that Trump believes will defeat ISIS.Hillary s refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016And then he threw a broader tantrum.Hillary will never reform Wall Street.
She is owned by Wall Street!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Hillary s vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016Hillary s wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016It should be pointed out that the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq were not Hillary s wars.
They were George W. Bush s wars.
No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016Then Trump picked up where he left off and continued his hissy fit.The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke.
@CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and forgot to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 @AnnCoulter: I believe in science Dem code for we re shutting down coal mines, steel plants and any other remaining manufacturing Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech.
Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS.
His record = BAD #NeverHillary Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Little Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me.
His last term as Mayor was a disaster!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn t get 10% of the vote they would run him out of town!
#NeverHillary Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016 Crooked Hillary said that I couldn t handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign.
Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 29, 2016Again, this is who the Republican Party actually thinks is qualified to be the leader of the free world.
How will he lead the nation when is he is too busy lashing out on Twitter at anyone who makes even the slightest criticism against him?
And keep in mind that Trump only has Twitter to attack people with.
As president, he would have the military, drones, and nuclear weapons at his disposal.
How can anyone feel safe with Trump as president when he has such a thin skin that he could start a war at any time just because another nation insulted him?Featured Image: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images
