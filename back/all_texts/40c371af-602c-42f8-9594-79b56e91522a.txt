Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau participated in a forum on Thursday, which was hosted by the New York Times, to discuss current relations between Canada and the United States.
Trudeau was as suave as ever for the most part and tried hard to play down the fact that Donald Trump is a raving f*cking lunatic.
However, when the conversation turned to Trump s tweets, he accidentally pointed out what an irresponsible child the current President actually is.Trudeau was asked if he has his phone set to notify him when Trump sends out a tweet, like many of us do.
Without even trying, the Prime Minister s response made Trump look like a damn fool.
There s no question that the way the President chooses to speak directly to people through social media is a new wrinkle in international diplomacy, Trudeau replied.
He explained that deciphering how serious to take any given tweet of Trump s is important so that Canada can respond without reacting to a similar level.
The interviewers continued to press Trudeau on the matter, asking him if he is in bed, like the rest of us, looking at Twitter at night?
And that is when it came.
He made Trump look like an absolute moron simply by doing his job and not being a Twitter-obsessed narcissist.
No, I tend to focus on the things I need to do, on my job, Trudeau said, causing the audience to burst into laughter.
Realizing that he had just unintentionally wiped the floor with Trump, he added, If I get woken up at night, it better be for something more important than a tweet.
This just caused the crowd to laugh even harder.
By anyone!
he said as an afterthought, but the everyone in the room was still howling with laughter.You can watch a video of this exchange below and you can watch Trudeau s entire interview here:Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
