He [Trump] did all of the dogwhistles.
This is not Bernie Sanders populism, this is George Wallace populism that he s doing.
But he cannot say he did not run a campaign that has created a lot of racial fears and a lot of divisiveness and he played to the crowd and he knew what he was playing to.

He was playing to the worst elements.
The question is now what are you going to do?
