On Wednesday, three young Washington teens received a terrifying lesson from one of the people the NRA says will save us from any and all danger.
Kitsap Sheriff s deputies are investigating an incident in which a man held three 13-year-olds at gunpoint while he lectured them about crime in the area.The teens, who were playing an innocent game of basketball in a community court, say the man approached them.
According to the kids, he had been dropped off by another man in a silver pickup truck with orange cab lights.
He shined a flashlight at the children then pointed a semi-automatic pistol and told them he was not playing around, ordering them face-down on the ground.The Kitsap Sun reports that the man, who is described as a caucasian in his 60s or 70s with white hair, interrogated them about what they were doing, and informed the frightened teens that there had been a rash of car thefts and vandalism in the area.
He told the kids he had been asked to investigate by a neighbor.After the interrogation, the pickup truck returned and another white man got, heavyset with grayish hair, got out and shook the kids hands, patting one on the back.
The gun-toting gentleman got in the truck and they drove off.
Police are still investigating the incident.Unfortunately, this is where we are at in America.
Two men, empowered by the NRA and Republicans rhetoric that places them as judge, jury, and executioner, conducted their own firearm-assisted interrogation against three children who had done nothing worse than playing basketball in the evening.
