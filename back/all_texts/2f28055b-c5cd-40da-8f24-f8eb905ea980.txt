Turley is always fair and is a brilliant lawyer who has great insight.OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON THE PODESTA BROTHERS:Could this be what Tony Podesta is referring to?
Tucker Carlson had bombshell announcements tonight that he even seemed shocked by.

@TuckerCarlson: Source Says Podesta Brothers & Manafort, Not #Trump, 'Central Figures' in Russia Probe https://t.co/A5XLV46ovw | #Tucker pic.twitter.com/IL5u7QtiOK Fox News (@FoxNews) October 25, 2017Fox News reported:A thus-far-reliable source who used to be involved with Clinton allies John and Tony Podesta told Tucker Carlson that press reports appearing to implicate President Trump in Russian collusion are exaggerated.The source, who Carlson said he would not yet name, said he worked for the brothers Podesta Group and was privy to some information from Robert Mueller s special investigation.While media reports describe former Black, Manafort & Stone principal Paul Manafort as Trump s main tie to the investigation, the source said it is Manafort s role as a liaison between Russia and the Podesta Group that is drawing the scrutiny.The vehicle Manafort worked for was what Carlson called a sham company with a headquarters listed in Belgium but whose contact information was linked to Kiev, the Ukrainian capital.Manafort was, at the time, representing Russian business and political interests during the Obama era.The source said the Podesta Group was in regular contact with Manafort while Hillary Clinton was America s chief diplomat.
