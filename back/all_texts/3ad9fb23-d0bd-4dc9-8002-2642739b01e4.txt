After Black Lives Matter hosted a blacks-only Memorial Day party, Tucker Carlson asked a BLM supporter why such an event is acceptable.Carlson said the party promoted segregation the exact thing BLM purports to oppose.
I thought the whole point of Black Lives matter was to speak out against singling out people based on race?
Carlson asked political commentator Lisa Durden.
Boo-hoo, you white people are angry because you couldn t use your white privilege card to get invited to the Black Lives Matter all-black Memorial Day celebration, Durden said.
Carlson asked again why BLM would exclude others based on their race while they protest against such actions.
