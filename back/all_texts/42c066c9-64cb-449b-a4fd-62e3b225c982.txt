Hillary Clinton has been gearing up for months to take on Donald Trump and expose him as the fraud he is.
She exposed his nonsensical view of the world in a searing national security speech, and now she did it over his dangerous, risky, and shameful career in the private sector.At a blistering speech in Columbus, Ohio (a very important swing state), Clinton worked in some very stinging zingers against the billionaire mogul, including a shot at his multiple bankruptcies:Trump has written a lot of books about business but they all seem to end at Chapter 11.Clinton also referred to the pending lawsuit against Trump University (which the media has completely forgotten about since the shooting in Orlando), saying, The same people he s trying to get to vote for him are people he s been exploiting for years.
Trump and his campaign, of course, deflected, and accused her of running a hedge fund for the Clinton Foundation during her tenure as Secretary of State.Here s the difference between what Trump did (and his currently doing) and what Clinton has done:The Clinton Foundation took money from countries around the world and turned it into AIDS medication, schools and learning supplies for girls, clean drinking water in Africa, and hospital supplies in the Middle East.
Trump tried to scam veterans out of a donation until the media called him out on it.
And he scammed thousands of honest, hardworking Americans out of their money in a fraudulent university.
But Clinton s speech wasn t just an attack on Trump.
She carefully and plainly laid out her economic agenda:Notably, even with the drawn-out battle against Bernie Sanders behind her, Clinton hewed closely to progressive goals and rhetoric.
She vowed in her speech to veto any efforts to undo Dodd-Frank financial reforms and reiterated her opposition to the Trans Pacific Partnership trade deal, while noting that Trump s own businesses have engaged in the kinds of outsourcing he now attacks.Clinton s rhetoric is getting sharper, and her strategy is getting clearer: she s going to crush Donald Trump.Featured image via J.D.
