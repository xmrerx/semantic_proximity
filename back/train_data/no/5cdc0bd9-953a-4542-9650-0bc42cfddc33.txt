amsterdam ( reuters ) - digital privacy advocates who hope to force the repeal of a law giving dutch intelligence agencies new surveillance powers said on monday they have gathered enough signatures to demand a referendum .
a range of activists , politicians and media groups oppose the law , which passed by a healthy margin in july and gives agencies the power to gather data covertly from large groups of people at once .
the petition for a referendum must now be submitted to the voting commission to vet whether it has met the 300,000 signature threshold .
if it has , the government is obliged to hold a non-binding referendum on whether the law should be upheld , likely together with municipal elections on march 21 .
you cross the line when large groups of innocent civilians can be dragged into the sights of secret services with a trawling net , said david korteweg , a lawyer for online rights group bits of freedom , in a statement .
the government argues that the expanded powers are needed for spy agencies to counter threats to national security and their use can be tested by an oversight panel .
the referendum law is itself controversial and may be repealed .
after it was passed in 2015 its first use was to block the dutch government from ratifying an economic treaty it and other european union countries had negotiated with ukraine .
a large no vote on the referendum embarrassed the hague and forced prime minister mark rutte to seek minor amendments to the treaty .
it later emerged that the signatures to hold the ukraine referendum were gathered via the internet and never vetted .
