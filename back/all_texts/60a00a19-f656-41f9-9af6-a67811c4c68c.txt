Just when you think things can t get any more bizarre than they already are regarding Donald Trump and his choices for his administration, he goes and ups the ante.According to Reuters: Entertainer Steve Harvey says he will team up with Housing Secretary-designate Ben Carson on inner city initiative.
JUST IN: Entertainer Steve Harvey says he will team up with Housing Secretary-designate Ben Carson on inner city initiative Reuters U.S. News (@ReutersUS) January 13, 2017Yes, that Steve Harvey.
The same guy who is an entertainer, comedian and game show host.
The same guy who f**ked up Miss Universe, which probably explains the Trump connection.
The same guy who makes fun of people on The Family Feud.Steve Harvey will be working with Ben Carson with the department of Housing and Urban Development.
So, basically, it would seem Trump is putting all the black people he may know in charge of the position with urban in the title.
Although, it s surely just coincidence.It seems as if Harvey is excited for the role and is looking forward to working with Ben Carson to bring positive change to inner cities.
