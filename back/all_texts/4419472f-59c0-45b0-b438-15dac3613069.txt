One of Twitter s top trending hashtags is full of women who ve been harassed and assaulted, and they re explaining why women don t report such incidents with their personal stories.
There are many, many moving accounts under #WhyWomenDontReport, but there are also the misogynistic jerkwads who are intentionally hurting victims all over again.Trump s deplorables are busy reinforcing their image as the bottom-feeders of deplorability.
They re calling Trump s victims liars, and they re calling women who report sexual assault liars, gold-diggers, and worse.
In short, they re doing every single thing they can to shame women who have been harassed and outright attacked.
Some are even using #NextFakeTrumpVictim as a rebuttal to #WhyWomenDontReport.They are disgusting, and they are monsters.
They ve once again shown themselves to be the basket of deplorables that Hillary said they are.We don t live in a rape culture.
Shut up.

Sam DeGreen (@samdegreen) October 13, 2016#WhyWomenDontReport people usually tend to believe rape cases that are actually true.
However, there s too many false cases as well Nick (@NickyBRizzle) October 13, 2016If people stopped trying to destroy the life of a human being because they don t agree with them, this wouldn t happen #WhyWomenDontReport I Support Trump ??

Many fear that nobody will believe them.
They fear the accusation will be turned back on them and destroy their reputations and lives.
They can t stomach the idea of having to answer explicit questions about their bodies and their sexuality in order to prove they were actually attacked.It s because there are police who tell women to deal with it, and sometimes don t even file the report.
It s because women are asked what they were wearing, whether they were drinking and flirting, why they were wherever they were, why they let themselves be alone with their attackers, and so forth.
It s because people say that sexual assault is just sex that the victim regrets later on.No, people don t believe us.
Yes, people shame us to hell and back.
Yes, we re accused of ruining the lives of the men who hurt us so badly.
Why don t women report sexual assault and harassment?
Because we can t.Featured image by Ralph Freso via Getty Images
