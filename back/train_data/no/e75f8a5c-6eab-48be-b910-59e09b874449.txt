no wonder she didn t want anyone to see her speeches .
she was singing the praises of trump before she even knew he was going to defeat her in the general election from wikileaks email dump : secretary clinton : that s a really interesting question .
you know , i would like to see more successful business people run for office .
i really would like to see that because i do think , you know , you don t have to have 30 billion , but you have a certain level of freedom .
and there s that memorable phrase from a former member of the senate : you can be maybe rented but never bought .
and i think it s important to have people with those experiences .
and especially now , because many of you in this room are on the cutting edge of technology or health care or some other segment of the economy , so you are people who look over the horizon .
and coming into public life and bringing that perspective as well as the success and the insulation that success gives you could really help in a lot of our political situations right now .
