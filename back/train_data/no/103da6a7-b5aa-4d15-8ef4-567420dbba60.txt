ankara ( reuters ) - fifteen people drowned when a fishing boat carrying migrants sank off the turkish coast in the marmara sea on friday and up to 15 more were missing , turkey s coast guard said .
the boat sank off the northwestern province of kocaeli shortly after calling for help , the coast guard said in a statement .
forty migrants were rescued from the sea so far and teams were still searching for another 13 to 15 people , it said .
the search effort included two helicopters , as well as planes and commercial boats .
the state-run anadolu news agency said the rescued migrants were brought back to kocaeli , where they were treated at a make-shift hospital at the dock .
it said two of the injured were transferred to a hospital in the city .
their origin and destination were not immediately clear .
turkey agreed with the european union to help curb a flood of illegal migrants - many of them passing through turkey or its waters - on the way to europe .
while that has helped significantly reduce the illegal flow to europe , some migrants still risk their lives trying to make the perilous voyage .
but there are fears that deteriorating relations between europe and turkey could endanger the deal , under which ankara is supposed to receive 3 billion euros in financial aid and visa-free travel for turks to europe .
turkey says the european union has yet to fulfil its end of the bargain and has warned it could re-evaluate or suspend all of the agreement .
