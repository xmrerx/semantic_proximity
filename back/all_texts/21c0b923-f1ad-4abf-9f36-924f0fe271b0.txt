Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 21, 2017Trump s tweet was enough to put the maniacal Trump hater Mika Brzezinski over the edge.
She mockingly read the tweet to the MSNBC show s panel, then turned to Tom Brokaw to ask for his reaction to President Trump s tweet.
Brokaw smugly told Brzezinski that President Donald Trump watches Fox News because it reinforces what he believes .
Brokaw then went on to exclude leftist crybaby Shepard Smith from his disgusting and inflammatory assertion that Fox News is on a jihad.
Fox News, after Shepard Smith, in the late afternoon, is on a jihad right now on the whole question about whether there is a fairness about this or not, Brokaw told Brzezinski.
The whole assault is on the institutions.
Brokaw then went on to criticize Newt Gingrich for daring to call out the corrupt and biased behavior of the FBI, that s recently been uncovered as a result of the Trump-Russian collusion witch hunt.
Brokaw told the panel, Newt Gingrich looking in the camera and saying the FBI is a corrupt organization, right?
Three months earlier he had said Bob Mueller is one of the great, distinguished public servants we have.

So, we re at war here, Brokaw told the like-minded leftist hack panel at MSNBC.Watch (audio is missing for the first second of the video):
