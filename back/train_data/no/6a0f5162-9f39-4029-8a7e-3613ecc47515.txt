fox news adam housley just came out with a great report ( video below ) that totally vindicates intel chair devin nunes in the investigation into spying and unmasking names of trump and trump staff .
watch the video below but here are a few highlights with tweets from housley included : here are a few of the highlights:1 .
the surveillance that led to the unmasking started way before trump was the gop nominee2 .
the person who did the unmasking is very high up in the intelligence world and is not in the fbi 3 .
the people reported by the ny times were not nunes sources .
they only helped him navigate the intelligence4 .
nunes was told about the unmasking of trump s team back in january before trump s tweet about obama s spying .
5 .
it took a while to coordinate nunes seeing the intelligence reports in order to protect his source .
they chose the white house because it was the only other location they could view the reporting without outing the source .
6 .
none of this has anything to do with russia .
