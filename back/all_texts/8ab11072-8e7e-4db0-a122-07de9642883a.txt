When Donald Trump boldly declared that he had been released from the shackles of the GOP (that was him shackled?)
Star Trek and Big Bang Theory actor Wil Wheaton just couldn t resist.
It began with a one-word, yet oh-so-beautiful tweet:"shackles" Wil SCREAMton (@wilw) October 11, 2016Then, of course, Wheaton moved on to the defining moment of Trump s campaign: the revelation that he spends a lot of time grabbing women by their p*ssies:Oh you're gonna grab America by the pussy?
Or are you gonna punch it in the face?
Or not pay any taxes to support it?
Please, do tell.

Maybe he's going to suck as much money out of America as he can, then declare bankruptcy so everyone else suffers for it.
Wil SCREAMton (@wilw) October 11, 2016Then came the boom:Does anyone really believe Voldetrump has been "shackled" until now?
They don't even make shackles small enough for his tiny little hands.
Wil SCREAMton (@wilw) October 11, 2016Donald Trump is terrible.
If Americans vote him into office next month, we will have a President who:On top of that, he s a bully with thin, orange skin who wants to build a wall to keep brown people out of the country, lock up Muslims in what can only be described as concentration camps (after forcing them to register in a national database and wear special little badges like Hitler made the Jews wear), and who is unfit to be President in every sense of the word.Democrats have traditionally had issues getting to the polls on election day, even during presidential elections.
Make sure that doesn t happen this time.
