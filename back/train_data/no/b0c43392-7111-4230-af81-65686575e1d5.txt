brussels ( reuters ) - there is no possibility that britain and the european union can conclude a free trade agreement by the time britain leaves in march 2019 , eu brexit negotiator michel barner said on tuesday .
asked about suggestions in london that a trade deal could be ready for signature shortly after britain is no longer an eu member , barnier reiterated the eu s official line that only a political declaration outlining future trading relations would be ready at the time of britain s withdrawal .
he told reporters after he had briefed eu ministers ahead of a leaders summit on friday that negotiating a free trade pact would take longer .
he also stressed that there must be no backtracking by britain on an outline divorce package agreed last week if it wants to negotiate the future relationship .
he said that after the summit he hoped he would be able to present draft language early in the new year on the withdrawal treaty , elements of which were agreed last friday .
