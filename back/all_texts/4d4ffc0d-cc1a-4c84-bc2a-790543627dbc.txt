Two white guys living in a state where 96% of its residents are white, and who have become extremely wealthy by selling ice cream to the rich, want everyone to know how much they support diversity by marketing over-priced ice cream with diverse labels to more rich people Ben & Jerry s announced Tuesday that proceeds from its newest flavor of ice cream, Empower Mint, will help benefit the North Carolina NAACP s campaign to repeal the state s voter ID law.
Ben Cohen, Jerry Greenfield and North Carolina NAACP President Rev.
William Barber kicked off a voter registration drive at North Carolina Central University in Durham on Tuesday to help marshal support against a new North Carolina law requiring voters to present a photo ID before they vote.Proceeds from the sale of the new flavor will also go toward the organization s effort to get big money donations from corporations and wealthy elites out of politics.
This flavor will benefit the North Carolina NAACP, an organization dedicated to ensuring the political, educational, social and economic equality of rights of all persons and eliminating racial hatred and discrimination, the ice cream company wrote in a statement on its website.
It just felt really good to be working with all these people here in North Carolina, who ve been struggling to get back their right to vote for them and other people of color, said Ben Cohen.Campaigning against voter suppression is not something we get to do in Vermont, because they re so white, he added, chuckling.
This flavor, Jerry Greenfield said, helps us connect with Ben & Jerry s fans as we work nationally on trying to help reauthorize the voting rights act.
Right now we have a government that represents rich white people, Cohen added.
That s not what s it s about.
We ve got to overturn these laws.
Ben & Jerry s Ice Cream was founded in 1978.
Cohen and Greenfield sold the company they co-founded to British-Dutch corporation Unilever for $326 million in 2000.
