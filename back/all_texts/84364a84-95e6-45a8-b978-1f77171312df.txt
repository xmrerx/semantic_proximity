The inspiration behind the Black Lives Matter movement the individual cited by its founder and regularly quoted by its supporters is a convicted cop killer who is on the FBI s Most Wanted Terrorists list.In an article which details the philosophical foundation of Black Lives Matter , BLM co-founder Garza cites, Assata s powerful demand in my organizing work.
Assata is a reference to Assata Shakur, otherwise known as Joanne Deborah Chesimard, a radical feminist and Marxist revolutionary who escaped from prison in 1979 while serving a life sentence for the murder of New Jersey State Trooper Werner Foerster.On the night of May 2, 1973, Shakur, along with two other accomplices, killed Foerster execution-style at point-blank range during a routine traffic stop on the New Jersey Turnpike in East Brunswick.For Shakur, the shooting was the culmination of years of militant radicalism during which she joined and left the Black Panther Party because it was not violent enough, before subsequently joining the Black Liberation Army, a domestic terror outfit responsible for bombings and assassinations throughout the 1970 s which claimed the lives of 13 police officers.
InfowarsShe escaped from prison in 1979 and fled to Cuba, where she was granted political asylum, and she s been there ever since.President Trump on Friday demanded that Cuba return notorious New Jersey cop killer Joanne Chesimard to the United States to face justice.During a speech in Miami to announce changes in U.S. policy toward Cuba, Trump said the return of Chesimard and other fugitives was one of several steps the Cuban government needed to take before the longstanding embargo could be lifted.
To the Cuban government, I say, put an end to the abuse of dissidents, release the political prisoners, stop jailing innocent people, open yourselves to political and economic freedoms, return the fugitives from American justice, including the return of the cop killer Joanne Chesimard, aka Assata Shakur Trump said.Following the passing of brutal dictator Fidel Castro, BLM wrote a love note of sorts on Medium, expressing their gratitude for harboring their hero, cop-killer Assata Shakur: A final lesson is that to be a revolutionary, you must strive to live in integrity.
As a Black network committed to transformation, we are particularly grateful to Fidel for holding Mama Assata Shakur, who continues to inspire us.
We are thankful that he provided a home for Brother Michael Finney Ralph Goodwin, and Charles Hill, asylum to Brother Huey P. Newton, and sanctuary for so many other Black revolutionaries who were being persecuted by the American government during the Black Power era.
