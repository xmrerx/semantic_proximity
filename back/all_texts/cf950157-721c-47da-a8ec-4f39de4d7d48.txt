There is a also a map (below) showing which states will and won t accept refugees from Syria and those who haven t made up their minds yet Leave it to Obama to call anyone who questions the sanity of bringing hundreds of thousands of unchecked Muslims over to a country they ve been taught to hate since birth anti-Americans!
President Obama said the United States needed to step up and do its part admitting refugees from SyriaHe said that the issue of refugees and terrorism should not be equated in the aftermath of the Paris attacksA handful of Republican governors have publicly pronounced that their states would not accept SyriansObama made a swipe at those GOP leaders asking them to be more like President George W. Bush in the aftermath of 9/11Now, 25 Republican governors and one Democrat too have said they don t want Syrian refugees in their states, as President Obama recommitted the U.S. to take a portion of this population fleeing from ISIS.In a press conference this morning in Turkey, Obama said that the United States has to step up and do its part, while chiding those in the opposition party for suggesting there be a religious test for entry into the United States.There s concern, after Friday s brutal attack in Paris, that ISIS fighters are infiltrating those fleeing Syria and will carry out future violence against the West.
It is very important, Obama said.
That we do not close our hearts to these victims of such violence and somehow start equating the issue of refugees with the issue of terrorism.
