BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States government upholds and sticks to the one China policy, U.S. President Donald Trump told Chinese President Xi Jinping on Thursday during talks in Beijing, China s official Xinhua news agency reported.
As president-elect, Trump broke with protocol and accepted a congratulatory phone call from the Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen in December, angering China, which claims the self-ruled island as integral Chinese territory.
