potsdam , germany ( reuters ) - german police on friday secured a device full of wires and nails found near an outdoor christmas market in the city of potsdam , but could not establish whether it had contained explosives .
germany is on high alert for militant attacks , nearly a year after a tunisian islamist rammed a hijacked truck into a christmas market in central berlin , killing 11 people as well as the driver .
police evacuated a large area of potsdam s old town center on friday , including parts of the market , and closed stores while they investigated the package , which had been delivered to a pharmacy .
karl-heinz schroeter , interior minister of the state of brandenburg , which surrounds berlin , said the area would remain shut while police searched with sniffer dogs for any other similar packages .
he told reporters that several hundred grams of nails had been found in a metal cylinder inside the package , but added : we just don t know at this point if this was a device that could have actually exploded , or a fake , or a test .
a robot using water jets was used to ensure the device was safe , officials said .
potsdam police said x-rays had shown wires , nails and batteries inside the package , but that no detonator had been found .
christmas markets opened across germany on monday at the start of the holiday season , fortified with concrete barriers and security staff to protect shoppers .
germany has around 2,600 such markets , filled with sparkling christmas trees and wooden stalls serving candied nuts , sausages , mulled wine and handicrafts .
interior minister thomas de maiziere said this week that germany had increased information-sharing between federal and state officials and taken other steps to increase security after a series of missteps in the berlin case .
a ministry spokesman said this week that the risk of an attack in germany and europe remained high .
