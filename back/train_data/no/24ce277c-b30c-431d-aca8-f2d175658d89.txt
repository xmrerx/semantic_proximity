gaza ( reuters ) - a palestinian militant group said on friday that five of its members had been killed earlier this week when israel blew up a cross-border tunnel being dug by militants from the gaza strip , bringing the death toll in the strike to 12 .
neither side seemed eager to seek escalation after the tunnel was blown up on monday by israel , which pointed out that its action was carried out on its own side of the border .
the islamic jihad group said it was denied access to the collapsed tunnel and was unable to recover the bodies of its five members .
both islamic jihad and hamas , the dominant islamist group in gaza that had said earlier it lost two people in the tunnel collapse , have sworn to retaliate .
hamas accused israel of trying to undermine a reconciliation agreement it reached with mahmoud abbas , the president of the palestinian authority , last month .
israel has been constructing a sensor-equipped underground wall along the 60-km ( 36-mile ) gaza border , aiming to complete the $ 1.1 billion project by mid-2019 .
during the last gaza war , in 2014 , hamas fighters used dozens of tunnels to blindside israel s superior forces and threaten civilian communities near the frontier , a counterpoint to the iron dome anti-missile system that largely protected the country s heartland from militant rocket barrages .
israel and the united states have called for hamas to be disarmed as part of the pact between hamas and the palestinian authority , so israeli peace efforts with abbas , which collapsed in 2014 , could proceed .
hamas has rejected the demand .
