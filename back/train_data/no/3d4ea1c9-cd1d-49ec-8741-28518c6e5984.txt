sao paulo ( reuters ) - brazil s lower house speaker rodrigo maia said on monday he will try to pass a fiscally crucial pension reform bill this year in the chamber , but he told reporters he would only put the measure to the vote if it has enough support .
the bill needs a three-fifths super majority of 308 votes to pass and poll by arko advice consultancy found the government is 46 votes short and time is running out .
a government plan to hold a vote next week will likely get put off until dec 13 , with days to spare before the congressional recess begins on dec 22 .
