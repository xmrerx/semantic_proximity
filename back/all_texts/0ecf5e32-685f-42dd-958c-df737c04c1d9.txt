(Reuters) - Mount Agung, a rumbling volcano towering over the east of the Indonesian island of Bali, has forced more than 140,000 people to evacuate as authorities warn it could erupt at any time.
Holidaymakers are avoiding the island after scientists issued the highest alert level for the volcano, which killed more than 1,000 people when it last erupted in 1963.
Rising more than 3,000 meters (yards), Mount Agung is the island s highest and most sacred volcano, home to the Pura Besakih temple complex that narrowly escaped the previous eruption.
Bali is better prepared this time, imposing a 12-km (7-mile) exclusion zone around the volcano and stocking up on food and emergency supplies at temporary shelters.

The Reuters graphics team also takes a look at the potential impact on an economy that relies on nearly 5 million tourists a year visiting its beaches and temples.
