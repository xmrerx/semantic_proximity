washington ( reuters ) - u.s. president barack obama shortened the prison sentences of 111 convicts serving time for drug-related offenses in his second round of clemency grants this month , the white house said on tuesday .
obama has now granted a total of 673 commutations during his presidency , more than the number granted by the 10 previous presidents combined , as he seeks to reform the criminal justice system , it said .
for some of the convicts , the commutations mean they will serve only half of their original prison sentences .
for instance , sly stallone aikens of south carolina , serving a sentence of 360 months for using and carrying a gun during a drug trafficking crime , will now serve only 180 months .
more than one-third of the 673 convicts had been serving life sentences .
obama has made reducing the number of people serving long sentences for nonviolent drug offenses a priority .
it is one of the rare issues where the president gets support from republican lawmakers .
he launched the clemency program in 2014 , inviting thousands of drug offenders and others to seek early release .
it was the most ambitious such program in 40 years , but it has struggled under a flood of thousands of unprocessed cases .
the white house counsel , neil eggleston , said he expects obama will continue to grant commutations through the end of his presidency , which ends on jan. 20 .
but only legislation passed by congress can “ achieve the broader reforms needed to ensure our federal sentencing system operates more fairly and effectively , ” eggleston said .
