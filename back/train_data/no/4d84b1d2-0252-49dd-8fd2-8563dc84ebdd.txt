america s first black president continues to destroy employment opportunities for the black community we ve got a bad guy in the family , but protect him because he s family .
we ve got to wake up , slap ourselves and wake up .
this is america and everybody s involved in this and if our children are hurting , it s our responsibility to find someone who understands that pain , feels it like bill clinton would say .
this guy doesn t feel it .
in fact he issues a lot of that pain , with a smile .
