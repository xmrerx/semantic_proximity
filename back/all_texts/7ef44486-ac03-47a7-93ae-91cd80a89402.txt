MANILA (Reuters) - Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte said on Sunday the South China Sea dispute, involving China and five other claimants including the Philippines, was better left untouched .
We have to be friends, the other hotheads would like us to confront China and the rest of the world on so many issues, Duterte said at a ceremony on the eve of a summit of East and Southeast Asian nations in the Philippine capital.
The South China Sea is better left untouched, nobody can afford to go to war.
