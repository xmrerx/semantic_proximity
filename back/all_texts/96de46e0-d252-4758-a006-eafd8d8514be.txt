How many times have liberals used the argument that everyone s relatives came here illegally!
?
The answer is about a million or more times.
Liberals can t seem to differentiate between people who came to our nation to either escape persecution or to find a better life that came through Ellis Island or immediately applied for citizenship in America, and those who float across the Rio Grande on an inner-tube after paying a coyote a fee to help them illegally cross our borders.This meme brilliantly explains the difference in 4 short bullet points.
:Here s a little visual for anyone who tells you #4 isn t true:It is estimated that 12.5 million illegal aliens are currently living in the United States.Below, are a series of visuals from the Federation for American Immigration Reform or FAIR to help Americans to understand the cost of illegal immigration to taxpaying Americans.
This data from September 27, 2017, paints a pretty bleak economic picture for America if we continue to ignore the serious problem of illegal immigration: FAIR At the federal, state, and local levels, taxpayers shell out approximately $134.9 billion to cover the costs incurred by the presence of more than 12.5 million illegal aliens, and about 4.2 million citizen children of illegal aliens.
That amounts to a tax burden of approximately $8,075 per illegal alien family member and a total of $115,894,597,664.
The total cost of illegal immigration to U.S. taxpayers is both staggering and crippling.
In 2013, FAIR estimated the total cost to be approximately $113 billion.
So, in under four years, the cost has risen nearly $3 billion.
This is a disturbing and unsustainable trend.
