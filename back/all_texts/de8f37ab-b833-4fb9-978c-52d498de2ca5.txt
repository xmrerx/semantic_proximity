The apple doesn t fall far from the tree Chelsea Clinton is pregnant with her second child, so in typical progressive feminist fashion, Chelsea has abortion on her mind.
In a new interview, Chelsea Clinton, the daughter of pro-abortion presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, says she left the Baptist Church at the age of 6 because it has a strongly pro-life position opposing abortions.Clinton made the comment at a recent fundraiser for Hillary Clinton in an attempt to address evangelicals who question her mother s faith in God.
She said she was upset when teachers in a Sunday School class talked about the wrongness of abortion.
My mother is very deeply a person of faith, Chelsea said.
It is deeply authentic and real for my mother, and it guides so much of her moral compass, but also her life s work.
I recognized that there were many expressions of faith that I don t agree with and feel [are] quite antithetical to how I read the Bible, Chelsea said.
But I find it really challenging when people who are self-professed liberals kind of look askance at my family s history.
