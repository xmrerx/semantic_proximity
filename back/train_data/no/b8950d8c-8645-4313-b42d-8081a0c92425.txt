nairobi ( reuters ) - south sudan s media regulator has suspended all press associations in the country while they register for licences to operate , journalists said , a move that raised concern about a possible crackdown on independent media .
the directive , handed to south sudan s three associations this week and seen by reuters on wednesday , gave them seven days until nov. 7 to obtain operations licences or face permanent closure .
we have applied , but we do not know whether our application will be accepted or not , said mary ajith , chairwoman of the association of media development in south sudan , a grouping of journalists .
this is ... harassment from the media authority that is being done to us .
officials from both the government information and the national communication authority were not immediately available for comment .
another journalist said the directive would give the national communication authority powers to command every single activity with the support from the national security agency .
the move is the latest example of what rights activists say is an increasingly hostile and restrictive approach by the government towards the press in the world s youngest country .
in july , four news websites and blogs - including the dutch-backed radio station and website radio tamazuj - were either blocked or had transmissions partially restricted .
foreign correspondents have also faced difficulties in reporting from south sudan , with at least 20 reporters being denied entry by authorities early this year .
since its establishment in 2015 , journalists in south sudan say the body has made it extremely difficult to obtain permits to travel outside the capital juba on reporting trips .
it also requires prior permission for filming , at a hefty cost .
south sudan , which won independence from sudan in 2011 , plunged into civil conflict in december 2013 .
