Break out the popcorn Donald Trump got busy bashing Hillary Clinton on his Twitter account over her emails.
Again.
Because Trump can only do two things on Twitter: Praise himself while pretending to thank his audiences, and bash anybody he doesn t like.
One particular tweet stands out, though, particularly for its irony:Lyin Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the C markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED.
How can this be happening?
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2016The irony is that, back in the 70s, Trump Management marked lease applications from black people with the letter c to indicate that they were black, and therefore, not to be rented to.
That s what s getting Twitter in an uproar over this.Trump Management claimed they never discriminated and they never would when the Department of Justice sued them over this.
Our dear Donald, at the time, swore that he didn t have direct knowledge of what was going on.
He flat-out said, I don t care and I don t know.
Twitter is having a field day with him over this, as well they should.
If he s going to rag on Hillary for not knowing that c stands for, then he can jolly well admit that Trump Management was racist enough to mark applications with a c themselves so they would know who they should not rent to.
@realDonaldTrump the C making on your tenancy applications meant colored though, right Donald?
Jemaine Clement (@AJemaineClement) September 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump funny because you were sued for labeling black tenants with a c for colored Parker (@Parker9_) September 4, 2016 @realDonaldTrump Boss, America is more worried about the C for colored that you marked on 100% rejected A-A rental applications.
Shame!
Trump University (@trumpUni) September 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump knows better about C marking than anyone else.It used for color & a mark to reject leasing applications in his properties M. Shafiq Hamdam (@shafiqhamdam) September 5, 2016 Well at least she didn t write C on the rental applications of black people and then get sued by the DOJ twice.

Marcy Fisher (@gieneh52) September 5, 2016 @realDonaldTrump remember, how you didn t know the C marking on applications meant colored ?
I would imagine its the same thing.

@realdonaldtrump Like your documents (leases) where the c stood for colored (meaning, do not rent to blacks ) RiskyLiberal (@RiskyLiberal) September 5, 2016Yes, Trump has indeed forgotten what a little c on rental applications meant.
The hypocrisy is strong in this one, as is the ignorance.
C on government emails means confidential, though Trump & Co., and the Never Hillary crowd, are behaving as though she shared info that was classified as top secret.
Information marked confidential is still classified info, that s true, but it s hilarious that Trump doesn t see similarities between his family s problems with that letter, and Hillary s.Featured image by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images
