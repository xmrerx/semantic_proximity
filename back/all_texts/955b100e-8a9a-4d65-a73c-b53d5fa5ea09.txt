(Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton would be “happy” to participate in an additional debate beyond those already planned if the other candidates agree, a spokeswoman for Clinton said on Tuesday.
Clinton is campaigning in Iowa ahead of state caucuses there on Monday that mark the first contest in the nomination race for the Nov. 8 presidential election.
