WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday denounced an attack in London when a blast hit a packed commuter train, and urged authorities and others to take more proactive steps such as better policing of internet use by terrorist groups.
Another attack in London by a loser terrorist.
These are sick and demented people who were in the sights of Scotland Yard.
Must be proactive!
Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.
Loser terrorists must be dealt with in a much tougher manner.
The internet is their main recruitment tool which we must cut off & use better!
