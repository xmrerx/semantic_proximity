geneva ( reuters ) - the international committee of the red cross ( icrc ) called on tuesday for all borders with yemen to be kept open to allow vital food , health and medical supplies to enter the country reeling from war and a major cholera epidemic .
the saudi-led military coalition fighting against the houthi movement in yemen said on monday it would close all air , land and sea ports to the arabian peninsula country to stem the flow of arms to the houthis from iran .
the icrc said a shipment of chlorine tablets to prevent cholera did not get clearance at yemen s northern border , and it voiced fears for 50,000 vials of insulin for diabetics due to be delivered by next week , which require constant refrigeration .
