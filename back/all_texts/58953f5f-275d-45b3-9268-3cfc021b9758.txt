This weekend, neo-Nazis and white supremacists gathered in eastern Kentucky.
On Friday, Art Jones addressed the group.
The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has identified Jones as a denier of the Holocaust.
Since the 1970s, he has been dressing up on Nazi attire and celebrating Hitler and the ideals of the Third Reich.
He is now upset with President Donald Trump and wishes he could take his vote back.Jones told the crowd: I m sorry I voted for the son of a bitch, I really am.
I m sorry I spent $180 out of my own pocket to buy three big banners that said, President Trump, build the wall , the blazer-clad Jones said, to a tent full of about 100 men, some of whom wore paramilitary-style uniforms.
Now he says, Eh, what wall?
I m embarrassed that I voted for him.
Jones went on to blame the Jewish lobby and Jared Kushner for many promises that Trump has broken.
