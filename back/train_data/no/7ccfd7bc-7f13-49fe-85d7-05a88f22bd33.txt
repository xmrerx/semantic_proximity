istanbul ( reuters ) - a turkish judge ordered four prominent journalists and senior staff from the opposition cumhuriyet newspaper to remain in jail for at least two more months during their trial , accused of supporting the organizers of last year s failed coup .
editor in chief murat sabuncu , attorney akin atalay , correspondent ahmet sik and accountant emre iper , some of whom have already been detained for 14 months , were ordered to be jailed until the next session of their trial on march 9 .
prosecutors say cumhuriyet was effectively taken over by supporters of fethullah gulen , a u.s.-based cleric blamed by the government for last year s failed coup .
the newspaper and staff have denied the charges and say they are being targeted to silence critics of president tayyip erdogan .
monday s hearing included drama in court , when the judge ordered sik removed from the hearing for making political comments .
sik , who wrote a book critical of gulen s movement at a time when it was an ally of the government , described turkish authorities as an authoritarian regime dedicated to cruelty , according to the newspaper .
after he was ordered out , sik said the case itself was political .
the days will come where you will be tried , do not forget this , he said , according to cumhuriyet .
i hope you won t be tried in a court like yours .
the court said the next hearing will be held in silivri courthouse , the site of a large prison about 60 km ( 40 miles ) west of istanbul , to ensure security and order .
the turkish authorities have launched a crackdown since the failed 2016 coup , which they blame on followers of gulen , who denies involvement .
more than 150,000 police , teachers , university lecturers , journalists and other professionals have been sacked or suspended from their jobs and 50,000 people have been arrested .
