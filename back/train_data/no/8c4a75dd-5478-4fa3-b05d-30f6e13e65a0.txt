istanbul ( reuters ) - a draft declaration prepared for a summit of muslim leaders on wednesday said they considered washington s decision to recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel as a sign of u.s. withdrawal from its role as a sponsor of middle east peace .
the draft statement said leaders , ministers and officials from more than 50 muslim countries declare east jerusalem as the capital of the state of palestine , and invite all countries to recognize the state of palestine and east jerusalem as its occupied capital .
a copy of the draft declaration , tweeted by turkey s foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu , said the meeting rejected and condemned the u.s. move in the strongest terms .
it described the u.s. decision as a deliberate undermining of all peace efforts , an impetus ( for ) extremism and terrorism , and a threat to international peace and security .
wednesday s summit was hosted by turkish president tayyip erdogan who has bitterly criticized the united states , a nato ally , for its stance on jerusalem .
the city , revered by jews , christians and muslims alike , is home to islam s third holiest site and has been at the heart of the israeli-palestinian conflict for decades .
israel captured arab east jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it in an action not recognized internationally .
