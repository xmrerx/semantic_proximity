(Reuters) - U.S. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy said on Tuesday he was still troubled by Hillary Clinton’s use of a personal email server when she was secretary of State, even though the FBI has declined to recommend charges in the matter.
“This is still very troubling,” McCarthy, the No.
2 House Republican, told reporters, adding that there was no way to know whether Clinton’s email server was ever successfully hacked.
