moscow ( reuters ) - the russian finance ministry wants to find a solution on how venezuela will fulfill its debt obligations to moscow by the end of this year , a senior ministry official said on friday .
konstantin vyshkovsky , head of the state debt department at the finance ministry , told reuters that venezuela owed russia more than $ 3 billion .
venezuela borrowed from russia in late 2011 but failed to keep up with payments on the debt in 2016 as the south american state faced a full-blown economic and financial crisis .
for now we consider it to be a liquidity crisis but not a crisis of financial solvency , vyshkovsky said .
vyshkovsky said that the finance ministry hoped to agree on new conditions for how caracas would honor the debt by the end of 2017 .
what the conditions would be like and how quickly we would find a compromise remains to be seen .
but our partners speak about a strong desire to reach an agreement quickly , vyshkovsky said .
vyshkovsky declined to say when he would expect caracas to pay back its debt .
venezuela s unraveling socialist government is increasingly turning to ally russia for the cash and credit it needs to survive , according to a reuters special report published last month .
