On NBC s Meet The Press, host Chuck Todd cornered Republican presidential front runner Donald Trump for his attacks on Hillary Clinton s marriage and the sexual indiscretions of her husband by pointing out something Trump doesn t want Americans to focus on his own romantic history.During the segment, Trump continued his attacks on the Democratic front runner by bringing up ex-president Bill Clinton s controversial sexual past in response to her admission that Trump had a penchant for sexism.
Trump called the former president an abuser and brought up the fact that there were sexual allegations against him.Confronting Trump for his threatened attacks against Clinton, Todd told the business mogul that if he continued to go after Clinton in this way, his own marital disasters would come bubbling to the surface and be back to bite him in the *ss.
Todd reminded him: Your first divorce was ugly All over the tabloids.
Trump shrugged and stated that his own struggles from his love life mattered far less than Clinton s and weren t really up for discussion or ridicule.
He said, You know what?
I wasn t the President of the United States, and I wasn t dealing in the Oval Office, all right?
Big difference.
Trump then lied through his teeth and claimed that his first wife Ivana considers him great leaving out the part where he d actually cheated on her with Georgia beauty queen Marla Maples, who became his second wife.
Trump also conveniently failed to mention that he has also been accused of violent sexual assault (by Ivana herself) and has a long history of misogyny.You can watch the footage below, courtesy of Mediaite:Although Trump said that Clinton s camp has been unresponsive to his attacks, Clinton responded to Trump this morning, stating that American voters didn t want to relitigate the past.Featured image is a screengrab
