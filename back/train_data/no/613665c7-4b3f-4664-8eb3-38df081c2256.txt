the mets players wore nypd hats during batting practice to honor moore , 25 .
someplace along the line , hopefully we don t have to keep wearing these hats , terry collins said .
we are honoring the true heroes , the soldiers , the police , the fire department that keep us all safe and secure .
what they have to face each and every day is beyond any of our imaginations.ruben tejada and @ dilson_h proud to wear the # nypd caps during bp .

it s part of what we think is important and certainly honoring officer moore is important today , and so we ll wear them and wear them with pride and hopefully his family understands that although it s hard to understand what they re going through , we re there for them .
`` honoring officer moore is important today .
we will wear these hats with pride . ''

also , the orioles are having one of their home jerseys shipped here so the whole team can sign it to give to the family , according to a team spokesman .
it s unfortunate we are wearing it for the events that happened , said michael cuddyer , who signed with the mets this winter .
but i think it is a good gesture by the team , shows we care and are thinking of them .
