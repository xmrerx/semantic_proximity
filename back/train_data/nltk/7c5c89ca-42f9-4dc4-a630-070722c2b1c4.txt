paris bumper sticker
go back read article criticism levy environmental left
critical dismissive paris agreement
know
china ’ anything 2030 india condition obligation upon receive two half trillion dollar aid
russia india china contribute 0 dollar green climate fund
people short memory

’ better others across globe
people really want action meaningful outcome regard
pre1994 level
paris view – ’ symbolic optical respect whether progress progress make co2 reduction
reuters think argument major fossil fuel company like exxon cloud peak energy coal company make better u remain paris agreement give competitive advantage
’ understand argument
simply ’ understand argument say technology develop domestically go able export country interested
evidence
china still build coal facility tune almost one day
800 plan scale back
india go continue burn coal
ought export technology innovation help cleaner
job agency ’ job regulatory body force pick winner loser energy mix
need fuel diversity far generation electricity get much natural gas pipeline
attack infrastructure regard pipe natural gas deliver generate electricity
solid amount hydrocarbon – coal store site – allow address peak demand
gdp growth go continue 3 percent ’ get fuel diversity ’ energy security across board
’ unwise business one client two client
’ unwise electricity one source two source
oklahoma – 18 percent electricity wind generated
approach epa get business foist upon market decision say ’ burn fossil fuel
past administration unapologetic
’ regulation
paris
paris bad business deal country end day
