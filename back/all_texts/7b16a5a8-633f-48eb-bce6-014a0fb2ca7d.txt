After watching this video, it becomes very clear that these students want nothing to do with racial harmony.
This movement is about black power.
It s about treating people a certain way based solely on the color of their skin.
There is nothing about this movement that attempts to bring people together.
The black students have taken over the movement and kicked the Asian, White and Hispanic students who are supporting them to the curb.
This divisive #BlackLivesMatter movement will go down as one of the most deceitful movements in our nations history Students at Claremont McKenna College in California who are demanding a racially segregated safe space for marginalized identities, silenced and embarrassed an Asian woman when she described how she had been racially harassed by an African-American man.The exchange is damning because it illustrates how the safe space students don t really care about racism, they only care about race baiting and exploiting identity politics in order to obtain power.
