chris farrell is the judicial watch director of investigations who let it rip last night on the direction america is going in .
lou dobbs got an earful from farrell who discussed the paralyzed justice department : farrell let it rip : it s really a giant socialist organ operating that protests itself .
offense after offense and you find laws are for the little people .
the clinton gang walks away .
people say , hey where s the department of justice investigation ?
where s the fbi ?
half the time they re complicit.farrell continued : the people with direct firsthand knowledge , they re the ones who kept their mouths shut for years .
this is evidence that we are becoming a failed state .
and i m not exaggerating when i say that .
when the entire justice department is paralyzed .
when the entire justice department is compromised when there is no investigations .
there s these make-believe congressional hearings that are nothing more than soundbites.he s spot on about everything !
is anyone else out there sick to death of the congressional hearings that just give the democrats a chance to create soundbites for the news ?
they get nothing accomplished at these hearings that really have become useless .
why not interview people without all the cameras ?
having the cameras there just makes it a sideshow with drama queens like al franken.farrell s assessment of the justice department and other agencies like the fbi couldn t be more spot on .
they are compromised therefore paralyzed into inaction .
