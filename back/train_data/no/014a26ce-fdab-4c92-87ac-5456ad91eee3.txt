athens ( reuters ) - two macedonian nationals wanted by interpol have been arrested in greece over their alleged involvement in a wiretap scandal that brought down macedonia s government , a police official said on thursday .
two years of political turmoil were triggered in 2015 after opposition parties accused then prime minister nikola gruevski and his counter-intelligence chief of orchestrating the wiretapping of more than 20,000 people .
the eu , which macedonia aspires to join , was forced to broker an agreement in which parties agreed to hold early elections and establish the office of a special prosecutor to investigate the content of the wiretaps .
a new government was formed in may .
the two macedonians , aged 51 and 35 , are accused of destroying machines used in wiretapping , a police official said on condition of anonymity .
they were arrested on wednesday at the airport in the northern greek city of thessaloniki carrying fake bulgarian passports , the official said .
greek police said the men were also accused of setting up a criminal gang to carry out technology-related crimes .
they are due to appear before a prosecutor on thursday .
in june , macedonia s special prosecutor filed charges against 94 people , including former high government officials , over their involvement in alleged crimes revealed in tapes that emerged during the surveillance scandal .
