i don t think she has a soul , paronto said of clinton during an interview with hearst connecticut media .
i hope it haunts her .
i don t think it will .
a spokesman for clinton , who campaigned in bridgeport ahead of her primary victory last month in connecticut , declined to comment.paronto said he has no doubt that there is a nexus between the benghazi attack and the email scandal that has dogged clinton , who has been criticized for using a personal server to send and receive classified material when she was secretary of state .
he repeated accusations that clinton misled the victims families over what incited the attack .
she lied to the family members , period , paronto said .
people are believing her over the family members of teammates that i lost .
clinton has denied telling the victims families that an anti-islam video was to blame for sparking the attack.andy wainwright , a republican state central committee member from stamford , said he recently saw 13 hours and was mesmerized .
it was not a political movie , he said .
