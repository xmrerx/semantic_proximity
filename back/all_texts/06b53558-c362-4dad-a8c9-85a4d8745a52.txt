A rookie Dr. Ben Carson: I haven t said anything about me being the only one to do anything.
I m the only one to separate siamese twins.
The only one to operate on a babies while still in a mother s womb.
I m the only one to take out half a brain, although you would think if you go to Washington that someone had beat me to it.
