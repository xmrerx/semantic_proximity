assimilate or go hungry human rights lawyers descend in 5 4 3 2 1 copenhagen , denmark a danish city has ordered pork to be mandatory on municipal menus , including for schools and daycare centers , with politicians insisting the move is necessary for preserving the country s food traditions and is not an attack on muslims.frank noergaard , a member of the council in randers that narrowly approved the decision earlier this week , says it was made to ensure that pork remains a central part of denmark s food culture .
denmark is a major pork producer and it is the most popular meat , but it is forbidden to muslims and jews .
most of the asylum-seekers who have arrived in the country in the past months are muslim.noergaard , a member of the anti-immigration , populist danish people s party that proposed the council motion , said thursday that it wasn t meant as a harassment of muslims , but added that he had received several complaints about too many concessions being made to muslims in the small , predominantly lutheran country .
the signal we want to send here is that if you re a muslim and you plan to come to randers , don t expect you can impose eating habits on others .
pork here is on an equal footing with other food , noergaard told the associated press .
he said that halal meat , vegetarian dishes and diets for diabetics would still be available.in 2013 , then-prime minister helle thorning-schmidt lashed out at some nurseries after they started serving halal-butchered meat instead of pork because muslim children had refused to eat it .
