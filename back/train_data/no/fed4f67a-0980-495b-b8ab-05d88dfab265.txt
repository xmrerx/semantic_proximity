lindsey graham , the south carolina republican was unable to differentiate himself from other gop presidential candidates and in august 2015 , national polls said that 13 percent of republican or leans-republican voters said they d never vote for him .
zero percent said they would vote for him.even someone else polled at 1 percent ( cue the joke about how hard it would be to find someone else who isn t already in the race ) .
the highest graham polled nationally was at 2 percent , according to real clear politics.yet this morning , on cbs s face the nation , while discussing president donald trump s inaugural address calling for his policy to be informed by putting america first , sen. lindsey graham , ( r-sc ) said , i don t know what america first means .
graham said , to the president , if america first is a throwback to the 20 sand 30 s isolationism when it was first used as a phrase , the world would deteriorate even quicker , if it is a new way of ronald reagan s peace through strength i would like to work with him .
i don t know what america first means .
