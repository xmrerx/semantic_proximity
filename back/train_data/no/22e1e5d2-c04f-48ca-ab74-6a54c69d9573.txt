house minority leader nancy pelosi ( d. , calif. ) implied during a wednesday press conference that president donald trump s daughter , ivanka trump , has been complicit in her father s actions , which the lawmaker described as not acting in the interest of the american people .
pelosi s remarks came after she was asked about comments ivanka trump made during an interview on cbs this morning .
cbs host gayle king had asked trump to address those who say she is complicit in her father s white house .
in an interview today , ivanka trump said , i don t know what it means to be complicit and that not to conflate lack of public denouncement with silence when it comes to issues like planned parenthood .
what do you make of these comments ?
an-off camera reporter asked pelosi .
we re not here to talk about the president s family , but the fact is , i think everybody knows what the word complicit is , and what it means is you re not acting in the interest of the american people , pelosi responded .
without going into what lack of impact family members who profess to believe in climate crisis or women s right to choose or any of the other things , but have no impact on the policy of the president of the united states , that s for the public to make a judgement , the minority leader continued.pelosi s rant : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=gul3-ib5_pmvia : wfb
