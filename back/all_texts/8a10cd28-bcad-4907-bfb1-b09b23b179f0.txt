Antifa threw fireworks at police during the Patriot Prayer rally at Waterfront Park in Portland, Oregon.
The Patriot Prayer rally had to be cancelled because of the Antifa violence.
The Patriot Prayer rally and group are not in any way a white supremacist group but Antifa attacked them and the police anyway.
The police told the crowd to disperse and that s when things got ugly.MIKE BIVINS: Antifa throw fireworks at police during Patriot Prayer rally at Waterfront Park in Portland, Oregon pic.twitter.com/4Nd1hR8N1q Josh Caplan (@joshdcaplan) September 10, 2017 THE POLICE DID A GREAT JOB AND DID NOT STAND DOWN THIS IS WHAT LAW AND ORDER LOOKS LIKE:People yelling at police right now for their treatment of protestors.
