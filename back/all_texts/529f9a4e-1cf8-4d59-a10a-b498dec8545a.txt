Failed Republican vice-presidential candidate and reality TV star Sarah Palin is threatening to lead an open revolt at the Republican convention this fall if her candidate, Donald Trump, is not chosen as the nominee.
Palin issued her threat to the party in an interview with the Associated Press:The 2008 vice presidential nominee told The Associated Press that GOP voters have the right to decide the party s nominee and will rebel if House Speaker Paul Ryan or some other white knight is chosen at a contested convention.
Ryan said this week he will not seek or accept the nomination.Palin said voters know better than to be fooled by party leaders.
How dare they?
Palin asked, denouncing arrogant political operatives who underestimate the wisdom of the people.
If party leaders try to intervene at the July convention, we will rise up and say our vote does count, our activism does count, she said.Palin infamously announced she was riding the so-called Trump Train at an event in January, praising Trump for going rogue left and right, allowing him to tear the veil off this idea of the system.
Her comments come as the Republican establishment continues to try to stop Trump from winning the nomination since they believe and polling backs them up he would be a disaster for the party in the fall against either of the Democratic candidates.Texas Senator Ted Cruz has tried to set himself up as the defacto Trump alternative, but Ohio Governor John Kasich has continued to run despite only winning one state (his home state).
As a result, the anti-Trump votes have been diluted in primaries, even as Cruz operatives have worked in other party meetings to snipe as many Trump delegates away as possible.Currently Trump needs 1,237 delegates to secure the nomination.
Right now he has 755, which is 210 more than Ted Cruz s 545 delegates.
Trump is widely expected to win upcoming primaries in New York and Maryland, which will add to his lead.Featured image via Flickr
