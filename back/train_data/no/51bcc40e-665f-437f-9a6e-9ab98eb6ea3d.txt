paris ( reuters ) - french trade unionists blocked access on monday to several fuel depots in protest against an overhaul of employment laws , seeking to test the government s will to reform the economy .
in southern france , protesters unions set up a road-block in front of total s la mede refinery , while in western france fuel depots were blocked near bordeaux and the coastal city of la rochelle .
union members also held go-slow operations on highways near paris and in northern france .
we re determined .
we re going to stay as long as possible while hoping that other blockades take place elsewhere , maybe that ll make mr. macron move , force ouvriere union official pascal favre told reuters .
eager to avoid fuel shortages , centrist president emmanuel macron s government deployed police at some sites before dawn to ensure by force that protesters could not block access .
it s not in blockading the country s economy and by preventing people from working , that one best defends one s cause , junior economy minister benjamin griveaux told rtl radio .
the labor reform is due to become law in the coming days after macron formally signed five labor form decrees on friday , in the first major economic reforms since he took power in may .
the new rules , discussed at length in advance with unions , will cap payouts on dismissals that are judged unfair , while also giving companies greater freedom to hire and fire employees and to agree working conditions .
while unions have failed to derail the reform , the considerable political capital macron had after his landslide election victory in may is quickly evaporating .
macron suffered his first electoral setback on sunday when his republic on the move ( lrem ) party won fewer seats than expected in elections for the french senate .
