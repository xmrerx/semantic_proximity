we all remember the horrific violence that occurred in charlottesville , virginia in august .
white supremacists , ku klux klan members , and other assorted white supremacists descended upon the historic college town to do violence , and they succeeded .
their efforts began with a torch lit march the night before , and continued with a rally the next day that quickly turned violent .
it eventually ended in a white supremacist driving his car into a crowd of counter-protesters and killing 32-year-old heather heyer .
now , it seems that they are at it again.as of this writing , white nationalists are holding another torch lit march in charlottesville .
as despicable as that is , it s true .
white supremacist leader richard spencer boasted that what he calls charlottesville 3.0 was , quote , a success .
charlottesville 3.0 was as success .
