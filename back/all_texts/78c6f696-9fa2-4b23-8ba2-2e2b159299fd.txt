Left lying in a pool of blood, the 40-year-old died in hospital.
Police, who were questioning a 32-year-old suspect last night, said the killing was religiously motivated.Mohammad Faisal, a family friend, said a bearded Muslim wearing a long religious robe entered Mr Shah s shop and spoke to him in his native language before stabbing him in the head with a kitchen knife.Mr Shah s brother, who was working next door, rushed out to find the killer laughing while sitting on the Glasgow newsagent s bleeding chest.
The brother dragged Mr. Shah away but the guy continued attacking with the blade, said Mr Faisal.
They struggled up to the bus stop where Asad collapsed.
It was just a clear-cut revenge attack.
