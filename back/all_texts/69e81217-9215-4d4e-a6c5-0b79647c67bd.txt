DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland has made significant progress in talks with Britain on the future of the Northern Irish border, but the sides are not there yet , a spokesman for Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said on Monday.
The spokesman said Ireland was seeking a commitment to avoid a hard border in the withdrawal treaty, or ensuring that the rules and regulations of the single market and customs union cannot diverge .
It is also looking for assurances on the protection of the Northern Ireland peace process, cross-border funding and the British-Irish common travel area as well as a commitment to a transition period, he said.
