tokyo ( reuters ) - japan s navy is supplying fuel to u.s. ballistic missile defense ( bmd ) ships in the sea of japan , in a sign of deepening co-operation between the allies amid the growing threat from north korea , a source said .
by providing fuel to the u.s. aegis destroyers as well as its own bmd ships , japan hopes to ensure patrols can be maintained without unnecessary gaps , said the source , who has knowledge of the operation .
the refueling began in april , the nikkei financial daily reported earlier .
north korea threatened on thursday to sink japan with nuclear weapons for dancing to the tune of the united states for backing a u.n. security council resolution that imposed fresh sanctions on pyongyang .
the u.s. navy s seventh fleet usually has around six aegis ships assigned to bmd operations around japan .
japan operates four ships of its own .
they are armed with interceptors designed to shoot down warheads in space before they plunge to their targets .
around half of the ships would normally be at sea at any one time .
japanese prime minister shinzo abe s administration in 2015 won lawmaker approval to expand the role of the nation s self defence forces ( sdf ) under the pacifist constitution to allow them to take on a bigger role in the alliance with washington , including resupplying and defending u.s. ships .
japan has delivered fuel to u.s. ships in the past under ad hoc legislation , including vessels deployed to support military operations in afghanistan a decade ago .
but this is the first time it has been undertaken under the new security law .
japan s chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga at his regular morning press briefing on thursday said that this kind of co-operation would be undertaken by the allies .
he declined to comment on the aegis ship fuel shipments saying it could reveal details of sdf and u.s. navy operations .
