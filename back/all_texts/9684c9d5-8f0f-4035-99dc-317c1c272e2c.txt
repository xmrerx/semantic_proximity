BERLIN (Reuters) - Support for Germany s center-left Social Democrats (SPD) has slumped to its lowest level this year just 10 days before an election in which conservative Chancellor Angela Merkel looks set win a fourth term, a poll showed on Thursday.
The weekly survey, conducted by Infratest dimap for ARD television, showed support for Merkel s CDU/CSU bloc unchanged at 37 percent, with the SPD dipping one percentage point to 20 percent.
That was the SPD s lowest level since January, when it also scored 20 percent.
The party has not polled a lower level in the Infratest dimap survey.
The anti-immigration, euro-hostile Alternative for Germany (AfD) came in at 12 percent, up one point, making it the third-strongest political force.
The business-friendly Free Democrats (FDP) followed with 9.5 percent.
The radical Left party scored 9 percent, and the environmentalist Greens were on 7.5 percent.
