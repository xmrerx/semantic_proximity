by nightfall , four more newborns had died .
the death of a baby is our daily bread , said dr. osleidy camejo , a surgeon in the nation s capital , caracas , referring to the toll from venezuela s collapsing hospitals.the economic crisis in this country has exploded into a public health emergency , claiming the lives of untold numbers of venezuelans .
it is just part of a larger unraveling here that has become so severe it has prompted president nicol s maduro to impose a state of emergency and has raised fears of a government collapse.hospital wards have become crucibles where the forces tearing venezuela apart have converged .
gloves and soap have vanished from some hospitals .
often , cancer medicines are found only on the black market .
there is so little electricity that the government works only two days a week to save what energy is left.at the university of the andes hospital in the mountain city of m rida , there was not enough water to wash blood from the operating table .

the president s opponents declared a humanitarian crisis in january , and this month passed a law that would allow venezuela to accept international aid to prop up the health care system .
this is criminal that we can sit in a country with this much oil , and people are dying for lack of antibiotics , says oneida guaipe , a lawmaker and former hospital union leader.but mr. maduro , who succeeded hugo ch vez , went on television and rejected the effort , describing the move as a bid to undermine him and privatize the hospital system .
i doubt that anywhere in the world , except in cuba , there exists a better health system than this one , mr. maduro said.for entire story : nyt smuch like the drooling college students who are turning out by the tens of thousands to bernie sanders rally s in the united states , the citizens of venezuela elected the controversial nicolas maduro as their president , and now they are paying a very heavy price .
