Sometimes you just have to point the obvious out, because a lot of people just don t see the error in their own ways.
This is exactly what Grey s Anatomy star and activist Jesse Williams did when he took to Twitter to point out what an ass Donald Trump is truly behaving like.Trump tweeted out: Just released that international gangs are all over our cities.
This will end when I am President!
Now, terrible grammar aside, this is an absolute ridiculous statement.
First of all, wtf?
He s just trying to incite fear and hatred, once again of the other.
Secondly, Trump is coming across like he s Batman out to save the day completely ignoring how to actually get something done.Noticing this buffoonery, Williams tweeted out in response to Trump s ridiculous tweet: You literally could ve been anything and you chose to go down in history as a preposterously oafish laughing stock.
via TwitterQuite honestly, it doesn t get much more perfect than that.
Trump time and time again says the most ridiculous things that hold no basis in reality, and uses Twitter as his own personal troll fest to be as big of an asshole as possible.
His followers eat it up, but to those of us who clearly have a grasp on common sense and reality, Trump is turning himself into one of the biggest embarrassments of all time.Trump was born in to massive wealth, and like Williams said, the Republican front-runner could have been anything in the world he wanted to be.
Hell, he could have just sat on his fortune, made a few investments and lived his life in peace.
But instead, he chose to go down as a preposterously oafish laughing stock, who at this point, will never ever recover.Trump, we get that you re a narcissist, but to actually believe that you can handle being the leader of the free world?
Nah, you re absolutely out of your disheveled head.Featured Photo by Tommaso Boddi/Getty Images Twitter
