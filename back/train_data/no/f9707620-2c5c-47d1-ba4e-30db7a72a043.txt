paris ( reuters ) - french state-controlled utility edf ( edf.pa ) wants to take part in saudi arabia s plans to build nuclear power reactors , its chief executive told reuters on monday .
saudi arabia , which wants to reduce oil consumption at home , is considering building 17.6 gigawatts of nuclear-powered electricity generating capacity by 2032 and has sent a request for information to international suppliers to build two reactors .
sources familiar with the situation said last month edf has already held talks with saudi arabia about selling areva-designed european pressurized reactors ( epr ) and that it wants to participate in a possible saudi nuclear tender .
levy said that edf wants to take part in the country s move away from relying on fossil fuels for its energy supplies .
we will respond to this opportunity in all the energy technologies in which we have competencies , that is in solar , wind and nuclear , levy said .
russian and south korean companies have already said they plan to bid for the saudi work on nuclear power while sources have said toshiba-owned u.s. firm westinghouse ( 6502.t ) is in talks with u.s. peers to form a bidding consortium .
in 2009 edf and areva lost out to south korea s kepco ( 052690.ks ) in the bidding to build nuclear reactors in the united arab emirates , the first such project in the middle east .
edf is set to buy french nuclear group areva s reactor engineering division areva np in a deal expected to be finalised before the end of this year .
levy said edf is on track to finalize the deal before the end of this month .
