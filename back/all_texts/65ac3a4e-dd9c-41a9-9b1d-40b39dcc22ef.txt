It s no secret that the rest of the world is appalled and incensed that America elected a bumbling, incompetent, dangerous buffoon like Donald Trump to be president for the next four years.
They, unlike half of our nation, knew that Trump would be unfit to hold that office, and Trump has not disappointed on that front since he was sworn in on January 20th.
Even worse, he has treated the presidency like some kind of monarchy, and used it to enrich himself and his family, all while installing his daughter and son-in-law in key positions.
The world is watching, and they do not like what they see.
Case in point the less than warm welcome that Ivanka Trump received when she attended a women s conference in Germany.Ivanka took to the stage to praise her daddy dearest, and to try and smooth over the fact that the whole world knows that Trump is a huge misogynist.
That s easy to see; after all, there s literally years of evidence of that fact on tape.
Nevertheless, Ivanka plowed on, saying her father is a tremendous champion of supporting families.
She also tried to follow that line of bullshit by saying that the orange man baby encouraged me and enabled me to thrive.
That may be true, but the one thing he wants to encourage, Ivanka, is for you to hop into the sack with him.
I think you know that.
Your father doesn t give a damn about women, the nation, the world, the American people, or anything else except himself and his own ego.
You should be ashamed of yourself.
Your father has done nothing for women since he s been in office; in fact, he has defended serial sexual harasser Bill O Reilly, taken steps to defund Planned Parenthood for good, and rolled back protections for women in the workplace.
Champion of women indeed.Ivanka, you are just as much of an embarrassment as your disgusting father, and you got the exact kind of reception you deserved.Watch Ivanka get her comeuppance below:Featured image via Joe Scarnici/Getty Images for Fortune
