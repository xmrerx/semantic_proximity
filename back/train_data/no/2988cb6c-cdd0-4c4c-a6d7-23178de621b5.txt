istanbul ( reuters ) - a turkish military vehicle was hit by an improvised explosive device in the southeastern province of hakkari , killing one soldier , security sources said on monday .
the device was detonated by militants of the outlawed kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) as the vehicle was passing the road near turkey s border with iraq , the sources said .
turkey s largely kurdish southeast has been rocked by violence following the collapse of a 2-1/2-year ceasefire between the state and the pkk in 2015 .
the autonomy-seeking pkk took up arms in 1984 , and more than 40,000 people have died in the conflict .
it is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
