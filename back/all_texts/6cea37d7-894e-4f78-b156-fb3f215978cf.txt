After having to endure Donald Trump s disastrous presidential campaign and having to basically hold his hand every single day after the election, you can only imagine just how fed up President Barack Obama and his family are with Trump and his entitled children.
They re likely counting down the days until they no longer shoulder the responsibility of the undeserving President-elect and aren t forced to be face-to-face anymore.
Unfortunately, it seems that the Obamas are far from finished with the Trumps because part of Trump s family has dropped a bombshell with the decision to move just three minutes away from them.Trump s most beloved daughter Ivanka has just announced that she and her family will practically be neighbors to the Obamas once they leave the White House in less than three weeks.
According to The Washingtonian, multiple real estate sources have reported that Ivanka and her family will be moving into a $5.5 million residence on Tracy Place in Washington, DC less than two blocks away from where the Obamas will be living.TwitterSo just as the Obamas thought they might actually be free of Trump once he takes the presidency, it looks like that s going to be much harder than they originally planned, as Trump will likely be lurking just around the corner at Ivanka s house.
And Obama shouldn t be surprised if one day Trump comes around begging him for advice considering he has no idea what the hell he s doing.Ivanka is moving her family to Washington, DC to undoubtedly be closer to her father and provide assistance, just as she was heavily involved in his campaign.
Currently, Trump and his team are trying to find a loophole that will allow Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared Kushner to have a role in his administration.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images
