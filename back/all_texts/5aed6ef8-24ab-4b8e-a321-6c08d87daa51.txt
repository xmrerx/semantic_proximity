WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump spoke with Saudi King Salman on Wednesday and urged all the parties in the Qatar dispute to find a diplomatic resolution to end a crisis that has embroiled several Gulf countries, the White House said in a statement.
Saudi Arabia, along with Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt, have cut political and trade ties with Qatar since June because they say Doha supports regional foe Iran and Islamists.
