Donald Trump is an established denier of climate change and lover of absurd conspiracy theories.
During the first presidential debate on Monday, Hillary Clinton slammed him for claiming that global warming is a Chinese hoax: Donald thinks that climate change is a hoax perpetrated by the Chinese, Clinton said on the debate stage.
I think it s real.
I think science is real.
Trump promptly interrupted her to declare that he hadn t ever said anything of the sort.
I did not, I did not, countered Trump.
I do not say that.
Go figure, this was a boldfaced lie.
In 2012, Trump tweeted this:Trump later claimed he was just joking after Bernie Sanders nailed him to the wall for this ridiculous theory, but he still insisted that climate change is a hoax that benefits China.
Well, I think the climate change is just a very, very expensive form of tax.
A lot of people are making a lot of money.
I know much about climate change.
I d be received environmental awards.
And I often joke that this is done for the benefit of China.
Obviously, I joke, Trump said to Fox News in January.
But this is done for the benefit of China because China does not do anything to help climate change.
They burn everything you could burn; they couldn t care less.
They have very you know, their standards are nothing.
But they in the meantime, they can undercut us on price.
So it s very hard on our business.
The GOP nominee has repeatedly claimed that global warming is a hoax.
He argued this point on Fox News in 2014.And his Twitter feed abounds with similar statements.Sooner or later, you d think Trump would learn that lying about what he has said doesn t work, especially if it was said on television or social media.
But apparently, this is a lesson that hasn t quite sunk in yet.Watch Trump lie about claiming that global warming is a Chinese hoax, here:Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
