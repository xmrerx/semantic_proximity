Last night, the Republican Party made a disturbing move to strip millions of Americans of health care by voting to repeal Obamacare.
Fortunately, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) didn t hesitate to rip them apart for it this morning.In an interview with Morning Joe, Sanders railed against the GOP and its hatred for Obamacare, as well as rallied Democrats to unite and stand up against the horrendous Republican agenda that is now threatening the country under Donald Trump.
Sanders, encouraging a reform in the Democratic party, said: We need to reach out to working people and young people all over this country.
He quickly worked the GOP s attack on the Affordable Care Act into his rant, promising to do everything in his power to block them from succeeding.
He said: No, you re not going to repeal the Affordable Care Act, throw 30 million people off of health insurance, raise the cost of prescription drugs for seniors.
You re not going to do that.
We re going to fight and organize at the grassroots level.
And right after Sanders spoke about uniting the Democratic Party to fight voter suppression, to reactivate grassroots politics in this country, Sanders reminded the GOP why he s their biggest nightmare because he truly doesn t give a f*ck what they think.
In fact, Sanders considers it a blessing if billionaires the ones that will heavily benefit from a corrupt Trump administration and a Republican-dominated Congress hate him.
Sanders said: If the billionaire class hates me, or hates other progressives, we should be proud of that, because we ve got to start identifying with the working people who have seen their jobs go to China and Mexico, the people who are making 10 bucks an hour, the elderly people who can t afford prescription drugs.
