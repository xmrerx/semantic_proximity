Several white supremacist hate groups have been able to exploit federal law and raised millions while disguising themselves as charities, according to a new report.
Espousing a hate message that advocates for a whites-only America where minorities are removed from the country, these groups are not subtle about what they believe in.
Yet they were still able to pretend to be charitable groups in the eyes of the government.The federal government has allowed four groups at the forefront of the white nationalist movement to register as charities and raise more than $7.8 million in tax-deductible donations over the past decade, according to an Associated Press review.Already emboldened by Donald Trump s popularity, group leaders say they hope the president-elect s victory helps them raise even more money and gives them a larger platform for spreading their ideology.With benevolent-sounding names such as the National Policy Institute and New Century Foundation, the tax-exempt groups present themselves as educational organizations and use donors money to pay for websites, books and conferences to further their ideology.
The money also has personally compensated leaders of the four groups.The IRS actually has the power to exclude hate groups from being awarded a non-profit designation, but some experts believe that recent complaints about the IRS scrutinizing conservative scam groups that registered as non-profits has scared off the agency.
They also don t have the full resources necessary to police these sort of groups.Even worse, the incoming Trump administration has coddled these groups, inviting them to cover his campaign and the 2016 Republican National Convention.
In all likelihood rooting out hate groups using the tax code to give tax breaks to racist funders is unlikely to be a major target for the Trump team.
It will fall to bureaucrats in the IRS and outside investigations to expose these groups.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons
