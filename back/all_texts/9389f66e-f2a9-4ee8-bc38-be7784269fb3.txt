Donald Trump s two month old presidency has been so disastrous, the only things we know he s doing (besides working to strip health care from millions of Americans and humiliating the country) is play golf and watch television.
A LOT of television.Pretty much everything Trump has tweeted or referred to in interviews has been influenced by something he watched on TV Fox News in particular.
Trump s obsession with cable news and the way he s being portrayed is an all-consuming hobby for the narcissistic POTUS, and he s taken it to a truly disturbing level.Apparently, according go New York Magazine reporter Gabriel Sherman, Trump records news shows all throughout the day so he can watch how different networks have covered him right before he goes to bed.
He does this every single night!
In an appearance on Slate s Trump podcast, Sherman said: People in Trump world say basically a lot of Fox.
But the other thing he does, from a source close to the White House told me that he does DVR basically all of the cable news.
It s kind of remarkable when you think about it, that someone would actually want to watch cable news on recording.
Donald Trump, apparently he does.
And when he goes back up to the residence at the end of the day, I ve been told does spend a lot of time flipping through cable networks, including CNN, and catching up on the way that he s been covered.
This is a man whose validation is cemented by how the media covers him.
So he sort of obsessively monitors his media coverage.
So basically, Trump s unhealthy obsession with television is just another way that he caters to his monstrous ego.
This makes perfect sense, especially since Sherman stated that Trump s primary source of live information was Fox News, one of the only networks that routinely speaks of him favorably.
It would be nice if, for a change, Trump would stop watching television (especially the highly inaccurate Fox News) and actually do his job for once.Featured image is a screenshot
