KAMPALA (Reuters) - Ugandan legislators voted overwhelmingly late on Wednesday to remove from the constitution an age cap of 75 for presidential candidates, allowing President Yoweri Museveni, 73, to seek re-election at the next polls in 2021.
Critics say the move opens the possibility of a life presidency for Museveni, who has ruled the east African country for 31 years.
