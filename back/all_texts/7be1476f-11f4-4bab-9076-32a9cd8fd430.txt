If there s one thing we ve learned in this election, it s that Donald Trump s narcissism has absolutely no boundaries.
He s clearly in love with himself and is only in this election to prove that he s loved.
It d be sad if it weren t so damn scary.In what might be the most bizarre and narcissistic thing yet to come out of the Donald Trump campaign, there seems to be a Make America Great Again red hat in a museum box at the venue where Trump is holding his election night rally.Joe Perticone tweeted the image earlier today:There's a framed 'Make America Great Again' hat on the stage at Trump's venue in New York pic.twitter.com/5i07JhK8l2 Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) November 8, 2016Seriously though, what the actual f*ck is that?
Maybe Trump is preparing the hat for the Smithsonian for that time the United States almost handed the reins over to a complete and utter narcissistic a**hole.That really can be the only reasoning behind it.
Because otherwise, nobody actually gives a sh*t about that damn hat other than Trump himself.That hat, mind you, is reminiscent of the Gulf War hats sold at gas stations during the early 1990s.One can only hope that this will be the last time we even have to listen to Trump give a speech in our lifetime.Featured Photo by Mark Wallheiser/Getty Images
