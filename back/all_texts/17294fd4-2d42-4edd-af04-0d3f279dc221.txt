Julian Assange, the founder and head of the group WikiLeaks, has struck out once again at Hillary Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee.
In an interview with the New York Times on Facebook Live, Assange described Clinton as a demon.
The American liberal press, in falling over themselves to defend Hillary Clinton, are erecting a demon that is going to put nooses around everyone s necks as soon as she wins the election, which is almost certainly what she s going to do, Assange said in the interview, which was broadcast live Wednesday on Facebook.Assange s verbal attack is the latest episode of the organization lashing out at Clinton and the Democratic Party.
WikiLeaks was used as the conduit for the release of thousands of stolen emails from inside the Democratic Party before the 2016 Convention.
Those emails led to the resignation of the party chairman and several top officials and a rift between the DNC and Senator Bernie Sanders (I-VT).On the heels of that document dump, WikiLeaks also released documents stolen from Democratic lawmakers, including personal cell phone numbers for members of Congress like House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and others, who reported getting sexist and racist phone calls as a result.WikiLeaks has even engaged in promoting conspiracy theories, floating the allegation that a Democratic staffer who was tragically killed in Washington, D.C. had some sort of connection to machinations by the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton.Originally the vehicle for documents on the Iraq war disseminated by Private Chelsea Manning, WikiLeaks has over the last few months pivoted to be a force opposing Clinton, aided by hackers like Guccifer, who have infiltrated multiple systems.A recent analysis has also found that the possible source of material stolen from Democrats and given to WikiLeaks were hackers connected to the Russian government.
Assange has, in the recent past, hosted a television show on RT, the cable and satellite news channel financed by the Russians.Featured image via screen capture
