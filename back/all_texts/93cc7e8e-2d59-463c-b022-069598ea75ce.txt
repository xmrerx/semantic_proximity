Donald Trump s coronation party has just kicked off, and it is not going well at all.
The Colorado delegation, led by Free the Delegates founder Kendal Unruh, walked off the convention floor after the convention refused to give them a vote regarding a roll call vote and change the rules regarding the binding obligation to vote for Trump.And that s just the beginning.
One top fundraiser for the RNC and the Trump campaign has had enough.Gary Emineth, who signed on in recent weeks to help the Republican Party get Trump elected, is done with the whole GOP circus.
He was an unbound delegate, but he wanted to have the bound delegates be able to vote their conscience on the convention floor.
Instead, Reince Priebus and the rest of the party brass refused to give these delegates a voice at all.
Here is what Emineth had to say: I was on the Trump finance committee and I just resigned because that bully tactic is absurd.
I just texted them right now.
Why can t the people be heard?
I ve been texting Reince for 10 minutes.
He said we didn t have the votes.
We had 10, 1l states.
They peeled people back.
They were calling delegations asking people to step off the committee.
You don t do this in America.
You do this in other countries.
Despite the fact that the delegates had signatures from delegations of 11 states and followed the rules themselves to have a voice for the #NeverTrump movement, they were still denied the opportunity to speak.
So, in other words, the Republican Party brass broke their own rules in their determination to crown Trump the official King of the GOP.Granted, the #NeverTrump people don t even have anyone to replace Trump even if their efforts were to succeed.
It s the principle of the thing the party brass that fell in line behind the literal fascist that is now their standard-bearer and a danger to their nation have no principles, and they don t want to give a voice to those in their party who do.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
