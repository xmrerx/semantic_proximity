brussels ( reuters ) - the european commission repeated its call for dialogue in spain to end the crisis in catalonia amid concerns that the catalan regional authorities could declare independence on tuesday .
we called on all those concerned to get of this confrontation as quickly as possible and to start dialogue , a spokesman for the eu executive said in answer to a question on how the commission might respond to such a declaration .
violence , as we said , can never be a political tool , he told reporters , recalling a statement made last week .
and we expressed our confidence in the capacity of prime minister ( mariano ) rajoy to manage this delicate process in full respect of the spanish constitution and the basic fundamental rights of the citizens .
