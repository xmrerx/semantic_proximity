Ever since Donald Trump got exposed through an audio tape leak for bragging about how he sexually assaults women, Trump supporters have been sticking up for their favorite misogynist more than ever.Following in the Republican nominee s footsteps, their only defense against the truth in those tapes is to put blame on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton s husband, former President Bill Clinton, for the rape allegations against him.Hillary is taking this all in stride, and is completely shutting down any Trump lovers who dare hijack her rallies and distract voters from focusing on moving America forward.
During a rally with Al Gore in Florida today, Clinton s talk on climate change was interrupted by Trump supporters who were yelling about her husband being a rapist.
Here s a video of one such supporter, who obviously refuses to acknowledge the fact that his own candidate has several rape cases against him, one involving a minor.
For 2nd day in a row, a protester has interrupted HRC by yelling: Bill Clinton is a rapist.

Hillary handled the whole thing like a pro, and laughed as she urged everyone to focus on the issues that matter.
You can watch Clinton shut down this unfortunate Trump supporter below:Protester in a shirt with @billclinton s face and the word rape escorted from @HillaryClinton rally pic.twitter.com/XwBCxJYcf1 POLITICO (@politico) October 10, 2016TwitterBy the way, these Trump supporters aren t actually going to Hillary s rallies and disrupting them because they truly care about justice for sexual assault victims, or believe Trump is more innocent than Bill Clinton.
They re doing it because radio host Alex Jones is offering to give anyone who can get on camera and call Bill Clinton a rapist $5,000.
So basically, these people are just trying to get paid much like Trump himself.On the upside, it looks like Hillary can t be rattled by anything Trump and his pathetic Trump supporters do at this point!Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images
