21st century wire says in previous articles , 21wire has consistently raised the question of whether or not the cia and the pentagon have been using hollywood celebrities as soft power pawns in order to help grease foreign policy objects over seas .
this charge has always been met by narrow mainstream minds as a conspiracy theory even though we have provided evidence which indicates this is a very real practice , and one with historic precedents .
seems that the mainstream claim that the cia wouldn t hire someone like that won t fly anymore .
we have talked about dennis rodman , and george clooney as two high-profile ambassadors of the us , inserted into trouble areas in order to achieve various pr , strategic or intelligence ends.this latest admission regarding actress angelina jolie is even more telling where it is claimed she was being used as an expensive honey pot to lure the illusive ( and possibly non-existent ) joseph kony of the lord s resistance army in the jungles of uganda.andrew korybko oriental reviewit s long been suspected that the actress willingly promotes cia psy-op narratives in her films , but this time new leaks allege that angelina jolie had also at one time considered being the pentagon s bait to catch kony , which draws into question the true motivation of other celebrities foreign policy forays such as dennis rodman s friendship with kim jong-un .
agent angelinaangelina jolie is the poster woman for the hollywood-intelligence complex , the perfect example of a willing cia asset who regularly goes along with deep state narratives in her films , such as the anti-serb production in the land of blood and honey .
she s also been one of the loudest global cheerleaders for humanitarian interventions abroad , or in other words , imperialist wars waged under distorted or outright fabricated humanitarian reasons such as the one that she had been lobbying for in darfur .
jolie often visits us troops abroad like in afghanistan , though up until now there were no grounds for suggesting that she was anything other than a propagandist , as it would have been ordinarily absurd to even countenance her playing an active role in the battlefield.that s no longer the case anymore , though , according to a report by the sunday times , a uk-based media outlet , which claims to have read leaked international criminal court ( icc ) documents alleging that the starlet told the organization s former chief prosecutor that she d be willing to volunteer herself as a bait to catch the phantasmal african warlord joseph kony .
the sunday times article is mostly hidden behind a paywall , however , so the average information consumer needs to rely on second-hand sources such as people magazine in order to learn about what s in those leaks free of charge .
according to the celebrity news site : a hoard of 40,000 icc documents leaked to the french investigative website mediapart reveals that jolie once offered to act as human bait in a trap to arrest brutal ugandan warlord joseph kony.she has the idea to invite kony to dinner and then arrest him , reads an e-mail sent by former icc chief prosecutor luis moreno ocampo , reports the sunday times .
forget other celebrities , she is the one , moreno ocampo adds in another email .
she loves to arrest kony .
she is ready .
probably brad [ pitt ] will go also .
according to the sunday times , which has seen the mediapart documents , moreno ocampo hoped that jolie and her now estranged husband would travel to the central african republic with a team of us special forces.it was thought that their presence would then draw kony out of his armored compound and enable the us forces to take him into custody .
if these allegations are true , then it would mean that jolie had graduated from the usual propagandist class of hollywood operatives to an in-field asset of the pentagon in conspiring to carry out a globally important mission .
truth be told , catching kony , as the viral 2012 slogan went , isn t really that significant of a deal because the warlord is thought to have barely any supporters nowadays after years on the run in the transnational jungled space between his native uganda , the democratic republic of the congo , south sudan , and the central african republic .
in fact , the whole purpose of the cia psy-op to catch kony was to justify us special forces presence in this strategic region long enough for them to manufacture civil wars in south sudan and the central african republic , which would turn them into a failed state belt that forever prevents their crucial incorporation into a chinese-built bicoastal silk road through their resource-rich territories.the geopolitics of the kony diversion aren t the focus of this article , so it s recommended that readers review some of the author s hyperlinked analyses above if they re interested in learning more about this hybrid war campaign .
instead , it s important to focus on the relationship between celebrities and the deep state , both in the propaganda and as can now be seen in-field operational manifestations .
thus far , it doesn t seem like any of jolie s peers attempted to follow in her footsteps by partaking in such a high-profile covert mission , but toning down the drama just a notch and removing the lethal risk involved in her extreme example , it s certainly possible that other famous people are doing something similar in serving their governments.odd couple : joseph kony & angelina joliethe rodman-kim casethe most relevant case that comes to mind is dennis rodman , who s the us kim whisperer in passing along messages through what he calls basketball diplomacy but who actually functions as the best american pair of eyes and ears that has ever gotten to known the reclusive north korean leader in person .
it s been speculated for a few years already that rodman might indeed be working for the cia , but this was always dismissed by more mainstream voices who retort that he s either too stupid or that the cia wouldn t hire someone like that , but these critics never take the time to consider that rodman might be coerced into doing this in order to avoid a hushed-up drug bust or something of that nature.in any case , his last visit to the communist country was a failure because he wasn t allowed to meet with kim jong-un , although he did claim credit for jailed provocateur otto warmbier s release shortly before his death .
given that the american student was going to die anyway from what was likely complications from his unsuccessful suicide attempt in trying to overdose on sleeping medicine , he probably would have been released whether rodman came to the country or not , but it s very telling that kim jong-un refused to meet with his best friend during this time .
incidentally , it was shortly after this that the war of words and insult diplomacy between the north korean and american leaders really took off , which might have been inspired by trump finding out from his intelligence chiefs that they had lost their precious rodman-kim connection because pyongyang could have figured out what the basketballer was really up to.although it s only speculation at this point , it would indeed explain why trump made a show out of appearing to go crazy and resorting to the madman theory in dealing with kim jong-un , as the us intelligence community might have concluded that this is the only realistic way left for directly communicating with his north korean counterpart .
with rodman s last reconnaissance mission cut short and ultimately unsuccessful , the us might have feared that kim was signaling to them that he was prepared to imminently flex his muscles in vengeful showmanship for having been deceived this long , and while it s impossible to know exactly what he was in fact thinking , north korea did end up staging several highly provocative missile launches this summer after rodman s visit and even carried out a nuclear test.the above narrative might sound dubious upon first read , but it certainly deserves to be reconsidered in light of the revelation that angelina jolie was working with the pentagon as part of a highly secret special operation to catch kony , which would in that case not make it sound so crazy to imagine that dennis rodman might have been doing similar field work for the cia in collecting valuable personal intelligence about kim jong-un.even if the north koreans are actually aware of what rodman is up to nowadays , that doesn t mean that he ll never be allowed back into what some have derisively called the hermit kingdom , as there s a certain value that could be derived from continuing to use him for informal diplomatic purposes and indirect communication with the us deep state continue this story at oriental reviewread more hollywood news at : 21st century wire hollywood filessupport our work by subscribing & becoming a member @ 21wire.tv
