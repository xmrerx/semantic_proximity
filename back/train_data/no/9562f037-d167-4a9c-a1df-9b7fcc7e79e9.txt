( reuters ) - a report from standard & poor â€™ s global ratings on monday suggested that the latest proposed healthcare bill to overhaul obamacare could hurt the u.s. economy , states and health insurers .
the graham-cassidy-heller-johnson ( gchj ) bill , if implemented , could led to $ 240 billion in lost economic activity by 2027 and impact 580,000 jobs , the report indicated .
( bit.ly/2fmrr6y ) the bill would take federal money spent on the medicaid program for the poor and disabled , as well as subsidies to help individuals buy private insurance , and deliver it to the states in block grants .
the ratings agency also added that the gchj bill could cause greater disparity among states in terms of rules for the insurance markets and uninsured levels .
the gchj bill , which is awaiting a senate vote on monday , could lead to 21 million fewer americans having health insurance .
