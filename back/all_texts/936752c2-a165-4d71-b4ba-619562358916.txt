The only thing the libs didn t count on was Stallone s total support for Trump.
He really likes a fighter but who s surprised about that.
Rambo!!
!Stallone told Variety, I love Donald Trump.
Variety reported:Although he s been called a Republican, for supporting John McCain s 2008 presidential run, Stallone says he s not a member of the GOP.
May the best fighter win, he said.
I don t think you can be totally one-sided forever.
Then you close your mind to all sorts of possibilities.
It s just, Who comes along better at that time for what the planet is going through?
Right now, it s pretty confusing on every side.
What does he think of the Republican frontrunner?
I love Donald Trump, he said.
He s a great Dickensian character.
You know what I mean?
There are certain people like Arnold, Babe Ruth, that are bigger than life.
But I don t know how that translates he let out a laugh to running the world.
