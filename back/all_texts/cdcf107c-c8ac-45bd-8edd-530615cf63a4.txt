CAMP HUMPHREYS, South Korea (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump praised cooperation with South Korea during a visit to a U.S. base there on Tuesday and said he planned to address trade issues in discussions with President Moon Jae-in in Seoul.
There is great cooperation, he said.
We have a terrific meeting scheduled on trade in a little while with President Moon and his representatives.
And hopefully that will start working out and working out so that we create a lot of jobs in the United States which is one of the reasons that I m here.
Moon met briefly with Trump before he toured the sprawling U.S. military base Camp Humphreys in Pyeongtaek, which lies about 100 km (60 miles) from the border with reclusive North Korea.
