tucker goes on to call out the hypocrisy of rich , liberal elitist actors , liberals used to believe in democracy , that legitimacy was conferred by the people who live in the country , only they can choose their leaders .
maybe one of the reasons hillary lost in the first place , is that rich people including you , no longer believe that .
they think that we should pick someone i like and it doesn t matter how we pick em we re just gon na pick em and they ll be great .
i mean , that is the message you re sending right ?
farrell responded , let me demure about rich people , i m not one of them says the guy whose net worth is reportedly estimated at $ 10 million .
is this liberal who s trying to tell us who we should elect , so out of touch that he thinks having a net worth of $ 10 million is not considered rich by the standards of 99 % of america ? https : //youtu.be/n9u6ecfpfjy
