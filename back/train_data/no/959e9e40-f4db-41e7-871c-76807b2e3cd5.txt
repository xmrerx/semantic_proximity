cairo ( reuters ) - egypt s aviation minister will travel to russia to sign protocol agreements as early as friday to allow the resumption of russian flights that were suspended after the 2015 bombing of a tourist jet , egyptian sources and russia s minister said on thursday .
russian president vladimir putin met egypt s president abdel fattah al-sisi in cairo this week to discuss resuming flights and to sign a deal for a nuclear power plant as part of growing bilateral cooperation .
two egyptian sources said the minister would leave on thursday for russia , but did not confirm the date for signing the agreement .
the two governments may sign a deal on friday allowing to resume russian civilian flights , the tass news agency cited russian transport minister maxim sokolov as saying on thursday .
we expect that he ( the egyptian minister ) will come on friday , sokolov said , according to the ria news agency .
asked whether an aviation security protocol with egypt will be signed , he said : we expect that it will be signed .
moscow halted civilian air traffic to egypt in 2015 after militants detonated a bomb on a russian metrojet flight leaving the tourist resort of sharm el-sheikh and killing 224 people on board .
the bombing and the russian suspension were blows to egypt s tourism industry , a key source of hard currency .
the industry has been struggling after the upheaval triggered by a 2011 uprising that ended hosni mubarak s 30-year rule .
the return of russian flights and tours could be a massive boost to tourist numbers that are still well below the 14.7 million visitors annually egypt saw in 2010 before the uprising a year later and the unrest that followed .
