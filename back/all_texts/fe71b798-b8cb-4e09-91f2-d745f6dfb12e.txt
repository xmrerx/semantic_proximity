The Senate Republicans have attracted loads of criticism and backlash for being super shady and secretive while creating their latest version of the American Health Care Act and rightfully so.
This has taken place behind closed doors, with very little information being let out to the American public.
Luckily, some GOPers are taking a stand against it.Rep.
Pete King (R-NY) didn t mince his words as he railed against his fellow conservative lawmakers.
In an interview with Long Island radio host Jay Oliver earlier today, King went off on Senate Republicans and accused them of trying to hide something in a blistering rant.
King said: Listen, there has to be private meetings all the time, but I think there should be more public debate on it.
It looks like they re trying to hide something and it does add to conspiracy theories and everything else.
Oliver suggested that the secrecy of the Republican Party over this made it look like Senate GOPers were trying to do something underhanded, and King couldn t agree more.
Proving that there are some Republicans who actually do have spines, King said: This looks too secretive.
It s going to put a cloud over the whole final product Keeping America and other politicians in the dark is a bad move for Senate Republicans, and will likely result in failure.
Many Democrats and GOPers are highly concerned about what s being done in these Senate meetings, and many are openly condemning the drafting process.

King trashed the GOP a second time today when it came to the victory of Karen Handel last night in Georgia s special election.
While many GOPers were celebrating, King criticized Trump for his Twitter behavior, and told the tweet-happy POTUS don t bother tweeting.
