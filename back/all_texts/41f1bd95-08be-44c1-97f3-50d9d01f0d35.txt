WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama will deliver a statement at 12:15 ET on Tuesday on the economy following Monday’s Treasury Department announcement on corporate tax inversions, the White House said.
The U.S. Treasury Department took new steps to curb tax-avoiding corporate “inversions” late on Monday that threw a series of proposed mergers into question, including Pfizer Inc’s $160 billion agreement to buy Allergan Plc.
