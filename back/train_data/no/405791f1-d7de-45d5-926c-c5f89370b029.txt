abuja ( reuters ) - nigeria s next presidential and parliamentary elections will be held on feb. 16 , 2019 , the independent national electoral commission said on its official twitter account on thursday .
the date will mark the end of ailing president muhammadu buhari s first term .
he has not said if he will run again .
buhari came to power in 2015 , promising to crack down on endemic corruption , rid the country of the boko haram islamist insurgency in the northeast and kickstart a flagging economy .
critics say his presidency has been marred by inertia and little progress has been made on those key policies .
buhari has been absent for much of 2017 because of an undisclosed medical problem , which calls into question whether he will stand next year .
it also creates uncertainty for his all progressives congress party that was created to elect him .
a presidency spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment on buhari s plans .
