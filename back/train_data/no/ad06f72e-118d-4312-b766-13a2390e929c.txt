astana ( reuters ) - russian foreign minister sergei lavrov said on friday he hoped u.s. president donald trump would make a balanced decision on whether to remain engaged in the international deal to curb iran s nuclear program .
it is very important to preserve it in its current form and of course the participation of the united states will be a very significant factor in this regard , lavrov told reporters on a visit to kazakhstan .
under the deal , iran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for lifting most international sanctions that had crippled its economy .
trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal , a senior white house official said on thursday , in a step that potentially could cause the 2015 accord to unravel .
trump , who has called the pact an embarrassment and the worst deal ever negotiated , has been weighing whether it serves u.s. security interests as he faces an oct. 15 deadline for certifying that iran is complying with its terms .
if trump declines to certify iran s compliance , u.s. congressional leaders would have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on tehran suspended under the agreement .
