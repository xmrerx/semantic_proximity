( reuters ) - former u.s. vice presidential nominee sarah palin on tuesday said her husband is still in the intensive care unit of an alaska hospital with multiple injuries , including broken bones and a collapsed lung , two days after a serious snowmobile accident .
todd palin , 51 , suffered multiple broken ribs , a broken shoulder blade and clavicle , as well as knee and leg injuries .
he was back in surgery to repair several fractures , sarah palin said in a statement on social media on tuesday .
“ knowing todd , once he ’ s cognizant , he ’ ll probably ask docs to duct tape him up and he ’ ll call it good , ” she said .
“ he ’ s tough. ” an attorney for sarah palin declined to comment .
a representative for the hospital where todd palin is said to be receiving treatment could not be reached .
the accident on sunday forced sarah palin to cut short a campaign trip for donald trump , the front-runner in the race for the republican party ’ s presidential nomination .
palin , who has endorsed trump , had been scheduled to campaign for him on monday in the villages , a central florida retirement community of more than 100,000 residents which has its own newspaper and radio station .
florida is one of five states holding nominating contests on tuesday for the nov. 8 general election .
trump campaign officials said palin , 52 , was returning to alaska to be with her husband and they looked forward to her return to the campaign trail soon .
sarah palin was republican senator john mccain ’ s running mate in the 2008 presidential election won by democrat barack obama .
