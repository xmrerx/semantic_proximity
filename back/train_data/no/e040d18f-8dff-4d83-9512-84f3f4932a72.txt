dublin ( reuters ) - progress is being made in talks between britain and the eu on how to avoid setting up a physical infrastructure on northern ireland s border after the united kingdom leaves the eu in 2019 , irish prime minister leo varadkar said on wednesday .
i think it is fair to say that progress is being made but not that is sufficient at this stage , varadkar told parliament .
we are not at a decision point at the moment .
things are changing on a daily basis and are rapidly evolving , he said .
the eu has named the border as one of three issues on which sufficient progress must be made in order to allow progress to talks on a future trade agreement with britain , crucial for british businesses .
