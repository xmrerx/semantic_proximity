ATHENS (Reuters) - A makeshift bomb exploded outside a Greek court in Athens early on Friday shattering windows and damaging the facade of the building, police officials said.
Shots were also fired at a person guarding the Athens Appeal Court building, Justice Minister Stavros Kontonis told state TV.
The Justice Ministry suspended the court s operation for one day.
There were no reports of injuries.
Two Greek media organizations received warning calls at 2:50 a.m. (0050 GMT), before the explosion, one official said.
Police, who had cordoned off the area, later found a bag which contained the makeshift bomb outside the building.
Police were also investigating footage from cameras nearby, another official said, and reports of two people leaving the scene in a van.
