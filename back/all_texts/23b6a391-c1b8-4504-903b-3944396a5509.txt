Former White House photographer Pete Souza has spent the last eight years of his life photographing President Obama and his family inside the White House.
Now that we re in the Trump era, one peek at Souza s Instagram account shows just how much he loathes Donald Trump.
Usually, Souza trolls Trump with photos of his much more classy and capable predecessor.
The photos are a rare look inside the life of President Obama s historic presidency, and they are definitely a soothing balm on our raw nerves during the chaos that is the Donald Trump presidency.
Without further ado, here are just a few photos and videos of some of President Obama s most memorable moments.There was that time he spontaneously broke into song at a rally in front of a mesmerized crowd:And of course there was the time he joked with a woman whose boyfriend embarrassed her in the voting booth, and it went viral and made her day:This is Souza trolling Trump s disastrous first meeting with German Chancellor Angela Merkel:First time meeting Angela Merkel in 2009A post shared by Pete Souza (@petesouza) on Mar 17, 2017 at 12:54pm PDTAnd of course who can forget his running through the White House with First Dog Bo?Man s best friend.
