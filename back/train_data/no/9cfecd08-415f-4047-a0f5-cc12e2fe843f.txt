kampala ( reuters ) - ugandan legislators voted overwhelmingly late on wednesday to remove from the constitution an age cap of 75 for presidential candidates , allowing president yoweri museveni , 73 , to seek re-election at the next polls in 2021 .
critics say the move opens the possibility of a life presidency for museveni , who has ruled the east african country for 31 years .
