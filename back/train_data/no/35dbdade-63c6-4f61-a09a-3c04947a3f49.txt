jerusalem ( reuters ) - nazareth , the israeli arab city where jesus is thought to have been raised , has canceled some christmas celebrations in protest at u.s. president donald trump s recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital , an official said .
trump announced the move last week , reversing decades of u.s. policy and recognized jerusalem as the capital of israel , jeopardizing middle east peace efforts and upsetting the arab world and western allies alike .
nazareth , the largest arab town in israel with a muslim and christian population of 76,000 , is one of the holy land s focal points of christmas festivities .
we have decided to cancel the traditional christmas singing and dancing because we are in a time of dispute , because of what trump has said about jerusalem , city spokesman salem sharara said .
nazareth is traditionally thought to be where jesus grew up .
the imposing basilica of the annunciation in central nazareth is built on a site which many christian faithful believe was the childhood home of jesus mother , mary .
sharara said the town s market stalls and the traditional christmas church services would be held as they are every year .
within an hour of the announcement , the palestinian towns of bethlehem , jesus s traditional birthplace , and ramallah in the israeli-occupied west bank briefly switched off their christmas lights in protest .
there was no word from the bethlehem municipality whether it was also weighing a cutback on its celebrations at a crucial time of year for the town s tourist trade .
