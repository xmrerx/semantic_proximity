if you thought it was hilarious that trump s 2020 slogan was directly lifted from a promotional poster for the purge , you re in for a treat when you realize that he quoted a batman villain during his first speech as president .
today , we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another , trump told his tiny , tiny crowd of less than a quarter-million on friday , but we are transferring power from washington , d.c. and giving it back to you , the people .
trump says he wrote his speech himself , apparently after watching the dark knight rises .
the internet was quick to notice similarities to a speech given by batman villain bane : guys donald trump quoted bane in his # inauguration speech !

( @ garrystitchell ) january 20 , 2017you know , it is probably appropriate that trump would quote a deranged killer who took control of a city , emptied the prisons , proclaimed martial law , and threatened to blow everyone in the city up if they didn t comply with his authority .
it s going to be just like the movies.unfortunately , batman is not real and will not be here to protect us from trump .
it is up to each of you to do all that you can to ensure that this real-life villain does not win .
oppose him at every turn , or we lose gotham america as we know it.featured image by chip somodevilla via getty images/screengrab
