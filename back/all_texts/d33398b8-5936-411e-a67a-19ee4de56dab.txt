Donald Trump has always shown himself to be impulsive when it comes to his use of technology.
He often tweets in the middle of the night, goes on long rants that make no sense, and generally makes an absolute ass of himself in front of the whole world via his Twitter account.
However, we can block Trump from our Twitters.
Once he becomes president, though, we will NOT be able to block him from our phones.You see, this president, and every president thereafter, will be using the same service that sends us severe weather alerts to text everyone in the nation with a cell phone.
There s one person who has a platform and is not at all happy about this development, considering what we know about Trump Late Show host Stephen Colbert.During his Thursday night monologue, Colbert addressed this grim new reality.
He began: Here s the deal you legally don t have to have to follow his tweets.
You can un-follow Trump, delete Twitter, go into the world, live your life.
But the bad news is, starting January 20th, Donald Trump can send unblockable mass text messages to the entire nation.
The only person I would trust less with that technology is [former Rep.] Anthony Weiner [D-N.Y.].
Yes, feel free to block alerts about floods and missing persons, but if Trump wants you to know how he feels about the cast of Hamilton, you will listen.
Now, it s important to remember that this can only be done via Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEAs), and they must be approved first.
However, given Trump s authoritarian tendencies, I m pretty sure whatever safeguards are in place to keep him from blowing up 300 million phones whenever he feels like it will be decimated in short order.
In short, Colbert is right this is bad news.Watch the video below:[ad3media campaign= 1372 ]Featured image via video screen capture
