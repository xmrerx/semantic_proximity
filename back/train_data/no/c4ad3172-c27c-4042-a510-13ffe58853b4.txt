ankara ( reuters ) - turkey said on thursday it expected humanitarian aid could be delivered to syria s northern province of idlib , which is under the control of a rebel alliance spearheaded by the former al qaeda offshoot nusra front .
our expectation is that idlib , just like other de-escalation zones , becomes a region where humanitarian aid can easily be delivered , presidential spokesman ibrahim kalin told a news conference in ankara .
turkey will do whatever falls upon it on this matter .
turkey said last month it was limiting the movement of non-humanitarian aid into idlib because the area is controlled by a terrorist organization .
