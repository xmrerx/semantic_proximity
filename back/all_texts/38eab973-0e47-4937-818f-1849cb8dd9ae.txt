Donald Trump has added Pope Francis to his very long list of people he is feuding with.
During an episode of The Late Show with Colbert, Stephen Colbert did a hilarious bit about Trump s latest failure attempt to pander to Christians.The feud came after Pope Francis was quoted as saying that Trump is not a Christian, A person who thinks only about building walls wherever they may be and not of building bridges is not a Christian, Pope Francis said while traveling to Rome from Mexico.
When asked if he thought people should or should not vote for Trump, Pope Francis responded saying, As far as what you said about whether I would advise to vote or not to vote, I am not going to get involved in that.
I say only that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that.
Trump released an official campaign response, where said that Pope Francis is going to regret not supporting him and his campaign when ISIS attacks the Vatican.
During a campaign rally on Thursday Trump had this to say: As I m walking up here, they said, Mr. Trump, the pope made a statement about you, and I said, The pope?
What did the pope say?
I like the pope was it good or bad?
Because if it was good, I like the pope.
If it s bad, I don t like the pope.
Colbert mocks Trump during the segment, saying: It s like Jesus said: Blessed are the poor, unless they said something bad about me then screw them.
Trump is trying to pander to Christians.
He really needs them in order to secure his chances at receiving the Republican primary nomination.As I have pointed out before, Trump is making himself look a fool doing it too.
It s not just that Trump isn t saying the wrong things to win over Christian voters.
He doesn t even appear to understand the basic concepts of Christianity.
This was shown Trump publicly stated that he had not asked Jesus Christ for forgiveness.You can the video below.Featured image from video screenshot
