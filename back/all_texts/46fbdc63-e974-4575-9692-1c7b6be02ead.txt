BRUSSELS (Reuters) - North Korea s latest missile launch is a further unacceptable violation of its international obligations, a spokeswoman for the European Union foreign affairs chief said on Tuesday.
North Korea fired a missile that landed close to Japan in the early hours of Wednesday, the first test by Pyongyang since a missile fired over its neighbor in mid-September.
The Pentagon said its initial assessment was that it was an intercontinental ballistic missile.
This launch represents a further grave provocation, and a serious threat to international security, a spokeswoman for Federica Mogherini said.
