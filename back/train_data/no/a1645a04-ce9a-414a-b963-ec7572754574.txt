new york ( reuters ) - democrats beat republicans in u.s. television ratings , according to nielsen data released on tuesday for the first night of the democratic national convention .
an estimated 26 million people watched monday evening between 10 p.m. to 11:30 p.m. eastern time , when first lady michelle obama and senator bernie sanders were among the key speakers , nielsen said .
the data represents people watching across seven broadcast and cable tv networks .
the total is about three million more tv eyes than for the first night of the republican convention last week when white house contender donald trump ’ s wife melania was the keynote speaker .
all in all , some 23 million americans watched the first night of the republican convention last week - in line with the audience for the 2012 gathering .
trump ’ s big acceptance speech on thursday night last week , however , failed to deliver the record audiences many tv executives had been expecting .
in 2012 , the democratic convention generally drew more nightly tv viewers than the republican gathering , when mitt romney was running for the white house .
