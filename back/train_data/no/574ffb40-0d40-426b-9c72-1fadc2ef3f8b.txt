london ( reuters ) - british foreign minister boris johnson will travel to moscow later this year to discuss international security issues , the british government said on friday .
johnson canceled what would have been the first visit to russia in five years by a british foreign secretary in april due to a poison gas attack in a rebel-held area of syria that prompted the united states to carry out missile strikes .
moscow backs syrian government forces against rebels in the country s civil war .
russian foreign minister sergei lavrov subsequently met johnson at the united nations in september .
our relationship with russia is not straightforward , johnson said in a statement .
that is all the more reason to be talking to russia - to manage our differences and cooperate where possible for the security of both our nations and the international community .
relations between britain and russia have been strained since the murder of ex-kgb agent alexander litvinenko in london in 2006 , a killing which a british inquiry said was probably approved by president vladimir putin .
britain s foreign ministry said johnson , on his moscow visit , wished to discuss north korea , iran and regional stability in the middle east , as well as security for the 2018 world cup soccer tournament in russia .
we will continue to challenge russia s approach where we disagree , whether that is russia s actions in syria or its aggression toward ukraine .
my visit will provide an opportunity to talk about these issues and more , face-to-face , johnson said .
