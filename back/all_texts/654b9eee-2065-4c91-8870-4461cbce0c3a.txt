It s been a hell of a week for the Trump campaign with Donald Trump s recent pivots on immigration.
The Republican presidential nominee and his surrogates have placed themselves in a place where they can neither go forward nor retreat.
The media is trying to get a clear message from the campaign on just exactly where Trump stands on his initial proposal to forcibly deport 11 million undocumented immigrants.
Trump campaign senior adviser Boris Epshteyn appeared on CNN Sunday morning, where he gave probably the most honest statement regarding Trump s new position that we re going to get.The idea is lunacy.
Not only would such a massive deportation wave create one of the largest human rights crises in history, it would also cost hundreds of billions of dollars.
Not to mention the fact that it would also completely destroy the United States entire economy.That being said, Trump catapulted to his current position by tapping into his base s anti-brown hatred by promising he would do just that.
So it could be said that the campaign is trapped between appealing to white supremacists and well, reality itself.After dodging the question on every cable news journalist s lips by talking about Trump s Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton s immigration plan, which agree with it or not on some points, at least actually exists, Epshteyn says: Donald Trump will make sure America stays America and Hillary Clinton s plans will make sure we have illegal immigrants coming to this country at will.
Just to be clear, make sure America stays America is code for make sure the United States stays white.
That s all the Trump campaign has left.
Vague promises to implement racist policies.
That s all folks.You can watch the segment below.Featured image via video screen capture
