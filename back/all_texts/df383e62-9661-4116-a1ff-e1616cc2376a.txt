WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Senate Banking Committee will vote on Tuesday on the nomination of Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell to lead the U.S. central bank, the panel said in a statement.
The committee said on Thursday the vote would be held at 10 a.m. (1500 GMT).
If confirmed by the Senate, as expected, Powell would assume the Fed chair post after Janet Yellenâ€™s term expires on Feb. 3.
