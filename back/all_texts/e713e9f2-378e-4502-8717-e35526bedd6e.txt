The left showed its true colors last night with serious violence and anti-American flag burning.
Donald Trump held a fundraiser at the Minneapolis Convention Center that began and ended with violence and destruction.
These people must not understand that punching people and burning American flags wins you ZERO support.It s one thing to be on opposite sides of an issue and opposite parties but THIS is shameful and hateful behavior by Hillary s henchmen.Protesters blocked the entrance hoping Trump couldn t get in: Then DURING THE TRUMP FUNDRAISER in Minneapolis, the crowd of Hillary supporters were banging on doors and windows as the crowd inside the convention center held their event but then the Trump supporters had to walk through a gauntlet to leave.
You will be shocked to see the terrified Trump supporters being hit and yelled at:Some protesters got aggressive at the end of the night as Trump supporters left Minneapolis fundraiser.
