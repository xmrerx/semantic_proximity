large crowds , fights and a woman arrested for pulling a knife none are normally synonymous with a toy giveaway .
but saturday on detroit s west side , hundreds , if not thousands , gathered for free christmas toys.police had to be called in because , at times , the crowds were unruly .
people were fighting over toys , so they shut the door , one person said.it was likely a first for any kind of toy giveaway , crowds so large detroit police had to step in , and those trying to get toys , at times , getting out of control.saturday night s toy giveaway is part of a program called toys making i.m.p.a.c.t.s .
for months , those in need could register for free toys for their children , and when the doors opened at tower center mall on grand river avenue at 4 p.m. , close to 6,000 children were signed up.and more families who didn t sign up showed up.the organizers admit that organization and crowd control is on them .
they just weren t expecting so many people.a 39-year-old woman was arrested after pulling a knife on someone during a fight .
no one was hurt , but this happened in front of her children , so detroit police had to take them back to the precinct and try to find other family members .
