Major Hollywood liberal activist Rob Reiner is no match for Tucker Carlson who calls Reiner out on his Morgan Freeman propaganda ad on cyber war with Russia.
Tucker talks about how our real enemy is China when it comes to cyber wars Haha!
Reiner starts to get a little miffed at Tucker when Tucker calls him out on China Epic!
This is the meat of the interview: I agree with you we are very divided.
And maybe this is one of the reasons.
A lot of this is disingenuous.
Anyone who looks at cyber warfare will tell you, any honest person, will tell you the Chinese military is the primary culprit in the United States, hacked into the White House not too long ago Nobody said anything.
You guys in Hollywood sell your movies in China.
You bow to the imperatives of their propaganda and censorship office.
You change your movies to suit them.
And yet no one says we re at war with China.Notice how Reiner brings up the Facebook ads that the left is now going after because a Russian group spent $100K on ads during the election.
So it comes down to the fact that this is an effort at (ironic) propaganda to convince Americans that Russia stole the election.
Did you catch that Clapper is part of this???
WTH?
If people want to turn their heads at that, it s at their own peril Really?Who s the propagandist Mr. Reiner?
He might want to look in the mirror
