sao paulo ( reuters ) - a decision on friday by a brazilian federal judge to freeze the assets and companies of the billionaire batista family is legally fragile because it is based on newspaper reports and not on prior judicial rulings , the lawyers representing the family s investment holding company j & f investimentos sa said .
in a statement , the lawyers said a decision by federal judge ricardo leite of the 10th district court of bras lia demanding the family deposits 1.6 billion reais ( $ 506 million ) to compensate state development bank bndes is unjustified because j & f was to pay a slightly bigger fine as part of a may leniency accord .
earlier in the day , leite ordered the assets of the batistas be frozen as part of an investigation .
