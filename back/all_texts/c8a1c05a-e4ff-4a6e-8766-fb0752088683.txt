SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia s domestic spy chief has warned that universities need to be very conscious of foreign interference in an apparent reference to China s perceived undercover influence on campuses.
Australian Security Intelligence Organisation director-general Duncan Lewis told politicians in Canberra late on Tuesday that espionage and foreign interference were an insidious threat .
Lewis said foreign powers were clandestinely seeking to shape the opinion of the Australian public, media organizations and government officials in order to advance their countries own political objectives .
Lewis did not specifically name China in his late night testimony to a parliamentary inquiry, but when questioned about China s involvement, he said he strongly identified with comments made by a senior government official this month that universities should protect themselves from Chinese influence.
Asked last week about the Communist Party s overseas activities in places like Australia, a senior official said Chinese people living overseas had to respect the laws of the countries in which they lived.
China is Australia s largest trading partner, with business spurred by a wide-ranging China-Australia Free Trade Agreement signed in 2015.
Relations between Australia and China have been tested in recent months after the United States, Japan and Australia voiced concerns over Beijing s unilateral actions in the disputed South China Sea, including continued artificial land building.
