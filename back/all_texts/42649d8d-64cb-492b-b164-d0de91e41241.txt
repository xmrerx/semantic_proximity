Poor Gary Johnson.
Poor, poor Gary Johnson.
One thing is for sure, this man is not destined to be president.
He managed to make a total ass out of himself yet again, in what he called an Aleppo moment, when he couldn t name a single world leader he respects.
Not one.In an absolutely cringeworthy moment during Wednesday s Town Hall event, Johnson ensured that he will never sit behind the desk in the Oval Office.
MSNBC s Chris Matthews asked the Libertarian candidate to name one foreign leader that he respects or looks up to.
Well, that was enough to stump Johnson.Johnson sputtered and stammered, but he couldn t come up with anything.
Not one single name.
You gotta do this, said Matthews.
Anywhere.
Any continent.
Canada, Mexico, Europe, over there, Asia, South America, Africa.
Name a foreign leader that you respect.
The presidential hopeful finally said, I guess I m having an Aleppo moment.
The best Johnson could come up with was the former president of Mexico.
But he couldn t say which one.
But I m giving you the whole world, Matthews said.
Anybody in the whole world you like.
Anybody.
Pick any leader.
Johnson couldn t do it.
This guy wants to be president of the United States, but he can t come up with the name of even one lone foreign leader that he respects?
How much weed is this guy smoking?
And here s the part that really gets me, somehow, millennials who vehemently supported Bernie Sanders, are so blinded by their irrational hatred of Hillary that they are planning to vote for this f*cking moron.
