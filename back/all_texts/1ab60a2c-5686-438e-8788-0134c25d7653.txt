WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Wednesday he supports fellow Republican President Donald Trump’s deal with Democratic congressional leaders to extend the U.S. debt ceiling and fund the government into December in legislation that would provide relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey.
“That’s what I will be offering, based on the president’s decision, to the (House of Representatives) bill.
And we’ll try to get 60 votes and move forward,” McConnell told reporters.
McConnell said Hurricanes Harvey and Irma constituted a national emergency.
“His feeling was that we needed to come together to not create a picture of divisiveness at a time of genuine national crisis,” he said of Trump.
