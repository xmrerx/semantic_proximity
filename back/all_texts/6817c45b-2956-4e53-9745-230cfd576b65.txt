If you see something say something and maybe, if the FBI isn t too busy spending all of their time and resources investigating a presidential candidate who should already be in jail, they ll do something about it A gun store owner reported Orlando shooter Omar Mateen to authorities weeks before he committed the worst mass shooting in US history.Robbie Abell, co-owner of Lotus Gunworks, told the Wall Street Journal Mateen came into the store in South Florida in May and asked for heavy-duty body armor like the kind used by law enforcement.Staff at the store, which does not sell body armor, felt it was a strange demand.After his request was denied, Mateen asked to buy bulk ammunition.Though Lotus does sell ammunition, staff shut down his request and refused to sell him anything else.They subsequently reported the incident to the FBI, Abell said.
Mateen had already been investigated by the FBI years before.
But even after Abell s report, the 29-year-old self-radicalized gunman obtained an AR-15 and a semiautomatic pistol from another store in the area, bought stacks of ammunition, then opened fire on Pulse nightclub, where he killed 49 people and wounded 53.The store s owner Robbie Abell told the Journal: The questions he was asking were not the normal questions a normal person would be asking He just seemed very odd.
Abell also said Mateen was speaking to someone on the phone in Arabic and was walking around the store texting.He added that staff were on high alert since authorities has recently warned them to look out for suspicious activity in the area.Abell did not specify which authorities gave this warning.
Port St Lucie police said they did not receive a report about Mateen s suspicious behavior.The FBI has yet to comment.Once it emerged that Mateen was the perpetrator of the worst mass shooting in history, Abell said, Lotus staff instantly recognized him and reported their experience to the FBI.For entire story: Daily Mail
