beirut ( reuters ) - syria s foreign ministry on sunday condemned the u.s. administration of president donald trump for its position on the iran nuclear deal , saying in comments to state media that it would increase regional tension and threaten security and peace .
syria condemns the aggressive policies of the u.s. administration against the interests of the people , and which will increase the atmosphere of tension in the region and the world , state news agency sana quoted an official source at the ministry as saying .
trump refused on friday to formally certify that tehran was complying with the 2015 accord even though international inspectors say it is .
he warned he might ultimately terminate the agreement .
syria is a close ally of iran , which has given extensive military and financial aid to president bashar al-assad in his more than six years of war against rebels seeking to oust him .
the nuclear deal was also signed by china , russia , france , britain , germany and the european union , leading european allies to warn that putting it into limbo risks undermining u.s. credibility abroad .
the u.s. congress will now have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose economic sanctions on tehran that it lifted under the pact .
