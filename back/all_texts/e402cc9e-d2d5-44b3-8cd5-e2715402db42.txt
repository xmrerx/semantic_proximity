The 2016 presidential election continues to defy expectations as faithless electors emerged among Democrats refusing to support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.In the run-up to the vote of the Electoral College, all eyes had been on whether any Republican electors would refuse to vote for Donald Trump.
There had reports of last-ditch lobbying asking electors to switch from Trump to Clinton.Instead, it has been Democratic electors who were balking.Only eight of 12 Democratic electors in Washington cast their votes for Democrat Hillary Clinton, who won the state in November.
In an act of symbolic protest, three Democratic electors voted for Colin Powell and one for Faith Spotted Eagle, who has been fighting the Dakota Access Pipeline in North Dakota, instead of Clinton.There were also reports that two electors, one in Maine and another Minnesota, tried but failed in their efforts not to vote for Clinton.The irony: Muhammad Abdurrahman, Minnesota elector refuses to cast vote for Hillary today.
So his vote is invalid for alternative to cast.
