The Trump campaign is busy attempting to clean up the mess after Politifact exposed an incident of gross misrepresentation in its first TV ad.During the 30-second ad which was released Monday, a scene shows supposed migrants rushing through a national border while the voiceover states: He ll stop illegal immigration by building a wall on our southern border that Mexico will pay for.
The clear implication is that the viewer is watching Mexican migrants running across the U.S. border with zero controls or checks.
But as PolitiFact discovered, it s not it s 5,000 miles away, in a small Spanish enclave on the mainland of Morocco.
The fact checkers uncovered that the footage was first shown on Italian station RepubblikaTV on May 3 2014, and rather than showing Mexican migrants entering the U.S., actually shows: migrants crossing the border into Melilla, one of two enclaves on the Moroccan coast that are held by Spain.
Migrants who cross the border there are essentially entering territory held by a European Union nation, even though they are still on the African continent.
The footage has been shared multiple times across various social media since that time.
For example, one YouTube user posted the video in July this year.
Again, no mention is made of the U.S. border.
Trump scored himself a pants on fire rating for putting this nonsense on the air and attempting to mislead the American people as to the state of border security.However, Trump appeared unrepentant when he was called on to Bill O Reilly s show to explain his actions.
He told the Fox host on Monday night: I think it s irrelevant.
It s really merely a display of what a dumping ground is going to look like.
And that s what our country is becoming very rapidly.
Proving once again that he has all the personal integrity of a toddler with a cookie jar, the GOP front runner simply steps over his lie and moves on.Featured Image via Wikimedia Commons
