bill hemmer let mitch mcconnell have it but mcconnell was looking like a deer in the headlights with a blank stare on his face : people on the outside see this and think that that s just washington doing what washington wants to do .
and , damn the laws .
and , you know what s going on in the campaign trail , democrat or republican .
that s why bernie sanders is getting 15,000 people at a rally .
that s why donald trump is at 32 % of the polling right now .
people do not like what is coming out of washington and they think the smell stinks .
