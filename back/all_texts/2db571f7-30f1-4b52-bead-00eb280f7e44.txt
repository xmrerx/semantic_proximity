Politics can be a nasty business.
This latest spat proves once again, that in politics, it s not really about color, as much as it is which party you belong to.
In this sense, many prominent black American Democrats consider Ben Carson to be a traitor to their cause.Recently, President Trump s opponents have begun to intensify their attacks on African-American Republican HUD Secretary Ben Carson.
Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters has recently come out threatening Carson, and now Jumaane Williams, a Democrat and New York City Council member for the 45th District, has accused Carson of supporting White Supremacist views .
Is there any truth to these accusations, or is this a racially-motivated political witch-hunt?
