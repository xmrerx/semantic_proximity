dhaka ( reuters ) - bangladesh allowed two journalists from myanmar detained while reporting about fleeing rohingya muslims to fly home on tuesday and was dropping charges against them , their lawyer said .
minzayar oo and hkun lat were picked up from the cox bazar s region in early september because they were working as journalists on tourist visas , police said .
they were released on bail after calls from germany s geo magazine , which had assigned minzayar oo to cover the influx of rohingya refugees from myanmar , as well as rights groups .
it s so good to be free again , minzayar oo , one of myanmar s most prominent photographers , told reuters soon after his plane landed in the thai capital of bangkok .
bangladesh authorities had begun the process to drop the charges against the pair , their lawyer , jyotirmoy barua , said .
minzayar oo has worked for various media outlets , covering myanmar s emergence from military rule .
he had previously worked as a contractor with reuters .
hkun lat is also a well-known photographer in myanmar and has won prizes for his coverage of conflict in frontier regions .
about 582,000 refugees from myanmar have poured into bangladesh since aug. 25 , when attacks by rohingya militants on security posts triggered an army crackdown in response .
