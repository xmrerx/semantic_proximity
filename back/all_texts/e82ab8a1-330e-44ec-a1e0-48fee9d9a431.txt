Claire McCaskill is very clever.
Instead of outwardly calling Trump a phony bloviated god damned fool outright, she disguised it as something former Democratic president Harry Truman would have said.
And all while saying that, she smacked down historian Newt Gingrich.After the former Speaker of the House made a tweet equating Truman to Trump, McCaskill, a Clinton supporter, really let him have it.For a history guy,you don t know much about Harry Truman.He d call out Trump as a phony bloviating god damned fool.
https://t.co/p8EXLfGvTl Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) August 12, 2016Aside from McCaskill s accurate description of Trump, Gingrich really should brush up on his Truman history.
Before being tapped to the Vice Presidency, Truman was a United States Senator for 10 years and the elected presiding judge of Jackson County, Missouri for 8 years before that.
Not only that, he wasn t a millionaire he was a farmer, a haberdasher, and had deep connections to political mob bosses.Truman was no outsider.
And Trump isn t an outsider.
As a billionaire real estate mogul who has touted Bloomberg, the Clintons and Putin as his friends, it s hard to consider him an outsider, which is why McCaskill s assessment is spot on.Sadly, politicians (especially on the Republican side) have been pussyfooting around calling Trump out for what he really is.
But Claire McCaskill is not shy when it comes to voicing how she really feels.Between Nancy Pelosi basically saying Trump is spewing B.S., Elizabeth Warren lambasting him as a pathetic, two-bit dictator and now this, the women are grabbing the reins and honing in the conversation, and it s about time.Gingrich should stick to what he knows best staying out of the way and losing, like his dreamboat candidate Donald Trump.Thank you, Senator McCaskill, for saying what we re all thinking, and thank you for killing two birds with one stone.Featured image via Aaron S.
