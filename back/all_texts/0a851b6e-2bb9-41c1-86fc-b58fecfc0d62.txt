Hours before Thanksgiving Day began, Donald Trump once again called for that unity thing that conservatives think only white presidents deserve, and he got hammered for it.Trump had the gall to express hope that tensions in this country will begin to heal, even though he also seemed to whine that they weren t healing fast enough.
He even had the nerve to reference Abraham Lincoln, the president whom conservatives also hated and refused to unite behind.Here s his full bullshit message via Twitter.Let us give thanks for all that we have, and let us boldly face the exciting new frontiers that lie ahead.
Happy Thanksgiving.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 24, 2016Clearly, Trump was using a teleprompter to deliver this message, which is something else conservatives have constantly attacked President Obama for doing.But Trump s message was not a welcome one and people mocked him and told him exactly how they feel about him.Fun fact: The pilgrims were undocumented immigrants.
Happy Thanksgiving, @RealDonaldTrump!

Ironically similar to your campaign ideals Beth M (@bethmassanopoli) November 24, 2016@realDonaldTrump fuck you.
Chris Rager (@ragercoaster) November 24, 2016Trump has no right to ask for unity after he spent a year and a half using offensive, hateful, and divisive rhetoric.
And conservatives have no right to complain about Democrats refusing to support Trump after the way they treated President Obama over the last eight years.
If anything, this hypocritical asshole should get even worse treatment because turnabout is fair play and he doesn t deserve respect.Featured Image: Spencer Platt/Getty Images
