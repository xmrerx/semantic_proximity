the south s red states have been on a right-wing tear lately , and despite national outrag shows no signs of slowing down .
the latest to draw the ire of the non-bigoted public is mississippi governor phil bryant , who just signed an incredibly hateful anti-lgbt bill into law .
everyone from average citizens to influential public figures have taken to social media giant twitter to let governor bryant know just how awful what he s done is.the bill quite literally creates something of an anti-lgbt jim crow , where it is now perfectly legal for businesses and other public places to discriminate against lgbt people and use their bibles as a shield to do so .
house bill 1523 even shields government employees from having to perform same-sex marriages , despite the supreme court ruling legalizing marriage equality .
here are just a few tweets the bigoted governor got as a result of making this hateful bill the law of the land in his state : disappointing that mississippi gov @ philbryantms signed h.b .
1523 .
ibm strongly opposes this discriminatory bill .

instead , they are busily enshrining bigotry into law so that their state full of religious bigots can live to rant and rave another day about how the gays are the problem.shame on you , gov .
