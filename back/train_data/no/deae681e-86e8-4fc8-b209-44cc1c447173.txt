kabul ( reuters ) - a car bomber attacked a danish convoy belonging to the nato-led military mission in the afghan capital , kabul , on sunday , wounding a number of civilians but leaving international forces unharmed , security officials said .
a danish military spokesman said some civilians may have been killed but afghan officials reported no fatalities .
security officials say five civilians had been wounded while the interior ministry put the figure at three .
captain william salvin , a spokesman for nato s resolute support mission , confirmed an attack had occurred and said a team was on the scene to recover the vehicle .
there are no resolute support casualties as a result of the explosion , salvin he said in an emailed statement .
the danish spokesman said the danish soldiers were part of a security team normally engaged in protecting advisers traveling to and from the afghan military academy near kabul .
nato personnel traveling by road normally travel in convoys of three heavily armored personnel carriers which can resist all but the heaviest explosions .
past suicide attacks on such convoys have usually caused casualties among nearby civilians while leaving their targets relatively unharmed .
nato personnel now often travel even short distances in kabul by helicopter .
the taliban , which often exaggerates casualty estimates from its attacks , said 16 americans had been killed and three armored vehicles destroyed .
it said it was preparing to step up the pace of attacks on foreign forces in afghanistan .
