Everyone s been asking where the Hillary van is So Hillary pulls up in a gas guzzling van with tinted windows-I thought she wanted to mingle with the regular folk?
This monster gets 16-18 miles per gallon!
Ouch!The van, however, isn t an everyday minivan or even a full-sized van.
It s a luxury vehicle outiftted with top amenities.Specifically: It s a limited edition Chevrolet Express van upfitted with a Limited SE packed by Explorer Vans company It s very luxurious, a salesman who helped deliver this vehicle tells me on the phone.
I d rank it up there with the best.
The model being used to chauffeur Hillary Clinton around has a gray leather interior, heated seat, a 29 inch Samsung television, and a Blu-ray DVD player.There is no refrigerator in the van.
However, Hillary s model does feature an ice chest between the two front seats.
(Which might have been used to keep her cottage cheese cold.)
The middle chairs are swivel and quick release.
Indirect lighting (like mood lighting) throughout the vans.Oh, and there s a bed.
The power sofa in the rear of the vehicle converts into a bed.
But given the fact it s only a 6 foot wide vehicle, it might have been a little hard to get a proper night s sleep in it.But it s not exactly great for the environment.
It s a 2014 model all-wheel-drive that gets only 16-18 miles per gallon.READ MORE: WEEKLY STANDARD
