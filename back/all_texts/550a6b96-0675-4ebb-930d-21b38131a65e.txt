There was testimony today regarding illegal minors flooding our southern border.
John Conyers said it s unAmerican to stop them from crossing.
He struggled to read the prepared statement on illegal minors.
He claimed that illegals aren t committing an illegal act .
Notice how he reclassifies illegals as refugees.
This is what the left wants to do with illegals.
If they all claim persecution then it s their ticket into the U.S.
It s how they FEEL and not something they have to PROVE.
Yea, typical government stupidity.
So now we have a free for all at the border where anyone can come and they get in because they are now considered a refugee .
Not to mention, Obama just reinstated the catch and release program where the border patrol just releases the illegals once they catch them.
Crazy!
