What a difference a presidency makes!FLASHBACK TO MARTHA S VINEYARD: Where was President Obama when the most serious natural disaster happened during his 8 years in office?
He was golfing on Martha s Vineyard, and refused to leave his golfing vacation to assess the situation.President Obama is stirring resentment over his refusal to interrupt his Martha s Vineyard vacation to survey the Louisiana flood the worst U.S. natural disaster since 2012 while drawing comparisons to President George W. Bush s hotly criticized response to Hurricane Katrina in the same state.Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson defended Mr. Obama at a press conference Thursday, insisting that the president is closely monitoring the situation but that he will not cut short his two-week breather in the tony Massachusetts resort.
The president can t be everywhere, Mr. Johnson told reporters in Denham Springs, Louisiana.Louisiana Gov.
John Bel Edwards, a Democrat, backed him up, saying at the press conference that he is not complaining in any way about our federal partnership.
Even so, Mr. Obama s lack of urgency is drawing unflattering parallels to the federal response in 2005, when Mr. Bush was branded as uncaring and even racist for not touching down during a flyover two days after Hurricane Katrina.
