berlin ( reuters ) - germany s would-be coalition partners have not agreed to abolish a tax imposed after reunification to help poorer eastern states , a conservative politician told reuters on sunday , retracting his previous remarks that a deal on the issue had been reached .
hans michelbach , a member of chancellor angela merkel s conservative bloc , said earlier that an agreement had been reached with the greens and the pro-business free democrats ( fdp ) to abolish the solidarity tax by 2021 .
the fdp had made abolishing the tax , which was due to expire in 2019 , an election promise .
