Not to let us be disappointed in hearing something ludicrous come out of his mouth in so long, Dr. Ben Carson just dropped a doozy on us while he was being interviewed on Fox News.Still unable to keep his eyes open for more than half a second at a time, Carson was asked his opinion about Harriet Tubman being placed in the twenty-dollar bill.
He seemed flabbergasted at the notion and said that former President Andrew Trail of Tears Jackson, who is currently on the $20, was a tremendous secretary err, umm president and he believes he should get to hold his place on currency.When asked what he thought of Harriet Tubman, he said I love Harriet Tubman.
I love what she did, but we can find another way to honor her, and that not being bad enough, he said maybe a $2 bill.
Tubman risked everything to free herself and others who were being held as property, and then was a key participant in trying to get women the right to vote.
Being recognized on the $20 bill is the least we can do to continue to honor her and her legacy.
To say that she belongs on currency that is barely in use, and could likely be considered a joke, is not only condescending, but outright insulting..@RealBenCarson: Maybe Harriet Tubman should go on the $2 bill https://t.co/OMPuGSp82N pic.twitter.com/ZtHY9s2WNi POLITICO (@politico) April 20, 2016Featured Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images
