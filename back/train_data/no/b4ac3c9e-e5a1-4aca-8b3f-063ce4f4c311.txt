anyone who knows anything about the civil rights movement and its highlights knows about bloody sunday .
it was the sunday in the late winter/early spring of 1965 where many civil rights leaders and protesters lost their lives at the hands of law enforcement and others who wanted to keep racism alive on a legal level .
roughly 600 people assembled in selma , alabama after a march from montgomery that sunday march 7 , 1965 and today is the 51st anniversary of that march.another widely known fact is that esteemed and celebrated u.s .
congressman john lewis was there .
not only was he there , but he was beaten within an inch of his life for protesting for the civil rights of black people .
luckily , he survived to tell the tale , and has decided to tweet the timeline of what happened to him and others in the time leading up to that fateful day .
here are the highlights : i was arrested for the first time 56 years ago today during a nonviolent sit-in to protest segregated lunch counters pic.twitter.com/xp2c9k8ola john lewis ( @ repjohnlewis ) february 28 , 2016he reminded us what he and others went through so that everyone has the right to vote : the vote is precious , it is almost sacred .
i gave a little blood to guarantee that every american has the right to vote .
