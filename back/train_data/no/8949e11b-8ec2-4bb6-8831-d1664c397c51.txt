paris ( reuters ) - a court in paris on monday released the younger brother of former burkina faso president blaise compaore pending consideration of a request by the burkinabe government to have him extradited , his lawyer and a judicial source said .
police detained francois compaore at charles de gaulle airport in paris on sunday on an international arrest warrant related to the 1998 murder of norbert zongo , who published burkina faso s independent newspaper .
the killing of zongo , who had been investigating the murder of a driver who worked for francois compaore , became a symbol of repression during blaise compaore s 27-year rule , which ended in 2014 at the hands of a popular uprising .
francois compaore is barred from leaving france until a court examines an extradition request by burkina faso s government , said a judicial source , speaking on condition of anonymity .
compaore s lawyer pierre-olivier sur said the charges against his client are politically motivated by a burkinabe government unable to try blaise compaore , whom the government of neighboring ivory coast refuses to extradite .
blaise compaore fled to ivory coast during the uprising .
he faces an international arrest warrant in connection with the 1987 murder of former president thomas sankara .
activists are pushing president roch marc christian kabore to aggressively pursue cases of past human rights abuses .
critics say his government has been too slow to move against former government members , some of whom serve in the current administration .
