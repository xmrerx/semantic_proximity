nairobi ( reuters ) - in a heist reminiscent of a hollywood movie , kenyan robbers spent months tunneling into the bowels of a bank located opposite a police station and stole the equivalent of half a million dollars , police said on tuesday .
police said they had arrested two men and one woman over the robbery but had not recovered the 50 million kenyan shillings , reported missing by staff at the branch of kenya commercial bank ( kcb ) on monday when they showed up to work .
we have not recovered the stolen money , said simba willy , sub-county police commander in the town of thika , northeast of nairobi , where the heist took place .
we suspect the robbers hired one of the shops near the bank ( while digging their tunnel ) , willy told reuters .
the robbers were able to remove the earth during their months-long excavations without arousing suspicion by concealing it in boxes , the daily nation newspaper quoted local traders as saying .
the traders described the two young men who had rented the store as very hardworking and introverts .
kcb , which is the region s biggest bank by assets , confirmed the break-in on twitter .
but the kenyans have competition for the title of most ingenious robbery .
last month brazilian police foiled a plot to rob a sao paulo bank after discovering a 500-metre underground tunnel kitted out with lighting and ventilation systems .
