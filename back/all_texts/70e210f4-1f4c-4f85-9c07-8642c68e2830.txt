This weekend, the Libertarian Party held its annual convention in Orlando, Florida.
On Sunday, as ballots were being counted to determine who would be the party s presidential and vice-presidential nominees, candidates vying for party chairman were each allowed two minutes to speak.During this time, James Weeks, a candidate for the chairman position, took to the stage.
Instead of using his two minutes to urge party members to vote for him, he instead used his time to do a striptease.Reporters who were covering the convention tweeted out photos and video of the candidate s performance.The Washington Post s Dave Weigel tweeted:Image credit: Screen capture via Dave Weigel on TwitterAt around the same time, Byron Tau of the Wall Street Journal posted this image to Twitter.Image credit: Byron Tau via TwitterMeanwhile, Vaughn Hillyard of NBC News wondered how C-SPAN was dealing with the spontaneous striptease.Image credit: Vaughn Hillyard via TwitterC-SPAN aired the candidate s performance live.Video of the C-SPAN coverage, which identifies the candidate as James Weeks, was quickly posted to YouTube.
