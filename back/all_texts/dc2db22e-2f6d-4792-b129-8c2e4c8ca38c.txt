Lou Dobbs went off on #FakePresident Barack Obama during his Dobb s Commentary segment.
Fox News host Lou Dobbs is furious that the FORMER President, Barack Obama, aka Barry Soetoro has been either following President Trump around the world to meet with world leaders or meeting with world leaders just prior to scheduled meetings with President Trump.Dobbs suggested to his viewers that Obama s meetings with various world leaders appear to all be organized.
Why is the media ignoring Barack Obama s bizarre meetings with South Korea s new President Moon Jae-in, Britian s Prime Minister Theresa May, Canada s Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and German Chancellor Angela Merkel?
Would they have ignored former President George W. Bush if he embarked on a world tour to undercut or undermine Barack Obama only months after he was elected as our President?Perhaps someone needs to tell the FORMER President that in America, there s only ONE President at a time.
Barry had his chance, and he failed miserably.
It s time for him to step aside and let Donald Trump clean up the mess.
It s hard enough to have to follow in the footsteps of America s worst President, the least Barry can do now for the sake of our nation, is to get out of his way Subversive Obama- Former President now doing his worst to undercut @POTUS and the will of the American people.
