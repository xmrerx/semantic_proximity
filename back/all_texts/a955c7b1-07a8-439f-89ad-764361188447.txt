While it was billed as a one-time-only clash between the vice presidential running mates, the real matchup at the vice presidential debate turned out not to be Mike Pence versus Tim Kaine after all.As this video from the group Correct the Record shows, Mike Pence spent more time slamming positions and statements held by his own running mate, Donald Trump, than either of the members of the Democratic ticket.Here s the video:[ad3media campaign= 1045 ]It was really stunning to see Pence again and again roll his eyes or exhale as Kaine recited Trump s bizarre rhetoric, only to use his response time to completely avoid defending Trump or offering up the most token resistance.It s no wonder that many observing the debate believe Pence s tactics have more to do with a possible presidential run in 2020 than any real interest in being Trump s vice president for 4-8 years.The thinking is that even on a losing ticket, Pence will have the sort of national exposure that would be impossible to earn through any other means.
As the most recent Republican primary showed, a big name brand can conquer a field composed of Governors, Senators, and business leaders despite their credentials.
Even as a siting governor, Pence would not have somewhere in the realm of 30 million people watching anything he could do as the leader of Indiana compared to number two on the presidential ticket.So while the strategy seems to hurt in the short term whatever happened to party unity it may be a play for the so-called long game in which Pence has a leg up over the post-Trump GOP field.That being said, it could just be an act of self-preservation on Pence s part.
Not allying yourself with the man who attacks Muslims, Christians, and blacks is just good brand management, even though by simply being on the ticket, Pence is giving it validation in all its bigoted glory.Featured image via screen capture
