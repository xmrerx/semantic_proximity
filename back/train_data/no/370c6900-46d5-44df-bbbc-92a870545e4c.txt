yesterday , after the father of one of the ucla players arrested in china failed to show trump proper gratitude for getting his kid released , trump , predictably , went to twitter to grouse about it .
he seems to expect to be worshiped for his help on this matter , but lavar ball wouldn t do it , so trump tweeted : now that the three basketball players are out of china and saved from years in jail , lavar ball , the father of liangelo , is unaccepting of what i did for his son and that shoplifting is no big deal .
i should have left them in jail !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) november 19 , 2017fox news put that tweet into a meme portraying trump as a strong , decisive leader and the ucla basketball players as weaklings , because of course they did .
then they asked : do you agree with president trump ?
yes .
fox news seriously asked people whether they agree that trump should have left them in jail because the father of one is refusing to show proper gratitude : do you agree with president @ realdonaldtrump ?

shoplifting is a crime but its totally eclipsed by trump university .
cody swan ( @ lampliighter ) november 20 , 2017yeah , potus should only do his job if he gets his ass kissed properly .

pic.twitter.com/p3vdoxpxpg fox news ( @ foxnews ) november 20 , 2017nope .
i personally would be extraordinarily appreciative if this happened to one of my kids , but i think it s shameful that the prez resents not being thanked enough and doesn t view helping americans as just part of the job .
liberal kansan ( @ pvliberal ) november 20 , 2017no disgusting & embarrassing !
melanie ( @ melanie03630436 ) november 20 , 2017well , i m not convinced that he single-handedly got them out of jail so the question isn t really valid isaac simonelli ( @ dicetravels ) november 20 , 2017no normal person does .
and you know it .
ernie page ( @ angryhatter ) november 20 , 2017what ? !
this man is a child in a rumpled suit .
in case you haven t noticed , hardly anybody likes him .
: thus , when you give to the needy , sound no trumpet before you , as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets , that they may be praised by others .
pic.twitter.com/ntjzgkdwdz demos .. we the people ( @ windemere22 ) november 20 , 2017china should have thrown # dotard @ realdonaldtrump into the slammer , chucked the key into the bog & flushed it away .
holger \_ ( ) _/ ( @ hnelke1973 ) november 20 , 2017no .
@ realdonaldtrump has no idea what it means to do good for the sake of doing good .
he is an empty shell of a man with no moral compass .
also not my favorite president .
doreen graham ( @ doreegraham ) november 20 , 2017absolutely not .
the fact that our narcissistic baby in chief can t take any criticism without lashing out is disgraceful .
