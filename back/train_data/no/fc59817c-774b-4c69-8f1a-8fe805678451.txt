remember when the press used to actually report the news ?
today they are nothing more than a mouthpiece for the obama administration and democrat party .
there isn t a radical agenda this president and his regime want pushed that s off limits for today s mainstream media .
so you have an islamic terrorist who even in 2001 as a teenager was cheering the 9/11 attack .
he cased different targets , including disney world ( happy , but not a gay target ) and prepared for the attack apparently for quite some time .
he listened to anwar al awlaki videos , and has connection to radicals like american suicide moner abu salha .
he makes comments to coworkers about his connections to terrorists that spark them to call the fbi .
during the attack , he calls media , says he s doing it because of isis , tells the victims that s why he s doing it , tells the police that s why he s doing it .
he also tells victims he s doing it because the us bombing of my country ' [ afghanistan , he was born in ny but apparently self-identified as afghan ] .
isis claims the attack and calls him a soldier of the caliphate .the police never say it s islamic terrorism , and they immediately said the morning after , there are leanings in that direction .
they have reported the connections to radicals and are still looking at all the connections now.but it s domestic gun violence to these people ? check out the poll below : why ?
because of the media narrative and politicians like obama and clinton pushing it.at least 48 % ( translate republicans and people with sense ) get it.via : weasel zippers
