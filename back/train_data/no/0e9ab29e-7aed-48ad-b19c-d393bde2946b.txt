north korea just blinked with the strong statements from defense secretary jim mad dog mattis and after president trump s threats of massive retaliation for any new threat against the u.s. , noko backed off defense secretary jim mattis gave a quick statement that could be what resonated with noko .
he said it s game on if north korea fires missiles at guam .
if they shoot at the united states , i m assuming they hit the united states .
if they do that , then it s game on , mattis said .
i think if they fire at the united states , it could escalate into war very quickly , yes .
that s called war , if they shoot at us .
mattis then said , let s not do this , ok , folks ?
let s not start saying , general mattis said it s war , secretary mattis said it s war , war is up to the president , perhaps up to the congress .
the bottom line is we will defend the country from an attack .
it s not that i m over here , you know , dr. strangelove , you know , doing things like that , ok ?
mattis made the point that he would know within minutes if a missile was fired towards the u.s .
he said , we ll take it out .
you don t shoot at people in this world , unless you want to bear the consequences .
ok ?
all right .
there you go !
this is a very strong rebuke to the threats and it seems to have worked .
