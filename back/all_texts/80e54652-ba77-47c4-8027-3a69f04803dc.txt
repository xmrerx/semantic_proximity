Hillary Clinton is preparing to get back on the campaign trail with a week filled with appearances before actual voters, after ducking off the rally circuit to prepare for Monday s debate.She was set to begin with a Sunday appearance in Charlotte, North Carolina, after the city experienced riots and confrontations between protesters and police following the shooting of Keith Lamont Scott by a police officer this week.
But her campaign announced Friday night that the trip was being put off for a week, as there were protests in the city for a fourth consecutive night.
Hillary is grateful for, and intends to honor, the invitation from faith leaders to visit with the Charlotte community, according to Clinton communications director Jennifer Palmieri.
After further discussion with community leaders, we have decided to postpone Sunday s trip as to not impact the City s resources.
She will plan to visit Charlotte next Sunday, provided circumstances allow.
In the meantime her prayers are with the people of Charlotte during these difficult days, Palmieri concluded.
