watch : susan rice insists i leaked nothing to nobody https : //t.co/kasbu4vjdn msnbc ( @ msnbc ) april 4 , 2017 i know nothing about this .
i was surprised to see reports from chairman nunes on that count today .
what she says is a lie but who is surprised by this ?
we know that susan rice lied 5 times on 5 different morning shows the morning after benghazi .
why wouldn t she try and cover this spying up to protect herself and others including obama.susan rice is also giving conflicting stories on what she did so it might be a good idea for her to lawyer up right now .
she claimed ignorance of the unmasking and spying but today she spoke about doing it .
yes , red flags are everywhere on this !
the reality and truth is this was more of a political attack to destabilize the trump presidency and embarrass him : andrew mccarthy said it best : the national-security adviser is not an investigator .
she is a white house staffer .
the president s staff is a consumer of intelligence , not a generator or collector of it .
if susan rice was unmasking americans , it was not to fulfill an intelligence need based on american interests ; it was to fulfill a political desire based on democratic-party interests .
the bottom line is that laws were broken when the names were unmasked someone s in big trouble !
