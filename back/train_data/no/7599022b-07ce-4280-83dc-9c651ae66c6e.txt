dublin ( reuters ) - ireland s ruling fine gael party has opened up an eight-point lead over its nearest rival , an opinion poll showed on sunday , suggesting the minority government was seeing a bounce under new prime minister leo varadkar .
varadkar , the 38-year-old son of an indian immigrant and the first gay premier of the once-staunchly catholic country , succeeded enda kenny in may as members of his center-right fine gael hoped a young , straight-talking leader would propel the party ahead of main rival fianna fail .
fine gael secured the support of 33 percent of respondents to the sunday times/behaviour & attitudes poll , up from 29 percent in july , while the opposition fianna fail fell five points to 25 percent .
all of this increase has come from those who were undecided about the taoiseach ( prime minister ) in the previous poll , said behaviour & attitudes executive chairman ian mcshane .
in opinion polls taken before the summer recess , fine gael had mostly held only a marginal lead over fianna fail .
varadkar s minority government relies on the backing of fellow center-right fianna fail in key votes , under a deal due to last under october 2018 , although many analysts expect an election to be called before the agreement concludes .
fine gael won 25.5 percent of the vote at last year s election , to fianna fail s 24.3 percent , leaving both well short of the support needed to form a coalition government .
support for ireland s third largest party sinn fein rose one point to 19 percent in the poll .
both fine gael and fianna fail say they will not consider forming a coalition government with left-wing sinn fein after the next election .
