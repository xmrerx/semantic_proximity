A street preacher in Glasgow, Ireland decided to dedicate at least part of one of his sermons to spreading fear and hatred towards LGBT people.
He would have gotten away with it interrupted too, if not for the bravery of one cyclist who stopped to take a stand against the man s intolerance.The exchange was filmed by a passerby who posted the video online by a person named Emlyn Pearce.
Pearce says that they found the man who stood up to the preacher and that his name is Ryan Vance and that he is a writer and designer.
Though, Pearce writes that Vance shall forever more be more widely known as Mystery-Gay-Cyclist-Hero-Man.
Pearce went on to write: I walk through Glasgow holding hands with my boyfriend all the time, and we have never experienced any homophobia.
So to walk down the main shopping street and hear a man shouting that the 99% need to stand up to the 1% who are gay was very sad and very scary.
Pearce continues, saying Ryan Vance, as a gay man and a human being, I salute you: you made the world a better place.
Thank you, sir your pint awaits!
Vance appears to be hesitant to adopt his new title.
Don t worry Vance, if the title fits, rock it like no one else can, and be assured that it most certainly is befitting for a person like you.At what point do you think it's hubris to change my twitter description to "mystery gay cyclist"?
Ryan Vance (@rjjvance) May 9, 2016In the video, you can here Vance tell the hate preacher I m gay, I m gay, so say that to me.
The preacher responds saying God still loves you.
That s when drops the mic with a response that makes the entire street applaud for him.
Vance turns to the man and says I love me, I don t need a f*cking god to do it.
