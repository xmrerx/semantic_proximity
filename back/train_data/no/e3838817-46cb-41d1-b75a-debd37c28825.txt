bogota ( reuters ) - colombia has sent a letter of protest to venezuela after it said security forces from the socialist country crossed the border into the colombian province of la guajira over the weekend , two government sources said on monday .
the sources told reuters the colombian foreign ministry had given the letter to venezuela s embassy in bogota , although the government of venezuelan president nicolas maduro denied on sunday that the crossing into paraguachon , la guajira , took place .
the governor of la guajira criticized the crossing on twitter over the weekend , saying the security forces came over the border on saturday night and stole money and cellphones from residents .
long-standing tensions between the neighboring countries have escalated since colombian president juan manuel santos joined with other countries in the region to criticize maduro and said venezuela was heading toward a dictatorship .
venezuela s former top prosecutor , who has accused maduro of involvement with corruption , fled to colombia this month .
