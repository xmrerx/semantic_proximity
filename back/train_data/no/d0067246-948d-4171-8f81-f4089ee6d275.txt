reykjavik ( reuters ) - iceland s president asked the leader of the left-green movement , katrin jakobsdottir , on thursday to form a new government , although it came second in saturday s parliamentary election .
the mandate deals a blow to prime minister bjarni benediktsson of the independence party who called the snap election in september after less than a year in office as a scandal involving his father prompted a government ally to drop out of his ruling coalition .
the nordic island of 340,000 people , one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 financial crisis , has seen an economic rebound spurred by a tourism boom .
but a string of political scandals have hurt trust in government in recent years .
the election result showed a left-green-led coalition was possible if they joined forces with the social democrats , the progressive party and the pirate party .
together , they would hold 32 of parliament s 63 seats .
jakobsdottir s has said she may try to form a broad-based government .
the independence party , which has dominated icelandic politics for decades , fell short of a parliamentary majority .
