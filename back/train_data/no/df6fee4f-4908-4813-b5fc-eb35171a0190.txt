sofia ( reuters ) - couples lining up to face each other are given 30 seconds to chat before moving on - in a version of speed dating that , rather than sparking romance , aims to promote understanding and integration for new immigrants .
at a social center in the bulgarian capital sofia , the locals stand on one side , the immigrants - many refugees from syria , afghanistan and other war-torn countries - face them .
the quick-fire conversations - in which participants have just seconds to share their dreams and stories of love , pain and family - are aimed at starting a dialogue between two communities that in normal daily life rarely speak to each other on an equal footing .
it s so good to have an event like this , especially for refugees , said rodi naamo , a 26-year-old syrian kurd who arrived in bulgaria in 2015 , when hundreds of thousands of migrants passed through the balkans en route to germany and northern europe .
bulgarians also appreciated the speedy encounters , as well as the middle eastern food and traditional afghan dances afterwards .
i really enjoyed it , it helped me overcome prejudices , said milka bocheva , a bulgarian who runs an online business .
they ( the refugees ) are just people like us , we gave such similar answers .
bulgaria stands out in the region for its significant muslim minority , some 12 percent among 7.1 million mainly orthodox christians - a legacy of its history as part of the ottoman empire .
despite that , large parts of the population are concerned about the influx of asylum-seekers and migrants .
naamo , who returned to bulgaria after a short spell in germany , to work in a call center , believes opinions are starting to change .
i decided to stay here , this is my country .
i ll bring my family here , he said .
