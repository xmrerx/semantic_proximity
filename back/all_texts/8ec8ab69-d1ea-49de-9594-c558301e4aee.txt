Let s play a fun game called, What the hell did Nancy just say?
Every time Nancy opens her mouth, she proves that President Trump s election has caused her and her dingbat counterpart Rep. Maxine Waters to become completely unhinged.Here is the transcript from Nancy Pelosi s most recent appearance at the Peter G. Peterson Foundation s 2017 Fiscal Summit.
Can someone please tell us exactly what Nancy is trying to say here?
Talk about Russia s undermining our elections.
They did it.
Thisss .isss (mumble, mumble) isn t any question.
They hacked, they leaked, they disrupted.
The question is, was there collusion between the (mumble) campaign and the next.
You can t know until you have the full-fledged (mumble mumble).

Too bad she doesn t even know the NRA isn t part of the intelligence community:
