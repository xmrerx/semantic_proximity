WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he has “great heart” for illegal immigrants brought to the United States as children and he wants Congress to produce a legislative solution for them.
“I have a great heart for the folks we’re talking about, a great love for them,” Trump said after his administration announced earlier Tuesday it was phasing out a program that protects the so-called Dreamers from deportation.
“I can tell you in speaking to members of Congress they want to be able to do something and do it right and really we have no choice,” Trump told reporters.
