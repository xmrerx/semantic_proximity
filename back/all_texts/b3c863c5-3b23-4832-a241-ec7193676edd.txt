HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe agreed to resign on Sunday but his ruling ZANU-PF party did not want him to quit in front of the military, an act that would have made its intervention look like a coup, two senior political sources said on Monday.
It would have looked extremely bad if he had resigned in front of those generals.
It would have created a huge amount of mess, one senior source within ZANU-PF said.
Another political source said the speech was meant to sanitize the military s action.
