While not-my-president-elect Donald Trump was having a Twitter tantrum over recount efforts in three battleground states, one of his top advisers was on CNN s State of the Union having a hissy fit.
Team Trump is acting in an unusual manner for a campaign that claims he was legitimately elected.Officials in Wisconsin are preparing to conduct a full statewide recount of the votes from the 2016 election after a request was filed by Jill Stein.
She s vowed to follow through with Michigan and Pennsylvania as well.
Three precincts in Wisconsin have already had to revise their vote totals.
As it happens, more votes were counted than ballots cast.Conway called the Hillary Clinton campaign a pack of sore losers on Saturday.
And on Sunday, Conway said Trump has been gracious by not prosecuting Clinton while the recount is underway.On #CNNSOTU Kellyanne Conway says Trump has been "gracious" by not prosecuting Clinton while recount underway https://t.co/HqwIHYGUis State of the Union (@CNNSotu) November 27, 2016First off, Presidents do not prosecute people, at least not in a democracy.
Secondly, Clinton has not been charged with any crimes.
Thirdly, the money raised for the recount efforts wasn t because of the Clinton campaign.
Jill Stein and Hillary Clinton are two different people.Next, Conway will threaten Stein with prosecution.
Trump supporters threatened an armed revolt if Hillary Clinton won the election.
They openly talked to reporters at rallies with threats of assassinating Clinton if Trump lost.
All we want is a recount to be sure it was a fair election.As Hillary Clinton s campaign counsel said in a statement, It is a fundamental principle of our democracy to ensure that every vote is properly counted.
What is Team Trump so worried about?
Trump said the election would be rigged and openly called for the Russians to hack Clinton s emails.Hillary Clinton now leads the popular vote by 2.2 million, and that number is expected to continue to increase._____________________________________________________________________________________Featured image via screen capture
