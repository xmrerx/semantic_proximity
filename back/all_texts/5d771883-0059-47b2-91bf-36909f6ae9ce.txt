HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai is back in a South African hospital for a medical review, nearly two weeks after he returned home from that country, his spokesman said on Friday, denying reports that he was critically ill. Tsvangirai, who suffered severe vomiting after a party meeting and was in September airlifted to a Johannesburg hospital where he spent nearly a month receiving treatment and recuperating.
He returned to Zimbabwe on Oct. 13 but has not been seen in public since.
He came back knowing full well he would return for a review and he went for the review as scheduled, Luke Tamborinyoka, Tsvangirai s spokesman said.
He could not say when he expected Tsvangirai back.
Tsvangirai s illness has divided the opposition, with some senior party officials saying the former trade unionist should consider stepping down to make way for a younger and fit leader.
Tsvangirai, 65, declared last year that he was receiving treatment for colon cancer.
Despite the illness, he is leading an opposition alliance to challenge 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe in elections next year.
