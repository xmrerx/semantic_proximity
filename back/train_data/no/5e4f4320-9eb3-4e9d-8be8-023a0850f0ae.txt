warsaw ( reuters ) - poland s ruling pis party and president andrzej duda say they are closer to a compromise on overhauling the judiciary , an issue that has divided the once close political allies and worried the european union .
in july duda , who was backed by pis , the law and justice party , in the 2015 presidential election , unexpectedly vetoed the ruling party s judicial reform proposals following nationwide protests and warnings from poland s western allies about politicization of the courts .
the veto raised questions about whether pis would uphold its support for duda in the next presidential election .
in september the president made counter-proposals which still envisaged greater political control over the courts but to be exercised by the president and not by the justice minister , as well as parliament .
lawmakers from both pis and opposition parties criticized the president s proposals , but since then duda and pis leader jaroslaw kaczynski have met to discuss the reform , struggling to reach a compromise .
after the latest meeting , which ended on friday , representatives of both sides said compromise was nearing .
law and justice has made huge concessions when it comes to the judiciary reform .
( ... ) i think that we are close to an agreement , a pis spokeswoman told broadcasters .
she added that pis agreed on duda s proposal that parliament will need a three-fifths majority to appoint new top judges as well as to reduce the influence of the justice minister on courts .
duda s top aide krzysztof szczerski was quoted as saying by the state-run news agency pap that the meeting with kaczynski was a step towards achieving a shared , compromise version of the judiciary reforms within the boundaries of the bills recently submitted to parliament by the president .
