Donald Trump had a prime opportunity to take advantage of Britain s decision to leave the European Union in the so-called Brexit.
Appearing at his golf course in Scotland, Trump held a press conference a few hours after the outcome of the British referendum was clear.Instead, the presumptive Republican nominee completely botched the media availability.
Instead of talking up his sympathies with the right-wing movement that got the referendum passed, Trump instead babbled on about his golf course, the views from the course, and so forth.
When he was asked about the Brexit, Trump continued to bumble.
He could only talk about the tumbling global markets from the perspective of how his golf course would make money, instead ignoring the pensions being wiped out in the U.K. and the effect it could have on the American economy, including retirees with their money in the market.In response, Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign released a devastating web video that laid out the seriousness of the moment and Trump s utter failure to present any sort of leadership.Hours after the #BrexitVote, Donald Trump was in the U.K.Talking about how he, personally, would benefit.https://t.co/YEt5LozDpt Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) June 24, 2016The video also makes it clear how lost Trump is without his teleprompter.
After the media fell over itself to praise him for reading properly earlier in the week, it s also clear that Trump actually has the problem the right has accused President Obama of having for so long.When off teleprompter, Trump makes a fool of himself.
He can t back up what he s saying, and more often than not he is obviously, blatantly, comically, making things up.
The only time Trump can appear remotely competent is when his words are written down for him.Unfortunately for him, he has to focus so much on keeping it in check on prompter that he loses all the enthusiasm and rabble-rousing that has made him so popular with nativist supporters during the campaign.
They don t want to see Trump acting presidential, but rather they want the loudmouth who bashes immigrants and calls for minorities to be beat up.Featured image via Twitter
