who knew former cnn anchor piers morgan would criticize msnbc s chris matthews !
matthews keeps comparing the trump family to the former royal family of russia the romanovs.it s not just one passing comment but several !
the russian royal family lived a lavish life before being lined up and shot by the incoming communists .
it s a horrific story and matthews keeps comparing the trumps to the tragic royal family .
liberal lunacy ! morgan ripped into the lunacy of the matthews theory about trump : we re expected to believe that donald trump and vladimir putin get together , and they plan the mass murder of children to make some kind of point that they re no longer best buddies .
really ?
really ?
we think this a legitimate conspiracy theory flying ?

the romanovs were all slaughtered at the start of what would become the communist soviet union .
whatever your view of the romanovs , that s not really a comparison i don t think anyone in the american media should be making about the trump family , he said .
what are we supposed to deduce from that comment that , somehow , jared , ivanka , and donald are all going to be murdered by communists ?
hannity said the media is at a new low for how they portray trump and his family , including his 10-year-old son barron and wife melania.matthews has repeatedly compared the two families over the last couple months .
matthews likened president donald trump s daughter ivanka and his son-in-law jared kushner s white house roles to the romanovs last week .
he also asked on inauguration day why the trump family reminded him of the romanovs.via : wfb
