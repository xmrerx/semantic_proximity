Unidentified man helping to organize protests in suburbs tells Mark Barber of WSOC: We need to go where the immediate threat is at.
Whether it s a threat or not, I just want us to go to the area where the gentleman lives, so we can actually have the people with the money be concerned about the people without the money.
Reporter: So you plan to protest in the suburbs?
Man being interviewed: Yes.
Cuz I figure if we go hit them in their area, then they ll be more potent (?)
to what s going on in our area.
LISTEN | Protesters say this isn't the end.
They plan to take protests to wealthy areas of Charlotte next.
