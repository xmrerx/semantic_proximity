moscow ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump has lit the wick of war with north korea and his country will be made to pay with a hail of fire , a russian news agency quoted north korea s foreign minister as saying on wednesday .
tensions between north korea and the united states have risen in recent weeks over pyongyang s nuclear weapons and missile programs .
north korea has test-fired several missiles and conducted what it said was a test explosion of a hydrogen bomb as it advances toward its goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the u.s. mainland .
speaking to russia s state-run tass news agency , north korean foreign minister ri yong ho said his country s nuclear program guaranteed peace and safety in the region and would not be a matter of discussion .
with his bellicose and insane statement at the united nations , trump , you can say , has lit the wick of a war against us , tass quoted ri as saying .
we need to settle the final score , only with a hail of fire , not words .
ri has previously called trump president evil and his comments are likely to fuel an escalating war of words between the u.s. president and north korean leader kim jong un .
we have almost reached the last point on the journey toward our final goal - to achieve a real balance of power with the united states , he said .
our principal position is that we will never agree to any talks in which our nuclear weapons will be the subject of negotiations .
