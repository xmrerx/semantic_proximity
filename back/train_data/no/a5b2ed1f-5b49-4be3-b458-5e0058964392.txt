harare ( reuters ) - zimbabwe s president robert mugabe said on saturday he may make changes to his cabinet next week , at a time of rising tensions within his ruling party over who will eventually takeover from him .
mugabe told a meeting of the ruling zanu-pf youth wing in harare that it was time to review the performance of his cabinet ministers .
the last cabinet reshuffle was in september 2015 when mugabe was removing allies of his former deputy joice mujuru , whom he fired in december 2014 over accusations that she was plotting to topple him .
she denied the allegations .
next week there might be some changes in government .
should we remain with the same team or we make changes or even discard some .
so that exercise i will be doing it and early next week you will get the results , mugabe told a meeting of his zanu-pf youth wing .
vice president emmerson mnangagwa , a frontrunner to take over from mugabe , said on thursday he had been poisoned in august when he fell ill and was airlifted to south africa , which earned him a public rebuke from first lady grace mugabe .
zanu-pf is divided into two camps , one supporting mnangagwa to succeed mugabe and another rallying behind grace .
mugabe also castigated his senior party officials for fighting in public , saying this would weaken zanu-pf and embolden the opposition ahead of elections next year .
and the public insults , its a shame .
a shame even to our legend because our party was not built on that basis .
a party which has learnt that if we are divided then we become the food of vultures outside , mugabe said .
