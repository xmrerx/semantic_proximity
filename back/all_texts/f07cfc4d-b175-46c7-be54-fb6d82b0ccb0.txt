Chick-fil-A is in the news again and it s more of the same push for political correctness and the rights of the left to not be offended by just about everything.
The LGBT crowd seems to be offended by everything under the sun and Chick-fil-A s views against gay marriage are especially upsetting to this special group.The fast food chain s reputation as a supporter of traditional marriage has drawn another series of boycott threats, this time from the Denver city council.
The council is currently debating whether or not to sign a contract with the restaurant for a spot at Denver International Airport.From the Denver Post:Councilman Paul Lopez called opposition to the chain at DIA really, truly a moral issue on the city.
His position comes despite ardent assurances from the concessionaires who have operated other DIA restaurants that strict nondiscrimination policies will include protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity.Robin Kniech, the council s first openly gay member, said she was most worried about a local franchise generating corporate profits used to fund and fuel discrimination.
She was first to raise Chick-fil-A leaders politics during a Tuesday committee hearing.The normally routine process of approving an airport concession deal has taken a rare political turn.
The Business Development Committee on Tuesday stalled the seven-year deal with a new franchisee of the popular chain for two weeks.Should the committee reject the lease, an individual member if one is willing could introduce the concession deal in the full council.
Ten of the 13 members attended Tuesday s meeting, and none rose to defend Chick-fil-A, although some didn t weigh in.
We can do better than this brand in Denver at our airport, in my estimation, new member Jolon Clark said.
