President Obama spoke to reporters at the close of the fourth Nuclear Security Summit in Washington, D.C. about Republican frontrunner Donald Trump s statements regarding his advocacy for the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
Trump had stated earlier in the week that more countries should have nuclear weapons, including Japan and South Korea.
He also suggested that the US should get rid of 70 years of arms negotiations and agreements.
Here s what President Obama had to say about Trump s comments: The person who made the statements doesn t know much about foreign policy or nuclear policy or the Korean Peninsula or the world generally.
The president made his statement about Trump in a way that was serious, but at the same time with a tone that seemed to indicate that he thought Trump was an absolute moron.
In reference to America s nuclear umbrella for Japan and South Korea, the president said that it is: One of the cornerstones of our presence in the Asia-Pacific.
It has prevented the possibilities of a nuclear escalation and conflict.
You don t mess with that.
It s an investment that rests on the sacrifices that our men and women made.
We don t want someone in the Oval Office who doesn t recognize how important that is.
One can only imagine what the president s thoughts are on what the Republicans have to offer for a GOP nominee: There s the creepy Ted Cruz and there s crazy Trump.
At this point in the game the president probably is both humored and alarmed at the choices.Watch video here:Pres.
