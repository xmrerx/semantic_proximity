It s certainly not a stretch to say that this is part of why we have Obama.
The media has become the National Enquirer with reports on idiotic items like the one below that does nothing but dumb down Americans.
Please make an effort to contact your local news station if they report on items like this.
There are plenty of news items without this type of story even making it on the news.
This is also a HUGE reason why Americans and people around the world are turning to the NEW MEDIA with Twitter, Facebook and blogs that report what the news doesn t or won t. If you d like to speak up against this particular news station here s the contact information to e-mail or call: WTKRNorfolk, VIRGINIA (Scroll down for video) A woman in Virginia was arrested Tuesday after having sex with her unconscious boyfriend in the parking lot of a shopping center.36-year-old Kimberly M.
