Former Senator Jim DeMint speaks up in the WSJ about the obscene salaries the higher ups at PBS and NPR are getting:When presidents of government-funded broadcasting are making more than the president of the United States, it s time to get the government out of public broadcasting.While executives at the Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) and National Public Radio (NPR) are raking in massive salaries, the organizations are participating in an aggressive lobbying effort to prevent Congress from saving hundreds of millions of dollars each year by cutting their subsidies.The so-called commercial free public airwaves have been filled with pleas for taxpayer cash.
The Association of Public Television Stations has hired lobbyists to fight the cuts.
Hundreds of taxpayer-supported TV, radio and Web outlets have partnered with an advocacy campaign to facilitate emails and phone calls to Capitol Hill for the purpose of telling members of Congress, Public broadcasting funding is too important to eliminate!
PBS President Paula Kerger even recorded a personal television appeal that told viewers exactly how to contact members of Congress in order to let your representative know how you feel about the elimination of funding for public broadcasting.
But if PBS can pay Ms. Kerger $632,233 in annual compensation as reported on the 990 tax forms all nonprofits are required to file surely it can operate without tax dollars Meanwhile, highly successful, brand-name public programs like Sesame Street make millions on their own.
Sesame Street, for example, made more than $211 million from toy and consumer product sales from 2003-2006.
Sesame Workshop President and CEO Gary Knell received $956,513 in compensation in 2008.
With earnings like that, Big Bird doesn t need the taxpayers to help him compete against the Nickleodeon cable channel s Dora the Explorer.Read more: WSJ
