by the truth houndin the words of abc news anchor david muir , president trump s press secretary , sean spicer , set off a searing firestorm with rather awkward comments during a press conference comparing syria s leader bashar al assad to adolph hitler.on tuesday , april 11 , spicer said that even hitler didn t stoop to using chemical weapons like assad allegedly did on april 4 .
only two days later , with the facts on the ground still not clear , the u.s. launched a reported 59 cruise missiles at syria to punish assad s alleged chemical attack .
spicer clarified , however , that he meant that the sarin gas attributed to assad didn t exist in hitler s day , and that assad used sarin gas in a weaponized-projectile form against his own people , or so it seems.spicer then apologized , admitting that his assad-hitler comparison was an awkward mistake .
yet abc news wouldn t let it go , saying over and over again that spicer s highly insensitive comments on syria trivialized nazi germany s gas chambers in wwii .
so , the firestorm of controversy , while some jewish figures complained about spicer s remarks , came from abc s own hype , blowing spicer s brief comment totally out of proportion .
complaints are not necessarily a firestorm , which is a very loaded word.and like usual , big media like abc , which heatedly equated spicer s clunky comments with an alleged outright denial of the jewish holocaust in the second world war , can t seem to find the real story.the real issues at handmainly , there s still no solid proof that syria s leader used chemical weapons against his own people .
therefore , it was completely unnecessary for spicer to compare assad with hitler in the first place , because the jury is still out on assad.when congressman thomas massie of kentucky ( r ) tried to explain to cnn that syrian forces may have mistakenly hit a terrorist-controlled ammo dump that could have contained some kind of gas shells , cnn acted like massie was a loon .
