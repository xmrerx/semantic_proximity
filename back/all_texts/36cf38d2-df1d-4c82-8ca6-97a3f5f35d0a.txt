Beyonce gets political in her graphic anti-cop performance at the MTV VMAs last night.
The MTV awards use to be a fun-filled night of entertainment but now it s a chance for political activism to take center stage.
Prior to the show, Beyonce met with the Michael Brown s mom and other moms of people killed by police officers.
We guess she forgot about the fact that all of these cases are legitimate cases of crimes being committed by the deceased.
The truth is way too buried because it s more profitable for the truth to be twisted.
Where were the families of police officers like the Dallas officers murdered in cold blood?
Nope, Beyonce had to stick with a lie and be the political activist she always has been.
Remember the Super Bowl?
Yes, that was where she had her dancers form an X on the field in support of the Black Panthers fist raised in the air and all.
I have one thing to say about all of this While performing a medley of songs from her hit album, Lemonade, the pop megastar was surrounded by backup dancers dressed as angels.
However, as red lights flooded the stage, each of the angels was shot down during the performance, which viewers said was a representation of police brutality.
The imagery of the Beyonce performance with the angels getting shot down , one person tweeted.
Beyonce too deep.
