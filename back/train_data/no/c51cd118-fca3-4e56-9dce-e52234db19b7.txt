tokyo ( reuters ) - japan accepted just three refugees in the first half of 2017 despite receiving a record 8,561 fresh asylum applications , the government said on tuesday , highlighting the nation s reluctance to accept foreigners .
only four refugees were accepted in the first half of 2016 , when fresh asylum applications totaled 5,011 , the justice ministry said .
the human rights watch in january described japan s record on asylum seekers as abysmal .
unlike other industrialized nations , which have accepted or even encouraged immigration to refresh their labor force , japan has remained unwelcoming , even though its shrinking , aging population is a key reason behind the economy s slow growth .
supporters of japan s tough asylum process argue that the small number accepted is a consequence of a surge in bogus applications due to changes made to rules in 2010 allowing applicants to work after six months until a decision is made on their claims .
there appears to have been an increase in the number of people who are abusing the refugee status process , said yasuhiro hishida , an official who reviews applications at the justice ministry .
