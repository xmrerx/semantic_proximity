No word yet on when every female London resident will be asked to wear a hijab in public, so as not to offend the exploding Muslim population Sadiq Khan, London s first Muslim mayor, announced Monday that body shaming advertisements will no longer be allowed in London s public transport.
As the father of two teenage girls, I am extremely concerned about this kind of advertising which can demean people, particularly women, and make them ashamed of their bodies.
It is high time it came to an end, Khan said.No one's confidence or body image should be undermined by ads on our transport system.
I've strengthened @TfL policy https://t.co/AJ7qYDQW0T Mayor of London (@MayorofLondon) June 13, 2016Here are just a few Twitter (not G-rated) responses that the Mayor got to his tweet above:The mayor added, Nobody should feel pressurised, while they travel on the Tube or bus, into unrealistic expectations surrounding their bodies and I want to send a clear message to the advertising industry about this.
Khan was not clear in what would determine which ads would be banned, as it doesn t include all images of people in underwear or swimming clothes.
Most underwear and bikini models though can be assumed to have non-average bodies.
