A tape featuring Donald Trump proudly boasting about sexually assaulting women has rocked the GOP this weekend.
Former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is trying to brush it off as no big deal, arguing that men just talk like that.
But CNN s Jake Tapper did not let him get away with this pathetic excuse.Appearing on State of the Union this Sunday morning, the former NYC mayor tried in vain to convince everybody that this was just locker talk and voters should still support Trump, even if he does brag about grabbing women by the p*ssy.
This is talk, and gosh almighty, he who hasn t sinned, throw the first stone, Giuliani said of Trump s remarks on the leaked tape from 2005.Tapper cut him off and slammed Giuliani s bullshit argument.
Mr. Mayor, I have never said that.
I have never done that, Tapper said.
I am happy to throw a stone.
I have been in locker rooms, I have been a member of a fraternity.
I have never heard any man, ever, brag about being able to maul women because they get away with it.
Giuliani wasn t dissuaded and continued to insist that this is just how men are.
The fact is men, at times, talk like that.
Not all men.
Tapper asked the former mayor if he had ever said these kinds of things, but Giuliani just kept talking and pretended not to have heard the question.
Giuliani then insisted: I m not justifying it.
But he also never denied having made comments like this himself.Earlier in the interview, Giuliani said that Trump had apologized for his behavior and was likely to do so again during the upcoming debate on Sunday night.
He apologized for them, he said that he was wrong, that doesn t reflect the way he looks at things today, Giuliani said.
He made a full and complete apology for it, and I think he s going to do it again tonight.
