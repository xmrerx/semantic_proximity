PARIS (Reuters) - France on Wednesday reiterated a call for the Spanish government to be left to resolve the secession crisis in the northern region of Catalonia within the framework of Spain s constitution.
We call for discussions within the framework of the Spanish constitution, French government spokesman Christophe Castaner told reporters.
It is not France s place to take a stand on Spain s internal affairs, he added.
French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday that the European Union should not mediate in Spain s worst political crisis since an attempted coup in 1981.
