LONDON (Reuters) - Language suggesting that Britain should be punished for leaving the European Union is regrettable , as are any suggestions from London that officials do not want to negotiate a Brexit deal, trade minister Liam Fox said on Wednesday.
Answering questions from lawmakers, Fox also said it was inconceivable that the open skies agreement between the United States and the EU would not continue to include Britain once it has left the bloc in March 2019.
