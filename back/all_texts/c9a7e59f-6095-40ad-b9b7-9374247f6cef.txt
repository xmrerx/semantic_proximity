Donald Trump supporters have taken it upon themselves to try and throw Texas senator Ted Cruz out of the presidential race by filing a lawsuit against him.The lawsuit, which was filed on February 3rd at a district court in Alabama, questions if Cruz is even eligible to run for president, considering that he was born in Canada.
The lawsuit cites Article II, Section 1 of the Constitution, which states that no person except a natural born citizen, or a citizen of the United States, at the time of the adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the office of president.
The plaintiffs of the lawsuit are Sebastian Green, Shannon Duncan, Kathryn Spears, Kyle Spears and Jerry Parker, all residents of Cullman County as well as loyal fans of The Donald.
In the suit, the plaintiffs declared that Rafael Edward Cruz is ineligible to qualify/run/seek and be elected to the Office of the President of the United States of America.
Thomas Drake, the attorney representing the group, explained: Mr. Cruz was born in Canada, and obviously Canada is not a territory or protectorate of the United States, it s not dominion of the United States.
And as such, when he was born, at the moment of his birth, location determined his status, and his status was that of a natural-born Canadian citizen.
You cannot be a natural-born or native-born citizen of two countries.
Birther lawsuit against Ted CruzTwitterTrump has long been raising concern about Cruz s natural born status before, in almost the same way he did in 2011 when he went after President Barack Obama s birth certificate, claiming that that Barack wasn t a United States citizen.TwitterTed and Cruz will face each other again on Saturday, and the air between them will surely be even more tense, as the Trump has won the New Hampshire primary and Cruz took the Iowa caucuses.
