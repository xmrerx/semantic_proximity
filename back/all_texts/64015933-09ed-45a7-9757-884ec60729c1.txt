It s a pretty well-known fact among those who use their brains to make rational decisions that both Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are equally repugnant, but for different reasons (and some of the same reasons).
They are both extremely bad choices for the United States, and neither should ever set foot in the Oval Office.
Both are war hawks, both are anti-immigrant, which is ironic considering Ted Cruz is and immigrant and so is Trump s wife, and both men don t have any real plans to put in place that would actually be good for the nation.Trump is a bully with zero experience, and Cruz is a smarmy salesman with the bare minimum of experience.
So, when watching a Trump supporter confront Ted Cruz in Indiana, it wasn t exactly a meeting of the minds.
It was Cruz going after Trump, and Trump s supporter shouting short bursts of propaganda that have been continuously repeated by the Trump campaign.The video is extremely awkward to watch, but at the same time you can t look away.
It truly is that much of a disaster.My favorite line from the whole skirmish is when Cruz says: With all respect, Donald Trump is deceiving you, playing you for a chump.
It s funny, because it s true, but also ironic, since Cruz is also playing everyone for a fool as well.
Cruz s remarks were met with a bunch of random Lyin Ted shouts from the Trump minion, along with Indiana don t want you and where is your Goldman Sachs jacket?
clearly unaware he s supporting a big money tycoon himself.Here s a quick highlight from the unsettling confrontation:.
