Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky announced Wednesday he is suspending his presidential campaign.
Although, today I will suspend my campaign for president, the fight is far from over, Mr. Paul said in a statement.
I will continue to carry the torch for Liberty in the United States Senate and I look forward to earning the privilege to represent the people of Kentucky for another term.
Leisa and I had the privilege of hearing Rand Paul speak on Mackinac Island in Sept, 2015.
We videotaped his speech and hope you ll take a few minutes to hear what he felt were the most important issues America faces today.
He turned a room full of Republicans who were talking amongst themselves and barely interested in what he had to say, to a crowd of people who were totally engaged within minutes of his powerful speech.
He won the crowd over that night and went on to win the straw poll which included every GOP Presidential candidate, many of whom attended the same event.
We wanted to share this with you, as we believe Rand Paul brings up some very important points.
Love him or hate him, Paul is a true patriot who clearly loves this country.
He will be missed by many and we believe he was, and will continue to be an important voice in conservative politics.Mr.
Paul finished fifth in the Iowa caucuses earlier this week.
Across the country thousands upon thousands of young people flocked to our message of limited government, privacy, criminal justice reform and a reasonable foreign policy, he said.
Brushfires of Liberty were ignited, and those will carry on, as will I.
