Ivanka Trump decided on Tuesday evening to send out a tweet in honor of World Refuge Day, and once again, she apparently forgot who her father is.
On #WorldRefugeeDay we remember the plight & courage of the 22 million+ refugees globally.
We must work to restore peace & end this crisis, she wrote, seemingly oblivious to the cruel and bigoted stance her own father has taken against refugees.On #WorldRefugeeDay we remember the plight & courage of the 22 million+ refugees globally.
