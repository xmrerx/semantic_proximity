dakar ( reuters ) - suspected christian militias killed an egyptian u.n. peacekeeper and wounded three others in an attack in southern central african republic on sunday , the united nations said in a statement .
the attack , which the united nations said was carried out by anti-balaka militants , occurred in gambo , about 100 km ( 60 miles ) from the town of bangassou where more than 100 civilians and three moroccan peacekeepers were killed in separate incidents in may and july .
conflict has killed thousands in central african republic since muslim seleka rebels ousted president francois bozize in 2013 , provoking a backlash from the christian anti-balaka militia .
violence spiked when former colonial power france ended its peacekeeping mission last year .
since then , the united nations 13,000-strong central african republic mission , known as minusca , has struggled to restore order to a country where government control barely extends beyond the capital bangui .
in total , 13 minusca peacekeepers have been killed in the country this year alone .
five militants were also killed during sunday s clash , the united nations said .
