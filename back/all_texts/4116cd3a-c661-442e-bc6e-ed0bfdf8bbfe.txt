Thanks to Judicial Watch for exposing the Clinton Grifters for who they REALLY are con artists!
Hillary wouldn t see the prince via regular channels but once he donated the money she met with him!Newly released Department of State documents reveal that the Crown Prince of Bahrain was given an audience with then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton after he donated $32 million to her foundation.The documents, released Monday by Judicial Watch, included emails between Clinton Foundation executive Doug Band and former Clinton State Department aide Huma Abedin, which appear to show that Abedin acted as a middleman between Clinton and her foundation s donors.Band and Abedin s email exchanges show that Bahrain s Crown Prince Salman had to go through the Clinton Foundation in order to set up a meeting with Clinton after the former Secretary of State declined to meet after official requests were made.
The first email, dated June 23, 2009, shows Band interceding on behalf of the Crown Prince, noting he is a good friend of ours.
Abedin replied that same day noting that Salman had asked to see Clinton through normal channels, but it appears Clinton was not interested.
A later email, dated June 25, 2009, from Abedin to Band offers Salman a 10 A.M. meeting with Clinton.
Abedin said she reached out [through] official channels to secure the meeting.Read more: Daily Caller
