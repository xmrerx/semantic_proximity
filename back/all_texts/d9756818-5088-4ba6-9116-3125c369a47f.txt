The interview after the finger wagging was great!
Lilly basically said the Russian swimmer s record of not passing the drug test was not cool .
Soooo Lilly went out today and kicked some Russian booty The American beat Yulia Efimova in the 100-meter breaststroke and set an Olympic record, too a night after she called out the Russian for bragging after failing a drug test.Efimova was .57 seconds behind King, who finished in 1 minute, 4.93 seconds.
American Katie Meili won bronze[ ]King s victory made a statement, too.
Asked if she thought the win made a statement to Efimova, King said: I hope I did, that we can still compete clean.
