Now, you d think after calling Mexicans rapists and murderers, Donald Trump would have the Latino community bending over backwards to support him, but alas, they just don t seem to like him very much.
Wonder why?
It s really a thinker.In fact, Trump holds a 77% unfavorable rating with the Latino community, and Hillary Clinton is currently leading by 48 points among Hispanic voters.So, what s a guy to do at the Republican National Convention to show the world watching at home that Latinos really want Trump after all?
Play make-believe!Sure, out of the 2,482 delegates in attendance at the RNC 133 were Latino, but for the cameras, that s not nearly enough, sooooo have white people hold up Latinos Para Trump signs!
!Which is even incorrect grammar, it should have read Latinos Por Trump, but I digress.
They probably didn t have anyone to ask.Here are some of the Latinos right here:Seems to me like some of these Texas delegates w/ Latinos for Trump signs are not Latino someone is passing them out pic.twitter.com/z8KuCdyqny Eliza Collins (@elizacollins1) July 22, 2016RNC botches grammar on Spanish sign claiming Hispanics support Trump: https://t.co/tpUZ9xfvBa pic.twitter.com/5nEpx2y9A9 The Hill (@thehill) July 22, 2016Stupid cameras getting too close to show what s actually going on.
Someone s gonna get fired for sure.In reality, this is the general reaction from the Latino community, although, I m sure there are some who genuinely like Trump.
"Latinos for Trump" BISH WHERE???
