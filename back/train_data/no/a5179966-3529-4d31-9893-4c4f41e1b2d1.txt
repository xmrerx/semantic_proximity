zimbabwe ( reuters ) - a zimbabwean court has postponed to thursday the bail hearing of former finance minister ignatius chombo , who is facing charges of corruption dating back two decades .
chombo , who did not appear at the court on wednesday , was detained after the military seized power in operation restore legacy mid-november , which it said was meant to remove criminals around former president robert mugabe .
the high court had been due to sit on wednesday to hear chombo s appeal against a lower court ruling last week denying him bail pending his trial on dec. 8 , but the state prosecutor said he needed time to prepare his case .
this is the second time the court has postponed the hearing after an initial sitting on friday was delayed for the same reasons .
his lawyer says chombo will deny the allegations at his trial .
chombo was among members of the g40 political faction allied to 93-year-old mugabe and his wife , grace , who were also expelled from the ruling zanu-pf party .
ousted zanu-pf youth league leader kudzanai chipanga s bail hearing was also postponed to thursday .
chipanga is facing charges of making statements undermining public confidence in the military which helped end mugabe s 37-year rule .
some supporters of new president emmerson mnangagwa have called for unspecified action against g40 but the president has urged citizens not to undertake any form of vengeful retribution .
mnangagwa , who was sworn in on nov. 24 , and is under pressure to root out rampant corruption stifling the economy .
last week , he opened a three-month amnesty window for the return of public funds illegally stashed abroad by individuals and companies .
upon the expiry of the amnesty at end of february next year , the government will arrest and prosecute those who have failed to comply , he said in a statement .
