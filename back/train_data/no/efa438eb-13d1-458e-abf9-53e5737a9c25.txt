copenhagen ( reuters ) - denmark will no longer automatically accept a quota of refugees under a u.n. resettlement program after passing a law on wednesday that enables the government to determine how many can enter each year .
since 1989 , denmark has agreed to take 500 refugees a year selected by the united nations under a program to ease the burden on countries that neighbor war zones .
but after the european migration crisis in 2015 brought almost 20,000 claims for asylum , denmark has refused to take any u.n. quota refugees .
under the new law , the immigration minister will decide how many refugees will be allowed under the u.n. program , with 500 now the maximum except in an exceptional situation .
it s hard to predict how many refugees and migrants will show up at the border to seek asylum , and we know it may be hard to integrate those who arrive here , immigration and integration minister inger stojberg said last month when her ministry proposed the law .
the opposition social-liberal party said opting out of the u.n. program would increase pressure on countries already accommodating large numbers of refugees , and the move could encourage other countries to follow suit .
last year , more than 6,000 people claimed asylum in denmark .
between january and november this year just over 3,000 people did .
( corrects throughout to show new law only applies to u.n. resettlement quota , not other refugee applications . )
