berlin ( reuters ) - german chancellor angela merkel and her social democrat challenger , martin schulz are still fighting hard for every vote as sunday s national election nears , but they do have one thing common : neither is a gambler .
merkel , asked by the mass circulation newspaper bild what she would do if she won millions of euros in the lotto lottery , said , i personally don t play lotto .
the conservative leader , a trained physicist and daughter of a pastor who grew up in the former communist east , merkel told the paper she donated any money that she won in awards and prizes to charitable groups .
schulz , the former european parliament president who never went to college , said he also didn t gamble .
i ve never played lotto in my life , he told bild .
i never wanted to leave the question of my success in life up to chance or a lottery drum .
the two politicians also share similar views on prayer .
merkel , asked if she prayed to win the election , said she didn t pray for such concrete political results , adding : prayers are a very personal matter .
schulz , whose party is trailing merkel s conservatives by double digits , echoed that view .
politicians always have to know that there s something greater than their own success .
