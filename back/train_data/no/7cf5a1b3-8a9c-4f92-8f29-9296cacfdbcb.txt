san francisco ( reuters ) - a california lawmaker next week will introduce a bill requiring 15 percent of all vehicles sold in the state to be emissions-free by 2025 , her spokeswoman said on friday .
assemblywoman autumn burke says the legislation is needed to ensure that california ’ s current zero emissions vehicle target is met with actual vehicles and not just clean car credits , which environmentalists claim have flooded the market .
“ governor ( jerry ) brown has set an ambitious goal of 1.5 million electric vehicles by 2025 , but unless we take action , the state won ’ t come close to meeting this goal , ” said burke , who represents the city of inglewood in car-centric los angeles county .
“ that ’ s why we need to reform the rules to require that 15 percent of all cars sold in california have zero emissions by 2025 .
this is about clean cars , not credits , ” she said in a statement to reuters .
the bill will require the california air resources board to adopt a regulation by the end of next year to reach the 15 percent goal .
carb has for years operated a zero emission vehicles program , which has helped the state achieve its current level of about 200,000 zevs on the road .
but a complex system of clean car credits , designed to give automakers flexibility in meeting the sales target , has led to a glut of credits , according to experts .
environmental groups like the natural resources defense council and electric car manufacturer tesla motors told carb at a recent meeting that auto companies may be able to reach the state ’ s target by simply submitting credits , and said changes to the program ’ s credit system are required .
about 4 percent of vehicles sold in california are zero emissions vehicles , which include full battery electric , hydrogen fuel cell , and plug-in hybrids .
the nrdc estimates that under the current rules and credit system , california would have only 6 percent of all vehicles emission-free by 2025 .
