One of Donald Trump s top campaign officials has once again made a gross sexist comment while defending the nominee.
Appearing on CNN to discuss the large group of women who have accused Trump of unwanted sexual advances and misconduct, Trump attorney Michael Cohen told the host that the women in question aren t even women he d be attracted to.
It was disgusting.Michael Cohen says Trump was saying accusers are "not someone he would be attracted to" so that makes the claims "nonsense" pic.twitter.com/2Kn2sUuPDe Colin Jones (@colinjones) October 18, 2016 Beauty is in the eye of beholder these aren t even women he d be attracted to, Cohen said of Trump in a CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday.That line follows a recurring argument Trump has been making on the campaign trail that some of the women who accused him of groping, kissing, and manhandling them were not attractive and therefore are not telling the truth.Cohen went on to say, I think what Mr. Trump is really trying to say is that they re not somebody that he would be attracted to, and therefore, the whole thing is nonsense.
The ongoing controversy over Trump s behavior and comments have helped to damage his already failing campaign.
Every serious national poll now shows Trump behind from anywhere from 4% to 12%.Nobody has ever returned from a deficit that large in the history of presidential polling, and the same average that shows Clinton now well ahead correctly foresaw the winner of the last four presidential elections.Women have been key to Trump s collapse.
While a slight majority of men back Trump, Clinton s advantage with women has consistently been 11% and higher, even before the latest round of revelations.In addition to rejecting his current behavior, women responding to the pollsters have said that his dismissive attitude towards them has contributed to Clinton s support.The poll drop also comes as Trump spent days attacking former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, in what was seen as a continuation of his fat-shaming of her in the 1990s.Featured image via screen capture
