hysterical ! a us marine enters the catholic church confessional booth in jacksonville , fl.he tells the priest , bless me , father , for i have sinned .
last night , i beat the s * * t out of a flag burning hillary supporter .
the priest says , my son , i am here to forgive your sins , not to discuss your community service .
