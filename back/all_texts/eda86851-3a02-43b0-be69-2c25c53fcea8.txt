stood in the middle of the field and spoke to the players and coaches, as he tried to reassure them that they would recover: I know there s some people from Houston here, and the Houston area.
And I know you re going through a really tough time.
And just know that there ll be a lot of people that are gonna help, help the people down there a lot.
The country, right now, they re recovering, and so the key thing on the recovery is to keep people safe.
And then it s gonna be the rebuilding.
And if you re from that area, you d be amazed at all the people who come down there to help all kinds of people.
And so, the days are dark now, but they re gonna get better.
If anyone knows about hurricanes, and what is required to rebuild entire neighborhoods and cities, it s former President George W. Bush.
The media destroyed the former president for not acting fast enough to help the Hurricane Katrina victims where severe flooding affected residents from Gulfport, Mississippi to New Orleans, Louisiana, and areas in between.
Now the media is criticizing President Trump for visiting the victims too soon.Watch Bush s remarks here from the SMU Football Twitter account:Thank you President Bush for coming to practice today to offer support to our players from the Houston area!
