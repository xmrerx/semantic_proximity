of course tomorrow morning , the democrat party will put their heads together and after hours of damage control , they will tell americans wasserman-schultz didn t really mean what she said .
what is it about women in the democrat party ( hillary ) who don t really mean what they say ? the democratic national committee has released a statement about the shooting of 11 police officers in dallas tonight .
the shooting took place at a black lives matter protest against the deaths of alton sterling and philando castile at the hands of police this week .
in a press conference , the chief of the police department clearly said that there is no known link between the snipers and the protesters.chairwoman debbie wasserman shultz didn t get that memo .
the statement from the dnc looks like this : pay attention to that penultimate paragraph .
the last line , in particular , is noteworthy .
and while most protesters have made their voices heard peacefully , tonight s shooting of officers in dallas is unacceptable and a reminder that the time to address these tensions and find common ground is long overdue .
what are you implying here , dws ? image via : twittervia : mediate
