Many Americans are suspicious of he Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, who has strong ties to muslim extremists and was a strong supporter of Hillary.Khan has been on a Hillary supporting tour here in the United States and he is using that platform to let us know that he doesn t feel that immigrants should assimilate.Mr.
Khan insists: One of the lessons from around the world is that a laissez-faire or hands-off approach to social integration doesn t work.
We need rules, institutions, and support to enable people to integrate into cohesive communities and for the avoidance of doubt, I don t mean assimilation, I mean integration, and there s a difference.
People shouldn t have to drop their cultures and traditions when they arrive in our cities and countries .Coming from the muslim mayor who has let London go to pot with the epidemic of currently suffering from Muslim ghettoisation, horrific employment rates for Muslim women, an internal debate surrounding the banning of the burka, and ongoing issues such as female genital mutilation, anti-Semitism, and homophobia within Muslim communities.It s ironic that a man that has erased many freedoms by way of new laws such as British women not being allowed to travel over a certain distance from their addresses alone, and the banning of any sexually geared ads on the side of public transportation, i.e.
models promoting products, has the nerve to state that we should essentially allow muslims to come her and continue applying Sharia Law when their very tradition violates our Constitution.Mr.
Khan needs to go back to London with his anti-freedom rhetoric.
Americans will never allow immigrants to come here and try to impose any traditions that may be harmful to our citizens, nor will we ever allow the nationwide implementation of their archaic law.
