During an interview, Steve Bannon who is the new White House strategist under Donald Trump just referred to left-wing women as a bunch of dykes .Steve Bannon was recently appointed as a senior adviser for Trump, but he is not a good fit for the job.
He s just an egotistical blogger.
As chairman of Breitbart News he is known for his right-winged bias, which is quite clear here.
In this interview he says right-wing women are of the highest moral character while on the left we vilify women.
Incredible that he would say this, and then less than a minute later, refer to them as a bunch of dykes.
You can listen to that irony right here:There will always be some friction between the right and left, but referring to our liberal women as dykes is a little over the line, especially for the senior adviser of the White House.
Then again, look who he advises: Donald Trump, who is well-known for degrading women.
It s sad to see men like this controlling our government.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
