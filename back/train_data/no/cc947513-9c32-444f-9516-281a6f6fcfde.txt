21st century wire says science fiction is now science fact.watch a video of this report here : darpa s program director for the project says the implant is seeking to open the channel between the human brain and modern electronics .
a statement from darpa said it will enable data-transfer bandwidth between the human brain and the digital world , feeding digital auditory or visual information into the brain .
the research agency claims the project is not intended for military purposes , yet experts believe it will have many military applications .
while it could potentially restore senses to injured veterans , it could also be used to heighten the senses of perfectly healthy soldiers.moreover , let us not forget that it is the pentagon , the military s central command , whom controls the defence advanced research projects agency.either way , darpa is seeking to perfect the cyborg an individual with both organic and mechanical body parts.if this device could be used to heighten the awareness of an individual s surroundings , could it also be manipulated to present a misleading perspective on what is happening around the implanted person ? could a soldier be manipulated into believing something was happening due to a certain message being transmitted to the implant , when in actual fact something entirely different was occurring in reality ? such devices present incredibly hard questions for accountability.however , steven pinker , a cognitive scientist from harvard , is sceptical that the device could ever work : we have little to no idea how exactly the brain codes complex information my guess is that it s a waste of taxpayer dollars .
despite these concerns , darpa is pressing ahead with the project.do you think we are now a step closer to cyborg super soldiers , or just wasting $ 62 million ? learn all about military spending : 21wire military industrial complex files
