cairo ( reuters ) - president abdel fattah al-sisi said on saturday egypt will in the next two to three years embark on a $ 5.60 billion construction project in the sinai peninsula whose north has been gripped by an islamist insurgency .
while coast of the south of the peninsula is peppered with red sea tourist resorts , north sinai province is underdeveloped and lacks basic infrastructure and job opportunities .
security forces have battled islamist militants in the mainly desert region , stretching from the suez canal eastwards to the gaza strip and israel , since 2013 .
militants have killed hundreds of police and soldiers .
sisi ordered armed forces to end the insurgency within three months after an attack on a mosque in north sinai last month killed more than 300 people .
it was the worst militant attack in egypt s modern history .
we have entrusted the ministry of housing and the engineering authority with a national project of comprehensive urban planning , sisi said at a ceremony to inaugurate a development project in the suez canal city of ismailia .
the president said the project would cost 100 billion egyptian pounds and that it would be carried out whether he remained in power or not .
he did not provide a start date , sources of funding or specific details of what would be built under the project .
