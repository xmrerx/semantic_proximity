can they not find something original ?
the democrats are trying to fundraise off of donald trump s hat copycatsthe democratic congressional campaign committee ( dccc ) is trying to raise money for 2016 house races with its own version of donald trump s infamous make america great again hat.the dccc s hat comes in blue , and says make congress blue again .
unlike various outside efforts to troll trump ( make america hate again , et cetera ) , the dccc s hat seems an earnest effort to appropriate a slogan that has proven the most effective of the cycle.democrats , who need 30 seats to win the house , are ambivalent about trump .
some boast that trump would be the easiest general election opponent for hillary clinton ; he is one of the only candidates with worse approval ratings.the dccc has let it be known that it intends to tie vulnerable house republicans to trump .
you can denounce his comments but that only means so much if you would still vote for him , a dccc official told roll call recently.at the same time , democrats are quietly worried about trump s ability to motivate disaffected voters to come to the polls.in november , the democratic governors association blamed trump-mania for the surprise victory of tea party favorite matt bevin over attorney general jack conway in the race for kentucky governor : unfortunately , he ran into the unexpected headwinds of trump-mania , losing to an outsider candidate in the year of the outsider .
washington post commentator jonathan capehart has warned democrats : trump s support is deeper than we want to admit .
and if we re really being honest , we know his support doesn t just reside within the republican party .
thus , trump s i really don t give a damn mien could prove dangerous to a clinton campaign that prizes control .
