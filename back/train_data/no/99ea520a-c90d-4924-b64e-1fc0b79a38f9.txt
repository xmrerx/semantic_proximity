in a fraught moment of political protest across the country , the live mic at televised award shows has become a potent weapon.as such , grammy awards producer ken ehrlich has a message for those who will take the stage on sunday s ceremony : bring it on.ehrlich has no reservations about political messages or anti-president trump statements flying during cbs three and a half hour grammycast .
artists expressing passionate opinions about real-life issues are the stuff of memorable moments , he said .
one of the tenets of our show is artistic freedom , and over the years we ve shown we do believe in it , ehrlich told variety .
how many more times do we need to hear i d like to thank my publicist , my agent , my wife and kids .
the great acceptance speeches are ones that have a point of view and are more personal .
the only guidelines on speech that ehrlich has to keep an eye ( and ear ) on is profanity , given the potential for cbs to be hit with fcc fines if f-bombs fly before 10 p.m .
but almost everything else is fair game .
one of the things i ve learned from working with artists for 40 years is that they are deep-thinking , vital individuals who have interests that cover a broad cover a broad spectrum of subjects and passions , he said .
we should certainly allow for it on the broadcast .
ehrlich notes that the grammy awards as an institution has addressed issues of social justice and equality on the telecast in recent years .
