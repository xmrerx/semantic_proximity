We have a weak leader in our White House who s willing to be pushed around after leaving a vacuum in the Middle East for chaos.
Putin has decided he s in it for the long term and wants to have his presence strengthened in the Middle East since the U.S. has been so absent in the area.
Remember THE RED LINE?
That was a big turning point in our President s effectiveness in the area.
Obama has done NOTHING and continues to let Putin bring in his military mite to take over dominance.
So it s a win for Russia and Putin s desire to be the dominant big gun in the Middle East.
Obama has officially surrendered influence in the Middle East and Assad is staying.
Checkmate!
FOX NEWS: Russian warplanes have begun bombarding Syrian opposition targets in the war torn nation s north, working on behalf of dictator Bashar al Assad, according to a senior military official.The official said airstrikes targeted fighters in the vicinity of Homs, located roughly 60 miles east of a Russian naval facility in Tartus, and were carried out by a couple of Russian bombers.
It was not clear if the strikes targeted ISIS, Al Qaeda or other forces opposed to Assad, who Moscow is aiding.
According to a Twitter handle belonging to the Syrian government, the Russian strikes were initiated at the request of Assad.The development came after Pentagon officials brushed aside an official request from Russia to clear air space over northern Syria, where Moscow intends to conduct airstrikes against ISIS on behalf of Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad, according to sources who spoke to Fox News.The request was made by a Russian three-star general who spoke with U.S. officials at the American embassy in Baghdad, sources said.
The general, who was not identified, used the word please when delivering the verbal request, known as a demarche, according to the written transcript of the exchange.
