Seldom in life do you come across someone so dumb that they literally make you cringe, but alas, Sarah Palin is one of those people.
And if her general presence doesn t make you cringe then hearing her speak will, but if that still doesn t do it to you, just wait until you hear what she has to say.In her latest bout of idiocy, she took to her favorite pastime of posting on Facebook for her imbecilic following.
What is it that she posted this time?
Well, Palin posted an image of her new BFF Donald Trump with a quote by none other than Mahatma Gandhi.
Yes, really, that Gandhi.This is the quote she used: First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.

For Palin to equate the bombastic and racist Trump to that of not only Gandhi, but those who have long been fighting for justice, is not only inaccurate, but outright disgusting.
Trump is exactly opposite of everything Gandhi stood for.She s trying to say that no one took Trump seriously and now that he s the likely GOP nominee he may go on to win.
However, what she doesn t get, is the fact that Trump, as well as herself, are still jokes not to be taken seriously.
Their brand of politics is toxic not only to the GOP, but to the nation and the world.
Her idiocy really knows no bounds, and by equating Trump to Gandhi she proves, yet again, how truly stupid she is.Featured image: Flickr
