florida government official is serious about the bbq aroma infraction.lol !
the environmental laws are creeping into our everyday normal activities like grilling out .
big government is way out of control !
once our homes were our castles .
now they are the government s. not even the most trivial details of how we make use of our own property escapes bureaucratic regulation in the name of the environment .
for example : cobb county [ georgia ] is telling a kennesaw family to apply for permission to park their kids cars in their own driveway.the oviedo family got a notice of violation for having four cars in the driveway .
the family has relatives visiting and two kids home from college .
they got a visit friday from code enforcement , acting on an anonymous complaint .
the neighborhood is zoned an open space community .
a recent rule changed , and enacted a limit of two cars parked in the drive .
after channel 2 consumer investigator jim strickland got the county on the phone , officials decided to let the issue slide this summer , but put the family on notice next summer would require a permit to park four cars in the driveway .
i m having to pay to park on a property that i already pay tax on , said [ kim ] oviedo.but think how grateful the polar bears will be ! cobb county s open space community zoning was established to encourage the preservation of natural resources within residential development .
once environazis get their heads in your tent , you have been relegated to sleeping out on the sand .
