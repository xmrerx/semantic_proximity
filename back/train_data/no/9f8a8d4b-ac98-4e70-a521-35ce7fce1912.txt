i need you to stay alive .
the only way we re going to be able to write your story and write your book is if you stay alive .
the occupiers appear to have a separate line to the fbi , and are relaying that they ve been told no one will be allowed on to the refuge until they leave .
they want us to leave .
they said the time for concessions has passed , sandy anderson said.the details are sketchy , and the audio in parts inaudible , but it appears that one proposal is for a local figure , possibly a reverend , to join the occupiers and lead them off the site.david fry , the 27-year-old occupier from ohio , has become increasingly agitated on the live stream , shouting at fiore and his fellow protesters.fry made headlines when he posted video of himself using government computers to create a website for the occupation.according to a recent profile of fry by oregon public broadcasting ( opb ) , his antics led many in the militia to grow frustrated with him , with some wanting him to leave.fry had previously communicated with militia spokesman lavoy finicum online , and finicum had reportedly encouraged the young occupier to stay.fry s family told the radio station that he has frequently had problems with authorities .
he s had his problems , some of which he s brought on himself , his grandfather , william fry , told opb .
he gets pulled over for busted taillights , and instead of just rolling down his window and handing over his insurance , he screams at the officer , what the [ expletive ] do you want ?
and right there , a regular thing turns into him in handcuffs .
fry also often writes about conspiracy theories online.via : the guardianthe occupation at malheur started on 2 january in response to the conviction of two local ranchers on arson charges .
our explainer has more on the background to the 40-day standoff : one protester has been shot dead and eight others were arrested on tuesday after a confrontation between police and an armed group that has taken over a federal wildlife reserve in oregon.what were the circumstances of the shooting ?
the fbi said shots were fired after officers stopped a car carrying ammon bundy , the leader of the protests , and five others near the malheur national wildlife refuge .
activists said rancher robert lavoy finicum was killed , and one person wounded .
finicum , 55 , had been one of the main spokesmen for the occupation , appearing at daily news conferences , posting regular dispatches on his youtube page and organising some of the most high-profile actions protesting against the federal government s regulation of public lands .
bundy and four other senior members were taken into custody following the confrontation along highway 395 near the reserve in north-east oregon at 4.25pm local time , the fbi said .
two others were arrested later , including peter santilli , a journalist who livestreamed events at the refuge.is the standoff over ?
no .
fbi agents have set up a perimeter around the wildlife refuge , where an unknown number of people are still holding out .
one of the remaining occupiers , jason patrick , told reuters by phone that they would stay until the redress of grievances .
he said : i ve heard peaceful resolution for weeks now and now there s a cowboy who is my friend who is dead so prepare for the peaceful resolution .
how long has the occupation been going on , and why are they there ?
the takeover at malheur started on 2 january after a peaceful protest in nearby burns , oregon , over the conviction of two local ranchers on arson charges .
dwight hammond , 73 , and his son steven hammond , 46 , said they lit fires on federal land in 2001 and 2006 to reduce the growth of invasive plants and protect their property from wildfires .
the two were convicted three years ago .
but in october a federal judge ruled their terms were too short and ordered them back to prison for about four years each .
among the demands by the group is for the hammonds to be released .
but the militia have more deep-seated grievances over land under federal government control .
