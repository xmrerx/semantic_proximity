tokyo ( reuters ) - finance minister taro aso said on tuesday that japan would seek the united states ’ understanding of the strategic and economic benefits of joining the trans-pacific partnership , after president donald trump formally withdrew from the free-trade pact .
aso told reporters after a cabinet meeting that arrangements were being made for prime minister shinzo abe to visit the united states and meet trump , but that it was undecided who would accompany the premier .
fulfilling a campaign pledge to end american involvement in the 2015 pact , trump signed an executive order in the oval office pulling the united states out of the 12-nation tpp , which includes japan .
