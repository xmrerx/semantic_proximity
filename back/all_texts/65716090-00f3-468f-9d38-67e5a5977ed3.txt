The leftist mainstream media would love Americans to believe Trump had Univision propagandist removed from the press conference.
As anyone can clearly see, he had nothing to do with Ramos removal and everything to do with him being invited back for a series of questions (with brilliant responses).Univision s Jorge Ramos was removed from Donald Trump s press conference this afternoon by security after standing up and delivering a sermon before Trump could even call on a reporter for a question.
Even after the candidate called on another reporter in the room, Ramos continued his rapid fire question/political statement mix, talking over any chance the other reporter might have for a question, as can be seen in the video above.
Excuse me.
Sit down.
You weren t called, said Trump to the emotional anchor and reporter.
You can t just stand up and scream, said Trump.
Amazing how waiting to be called on worked out.Other reporters in the room naturally asked Trump about the situation, and Trump defended what happened saying that Ramos simply stood up and started yelling, an accurate portrayal.
Even so, Ramos was allowed to return to the press conference, was called on, and was able to ask several questions, as seen in this second video below.
