As we all remember last year, Pope Francis made a historic visit and was beloved by pretty much everyone he came in contact with.
However, there was a very dark cloud that hovered over his visit once it was discovered that he would be meeting with Kim Davis, the controversial Kentucky County Clerk who refused to issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples.Well, it looks as though the ambassador who set up the visit, and apparently kept Pope Francis in the dark about the whole thing, is about to be replaced.
According The Advocate: Italian Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan will leave the position of apostolic nuncio, the equivalent of an ambassador, and will be replaced by Archbishop Christophe Pierre, a French-born clergyman who is currently the nuncio to Mexico, Catholic magazine America reports, citing Sandro Magister, a blogger who covers the Vatican.The Vatican is not expected to confirm the news until the Obama administration has agreed to the new nuncio s appointment, the magazine notes, but it adds that reliable sources expect an official announcement before Easter, which falls on March 27 this year.
Back in October after the visit with Davis, the Vatican released an official statement declaring that Pope Francis meeting with the County Clerk should not be considered a form of support.
Also stating: The brief meeting between Mrs. Kim Davis and Pope Francis at the Apostolic Nunciature in Washington, DC has continued to provoke comments and discussion.
In order to contribute to an objective understanding of what transpired I am able to clarify the following points:The Vatican clearly went into crisis mode to very clearly clarify that Pope Francis was not supporting Kim Davis and her bigoted ways, as was originally construed.
Now, with the replacement of the man who set the whole meeting up, it has been made extremely clear that this sort of thing isn t about to happen again.Kim Davis is a symbol of hate and bigotry, so to see Pope Francis, who has all too often been a shining symbol of hope and love, meet with Davis, it honestly broke a lot of people s hearts.
And while the Pope is still not in favor of same-sex marriage, it s definitely a positive development to see that the responsible ambassador will be replaced.
