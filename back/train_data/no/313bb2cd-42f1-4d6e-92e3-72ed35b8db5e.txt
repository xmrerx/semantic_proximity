conservative talk show host mark levin shredded joe scarborough and the media in defense of president trump as he pointed out that respect is a two-way street.levin , author of the book rediscovering americanism : and the tyranny of progressivism , said a man s man like trump can only take so much before he s gon na stand up , as he spoke with fox news sean hannity on the controversy over the president s tweets about msnbc s morning joe and its co-host mika brzezinski you attack a man repeatedly who s a proud man , who s an accomplished man , who is a man s man .
you attack him personally .
you attack him for his looks .
you attack him for his genitalia .
and at some point , a man s gon na stand up , levin said on hannity thursday .
you want him to act presidential ?
then you have respect for the office of the president , he added.while levin understood the outrage , he admitted his only objection to the tweet was because it jacked up the ratings for msnbc.levin thinks the meltdown by the left reveals a deeper issue : you know , it s nice to know where the liberals finally draw the line on this tweet by this president , levin told hannity , pointing out that liberals were not bothered by former president clinton , who was accused of rape and molesting and sexually attacking women in the oval office , nor were they bothered by ted kennedy .
but trump s tweet appears to be where the hypocritical left draws the line of acceptable behavior , levin noted .
so the bottom line is , msnbc has a problem .
from morning until night , it s the same damn show with different people , different dresses , different suits .
it s the same thing .
levin then suggested that president trump should keep tweeting via : bpr
