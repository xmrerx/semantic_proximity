it s about time rev .
patrick mahoney , of church on the hill in washington , d.c. says that christians in america can not afford to be silent about what s going on.speaking with fox news on friday , he discussed the persecution of christians worldwide .
every five minutes , a christian dies for their faith around the world .
that s over 100,000 a year , he said.mahoney started the # orangejumpsuit project to raise awareness , encouraging supporters to wear orange in a show of support for christians being murdered for their faith .
the color represents the jumpsuits worn by captives of isis , including the 20 egyptian copts beheaded in libya in february.as christians around the country embrace the campaign by wearing orange to church , mahoney argued that it is not a strictly christian movement .
americans need to realize we are seeing a genocide the likes we have not seen in a generation , he said.and for women , forced into marriages and sold into sex trafficking operations , he said , it is especially horrifying .
mahoney has been working with religious leaders of many faiths including muslims to be more vocal in condemning the persecutions.he recently stood outside the white house personally wearing an orange jumpsuit bearing the name of saeed abedini , an american pastor jailed in iran.via : biz pac review
