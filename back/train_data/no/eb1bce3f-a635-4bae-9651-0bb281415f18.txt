berlin ( reuters ) - a man slipped a potentially lethal poison into food , including baby food , on sale in some german supermarkets in an extortion scheme aimed at raising millions of euros , police said on thursday .
no cases of poisoning had been reported so far .
police said the alleged perpetrator had alerted them by e-mail after placing quantities of poison in products for sale in some southern german supermarkets earlier in september , and was now threatening to do so nationwide and elsewhere in europe unless given a pay-off of many millions .
we are taking the threat very seriously , uwe stuermer , deputy chief of police in the southern lakeside city of konstanz , told a news conference .
there is no reason for panic or hysteria , he added , while warning consumers to be on the look-out for packaging that had been tampered with when buying their groceries .
police were looking for a suspect who could be seen in security video footage from one of the supermarkets in a town near konstanz and appeared to be a man of around 50 .
the footage was made public to help in the search .
police said they had found some baby food spiked with ethylene glycol , a colorless , odorless liquid used in the manufacture of antifreeze , which can be deadly if consumed .
authorities in the southwestern state of baden-wuerttemberg said they would intensify checks of food on sale , but warned that identifying contaminated items would be a challenge .
the case is difficult because the blackmailer did not say which food will be targeted or what poison he will use , a consumer protection official said .
