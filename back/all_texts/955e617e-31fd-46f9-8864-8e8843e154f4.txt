Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy (Conn.) said Wednesday on MSNBC s Morning Joe that Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare are based on the GOP s hatred of Barack Obama.
MSNBC contributor Eddie Glaude asked Murphy what he believes the animating commitment behind the GOP health care bill is and what it would take for him to work in a bipartisan way with Republicans to fix the country s health care system.
At this point, I think it s clear the animating commitment is a hatred of Barack Obama, Murphy said.
The policy has been pushed to the wayside here.
They don t seem tremendously interested in actually crafting something that insures more people or reduces rates.
They just want to fulfill this commitment that they made to repeal Obamacare.
Murphy went on to say that he has made it very clear he wants to compromise with Republicans on health care.
They want, as far as I can tell, flexibility of benefit design.
They want something that has some cheaper premiums, less regulations in these exchanges.
I m willing to talk to them about that, Murphy said.
I m willing to give them some flexibility of benefit design if they re willing to give us some security on these exchanges that Donald Trump won t unwind them.
