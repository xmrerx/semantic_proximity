With an Imperial President who believes he is above the law, is there even a need for a Supreme court?On Monday, President Barack Obama said the Supreme Court should not have taken up the challenge to the Affordable Care Act in King v. Burwell.
This should be an easy case.
Frankly, it probably should not even have been taken up, Obama said during a press conference at the G-7 summit in Germany.When asked whether the administration had a plan B, in the event that the Supreme Court strikes down subsidies in states that do not run their own health insurance exchanges, Obama said there are no easy solutions.
You have a model where all the pieces connect, he said.
And there are a whole bunch of scenarios not just with relation to health care but all kinds of stuff I do where if somebody does something that does not make any sense, it is hard to fix.
This would be hard to fix.
The president called the legal challenge bizarre in light of the law s successful implementation.
What s more the thing s working, Obama said.
Part of what is bizarre about the whole thing is that we have not had a lot of conversation about the horrors of Obamacare because none of them have come to pass.
The Supreme Court will announce a ruling this month on whether the Affordable Care Act s designation of an exchange established by the state means that the law can only provide subsidies to individuals in states that run their own exchanges.
If the court rules in favor of a narrow interpretation of that provision of the law, 6.4 million people in 34 states will lose their subsidies, leaving many unable to afford insurance.Via: Huffington Post
