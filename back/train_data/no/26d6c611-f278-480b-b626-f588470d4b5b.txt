sometimes , politics can get so ridiculous that one is forced to wonder if what he or she is seeing is really happening .
one of those moments occurred on the second day of the gop convention .
after melania trump blatantly plagiarized part of michelle obama s 2008 democratic convention speech , the gop leaped into action , offering every ridiculous excuse they could muster to defend the prospective next first lady including the trump campaign s official hamburger delivery boy chris christie s well-she-didn t-plagiarize-all-of-it-so-it-wasn t-plagiarism defense.but the most insane thing to come out of this scenario is perhaps republican national committee communications director sean spicer s my little pony defense .
melania trump said , you work hard for what you want in life .
akon said , work hard for what you get in life .
john legend said , work hard , spicer offered during an interview on msnbc .
you re quoting akon and john legend ?
asked host craig melvin .
hold on , it s getting better , spicer continued .
and he was right it did get better : melania trump said , the strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them .
twilight sparkle from my little pony said , this is your dream , anything you can do in your dreams .
a simple google search of three phrases comes up with everything from sparkle pony to john legend to akon , spicer said , ignoring that an entire paragraph was quoted by mrs. trump nearly word-for-word.naturally , the internet had a lot of fun with this : a presidential campaign quoting from my little pony .
there just is n't enough popcorn in all the world for this .

diz foley ( @ dizfoley ) july 19 , 2016you know how all those guys were like `` girl ghostbusters ruined my childhood ?
`` well the rnc quoting my little pony is doing nothing for mine marla rosenthal ( @ half_shiksa ) july 19 , 2016let s say spicer is 100 % correct in that michelle obama lifted the phrases from my little pony .
he s not , but let s pretend that this is some alternate universe where rabid , tentacular beasts rule the planet , the sky is constantly on fire , and a smart , classy woman like michelle obama needs to dip into the brilliant and thought-provoking scripts of my little pony in order to write a speech.does it really make it any better that melania trump lifted quotes third-hand from a children s tv show ?
is the fact that mrs. trump couldn t steal from someone more respectable than a show about magic horses actually comforting ? here s the thing , though .
while spicer really had to reach to connect trump s ( and obama s ) to my little pony , the difference in wording between the two speeches was minimal .
in any case , this tweet from california senate candidate thomas del beccaro keeps getting more hilarious by the minute. # melaniatrump proved tonight she is total opposite of # michelleo .
no anger .
no complaints .
just about what can happen through opportunity .
