sao paulo ( reuters ) - brazilian federal judge s rgio moro on monday said the car wash probe , brazil s largest ever corruption investigation , is nearing completion in the southern city of curitiba , where it started in 2014 .
there are still investigations under way , but a large part of the work has been done , moro told reporters in sao paulo after a ceremony where he received a distinction from u.s.-based notre dame university for his work leading the probe .
brazil s largest corruption probe started almost by accident in curitiba , when investigators went to a local car wash to ask owners why the small company had done several international money transfers .
from there it spread to several state-controlled companies , politicians , parties and private engineering groups .
but curitiba remained the host city for almost the whole investigation .
moro said he is a bit tired due to the workload resulting from the spreading probe , but he ruled out leaving the operation until it is concluded .
he also dismissed suggestions that he could run in next year s election , despite the huge popularity he gained among brazilians .
some pollsters such as datafolha have included moro s name in some early surveys .
they are losing their time , because this is not going to happen .
simple as that , he said , adding that he is a professional federal judge and will remain so .
despite the prospect of work related to the car wash investigation to end in curitiba , moro said they it will go on in other cities who host higher court instances and also in brasilia , where several parts of the probe are being conducted by the supreme court .
