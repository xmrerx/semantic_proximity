new jersey governor chris christie is catching heat on twitter after he spent sunday soaking up the sun with his family on a state beach that was closed to the public .
the outrage was caused when the state legislators couldn t agree on a budget so they closed down 11 miles of state beaches to the general public during 4th of july weekend but the rules apparently don t apply to christy ! christie hosted a private beach party !
he was caught lounging at the beach with his entourage which catapulted the hashtag # chrischristie to the top of twitter trends on sunday night into monday morning photoshop gold !

the citizens of new jersey deserve someone who doesn t think he s above the rules and regulations .
it s banana republic behavior at best .
he didn t help himself when he said if people want to enjoy the beach then they could try and be governor ouch !
