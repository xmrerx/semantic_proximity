It s well known by now that Trump unsuccessfully pressured Comey to end the FBI s investigation into Michael Flynn and Russia.
Many might think that his attempts to pressure authorities to end that investigation ended with Comey, or maybe Attorney General Jeff Sessions.
They didn t. A new report from the Washington Post details how Trump went after his newly confirmed Director of National Intelligence, Daniel Coats, on this same subject.
[Trump] then started complaining about the FBI investigation and Comey s handling of it, said officials familiar with the account Coats gave to associates.
Two days earlier, Comey had confirmed in a congressional hearing that the bureau was probing whether Trump s campaign coordinated with Russia during the 2016 race The interaction with Coats indicates that Trump aimed to enlist top officials to have Comey curtail the bureau s probe.
After that, Trump spoke to Coats again and asked him to publicly deny the existence of any evidence of collusion between his campaign and Russia.
He made a similar request of Mike Rogers, the director of the National Intelligence Agency.
Both of them refused to do what Trump wanted them to do.Trump is likely upset that he can t control every part of the executive branch like he no doubt thought he would.
Nominating and confirming people who have a modicum of integrity, as well as knowledge of how the intelligence community and White House should behave with respect to each other, has only served to push Trump into a very uncomfortable corner.While Trump and his allies continue to deny that anything ever happened, up to and including lying through their teeth, we have to ask one question: If Trump knows he s innocent, why try to interfere in the investigations this way?
Why behave like there s a cover-up?
Once again, none of this is the behavior of an innocent man.
It s the behavior of someone with something to hide.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images
