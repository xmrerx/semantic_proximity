Has there ever been a US Olympic athlete who, before representing the United States in the Olympic games, discussed whether or not they would be representing our President?
Aren t the U.S. Olympic athletes made aware fairly early on, that they re representing our nation?
I don t remember ever seeing any of our athletes carrying a flag with a picture of the President of the United States, or wearing apparel covered with the President s image or name.
So why is Lindsey Vonn making a statement about how she s not going to be representing President Trump?
Does anyone really care about Lindsey Vonn s opinion about President Trump?
FOX News Olympic gold medal skier Lindsey Vonn says she ll represent the United States, but not President Trump, when she returns to the Winter Games in February.Vonn, who won a gold medal in the women s downhill competition in 2010 in Vancouver, skipped the 2014 Sochi games because of knee injuries.
I hope to represent the people of the United States, not the president, Vonn said this week amid the buildup to the 2018 games in PyeongChang, South Korea.
I take the Olympics very seriously and what they mean and what they represent, what walking under our flag means in the opening ceremonies, she added.
I want to represent our country well, and I don t think there are a lot of people currently in our government that do that.
Vonn also told CNN that she would absolutely not accept an invitation to the White House.Isn t this really more about a former Olympic athlete with an over-inflated ego and an overblown sense of how important her opinions are to the American people than anything else?
