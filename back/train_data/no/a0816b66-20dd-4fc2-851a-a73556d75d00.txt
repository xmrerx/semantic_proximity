beijing ( reuters ) - china supports cambodia s efforts to protect political stability and believes it will smoothly hold elections next year , chinese foreign minister wang yi told his cambodian counterpart , after the country s main opposition party was dissolved .
the supreme court banned the opposition cambodia national rescue party ( cnrp ) last week at the request of prime minister hun sen s government in a move that prompted the united states to cut election funding and threaten more punitive steps .
the european union has also threatened action .
the cnrp was banned after its leader , kem sokha , was arrested for alleged treason .
the government says he sought to take power with american help .
he rejects that allegation as politically motivated , to allow hun sen to extend his more than three decades in power in next year s general election .
the united states has said that cambodia s 2018 election will not be legitimate , free or fair .
meeting on monday on the sides of a asia-europe foreign ministers meeting in myanmar , wang told his cambodian counterpart prak sokhon that china supported the government s actions .
china supports the cambodian side s efforts to protect political stability and achieve economic development , and believes the cambodian government can lead the people to deal with domestic and foreign challenges , and will smoothly hold elections next year , , china s foreign ministry said in a tuesday statement .
china has repeatedly expressed its support for cambodia , making no criticism of the government led by hun sen , a former khmer rouge commander , who is one of beijing s most important allies in southeast asia after more than three decades in power .
