While Hillary Clinton was busy tearing Donald Trump orange limb from orange limb on the debate stage, Elizabeth Warren made the world her stage as she masterfully kicked him while he was down via Twitter.Trump didn t have a good night Sunday.
Not only did he fail completely to explain away his open admission that he sexually assaults women by grabbing them by the pussy (and gets away with it because he s rich), but Trump managed to cause the room to erupt in laughter when he called himself a gentleman, openly admitted that he doesn t pay his taxes, and even threatened to jail his opponent if he is elected because some people want him to.Warren hit him HARD on taxes:.
@realDonaldTrump's tax plan is to cut taxes for rich & powerful guys like Donald Trump & leave everyone else behind.

@realDonaldTrump is PROUD that he doesn't pay his taxes.
He thinks he's smart and you're stupid for paying yours.
#debate Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 10, 2016 and reminded us that no matter how much distance the GOP tries to create, they are still blocking Obama s Supreme Court nominee so Trump can nominate one of his choosing:Remember: @SenateGOP are running away from @realDonaldTrump this weekend, but they're holding a Supreme Court seat hostage for him.
#debate Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 10, 2016She even agreed with Trump on something I am sure we can all agree upon Clinton is a fighter:I agree with @realDonaldTrump: @HillaryClinton is a fighter.
She's dealt with bullies like Donald for 25+ yrs & she never gives up.

@HillaryClinton doesn t whimper, whine, or run to twitter at 3am.
She keeps fighting for those who need her.
That s why #ImWithHer.
#debate Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) October 10, 2016Trump himself was silent on Twitter after the debate, though he did retweet Mike Pence congratulating him for winning (was Pence watching the same debate?
).Congrats to my running mate @realDonaldTrump on a big debate win!
Proud to stand with you as we #MAGA.
Mike Pence (@mike_pence) October 10, 2016The Donald doesn t stand a chance at this point but just to make sure, head to the polls on November 8 and join the nation in rejecting him.Featured image via Getty Images (Ethan Miller)
