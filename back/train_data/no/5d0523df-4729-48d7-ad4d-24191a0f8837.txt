washington ( reuters ) - u.s. president barack obama on tuesday urged congress to take action to stop u.s. companies from taking advantage of tax loopholes that allow them to avoid paying taxes .
“ when companies exploit loopholes like this ... it sticks the rest of us with the tab and it makes hard-working americans feel like the deck is stacked against them , ” obama told reporters at the white house , adding that wealthy corporations and individuals should not be “ gaming the system. ” obama , a democrat , has called repeatedly for action by the republican-controlled u.s. congress on tax-avoiding corporate inversions , which lowers companies ’ tax bills by allowing them to redomicile overseas even though their core operations and management usually remain in the united states .
so far , lawmakers have done little .
the u.s. treasury department took more decisive actions to crack down on inversions late on monday , that imperils a number of proposed mergers , including pfizer inc ’ s ( pfe.n ) $ 160 billion agreement to buy dublin-based allergan plc ( agn.n ) .
“ i want to be clear .
while the treasury department ’ s actions will make it more difficult ... to exploit this particular corporate inversions loophole , only congress can close it for good , ” obama said .
