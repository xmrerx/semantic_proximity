using the twitter handle houdini @ sizzle_seyf , the man posted the news video and retweeted congratulations on his chasing and tackling the trump supporter.this video shows anti-trump thugs sucker punching and attacking trump supporters .
near the end of the video , the young white trump supporter can be seen running from the mob .
