There is definitely such a thing as protesting too much, and Donald Trump is making it very clear that Congress should investigate his ties to Russia.In yet another hissy fit on Twitter, Trump whined about his Russia scandal continuing to be a major news story and claimed that the media keeps bringing it up to hide his big election victory.Russia talk is FAKE NEWS put out by the Dems, and played up by the media, in order to mask the big election defeat and the illegal leaks!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 26, 2017First of all, Trump s big election victory was one of the smallest on record.
He only received 306 electoral votes, which is lower the both of President Obama s totals in 2008 and 2012.
Furthermore, Trump lost the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.Second, the media continues to report on Russia because it is a major scandal that Trump has been trying to shake for months now.
His chief-of-staff Reince Priebus even desperately asked the FBI to shut down the reports on it in order to muzzle the story.Third, leaks are important sources for the press, especially since Trump lies constantly every time he speaks.
Also, Trump is only calling the news fake because he doesn t like it.But Trump s obsession with calling his Russia scandal fake news should be reason enough for Congress to open an investigation.
Trump has been protesting this story and trying to make it go away for way too long.
If there is truly nothing to the story then Trump would just ignore it.
But he isn t because he has something to hide.As usual, Twitter users were not impressed by Trump s tweet either.
@realDonaldTrump And can you explain HOW Russia is fake news ?
You ve said this 1000 times yet have never countered a single point!
William LeGate (@williamlegate) February 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump The only illegal leaks now are coming from within *your* administration, and we all know leaks cannot be fake William LeGate (@williamlegate) February 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump In a recent press conference you were corrected that you did not have the biggest electoral college win.
Al Letson (@Al_Letson) February 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump Additionally, you lost the popular vote by 2.8 million voters.
How is this a big election defeat?
Al Letson (@Al_Letson) February 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump was birtherism a fake story?
You wanted Obama to prove your accusation wrong.
Should you not do the same?
Al Letson (@Al_Letson) February 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump Are you sure it isn t that your talk about inauguration numbers is just a cover for your ties to Russia?

@realDonaldTrump How is it fake news AND illegal leaks?
If it s fake news, you wouldn t be after leakers.
Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) February 26, 2017The bottom line is that Trump needs to be investigated by Congress, but Republicans are too busy making excuses so that they don t have to do it.
Because if they did their duty, they would discover Trump s treachery and would be forced to impeach him.
And they don t want to do that because they would lose their rubber stamp and piss off their voter base.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
