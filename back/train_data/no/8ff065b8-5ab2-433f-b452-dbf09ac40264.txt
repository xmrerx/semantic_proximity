doha ( reuters ) - qatar has signed 36 worker protection agreements with countries that provide much of its labour force , state media reported on wednesday , weeks before the international labour organisation is to decide whether to investigate it for worker abuse .
qatar is keen to show it is tackling allegations of worker exploitation as it prepares to host the 2022 soccer world cup , which the gulf arab state has presented as a showcase of its progress and development .
state news agency qna did not provide details of the bilateral agreements , but said they are in addition to five memorandums of understanding , preparations for a minimum wage , and an employment support fund that would help workers faced with overdue wages .
labour and rights groups have attacked the gas-rich state for its kafala sponsorship system , which forces the country s 1.6 million mainly asian foreign workers to seek their employer s consent to change jobs or leave the country - a measure groups say leaves workers open to exploitation .
qatar last year issued changes to this system , allowing workers who have completed contracts to change jobs freely and imposing fines on businesses who confiscate employees passports , but rights groups have said the new measures do not go far enough .
qatar is expected to present a report by november on implementation of its reforms to the ilo , which will then decide whether to form a commission of inquiry , a rare sanction which the united nations agency has imposed only about a dozen times since world war two .
