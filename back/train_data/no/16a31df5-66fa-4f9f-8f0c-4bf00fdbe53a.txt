paris/geneva ( reuters ) - switzerland is sending a tunisian couple who include the brother of a man presumed to have killed two people in a knife attack at a french train station back to their home country for security reasons , swiss federal police said on tuesday .
the couple were arrested in the swiss town of chiasso near the swiss-italian border on sunday night where they sought asylum .
they will detained pending their expulsion , swiss federal police said , giving no date .
the man is known to foreign police services for his links with the jihadist terrorist movement .
for now his role in the marseille attack , if any , is not clear , swiss federal police said in a statement giving no names or ages for the couple .
earlier a source close to the investigation said on tuesday that swiss had detained two tunisians wanted in connection with a deadly knife attack at marseille train station on oct. 1 .
swiss police confirmed that one of the two detained is a brother of 29-year-old ahmed hannachi , who was shot dead by a french soldier after killing two young women outside the station in southern france .
authorities are investigating the attack as a probable terrorist act .
hannachi s younger brother , anis , was arrested in italy earlier this month .
more than 240 people have been killed in france since 2015 in attacks by assailants who pledged allegiance to , or said they were inspired by , the islamic state group .
earlier this month , the french parliament adopted counter-terrorism legislation to increase police surveillance powers and make it easier to close mosques suspected of preaching hatred - a law which civil rights groups said would infringe on personal freedoms .
