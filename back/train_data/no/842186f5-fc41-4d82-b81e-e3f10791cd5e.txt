comedic icon tim allen is taking on microagressions in the latest episode of abc sitcom last man standing .
in friday night s installment , entitled precious snowflake , allen , who plays conservative family man mike baxter , goes head-to-head with his daughter mandy over the issue on college campuses.after being asked to speak at her business school s graduation ceremony , baxter learns his speech has to be examined beforehand to remove any microagressions or objectionable words or phrases .
i know what microagressions are , baxter says .
it s the liberal attack on free speech and a lot of fun if you do them right .
as baxter begins to read his prepared statement , he is immediately reprimanded by mandy for using the term ladies and gentlemen .
no , uh , you can t say , ladies and gentlemen , mandy says .
because it excludes those who don t identify as either .
to quote future nobel prize winner lee greenwood , i m proud to be an american .
not just because i have the right to speak my mind or carry an awesome gun , but because it s the land of opportunity , baxter reads .
some whiny babies might not think so , but in america , if you work hard , anyone can be successful .
vanessa responds hesitantly by noting the university will almost certainly find his speech problematic .
the thought police are never gon na approve that speech , she says .
