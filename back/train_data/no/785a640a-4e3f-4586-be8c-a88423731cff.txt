new york ( reuters ) - democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton ’ s lead over republican rival donald trump narrowed to less than 3 percentage points , according to a reuters/ipsos opinion poll released on friday , down from nearly eight points on monday .
about 42 percent of likely voters favored clinton , to trump ’ s 39 percent , according to the july 31-aug. 4 online poll of 1,154 likely voters .
the poll had a credibility interval of plus or minus 3 percentage points , meaning that the results suggest the race is roughly even .
among registered voters over the same period , clinton held a lead of five percentage points , down from eight percentage points on monday , according to the poll .
the reasons behind the shift were unclear .
clinton had pulled well ahead of trump on the heels of the democratic national convention last week , where she became the first woman to accept the u.s. presidential nomination from a major political party .
since then , trump has engaged in a days-long feud with the family of an american soldier killed in iraq and squabbled with the republican leadership over his comments and leadership turmoil within his campaign .
trump , in recent days , however , has sought to refocus .
on friday he announced his economic policy advisory team , said he would deliver an economic policy speech early next week , and was expected to endorse u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan , the top u.s. elected republican , who is seeking his 10th term in congress .
an average of polls aggregated by real clear politics showed clinton ahead of trump by 6.8 percentage points on friday , up from 3.9 on aug. 1 .
