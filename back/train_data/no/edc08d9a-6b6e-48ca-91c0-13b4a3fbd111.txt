beirut ( reuters ) - a rebel group in northern syria handed control of a major border crossing to a turkey-backed syrian opposition government on tuesday , a senior rebel official said .
by handing over the bab salama crossing at the turkish border , the jabha shamiya rebel group aims to strengthen the opposition government and help put an end to factional rivalries , the head of its political office khaled aba said .
he urged other rebels to follow jabha shamiya s example by handing over other crossings at the turkish border .
the interim government is the solution for the liberated areas to put an end to terrorism , to put an end to factionalism and the state of division in the liberated areas , said aba , a member of the opposition delegation to geneva peace talks .
the bab salama crossing is the main gateway into an opposition-held area of the north where neighboring turkey carved out a de facto buffer zone during a military incursion targeting islamic state and kurdish groups last year .
efforts have been underway in that area to merge and organize a plethora of rebel groups whose rivalries have led to factional fighting that has weakened the syrian opposition throughout the conflict .
jabha shamiya , a major force in aleppo until the syrian government and its allies defeated the opposition there last year , has joined a national army operating under the authority of the interim government s defense ministry , aba said .
it has also handed control of its training camps to the defense ministry , he said .
the opposition government is based out of the town of azaz , a short distance from the turkish border .
launched last year , turkey s euphrates shield operation drove islamic state out of a swathe of territory including the cities of al-bab and jarablus , preventing any further territorial gains by kurdish groups deemed a threat by ankara .
