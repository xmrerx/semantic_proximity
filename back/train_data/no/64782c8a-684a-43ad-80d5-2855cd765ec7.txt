donald trump can t let it go .
a broken and antiquated system that exists solely to benefit slave-owning states by increasing the value of their residents votes while devaluing everyone else s the electoral college allowed him to become president despite his opponent trouncing him in the popular vote , and he still isn t satisfied because he failed to travel back in time and vanquish his true nemesis : president obama.ever since he recently claimed that he could have beaten the president if he ran against him , trump has been the subject of mockery but on tuesday , his delusion came to a head when he claimed he had actually beaten obama , who could not and did not run in 2016 .
president obama campaigned hard ( and personally ) in the very important swing states , and lost , twitler tweeted .
the voters wanted to make america great again !

donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) december 27 , 2016now sure , he actually ended up with a historic popular vote loss among people who have become president while obama enjoyed a record-shattering popular vote win while also managing to win via the electoral college , but the donald is confident that he could beat obama in a head-to-head matchup .
naturally , the mockery intensified to match this new level of stupidity : .

stop catastrophizing into imaginary spirals .

( @ lisabbff ) december 27 , 2016at this point , trump should be working on unifying the country ( as though that is possible with him in charge ) .
unfortunately , it seems that he is more focused on being a twitter troll than on being president .
even more unfortunately , our country will suffer for it.featured image via getty images ( ethan miller ) /screengrab
