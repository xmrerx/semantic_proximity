Her admission to being a key figure on our House Intelligence Committee should scare every single American, no matter what political party you identify with.Listening to this woman talk only underscores the urgency of cleaning house in Washington this November.

Our national security is at risk over a crooked Secretary of State who deliberately set up a separate email server to hide goodness knows what and the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee calls it a distraction from Zika?
