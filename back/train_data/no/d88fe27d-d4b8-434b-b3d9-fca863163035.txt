geneva ( reuters ) - the united nations said on tuesday it had accepted a proposal from iraq to pay 0.5 percent of its 2018 oil proceeds toward compensation for $ 4.6 billion owed to kuwait for destruction of its oil facilities during the 1990-91 gulf war occupation .
payments from the fund , which were suspended since october 2014 due to security and budgetary challenges faced by iraq , will escalate annually until the end of 2021 , the u.n .
compensation commission ( uncc ) said in a statement , adding that kuwait had accepted the proposal .
based on oil price and export projections , this would result in payment in full of the outstanding claim award , it said , referring to the claim by the kuwait petroleum corporation , the largest approved by the geneva-based uncc .
