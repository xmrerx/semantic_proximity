It is literally impossible for Donald Trump to let America forget about what an awful person he is for one day.Trump s campaign has been getting wrecked over the past week thanks to a blatantly anti-Semitic tweet he sent out a few days ago.
The tweet was a meme with the Star of David slapped over an anti-Hillary Clinton graphic a meme that was traced back to a website frequented by white supremacists and neo-Nazis.
It doesn t seem possible, but Trump has managed to make the situation even worse.At a rally in Ohio on Wednesday night, Trump went on an insane rant about how unfair it was that his offensive tweet had to be taken down and is getting so much negative attention.
The Donald repeatedly insisted that the Star of David is actually just a regular star (or a sheriff s star) and that the dishonest media are actually the ones who are profiling not him.
Trump went out of his way to go after CNN, or the Clinton News Network, for rightfully calling him out on the anti-Semitic tweet, labeling the network and the rest of the media sick.
Then, Trump complained that he d had to alter the meme (by putting a circle over the Star of David) and pull the original off of social media.
He whined that his social media director, Dan Scavino, shouldn t have taken it down.
TwitterYou can watch Trump throw a temper tantrum about not being able to show his true bigot colors freely below:It s clear that Trump doesn t give a sh*t if his meme carried a super offensive or oppressive message.
All that matters in Trump s mind is that he s right, everyone else is wrong, and he can do whatever the hell he wants without being called out on his bigotry.Featured image via Gage Skidmore / Flickr
