so it s just too damn early to tell if the dallas massacre of white police officers is a hate crime ?
perhaps jeh johnson needs a refresher course in what a hate crime is how about when someone kills people and says it s because they re white cops ?
even the dallas police chief read off the comments by micah johnson that told everyone exactly why he did what he did .
why the confusion ?
could it be that obama has told his cabinet members to tow the government line and play like they still don t know why the dallas massacre happened ?
what a bunch of jackwagons ! during a sunday morning interview with cbs s john dickerson , secretary of homeland security jeh johnson stated though dallas shooter micah johnson told hostage negotiators he wanted to kill white people , especially white police officers , it s still relatively early to qualify his actions as a hate crime .
you said there s no link to a terrorist organization here , but the shooting in dallas was by any definition terrorism and a hate crime , wasn t it ?
posed dickerson .
well , there s still an investigation being conducted by the dallas police department and the fbi supported by many resources from the local government and the federal government , johnson responded .
so it s still relatively early .
will this clear it all up for jeh johnson : obama s comment on the attack mirrors johnson s : i think it s very hard to untangle the motives of this shooter .
as we ve seen in a whole range of incidents with mass shooters , they are by definition troubled .
