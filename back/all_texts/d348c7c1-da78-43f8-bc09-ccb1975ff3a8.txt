Most of us don t know what it s like to be homeless, but three brothers decided to let all of us know with a video that has gone viral.
As a homeless man sat in the streets of New York asking for money for food, the youngest brother Omar sat next to him and pretended to be homeless.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NvoWBbYxdwc]As people passed by, it was young Omar who who was getting money in his cup while the homeless veteran received nothing.
At one point, after a policewoman put money in Omar s cup, the veteran asked her for money, saying that he had nothing to eat the entire day.
Annoyed, the policewoman sternly said that she works every day and that he s a grown man and then flicked his hat.Another passerby was even more abusive.
After he gave Omar some money, the veteran asked for some change to which the man said, This little kid out here.
They don t know what it takes.
You re a grown ass man.
I got a job.
I work my ass off every day.
The veteran replied, I served my country sir.
The man then said, You served your country!
Here is something that served your country!
He then spilled the food he was carrying all over the veteran.Yet, despite being humiliated and crying, the veteran stood up, walked a few feet to a restaurant, and came back with two slices of pizza, one for him and for Omar.That s when the two brothers of Omar came up to the veteran and told him that Omar was not homeless.
They gave him all of the money Omar had collected and an additional $200.
Surprised and crying, the veteran and the brothers exchanged hugs.We don t know why this man who served his country is homeless, but war is damaging both physically and psychologically.
What we do know is that he was extremely kind hearted to Omar despite the humiliation he suffered at the hands of strangers.One thing that we should learn from this video is that we need to take care of our veterans.Featured Image Via YouTube Screenshot.
