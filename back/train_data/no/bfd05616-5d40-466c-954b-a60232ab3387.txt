i m the only one to separate siamese twins .
the only one to operate on babies while they were still in their mother s womb .
the only one to take out half of a brain , although you would think if you went to washington that someone had beat me to it .
but i m very hopeful that i m not the only one who will pick up the torch of freedom .
because freedom is not free !
