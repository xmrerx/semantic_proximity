We all know by now that House Speaker Paul Ryan is a spineless weasel.
He is clearly uncomfortable with the idea of a President Trump, and yet he endorsed the great orange one anyway, and no matter how outrageously offensive Trump becomes, no matter how many times Ryan has to distance himself from Trump s remarks, he still says he s a Donald Trump supporter.
Well, Libertarian presidential candidate Gary Johnson is now calling Ryan out for making such a grave mistake, and wants him to un-endorse Donald Trump.Johnson sat down with CNN to express his views on Ryan s Trump endorsement, and he had nothing good to say about where the House Speaker is right now.
Johnson said: I think Paul Ryan has an opportunity here to say, Look, I made a mistake.
I m not saying that results in an endorsement of me, but come on, the statements that he s making he s made 100 statements that would disqualify any other presidential candidate from running and yet all you have to do is turn the page and tomorrow it will be 102.
Host Erin Burneet pointed out that 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney had once floated the idea of supporting a Libertarian ticket, but had reservations about Johnson s policies, particularly his support of legal marijuana nationwide.
Romney said that weed makes people stupid.
Johnson disagreed, and admitted to taking a toke or two himself, and said: I do not agree with that.
As someone who has used marijuana, I do not agree with that.
What Gary Johnson doesn t seem to understand, though, is that Paul Ryan is not Mitt Romney.
Paul Ryan is a dyed in the wool, loyal die hard GOPer till death do him and that wreck of a party part even if it means propping Trump up and letting him burn the world down.Give it up, Gary.
As much as I agree with you, I think you need to realize that Paul Ryan will never, ever disavow his annointed nominee.Watch the clip below, via The Hill:Featured image via William B. Plowman/NBC/NBC NewsWire via Getty Images
