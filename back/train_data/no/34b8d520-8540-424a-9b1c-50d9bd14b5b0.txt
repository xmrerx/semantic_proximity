mogadishu ( reuters ) - somali authorities imposed a daytime ban on monday on the movement of large trucks and road tankers inside the capital mogadishu in an attempt to improve security following a wave of devastating attacks by militants .
the move followed twin truck bombings on oct. 15 that killed more than 350 people in the city , in the deadliest attack in the history of the horn of africa nation .
though the islamist militant group al shabaab did not claim responsibility for that attack , the method is one it has often used .
trucks and tankers can not pass ... from 7:00 am to 8:00 pm .
this is to ensure security and ( to offer ) a solution to the complaints of the public , tabid abdi , the capital s mayor , said in a statement .
any truck or tanker driver who does not comply will be fined $ 1,000 .
further underlining the somali capital s security woes , at least 29 people were killed on sunday during a 12-hour siege at a mogadishu hotel , in an attack claimed by al shabaab .
the government sacked two top security officials .
they had the uniforms of security forces , even though they did not have id cards , information minister abdirahman omar osman told reuters .
al shabaab said 40 people had been killed , including three of its fighters who stormed the hotel .
al shabaab aims to topple the government in mogadishu and impose its own strict interpretation of islam .
the country has been at war since 1991 , when clan-based warlords overthrew dictator siad barre and then turned on each other .
though it has lost large swathes of territory to african union peacekeepers , the group s attacks have grown in frequency and size , as a 22,000-strong peacekeeping force prepares to begin withdrawing .
