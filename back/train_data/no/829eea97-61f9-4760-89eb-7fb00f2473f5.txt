a week ago , susan sarandon attended the 2016 sag awards looking absolutely fabulous .
she proudly wore an outfit that showed off her cleavage because she s susan sarandon and she doesn t care what you think .
the internet promptly melted down in worship at the sight of this feminist icon doing what she does .
but a few days later , piers morgan inexplicably took issue with sarandon s wardrobe choice on twitter : would susan sarandon wear this to a funeral ?
no .
it was thus horribly inappropriate for an in memoriam tribute .

i m not entirely sure why the sight of cleavage in public places offends some people and i understand even less why they think anyone cares about their opinion on the matter.still , sarandon decided to tease morgan and sent out the following time warp : today s # tbt is dedicated to @ piersmorgan .

their solution to the problem ?

pic.twitter.com/gjw3o2jlbx flattopper pride ( @ flattopperpride ) february 7 , 2016some have complained that it wasn t about sarandon showing her cleavage but where she showed them ( during her in memoriam segment ) , but the problem with that complaint is that we have arbitrarily declared women s breasts to be sexual objects to be hidden away .
they re only scandalous because we ve been conditioned to think that way .
sarandon clearly didn t think it was inappropriate and there s exactly zero reason she , or any other woman , should be beholden to anyone else s prudishness.featured image via twitter .
