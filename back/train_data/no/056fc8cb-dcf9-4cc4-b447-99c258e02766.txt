madrid ( reuters ) - spain s government on friday passed a law to make it easier for companies to move their operations around the country just as some businesses consider leaving the region of catalonia amid a rising conflict over a plan for independence .
the new law loosens the bureaucratic red tape needed for a company s board to take the decision to move the company s base , unless the group s statutes expressly say otherwise , the government said in a statement .
the law had been discussed with the opposition political parties , the socialists and business-friendly ciudadanos , economy minister luis de guindos said in the press conference following the weekly cabinet meeting .
