As if Donald Trump needs help delegitimizing his party, a senior member of his campaign in Oklahoma, state Senator Ralph Shortey, was forced to resign after being caught in a hotel room with a 17-year-old male prostitute.In true Trump style, Shortey tried to spin the encounter as him just helping the kid earn some money for his Spring Break by letting the kid earn his way with sexual stuff.
In online messages, he told him: I m gonna f**k you like a good little boy if you keep calling me daddy.
He also referred to having sex with the teen s boy p*ssy, baby boy .Source: Pink NewsAccording to court documents, Shortey was reported by a friend of the boy, who saw him getting into an SUV.
The friend followed them to the hotel room, where he saw the boy enter with a strange man.
The friend called the teen s father, who called the police.While the age of consent in Oklahoma is only 16, having sex with a prostitute under 18 is something else altogether.
Shortey has been charged with engaging in child prostitution, engaging in prostitution within 1,000 feet of a church and transporting a minor for prostitution.
All the charges are felonies.
He s out on $100,000 bail.Here s the video:Shortey s statement following resignation fell short of admitting to his crimes, instead calling them a distraction.
Earlier today, I submitted my resignation, effective immediately, to the President Pro Tempore of the Oklahoma Senate, as well as to Governor Fallin.
I thank the constituents of Senate District 44 for the opportunity they provided to serve.
Because I take that responsibility seriously, I recognize that the charges against me are a distraction to their interests and the remaining legislative session, which should serve all Oklahomans.
My resignation is evidence of my respect for public service and the duties of our elected officials.
I ask for the privacy of my family my wife and four daughters as I defend myself of these charges.Source: KFOR
