jerusalem ( reuters ) - an israeli court on saturday freed without charge three turks who had been arrested on suspicion of assaulting police outside a jerusalem holy site contested by jews and muslims , a police spokesman said .
the men - described by police as tourists - were taken into custody on friday , as israel confronted a weekly surge in protests against u.s. president donald trump s dec. 6 recognition of jerusalem as its capital .
bystander video appeared to show israeli police detaining several fez-wearing men and boys in the walled old city of east jerusalem , which israel captured in a 1967 war and which palestinians want as capital of their own future state .
police spokesman micky rosenfeld said the three turks had tried to reach al aqsa mosque , islam s third-most important shrine , where they planned on taking part in a demonstration .
jews revere the site as the vestige of their two ancient temples , and sometimes visit under the protection of israeli police who also guard the compound entrances - a presence resented by many palestinians .
rosenfeld said the three turks carried out an assault on police officers there .
he did not elaborate on the circumstances , other than to say there were no casualties .
brought before jerusalem magistrate s court on saturday , the men did not speak from the dock .
two of them flashed four-finger hand gestures that appeared to be the so-called rabia sign of solidarity with egypt s ousted muslim brotherhood .
the turks israeli defense lawyer , nick kaufman , said police asked the court to keep them in custody so charges of assaulting a police officer and resisting arrest could be brought .
it was obvious that this was a politically charged case and the judge rightly released them , kaufman told reuters .
