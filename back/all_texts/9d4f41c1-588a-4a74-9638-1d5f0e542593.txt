WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump intends to nominate former U.N. spokesman Richard Grenell to be U.S. ambassador to Germany, the White House said on Friday.
Grenell served as U.S. spokesman at the United Nations from 2001 to 2008, during the administration of Republican President George W. Bush.
Currently, Grenell is a contributor to Fox News.
His nomination as envoy to NATO ally Germany must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate.
