PARIS (Reuters) - French bank Societe Generale on Wednesday rejected the far-right National Front s accusations that it had acted to suffocate the party by closing accounts.
Societe Generale group s decisions on whether to open or close a bank account depend purely on banking reasons and in respect of all regulatory requirements, without taking into account any political consideration, it said in a statement.
Regarding the opening of an account at Credit du Nord, a financial representative of Front National asked the Bank of France for the right to have a bank account as an individual.
Credit du Nord responded to the Bank of France s requirements and offered the services required within the right s regulatory framework.
Credit du Nord is part of the French retail banking network of SocGen.
