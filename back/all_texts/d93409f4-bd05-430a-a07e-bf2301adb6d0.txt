Our most pressing issue is border control and terrorism.
If you ve been paying attention to the border issues, you know we have basically had open borders during the Obama presidency.
We ve become a global magnet for ANYONE to come across our border.
Who knows how many terrorists and violent gang members have crossed our border.
The bottom line is that the American taxpayer should NEVER have to pay for the people coming across and should not be put at risk.
This is a safety issue and a financial issue!
We need big changes and we need them fast.
The Republican party and the Republicans in charge now have done NOTHING to fix this problem.
Does this tell you anything?
We need to clean house and elect people who will put AMERICA FIRST!
The NBPC has had a longstanding practice of not endorsing presidential candidates in the primaries.
Via the National Border Patrol website:The National Border Patrol Council is the official organization representing our nation s Border Patrol Agents.
We represent 16,500 agents who selflessly serve this country in an environment where our own political leaders try to keep us from doing our jobs.The NBPC has had a longstanding practice of not endorsing presidential candidates in the primaries.
We will not, however, shy away from voicing our opinions as it pertains to border security and the men and women of the United States Border Patrol.
As such, we are breaking with our past practice and giving our first-ever endorsement in a presidential primary.
We think it is that important: if we do not secure our borders, American communities will continue to suffer at the hands of gangs, cartels and violent criminals preying on the innocent.
The lives and security of the American people are at stake, and the National Border Patrol Council will not sit on the sidelines.As an organization we expect our elected officials to aggressively pursue the interests of the country.
America has already tried a young, articulate freshman senator who never created a job as an attorney and under whose watch criminal cartels have been given the freest border reign ever known.Unlike his opponents, Donald Trump is not a career politician, he is an outsider who has created thousands of jobs, pledged to bring about aggressive pro-American change, and who is completely independent of special interests.
We don t need a person who has the perfect Washington-approved tone, and certainly NOT another establishment politician in the W.H.
Indeed, the fact that people are more upset about Mr. Trump s tone than about the destruction wrought by open borders tells us everything we need to know about the corruption in Washington.We need a person in the White House who doesn t fear the media, who doesn t embrace political correctness, who doesn t need the money, who is familiar with success, who won t bow to foreign dictators, who is pro-military and values law enforcement, and who is angry for America and NOT subservient to the interests of other nations.
Donald Trump is such a man.Mr.
Trump is as bold and outspoken as other world leaders who put their country s interests ahead of all else.
Americans deserve to benefit for once instead of always paying and apologizing.
Our current political establishment has bled this country dry, sees their power evaporating, and isn t listening to voters who do all the heavy lifting.
Trump is opposed by the established powers specifically because they know he is the only candidate who actually threatens the established powers that have betrayed this country.You can judge a man by his opponents: all the people responsible for the problems plaguing America today are opposing Mr. Trump.
It is those without political power the workers, the law enforcement officers, the everyday families and community members who are supporting Mr. Trump.Via: Gateway Pundit
