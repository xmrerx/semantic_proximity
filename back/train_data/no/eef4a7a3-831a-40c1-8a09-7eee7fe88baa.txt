berlin ( reuters ) - there is no reason to suspect that two bags of bullets found near a christmas market and mosque in western berlin have anything to do with terrorism and the find was related neither to the market nor to the mosque , police said on sunday .
asked about a possible link with terrorism , a police spokesman said : not at all .
ammunition is always being found in berlin , he added .
somebody was probably clearing their cellar out and found something from their grandfather .
germany is on high alert for militant attacks , nearly a year after a tunisian islamist rammed a hijacked truck into a christmas market in central berlin , killing 11 people as well as the driver .
earlier this month , experts made safe a device filled with nails that was delivered to a pharmacy near a christmas market in the german city of potsdam near berlin .
