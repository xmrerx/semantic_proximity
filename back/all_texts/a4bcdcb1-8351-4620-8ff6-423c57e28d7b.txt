Once again, it seems as though someone associated with the Trump campaign will receive special treatment.
According to reports, the billionaire s campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, will not face the music for manhandling former Breitbart reporter (we use that term loosely, given the nature of the right-wing garbage dump), after roughly grabbing her during a campaign event after mistaking her for a member of the liberal media.
Palm Beach County State Attorney David Aronberg says that, despite the attack being caught on video, the billionaire s right-hand man will not be prosecuted for what is clearly a crime because reasons.After Fields asked Trump a question, Lewandowski grabbed her, apparently attempting to throw her to the ground.
Fields says she was able to maintain her balance, but she was left with bruises after the attack.Lewandowski initially denied the allegations, but after video surfaced he had no choice but to admit to what he did.
But, of course, he says it was OK to physically assault a woman because he thought she was a member of the mainstream media he hates so much.
Prosecutor s office told me they would inform me of decision tomorrow.
If reports true, guess they decided to leak to reporters first.
Ugly, Fields tweeted after news of the decision leaked.
For those asking, office of prosecutor asked 2 weeks ago if I d be ok with an apology from Corey.
I said ya but haven t heard back about it.
With evidence of the attack, an admission, and a video that clearly shows the assault, one must wonder why Aronberg would refuse to prosecute Lewandowski, who was charged with a misdemeanor count of battery last month.You can bet that if it was anyone else, that person would have had to face what he did.Watch the attack below:Featured image via CNN
