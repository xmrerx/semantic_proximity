london ( reuters ) - ireland is trying to force the united kingdom , or at least northern ireland , to remain in the customs union after brexit as it suits their national interest , the deputy leader of the province s democratic unionist party said on friday .
their real aim is to try to get to a situation where either they try to force the united kingdom as a whole to stay within the customs union , which is in their interests clearly , nigel dodds told sky news .
or , if they fail that , to at least force northern ireland to stay within the customs union and the single market , follow the rules of it , something then we d have no say over , but we d have to abide by the rules which would then bring about a united ireland much easier .
