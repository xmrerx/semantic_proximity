Pennsylvania is always one of the most sought-after states in presidential elections, and even though it has been reliably Democratic, Republicans often believe that its 20 electoral votes are within reach.
With that in mind, there s almost nothing the GOP won t do to get those votes, including busing in people from out of state in order to intimidate voters especially minority voters.And now Pennsylvania Republicans are going to court to do just that.The Pennsylvania Republican Party filed a complaint late Friday night asking a federal court to allow out-of-county poll watchers to monitor voting stations on Election Day.Filed on behalf of eight Keystone State voters, the suit alleges that state law restricting poll watchers to the county in which they re registered violates the First Amendment and denies them their right to equal protection under the law.Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has been muttering for weeks that the election has been rigged a conspiracy theory that has coincided with him dropping in almost every national poll, from anywhere from 5 to 11 percent.As a result, many Republican voters have now convinced themselves that there is a massive national operation underway to steal the election from Trump.
And Trump has told his backers that this effort is coming from cities in swing states, and those cities are largely the main source of votes from black and Latino voters, both of whom are overwhelmingly Democratic.Those voters are more motivated than usual to vote against Trump, because he launched his campaign by describing Mexicans as criminals and rapists and repeatedly making it seem as if black people only live in urban blight, forever under fire by drug gangs and enduring lives of complete desperation.
Success and middle class livelihoods for ethnic minorities simply don t exist in Trump s view of the world.And his party doesn t want them voting.Featured image by Michael Candelori, CC BY 2.0 via Flickr
