baghdad ( reuters ) - iraqi forces and shi ite paramilitaries captured an air base from islamic state on monday , the army said , gaining a strategic foothold in the north of the country as they push toward the town of hawija .
iraq launched an offensive on september 21 to dislodge islamic state from hawija , which lies west of the oil city of kirkuk and is one of two areas of the country still under the control of the militant group .
iraqi army commanders said the rashad air base , which is around 30 km ( 20 miles ) south of hawija , was used by the militants as a training camp and logistic base .
militants took control of the air base after the iraqi army collapsed in 2014 in the face of the islamic state offensive .
after quick rehabilitation works , the air base will play a key role for iraqi forces by allowing helicopters to transport soldiers and arms in any future operation to maintain security in the north , said army lieutenant colonel salih yaseen .
the air base will help to put an end to the terrorists pockets hiding in mountainous areas near kirkuk and remove any possible threat to the energy facilities and oilfields .
hawija , north of baghdad , and a stretch of land along the syrian border , west of the iraqi capital , are the last stretches of territory in iraq still in the hands of islamic state .
islamic state s self-declared caliphate effectively collapsed in july , when u.s.-backed iraqi forces captured mosul , the group s de facto capital in iraq , after a grueling nine-month battle .
