two nyc-based artists secretly slipped some items inside the merchandising outpost of the trump tower s lower lobby .
among them : a trump-emblazoned kkk hood for fine people , sealed packages of pee-proof rubber sheets , and postcards featuring the 45th president of the united states , vladimir putin.hoping these artists will be dealt with asap.gothamist interviewed these so-called artists : we thought the tourists coming in to buy some stuff , especially people from other countries , should get the whole story of who the president is , because the items in the trump store don t accurately reflect the person , one of the two artists , who asked that we not reveal his name.could the left be anymore hateful and immature ?
