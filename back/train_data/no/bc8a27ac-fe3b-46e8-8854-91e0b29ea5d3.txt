erbil ( reuters ) - brett mcgurk , the u.s. special envoy to the coalition against islamic state , on thursday said he was encouraged that the iraqi kurdish leadership could embrace a plan to delay an independence referendum .
moving forward with the referendum on sept. 25 would be a risky move for iraq s autonomous kurdish region because there was no international support for it at this moment , mcgurk said in a news conference .
