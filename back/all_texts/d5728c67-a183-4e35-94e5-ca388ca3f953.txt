The saga surrounding the idiots who decided to invade and occupy a federal building on a wildlife preserve in Oregon continues.
Though the occupation itself is over, the legal troubles for this group of right-wing loons are just beginning.
It has been reported that Bundy and his band of nutbags have been indicted on yet more federal charges.These latest indictments state that they will be facing charges because they had weapons in federal facilities, as well as with vandalism and theft of property belonging to the government.
The original federal charges drop the hammer on the group 26 people charged in all for conspiracy to disrupt the duties of federal agents.
Also, their infamous stealing of a government truck for a grocery store trip is included in these latest indictments.
There are also charges of using weapons during violent criminal activity.Another blow came to the group when the death of LaVoy Finicum was ruled justified and necessary.
Further, another occupier, Sean Anderson and an unnamed accomplice are charged with destruction of sacred artifacts belonging to a local Native American tribe.The fact that any of this happened at all is nothing short of absolutely disgraceful.
This nonsense about being able to take over federal land whenever they please is treason.
Hopefully, the charges being handed down are serious enough for all of these lunatics to do some very hard time in a federal lock-up.They went into this thinking that they could cause another Waco-type situation, but luckily there was only one death, despite all of those weapons and lunatic gun nuts hellbent on dying for this ridiculously misguided cause.
There is no cause here.
That land belongs to the federal government, and these people are just lawless fools who are a danger to themselves and the rest of society.Lock them up and throw away the key.Featured image via screen capture from WMUR/Addicting Info archives
