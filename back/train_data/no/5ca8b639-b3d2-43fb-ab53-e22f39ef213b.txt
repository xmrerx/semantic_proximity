athens ( reuters ) - greece does not expect it will need a precautionary credit line when it exits its bailout next year , a view that is in line with its official creditors , the finance minister said on friday after a meeting of euro zone ministers in tallinn .
greece s 86-billion-euro bailout program , its third since 2010 when its debt crisis exploded , ends in august next year and by then athens aims to have fully returned to market financing .
it is pretty clear that the greek government , the european institutions and the imf are not thinking of a precautionary credit line , there is no reason for it , euclid tsakalotos told reporters .
he said that based on a eurogroup decision in june , greece should have a buffer of funds to ensure a clean exit from the bailout program and to pay down state arrears .
the money will likely come from bailout funds that will be left unused .
what emerges from the eurogroup s statement in june is that we may get part of these funds to form a buffer and pay down state arrears .
this is a discussion that will take place between february and may , not now , he said .
tsakalotos echoed european central bank executive board member benoit coeure , who said he saw no need to conduct an asset quality review ( aqr ) at greek banks as a broader european union-wide stress test is already being planned for 2018 .
the greek case is simple , greek banks are part of the european system .
we have the european authorities , the ecb and the ssm ( single supervisory mechanism ) , neither of which is asking for an asset quality review , tsakalotos said .
the minister said that greek banks will take part in the pan-european stress test next year and projected that economic recovery in the next two years will help lenders reduce their high level of non-performing loans .
