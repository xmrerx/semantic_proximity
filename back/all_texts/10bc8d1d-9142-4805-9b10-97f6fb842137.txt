UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley on Thursday called on countries to suspend providing weapons to Myanmar over violence against Rohingya Muslims until the country s military puts sufficient accountability measures in place.
We cannot be afraid to call the actions of the Burmese authorities what they appear to be - a brutal, sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority, Haley told the U.N. Security Council.
It should shame senior Burmese leaders who have sacrificed so much for an open democratic Burma.
