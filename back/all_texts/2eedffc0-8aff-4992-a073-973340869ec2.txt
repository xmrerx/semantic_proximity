NAIROBI, (Reuters) - Kenyan police fired teargas on Tuesday to try to control a crowd of thousands of people trying to force their way into a stadium to attend the inauguration of President Uhuru Kenyatta.
In a separate part of the capital city, where opposition leader Raila Odinga had planned to hold a rival meeting, police sealed off the area and lobbed teargas at opposition supporters trying to gather there.
