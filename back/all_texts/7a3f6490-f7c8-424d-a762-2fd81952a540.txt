An official representative of Donald Trump s presidential campaign has once again launched an attack on the family of fallen soldier Captain Humayun Khan.This time the attack comes from conservative Carl Paladino, the New York co-chair of the Trump for President Campaign.In a radio interview with Imus in the Morning, Paladino argued that Khizr Khan, Khan s father who gave a rousing speech to the Democratic Convention, does not deserve to be called a Gold Star parent even though he lost his son in combat in Iraq in 2004.
We ve got an un-indicted felon as his opponent and you re talking about Khan, about him making a remark about this man, Paladino, a former New York gubernatorial candidate, told interviewer Connell McShane on Imus in the Morning.
All right, I don t care if he s a Gold Star parent.
He certainly doesn t deserve that title, OK, if he s as anti-American as he s illustrated in his speeches and in his discussion.
I mean, if he s a member of the Muslim Brotherhood or supporting, you know, the ISIS-type of attitude against America, there s no reason for Donald Trump to have to honor this man.
The Trump campaign s heartless attacks against the Khans have received widespread condemnation across America, with even some Trump supporters saying that the line was crossed in attacking the family.
Trump himself belittled the family s sacrifices, pointing to his work as a real estate developer as comparable to losing a child.
Trump also insinuated that Khan s wife didn t speak at the convention because of her Islamic faith.In subsequent comments she said she did not speak because she is still overwhelmed when speaking about how her child was lost.By comparison, the Khan family s sacrifice has been repeatedly praised by Hillary Clinton, her running mate Tim Kaine, and other Democrats.
It is strange that in light of Trump s collapsing support in national polls that his campaign would return to this topic.Featured image via YouTube
