tokyo ( reuters ) - japanese prime minister shinzo abe said he will decide on the timing of a snap general election after he returns on friday from a trip this week to address the united nations .
regarding the dissolution of the lower house , i would like to refrain from commenting on every question , but i would like to make a decision when i return home , abe told reporters on monday as he left for new york , according to a foreign ministry transcript .
abe is considering calling a general election , the third since he swept to power in december 2012 , as early as oct. 22 , to take advantage of a rebound in his approval ratings after a series of scandals for this coalition government , and disarray in the main opposition party , government and ruling party sources told reuters on sunday .
abe is scheduled to speak at the un general assembly and the new york stock exchange on wednesday , and is seeking to arrange meetings with u.s. president donald trump and south korean president moon jae-in before returning to japan on friday .
an early vote would take advantage of defections in opposition democratic party and could also dilute a potential challenge from an embryonic party that allies of popular tokyo governor yuriko koike , an ex-ldp lawmaker , are trying to form .
abe s coalition would be likely to lose its two-thirds super majority in the lower house but keep a simple majority , political sources say .
