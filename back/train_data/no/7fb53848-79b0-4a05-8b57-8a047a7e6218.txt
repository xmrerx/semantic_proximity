liberals on twitter accused president donald trump s son eric of sporting a nazi haircut when he debuted a new hairdo sunday.eric trump sported a new hairstyle with the side of his head shaved in an interview with fox news .
trump s trendy new style is far from unusual : celebrities like macklemore , david beckham , brad pitt , and adam levine have all sported the same look.but in recent years , members of the alt-right , including white supremacist richard spencer , have also started wearing their hair the same way .
some have even begun to call the style fashy , short for fascist.when a screenshot of trump s hairstyle first hit the internet , reporters and liberals assumed the worst .
wfberic trump has a fascist haircut.this can not possibly be unintentional .
