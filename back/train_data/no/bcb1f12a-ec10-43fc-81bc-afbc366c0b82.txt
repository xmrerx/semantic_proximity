donald trump is taking credit again for deals made by companies long before the election , and the internet was quick to put his ego in check.once again , trump took to twitter to brag about how he is supposedly responsible for auto companies like ford and fiat chrysler announcing job creation and expansion in the united states.with all of the jobs i am bringing back into the u.s. ( even before taking office ) , with all of the new auto plants coming back into our .. donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 17 , 2017country and with the massive cost reductions i have negotiated on military purchases and more , i believe the people are seeing big stuff .
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 17 , 2017but the fact is that trump hasn t done shit.the auto companies themselves have emphatically refuted trump s claims and pointed out that these plans were in place long before election day .
also , these plans were announced and put in to action under president obama s administration , which is also responsible for saving the auto industry from collapse in 2008 , so if anyone deserves credit for what the auto industry is doing it s president obama.and twitter users flattened trump s ego .
@ realdonaldtrump you mean taking credit for bringing jobs back that you had nothing to do with ?
ex : amazon ?
