it appears that someone has possibly hacked the gop s official twitter account .
on wednesday evening , they sent out an absolutely crazy tweet that simply can not be real .
the account , @ gop , tweeted that the party is better with a pretty much guaranteed donald trump nomination .
considering the massive fracturing and panic going around in gop circles right now due to trump s divisive bid for the presidency , one would think that the gop establishment wouldn t be too happy that he seems to be in it to win his way to pennsylvania avenue in november .
here is the tweet : thank you to the entire republican field for a hard fought race .
the party is better for your efforts .

here are just a few : .
@ gop the party is better ?

there s no way that the gop establishment believes that trump is a good thing for their party or for the country .
he s an obnoxious , violent , thin-skinned spoiled brat .
all of that aside , he s also nothing but a reality television personality .
that does not = presidential material .
being rich and famous does not make one fit to occupy the oval office.congratulations , dumbass republicans .
you ve effectively allowed that buffoon to make your party into a laughingstock around the nation and the world.featured image via alex wong/getty images
