seoul ( reuters ) - north korea has been moving airplanes and boosting defenses on its east coast after the united states dispatched b-1b bombers to the korean peninsula over the weekend , south korea s yonhap news agency reported on tuesday , citing the country s spy agency .
the united states seemed to have disclosed the flight route of the bombers intentionally because north korea seemed to be unaware , the report said .
south korea s national intelligence service was unable to confirm the report immediately .
north korea s foreign minister said on monday that u.s. president donald trump had declared war on north korea and that pyongyang reserved the right to take countermeasures , including shooting down u.s. bombers even if they are not in its air space .
