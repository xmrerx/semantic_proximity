dubai ( reuters ) - iran has provided the capability for ballistic missile attacks launched from yemen , a senior u.s. air force official said on friday .
jeffrey harrigian , commander for southwest asia at the u.s. air forces central command , also told reporters while on a visit to dubai that it was important to find diplomatic solutions to tensions surrounding lebanon instead of going to war .
what we have seen , clearly from the results of the ballistic missile attacks , that there have been iranian markings on those missiles , that s been demonstrated , harrigian said .
to me that connects the dots to iran in terms of who s providing those missiles and that capability .
saudi arabia , part of a coalition carrying out bombings of the iran-allied armed houthi movement in yemen , has frequently intercepted missiles fired from its neighbor .
early this month , saudi air defense forces intercepted a ballistic missile fired from yemen over the capital riyadh , state news agencies reported .
the missile was brought down near king khaled airport on the northern outskirts of the city and did not cause casualties , the reports said .
meanwhile , saudi arabia has accused lebanon and its shi ite hezbollah movement of declaring war on it .
riyadh has advised saudi citizens not to travel to lebanon , or if already there to leave as soon as possible .
with respect to lebanon , i think the goal will be to try to find diplomatic solutions , harrigian said .
i don t want to speak to specifically how the kingdom of saudi arabia will deal with that , but i would like to think we will be able to find a solution to that problem that would allow diplomatic efforts to achieve success versus going to war .
