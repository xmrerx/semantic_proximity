In 2016, Ben & Jerry s co-founder, Ben Cohen s net worth was estimated to be $150 Million.
In typical liberal fashion, Ben s fine with sitting on an astronomical net worth, he just wants to make sure the government has the ability to take even more from the every day American s paycheck Ben & Jerry s co-founder Ben Cohen announced Monday he has created a new flavor celebrating Benrie Sanders s White House run.
Nothing is so unstoppable as a flavor whose time has finally come, Cohen wrote on his Facebook page alongside a picture displaying a pint of Bernie s Yearning ice cream.The new flavor isn t an official Ben and Jerry s ice cream.
Jerry and I have been constituents of Bernie Sanders for the last 30 years, Cohen said of the longtime Vermont senator.
But he noted that his company with fellow co-founder Jerry Greenfield is not directly involved with the flavor.Who knew the political revolution could taste so sweet?

When we re out speaking on his behalf people always ask if there s a Ben and Jerry s flavor.
There s not, Cohen added.
But if I were going to come up with one, this is what it would be.
Cohen s website describes Bernie s Yearning as plain mint ice cream beneath a solid layer of chocolate on top.
The chocolate disc represents the huge majority of economic gains that gone to the top 1 percent since the end of the recession, the flavor s packaging states.
Beneath it, the rest of us.Eating instructions include taking a spoon and whacking the chocolate disc into lots of pieces ; mixing the chocolate pieces around; and sharing the result with your fellow Americans.
