Low blow!
Political hack Angela Rye refused to say that President Trump is the president of the United States during a CNN interview this morning.
This bitter woman is truly childish.
This is the same former exec director of the CBC who said Trump gained success off the backs of poor people (SEE VIDEO BELOW).Arguing with former Rep. Jack Kingston (R-GA), Rye said, There are a lot of things that your president has done to defy logic.
Your president, too, Angela.
Your president too, Kingston responded with a smile.
He s YOUR president, Rye shot back.
The president of the United States, CNN host John Berman said as he concluded the segment, seemingly agreeing with Kingston.The tone from liberals on Trump s legitimacy differs greatly from the president s own attitude toward former President Obama.
Speaking at CPAC in 2011, Trump told the anti-Obama crowd that He is our president.
THIS IS THE SAME WOMAN WHO SAID REPARATIONS AREN T UNAMERICAN: Angela Rye, former executive director of the Congressional Black Caucus, is one angry woman!
She spews racist talking points like crazy without much rebuke from Carl Higbie.
Rye makes a claim that Trump achieved his success off of the backs of poor people : The very people who you re talking about who you think are looking for free gifts and handouts are people who have been disenfranchised since they got off the slave ship in this country.
