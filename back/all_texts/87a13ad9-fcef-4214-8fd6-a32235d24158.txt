WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee said on Wednesday his panel was likely to strip out language imposing sanctions against North Korea from legislation that contains sanctions against Russia and Iran.
Republican Senator Bob Corker told the Washington Post in an interview that doing so would ensure the measure could pass.
Corker said the bill was likely to become law “very, very soon.”
