More than one major retail chain has decided to drop Ivanka Trump s fashion line, and while they don t cite specific politics in their reasons for doing so, many believe that falling sales were prompted by politics, which, in turn, prompted the chains to drop her.
The brand, though, had yet to issue a statement on this until recently.It s just slightly ridiculous: The Ivanka Trump brand continues to expand across categories and distribution with increased customer support, leading us to experience significant year-over-year revenue growth in 2016.
We believe that the strength of a brand is measured not only by the profits it generates, but the integrity it maintains.
Integrity?
Really?
In any case, a company can t survive on integrity alone.
If enough stores dump her brand, her fashion line goes under.
End of.But that wasn t all they said.
They also used the statement to play up the diversity of the company and the professionalism of the women behind it: The women behind the brand represent a diverse group of professionals and we are proud to say that the Ivanka Trump brand continues to embody the principles upon which it was founded.
It is a company built to inspire women with solution-oriented offerings, created to celebrate and service the many aspects of their lives.
That doesn t really address the brand getting dumped by high-end retailers like Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus.
And it also doesn t address what the company is doing to mitigate this, even if they never specifically say they re working to mitigate it.
Where are they going with the brand?
Are they in talks with anyone else that could replace Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus?The statement is reminiscent of Trump s spokespeople, and also could be suggesting that they have no idea what they re going to do if more chains drop them.Featured image by Aaron P. Bernstein via Getty Images
