lima ( reuters ) - former authoritarian leader alberto fujimori sought forgiveness from peruvians from the bottom of my heart on tuesday for shortcomings during his rule , and thanked president pedro pablo kuczynski for granting him a christmas pardon .
in a video on facebook , fujimori , 79 , vowed that as a free man , he would support kuczynski s call for reconciliation , hinting that he would not return to politics .
i m aware the results of my government were well received by some , but i acknowledge i also disappointed other compatriots , the ailing fujimori said , reading from notes while connected to tubes in a hospital bed .
and to them , i ask for forgiveness from the bottom of my heart .
the remarks were fujimori s first explicit apology to the andean nation that he governed with an iron fist from 1990-2000 .
they came after two days of unrest as protesters slammed the pardon as an insult to victims and part of a political deal to help kuczynski survive a scandal .
the pardon cleared fujimori s convictions for graft and human rights crimes during his leadership of the rightwing government .
late on monday , kuczynski , a 79-year-old former wall street banker , appealed to peruvians opposed to the pardon to turn the page and defended his decision as justified clemency for a sick man whose government helped the country progress .
i can not keep from expressing my profound gratitude for the complex step that the president took , which commits me in this new stage of my life to decidedly support his call for reconciliation , fujimori said .
