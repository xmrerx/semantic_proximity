on friday , donald trump got himself amped up for cpac by complaining about leaks , much to the surprise of at least a couple russian prostitutes and anyone who paid attention during his campaign .
interestingly , no longer is the information fake news trump , feeling the water level rising , now admits that leaks are happening in his sinking ship of the administration .
and he wants them to stop .
the fbi is totally unable to stop the national security leakers that have permeated our government for a long time , trump tweeted .
they can t even find the leakers within the fbi itself .
classified information is being given to media that could have a devastating effect on u.s. find now the fbi is totally unable to stop the national security `` leakers '' that have permeated our government for a long time .
they ca n't even donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) february 24 , 2017find the leakers within the fbi itself .
classified information is being given to media that could have a devastating effect on u.s. find now donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) february 24 , 2017wow , trump seems panicked for some reason .
could it be that his campaign had almost constant contact with members of the russian government ?
michael flynn s discussion of sanctions with the russian ambassador that the trump administration lied about ?
the fact that the donald literally asked vladimir putin and his cronies to hack his political opponents and the russian dictator obliged ?
or is it that the fbi just told trump to f * ck off when his team demanded that they make a public statement that would discredit any idea that he and his compatriots are lying traitors ? maybe all of the above but whatever the reason , the folks on twitter were there to mock him for his stupidity : @ realdonaldtrump getting nervous , donnie ? ?

ruwayda mustafah ( @ ruwaydamustafah ) february 24 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump sucks when the fbi rejects your illegal request to declare your innocence on this russian disaster of yours .

matthewdicks ( @ matthewdicks ) february 24 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump insulting the fbi and suggesting an unknown danger to our country ( as you 1st did with your illegal ban ) is n't leadership .
benjamin byron davis ( @ tooda ) february 24 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump before they put me in a jail .
( you forgot to add that bit ) emma kennedy ( @ emmakennedy ) february 24 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump actually the fbi told the media that your team could be involved with russia .
so they are helping americans unlike you .
tony posnanski ( @ tonyposnanski ) february 24 , 2017 @ realdonaldtrump an odd coincidence that the only thing leaked of late can be devastating to you personally .
