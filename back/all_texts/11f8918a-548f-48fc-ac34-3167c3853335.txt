HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s Platform for Concerned Citizens, a civil society group, called on Tuesday for a far-reaching national dialogue involving all political parties to help plot a new course for the country after the resignation of Robert Mugabe.
A National Transitional Authority must be the final outcome of a national dialogue, the PCC said in a statement.
We have informed both the government and the military of our view.
