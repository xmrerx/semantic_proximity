Boom!Dear Abby,My husband is a liar and a cheat.
He has cheated on me from the beginning, and, when I confront him, he denies everything.
What s worse, everyone knows that he cheats on me.
It is so humiliating.
Also, since he lost his job 14 years ago, he hasn t even looked for a new one.
All he does all day is smoke cigars, cruise around and shoot the bull with his buddies, while I have to work to pay the bills.
Since our daughter went away to college he doesn t even pretend to like me, and even hints that I may be a lesbian.
What should I do?Signed: Clueless Dear Clueless:Grow up and dump him.
You don t need him anymore!
Good grief woman, you re running for President of the United States!
AbbyNailed it!
