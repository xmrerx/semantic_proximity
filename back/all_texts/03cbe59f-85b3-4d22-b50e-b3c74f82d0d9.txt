Hillary s over-the-top plan to tax the consumer for sugary drinks and soda makes former Mayor Michael Bloomberg look like a chump.
Hillary knows what s good for you and what s not now shut up and pay Hillary Clinton on Wednesday came out in favor of a tax on soda that is three times larger than the one floated by Michael Bloomberg when he was mayor of New York City.Speaking at a forum in Philadelphia, Clinton said she was very supportive of a proposal unveiled last month by the city s mayor, Jim Kenney.The Democrat is calling for a tax of three cents per ounce on soda and other sugary beverages.
The additional revenue which Kenney estimates to come in at $400 million over the next five years will help pay for pre-kindergarten education.Kenney s lofty proposal is three times the amount of the tax proposed in 2010 by Bloomberg a measure which was shot down and made the billionaire the butt of many jokes.Berkeley, Calif. is the only other major U.S. city to enact a soda tax.
That liberal enclave has a one-cent tax on sugary beverages.A group called Philadelphians Against Grocery Tax says that the Clinton-backed tariff would double the cost of some grocery items.A 12-pack of 12-ounce sodas would cost an additional $4.32, nearly doubling the price of the item for consumers, according to the group, which is backed by the American Beverage Association.A 2-liter bottle of soda, which contains roughly 68 ounces and costs around $1.50, would more than double in price.
The tax would run $2.04.
