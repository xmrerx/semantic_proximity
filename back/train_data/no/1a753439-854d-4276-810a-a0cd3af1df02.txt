it s hard not to notice the liberal media gushing all over hillary clinton .
cnn defends her every move while hammering trump on just about everything .
even obama has said he s not endorsing a candidate but it obvious his best hope for continuing his legacy of far left ideology is with clinton .
they are both students of well known radical saul alinsky .
msnbc is another news outlet that loves hillary and is always pushing her agenda .
the only problem is that the dems didn t get the memo that bernie sanders is the guy for the voters and some lefty organizations .
oops !
it s clear that bernie sanders has taken a rather large lead in the nh polls ( 14 percent ) and that lefty organization moveon.org just endorsed sanders .
yes , the writing is on the wall for all to see except the liberal media this should be interesting ! cnn had this gushing article today : obama hopes to pave way for clinton with farewell state of the unionthough the white house says obama will not endorse a candidate in the 2016 primary race , there is no doubt that he has long seen clinton as the best hope for preserving his legacy.in fact , that belief was one reason many people in the administration s inner circle were wary of a run by vice president joe biden .
i think barack obama believes that it is incredibly important that hillary cinton succeeds him , said a former close aide to obama who is still connected with the white house .
the only way that we have an economy where people aren t losing their health care is if hillary clinton becomes president .
jeff shesol , who is familiar with the dynamic between a president and his preferred successor after working in the final years of the clinton white house as a speechwriter , including on the state of the union address , highlighted obama s reliance on clinton for his place in history .
the single most important thing that could happen from here on out for the obama legacy is the election of hillary clinton , he said .
