If you thought it was hilarious that Trump s 2020 slogan was directly lifted from a promotional poster for The Purge, you re in for a treat when you realize that he quoted a Batman villain during his first speech as President.
Today, we are not merely transferring power from one administration to another or from one party to another, Trump told his tiny, tiny crowd of less than a quarter-million on Friday, But we are transferring power from Washington, D.C. and giving it back to you, the people.
Trump says he wrote his speech himself, apparently after watching The Dark Knight Rises.
The Internet was quick to notice similarities to a speech given by Batman villain Bane:Guys Donald Trump quoted Bane in his #Inauguration speech!

(@GarryStitchell) January 20, 2017You know, it is probably appropriate that Trump would quote a deranged killer who took control of a city, emptied the prisons, proclaimed martial law, and threatened to blow everyone in the city up if they didn t comply with his authority.
It s going to be just like the movies.Unfortunately, Batman is not real and will not be here to protect us from Trump.
It is up to each of you to do all that you can to ensure that this real-life villain does not win.
Oppose him at every turn, or we lose Gotham America as we know it.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images/screengrab
