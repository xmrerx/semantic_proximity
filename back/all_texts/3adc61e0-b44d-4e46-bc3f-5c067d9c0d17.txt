A white five-year-old girl told her mother Christmas and Easter are stupid and European women are alcoholics after being fostered to two Muslim families, it was claimed today.The child, who is a native English speaker, also refused to take back her favorite meal spaghetti carbonara because it contained bacon which Muslims do not eat.The child, who is a native English speaker, spent the past six months in two Muslim households after being placed into foster care in Tower Hamlets, east London.She was forced to live in Muslim foster homes where nobody spoke English and her carers took away her Christian cross and encouraged her to learn Arabic, according to The Times.Local authority reports describe how the little girl sobbed and begged not to be returned to her niqab-wearing carer s home, telling a social worker: They don t speak English.
The reports detail how the child was very distressed and claimed the foster carer had removed her Christian cross and encouraged her to learn Arabic.The two placements were made by the scandal-hit Tower Hamlets borough council against the wishes of the girl s family.Local authorities are required to give due consideration to a child s religion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic background when placing them into a foster home.The girl s mother is said to be horrified by the circumstances her daughter has been placed in.A friend told the newspaper: This is a five-year-old white girl.
She was born in this country, speaks English as her first language, loves football, holds a British passport and was christened in a church.
She s already suffered the huge trauma of being forcibly separated from her family.
She needs surroundings in which she ll feel secure.
Instead, she s trapped in a world where everything feels foreign and unfamiliar.
That s really scary for a young child.
