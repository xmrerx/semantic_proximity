WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will discuss ways to expand trade with Britain when British Prime Minister Theresa May meets with him at the White House on Friday, although trade may not be the central focus of their conversation, the White House said.
“I’m sure that there will be a discussion of trade ... the degree to which I don’t know yet,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters on Monday.
“He’s going to have a great conversation about the potential for greater trade with the UK.” Spicer added that he did not believe there were currently any plans for the two leaders to hold a joint news conference.
Trump, asked in the Oval Office what his agenda was for the meeting, would not go into details, saying only, “I look forward to seeing her.”
