Last night, Jimmy Fallon, host of The Tonight Show, tried to get to the bottom of this phenomenon when he had Trump on his show.After Trump denied that he knew Russian President Vladimir Putin, Fallon asked Trump to fulfill a special request of his.
Fallon asked, Can I mess up your hair?
Trump cringed at first, but Fallon promised to be gentle.
After squirming around in his seat for a few moments, the Republican nominee eventually said: The answer is yes.
But the people in New Hampshire where I m going to be in about an hour from now, I hope they re going to understand.
Trump then cozied up to Fallon, who reached across his desk and aggressively ran his fingers through Trump s golden strands.
Trump s hair flew in all directions, and his scalp was exposed at one point.
Trump tried to smile during this, but you could tell he didn t enjoy it by how quickly he tried to put his hair back in place after Fallon was finished.
