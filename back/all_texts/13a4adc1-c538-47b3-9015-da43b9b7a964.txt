BEIJING (Reuters) - China said on Friday it supports Cambodia in pursuing its own development path, after Cambodia s Supreme Court dissolved the country s main opposition party at the request of the government of Prime Minister Hun Sen ahead of elections next year.
Foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang made the comment at a daily news briefing in Beijing.
The United States has promised concrete steps against Cambodia and the European Union raised a threat to vital trade preferences after the ruling.
