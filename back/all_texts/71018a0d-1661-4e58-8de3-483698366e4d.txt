As the nation is embroiled in one scandal after another with Donald Trump, as the world now has first-hand knowledge of the buffoon who was chosen by the Electoral College, there was a tiny sliver of a break.
On Tuesday night, Barack Obama and Justin Trudeau had a candlelit dinner in Montreal and all was right with the world, even if it was very short-lived.The couple of world leaders, that is discussed how to get the next generation involved in their communities, between heartfelt confessions of how much they missed each other (probably).The most talked-about international date night of the modern diplomatic era had every romantic element the Trudeau-Obama fandom could ever dream of: an intimate restaurant booth, an abundance of gazes into each other s eyes, presumably some Secret Service right outside the door.Source: CNNSocial media went completely nuts:Obama and Trudeau on a dinner date tonight in Montreal.
