we don t want to jump to any conclusions , so we ll just wait to find out if victor alonzo majia nunez is a legal us citizen ( or not ) .
for some strange reason , it always seems to take days , or even weeks for the media to find out whether or not the suspect in a crime is a legal us citizen a suspect is under arrest after police say a roswell officer was shot at during a patrol early friday morning.officer brian mckenzie was in the area of old roswell road and commerce parkway when police say a passing vehicle fired a shot at the mckenzie s patrol car .
he noticed a vehicle slow down and then heard what he thought was either gunfire or fireworks .
he looked over and realized it was gunfire coming towards him , said roswell police official zachary frommer.mckenzie was not hit.frommer says mckenzie chased 21-year-old victor mejia nunez , but the riverdale man crashed the stolen suv he was driving .
detectives have been speaking to him .
he s been less than forthcoming so we don t know motive or anything like that , frommer said.frommer says in light of the attacks on police in dallas , officers here were already on high alert .
then something like this happens and it just perks us up even more , frommer said.mejia nunez is facing several charges , including aggravated assault on a police officer .
he was in an suv stolen out of sandy springs .
