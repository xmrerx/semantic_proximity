MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin has sent a telegram to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, hailing the breaking of the siege of Deir al-Zor by Syrian government troops, the Kremlin said on Tuesday.
Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters that Putin had hailed the breakthrough as a strategic victory over Islamic State militants.
Street-to-street fighting was now underway in Deir al-Zor, Peskov said.
Russian air strikes that struck Islamic State targets in the city on Tuesday helped Syrian government troops in the area swiftly advance, he said, citing a Russian Defence Ministry report to Putin.
