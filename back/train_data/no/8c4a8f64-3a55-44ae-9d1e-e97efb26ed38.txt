with an imperial president who believes he is above the law , is there even a need for a supreme court ? on monday , president barack obama said the supreme court should not have taken up the challenge to the affordable care act in king v. burwell .
this should be an easy case .
frankly , it probably should not even have been taken up , obama said during a press conference at the g-7 summit in germany.when asked whether the administration had a plan b , in the event that the supreme court strikes down subsidies in states that do not run their own health insurance exchanges , obama said there are no easy solutions .
you have a model where all the pieces connect , he said .
and there are a whole bunch of scenarios not just with relation to health care but all kinds of stuff i do where if somebody does something that does not make any sense , it is hard to fix .
this would be hard to fix .
the president called the legal challenge bizarre in light of the law s successful implementation .
what s more the thing s working , obama said .
part of what is bizarre about the whole thing is that we have not had a lot of conversation about the horrors of obamacare because none of them have come to pass .
the supreme court will announce a ruling this month on whether the affordable care act s designation of an exchange established by the state means that the law can only provide subsidies to individuals in states that run their own exchanges .
if the court rules in favor of a narrow interpretation of that provision of the law , 6.4 million people in 34 states will lose their subsidies , leaving many unable to afford insurance.via : huffington post
