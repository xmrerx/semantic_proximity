Vice President Joe Biden has been careful to give Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders their fair share of lauding and criticism.
Like President Obama, Biden has not endorsed any candidate for the 2016 race, and has pledged to stay neutral until a nominee is decided at the convention.But in a telling interview with Mic in which his staffers tried to shut down Vice President Biden may have hurled a veiled endorsement towards Clinton s way when he said he would like to see a woman elected president.
His comments, more specifically:This country s ready for a woman.
There s no problem.
We re gonna be able to elect a woman in this country.
I would like to see a woman elected.After his staffers tried to cut the interview, Biden said he had no issues discussing the 2016 election, and reminded Mic that the president and I are not going endorse because we both, when we ran said, let the party decide.'
Although he did not mention Clinton by name, there is only one woman in the running for the White House (unless Sanders picks a female VP or the Republicans do) and that s Hillary Clinton.
After brushing off his staff, Biden added that both candidates are qualified, but then added, Hillary s overwhelmingly qualified to be president.
Biden s comments will be an uplift to Clinton, who suffered a public humiliation after the Vice President branded her as new to the issues of income inequality, a staple of the Sanders campaign.Surprisingly, Biden told Mic that he does not believe Clinton is held to a higher standard because she is a woman, even though social psychology shows people do, in fact, hold women in politics to a different higher standard than men.Although not an official endorsement, is Biden ready for Hillary?Here s the interview, via YouTube: Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
