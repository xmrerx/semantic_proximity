Republican Senator Rand Paul spoke with CNN s Erin Burnett on Tuesday and accidentally spilled the beans about the kind of healthcare American really needs.
While explaining his position on the latest healthcare plan drummed up by the GOP, he talked himself into a corner by describing a system of healthcare that sounds a lot like single payer.Paul was exchanging healthcare views with Erin Burnett when she realized that he accidentally made the point for nationalized healthcare, so she pressed him hard using his own words against him.
We should try to give them options, he explained while making the case for individual markets.
He used the example of a how a plumber could link up with additional plumbers and create one large group market that covers all cases, including things like pregnancy.
You could get a way out of that individual conundrum and you could get group policies, and most of the group policies actually have things like pregnancy, Paul continued.
If you work for General Motors, my guess is pregnancy is automatically in your insurance because you are a big group and you have the leverage to demand it.
Burnett took the argument for a collective large group insurance and ran with it.
So why not go for the biggest group of all and just have insurance for everybody?
She retorted.
Well, socialism s not a good idea, said Paul, using the Venezuelan health crisis as a model for socialism s failures.Burnet slammed back, But you did make a great argument for nationalized healthcare.
You said the bigger the group the lower the cost, so I m taking your argument to its logical conclusion.
Paul then tried to take back what he said.
I was talking about voluntary groups, not the gulag.
Too late, Paul.
You brought up the real solution to the healthcare crisis without even realizing what you were saying.
