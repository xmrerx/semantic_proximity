addis ababa ( reuters ) - at least 61 people have been killed in clashes between different ethnic groups in ethiopia s oromiya region , officials said , the latest bout of violence to highlight increasing instability in a province racked by bloody protests in 2015 and 2016 .
from thursday , 29 ethnic oromos were killed by ethnic somali attackers in the region s hawi gudina and daro lebu districts , regional spokesman addisu arega kitessa said .
the violence triggered revenge attacks by ethnic oromos in another district , resulting in the killing of 32 somalis who were being sheltered in the area following a previous round of violence .
the region is working to bring the perpetrators to justice , the spokesman said in a statement .
the cause of the latest violence was not known , but it followed protests in oromiya s celenko town where the region s officials said 16 ethnic oromos were shot dead on tuesday by soldiers trying to disperse the crowd .
we do not know who ordered the deployment of the military .
this illegal act should be punished , said lema megersa , the region s president .
the clashes are likely to fuel fears about security in ethiopia , the region s biggest economy and a staunch western ally .
lema s comments also illustrate growing friction within ethiopia s ruling eprdf coalition , since unrest roiled the oromiya region in 2015 and 2016 , when hundreds of people were killed .
at that time , the violence forced the government to impose a nine-month state of emergency that was only lifted in august .
the unrest was provoked by a development scheme for the capital addis ababa that dissidents said amounted to land grabs and turned into broader anti-government demonstrations over political and human rights .
it included attacks on businesses , many of them foreign-owned , including farms growing flowers for export .
