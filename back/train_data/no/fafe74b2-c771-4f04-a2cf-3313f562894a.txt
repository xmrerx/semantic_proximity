beijing ( reuters ) - china has summoned a british official in beijing and lodged stern representations about recent comments from london expressing concern about a british rights activist being denied entry to hong kong , it said on friday .
ben rogers , a co-founder of britain s ruling conservative party s human rights commission , has been a vocal critic of chinese-ruled hong kong s treatment of human rights activists , including that of jailed student protest leader joshua wong .
he was denied entry to hong kong on oct. 11 .
britain said on tuesday it had summoned the chinese ambassador to express its concern .
chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang reiterated that hong kong is part of china , and the central government handles hong kong s foreign affairs and beijing and hong kong decide who to let in or not as a matter of chinese sovereignty .
china has already summoned in an official from the british embassy in beijing , and lodged stern representations about britain s recent series of wrong remarks and actions on this issue , lu told a daily news briefing .
i must to stress here that hong kong matters are purely an internal affair of china s. china will not permit any government , organization or individual to interfere in china s internal affairs in any way .
hong kong , which returned to chinese rule in 1997 , is governed under a one country , two systems formula that promises it a higher degree of autonomy and freedom than on the mainland .
last week , british foreign secretary boris johnson said london needed an explanation from hong kong and beijing about the treatment of rogers .
