moscow ( reuters ) - the kremlin said on friday that north korea s latest missile test was part of a series of unacceptable provocations and that the united nations security council was united in believing such launches should not be taking place .
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov made the comments to reporters on a conference call after pyongyang fired a missile that flew over japan s northern hokkaido far out into the pacific ocean on friday , deepening tension after its recent test of its most powerful nuclear bomb .
in russia we are deeply concerned about these provocative launches which are further stoking tensions .
clearly demonstrating that our position is that such launches are unacceptable is the most tangible thing we can do right now , said peskov .
judging by the united nations security council , that is a unanimous point of view which unites security council members .
peskov also said that president vladimir putin was expected to attend the zapad-2017 military exercises on monday and would observe the war games from a command center near st petersburg .
the war games have stirred unease in some countries because russian troops and military hardware will be training inside belarus , a russian ally which borders ukraine as well as nato member states poland , latvia and lithuania .
peskov said that putin had held a phone call with french president emmanuel macron earlier on friday .
he did not provide further details .
