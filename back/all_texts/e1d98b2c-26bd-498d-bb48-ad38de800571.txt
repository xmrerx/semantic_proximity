It s a federal offense to threaten a presidential candidate.
But is it a federal offense if the candidate is Donald Trump?
Would the media cover this story if a bar owner suggested a well-known attempted assassin kill Hillary?
Is it a clever joke or a threat?
Maybe a little bit of both?
A sign outside a bar is turning a lot of heads.The message is political and timely and if you understand the context, but it could be considered a possible threat on Donald Trump.
