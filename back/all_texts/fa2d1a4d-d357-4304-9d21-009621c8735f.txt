Native New Yorker and Republican front runner Donald Trump made his first-ever visit to the 9/11 Memorial and Museum on Saturday afternoon, and ended up p*ssing everyone off in the process.With his third wife Melania at his side, the business mogul took a 30-minute tour through the museum, making the press wait outside for him to finish.
While Trump might have enjoyed his little run-through of the museum, not everyone was happy about it and many of them took to social media o blast him for it.One Instagram user, josh_andew, posted a photo of the candidate and captioned it, Ugh a Trump sighting in NYC #Hillary2016 #NoTrump :InstagramTwitter also blew up with insults directed at the GOP candidate, many bringing up the fact that Trump has been the most anti-Muslim candidate, and criticizing him for using the museum visit as a campaign stunt.TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterThis tweet, in particular, nailed Trump s fake personality so well:TwitterNothing that Trump does is genuine, or without some sort of benefit in it for him.
In the years between the opening of the museum and the start of his campaign, Trump was apparently too busy to pay his respects to the thousands of people who were killed in the terrorist attacks even though he himself said that he lost hundreds of friends at the World Trade Center.But now because he s running for president, Trump is suddenly making it a priority to seem more appreciative of New York values than his rival Ted Cruz, who recently offended New Yorkers.
It s obvious that blasting Cruz was part of Trump s plan all along when you read the end of this statement from Trump s campaign:This statement comes just a day after Trump blasted Cruz at a rally, saying: Remember when he started lecturing me on New York values like we re no good?
We all know people who died, and I ve got this guy standing over there looking at me and talking to me about New York values with scorn on his face, with hatred of New York.
Trump had also made a $100,000 donation to the museum, which never received a cent from Trump s charitable foundation before he was running for president.
Actually, there isn t one 9/11-related nonprofit group that Trump made a contribution to until now, despite the fact that Trump feels so passionately about the rescue workers and survivors of the terror attacks.
Trump doesn t give a damn about the victims, survivors or families affected by 9/11 he only cares about making himself look better.
