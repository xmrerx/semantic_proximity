Rather than making America great again, Donald Trump is making American business owners in Florida go broke.Every time Trump spends the weekend at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, it costs taxpayers $3 million.
So far, Trump has spent nearly every weekend there since taking office, and the price tag has eclipsed $10 million.If Trump continues taking weekend vacations at his current pace, he ll outspend President Obama s entire eight years of vacation costs in just under a single year.Taxpayers are going to feel the burden of this, but business owners in Palm Beach are especially feeling the pain because Trump s frequent visits are literally going to put them out of business if he doesn t stop.Because of the extra security, businesses in Palm Beach are losing tens of thousands of dollars every weekend.
We re basically going broke, said a spokesperson on behalf of Southern Helicopter when approached for comment by NBC Nightly News.
We were not expecting him to come down almost every weekend.
But that s exactly what Trump is doing.Instead of working for the American people, Trump would rather spend his weekends playing golf and throwing lavish parties, and that is taking a toll on the local economy as taxpayers in Palm Beach County have to pony up $1.7 million for extra security when Trump is in town.And just as Trump stiffs his contractors when he owes them money, Trump is stiffing Palm Beach County after they asked the White House to reimburse the massive costs.Stellar Aviation Group president Jonathan Miller told NBC that his business is losing $30,000 every weekend when Trump is in town.
He fears his business will fold if Trump doesn t halt his trips soon.Here s the video via NBC.This is yet another example of Trump only caring about himself.
He is selfishly vacationing every weekend at taxpayer expense and it doesn t matter to him that local business owners are struggling to remain afloat as long as he gets to party and golf.NBC noted that Trump promised to rarely leave the White House during the campaign, and pointed out his hypocrisy since he often whined about President Obama s vacations.So Trump is a liar and a hypocrite who is making the local Palm Beach economy suffer.Americans should be outraged by this.
How can Trump claim that he is creating jobs when he constant vacations in Palm Beach alone are threatening to cause many people to lose their livelihoods.
Trump should be ashamed of himself and America should demand their wasted tax dollars back.Featured image via screenshot
