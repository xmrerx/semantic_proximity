stephanie ruhle of msnbc was on with a panel of liberals when she blurted out : i too have a pre-existing condition .
i m a woman , ruhle said to a panel that seemed to agree with her.the left has been broadening and redefining what a pre-existing condition is but this is ridiculous ! ruhle said that president trump will have a hands-off approach to healthcare now because he got his win , but another panelist couldn t let that comment go as he claimed five times that this was not a win for the president .
no , he didn t get a win .
he got something he could claim is a win .
it is so far from being a win ; it is disgusting what he does by having a ceremony in the white house rose garden making it seem like he has a win but he s doesn t have a win .
his win is not a reality .
the anger and hate runs deep with this group https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? time_continue=44 & v=twsh3jmvuau she s been in hot water before : oops !
she had to apologize for saying fox held their christmas party at the trump hotel .
