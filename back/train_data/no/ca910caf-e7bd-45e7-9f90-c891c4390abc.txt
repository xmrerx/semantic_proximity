caracas ( reuters ) - venezuela s government and opposition will resume efforts to hold dialogue , the third attempt in a year by the administration of president nicolas maduro and his adversaries to break up a bitter political stalemate .
previous dialogue efforts have ended in recriminations between the two sides and no concrete progress amid a dire economic crisis that has led to increased malnutrition and preventable diseases .
opposition leaders said that even though maduro has previously used the talks to stall for time instead of implementing serious reform , a new round would still be needed to help ensure free and fair presidential elections , which are currently scheduled for 2018 .
we have developed relations in latin america so that in the company of friendly countries and governments , we can facilitate the conditions for a presidential election , julio borges , president of the opposition-led national assembly , told a news conference .
the opposition in september walked away from dialogue with the ruling socialist party , insisting the government had not met demands including the release of imprisoned opposition activists and mechanisms to allow foreign humanitarian assistance .
legislator luis florido , spokesman for the opposition in the dialogue process , said the opposition would seek a new elections council and would push for presidential elections .
he added that paraguay , mexico and chile would accompany the process .
information minister jorge rodriguez said via twitter , the dialogue continues on nov 15 in the dominican republic .
the two sides in september held exploratory meetings with the backing of dominican president danilo medina .
