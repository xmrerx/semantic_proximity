STRASBOURG (Reuters) - The European Commission is not negotiating with London in a hostile way and assumes that the EU and Britain will reach a fair deal on Brexit, its president said on Tuesday.
I would like to say that the Commission is not negotiating in a hostile mood.
We want a deal.
Those who don t want a deal - the no-dealers - they have no friends in the Commission.
We want a fair deal, Jean-Claude Juncker told the European Parliament.
We will have a fair deal with Britain.
The no deal is not our working assumption, he continued.
