Leona Coakley-Spring has only been running her consignment shop, Rags to Riches, for a few months.
Coakley-Spring opened her dream business and settled into the ritzy Seattle, Washington suburb, only to be made to feel unwelcome.The trouble comes as Coakley-Spring made a horrifying discovery: a Ku Klux Klan robe amongst the dresses dropped off by a customer.
She considers the robe to be a threatening message, saying to local station Fox 13: You can t be a black business owner in downtown Redmond, you can t be her.
I didn t know what to do or what to say.
It was just so horrifying.
Coakley-Spring s son, Shane Coakley, documented the incident with photographs, which he then turned over to the authorities.
A sketch of the man believed to have left the racist robe, alongside photos of the robe itself, are being released to the public.
The cops are increasing their presence around the store, and consider what happened here a hate crime.
Coakley-Spring has obviously been deeply affected by this: I can t change the way I look.
But it makes me feel like I m not good enough.
And that s a bad feeling to have, that you re not good enough.
Hopefully, this wonderful woman realizes that it s these racists who have the problem, not her.
She even considered closing down over this, but so far, is hanging on: We close the store, and they would win And I don t want to give them any satisfaction.
Remember that, Ms. Coakley-Spring, every time you want to throw in the towel.
We re rooting for you.Watch a video news report below, via Fox 13:Featured image via screen capture from Raw Story
