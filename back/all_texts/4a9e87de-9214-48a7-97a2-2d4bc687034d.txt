The serious consequences of political correctness gone wild Women attending an anti-racism music festival in Sweden were raped and molested by migrant men in yet another shocking example of how the west is importing a real rape culture.
According to police spokesman Stefan Dangardt, numerous foreign men sexually assaulted the women during Borl nge s Peace and Love festival, although three suspects who were arrested were later released because they claimed they were minors.Several assaults were reported on Thursday, the first day of the festival, before one woman was raped in the middle of the audience during a concert on Friday night.On Saturday, another attempted rape was reported at midnight, in addition to six other reports of sexual molestation.In some cases, the migrant men would crowd around the women in groups, as was the case in Cologne on New Year s Eve when hundreds of women were sexually abused by Muslim asylum seekers and migrants.According to Dangardt, the culprits were foreign men, but he said he was restricted from checking on their actual age, suggesting that the attackers probably lied and pretended they were minors, which is a common tactic migrants use to escape punishment for their crimes.Crimes in Borl nge have tripled or even quadrupled since Sweden opened its doors to mass immigration in the 1970 s.According to reports, the area, which has a large Muslim population, is one of Sweden s infamous no go zones, where police and ambulance personnel are routinely attacked.
Two months ago, cars were set on fire and shop workers were attacked, although police claim the situation is calmer now.
The organizers of the festival responded to the incidents by blaming all men in general, which is exactly how feminist and leftist groups reacted after Cologne.This is by no means the first time Swedish women have been sexually assaulted at festivals by migrants.
As the New York Times reports, police are investigating reports that dozens of young women and girls were sexually assaulted at two music festivals in Sweden last weekend at the Bravalla Festival in Norrkoping and the Putte i Parken music festival in Karlstad.
Most of the attackers were identified as foreigners .
