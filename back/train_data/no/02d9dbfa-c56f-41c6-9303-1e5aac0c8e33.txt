while appearing on the cnn presidential town hall , donald trump likely made the most asinine statement ever uttered .
after being asked about israel , trump proceeds to tell wolf blitzer that president obama has been the worst thing to ever happen to israel .
he said : president obama the worst president that israel has ever probably one of the worst things that s ever happened to israel .
yeah , that damn obama ensuring diplomacy and trying to disarm a nuclear iran all while still making sure israel gets $ 8.6 million per day from us taxpayers .
totally awful for israel .
( sense the sarcasm ) donald trump clearly has no clue what he s talking about , because if he did , those words would have never been uttered out of his mouth.you know what would be terrible for israel , the entire middle east and the world ?
something that could very likely render a third world war because of leadership that doesn t know how to careful maneuver foreign diplomacy and policy ?
a republican presidency .
in particular , a trump presidency.trump is all talk , and this talk is just outright wrong.// < !
