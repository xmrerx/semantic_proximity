the only reality show donald trump should have ever been featured in is the biggest loser because he just got his ass handed to him in court.two years ago , trump national doral miami golf resort signed a contract worth $ 200,000 for a local business called the paint spot to provide paint used to renovate the golf course.well , guess who tried to stiff the paint spot of the final $ 34,863 payment in the deal ? yeah , that would be republican nominee donald j. trump.trump and his company refused to honor the contract by not paying the final payment , saying that they ve paid enough for the paint .
in other words , trump negotiated a deal that ended up costing him more in the end , just like the kinds of deals he wants to negotiate for america with the rest of the world.anyway , paint spot owner juan carlos enriquez filed suit against trump in court , and judge jorge cueto just slapped trump and his company with a $ 300,000 hit to cover the paint shop s attorney and court fees , nearly ten times more money than the $ 34,863 owed .
and trump still hasn t paid that debt , so how are we supposed to trust him to pay down the debt of en entire nation if he can t meet his own obligations ?
i m happy i have a judgment , enriquez told the miami herald .
but he [ trump ] hasn t paid yet .
you know how he says he ll surround himself with the greatest people if he is president ?
in this case , he might not be surrounded by the right people .
this isn t even the first fine trump has been ordered to pay this month.on the same day as his coronation as the republican party nominee last week , the national labor relations board slapped trump with an $ 11,200 fine for treating employees like shit because they tried to join a labor union.as it turns out , one employee was wrongfully fired and the other was retaliated against by denying them the promotion they had earned.for someone who claims to be the law and order candidate , trump sure does break the law a lot.featured image : christopher furlong/getty images
