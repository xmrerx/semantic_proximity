An Islamophobic sack of monkey turds called a mosque in Watauga, Texas, to threaten them with beheadings and tell them to get out of America.
This is a person who obviously believes that all Muslims hate America, because he said: F**k you, f**k Muhammad, f**k Islam.
This is America.
If you don t like the way we do s**t, get the f**k out.We ll start just cutting off the heads of all of you m*******rs.
Huh?
How would you like that?
Maybe we need another Christian crusade, which I think we do.
There is nothing to say to this but, Wow.
Just wow.
This person seems to want revenge on terrorist groups by harming innocent Muslim Americans.
ISIS regularly beheads people for all kinds of reasons, and it s true that Christians in Syria, Libya and Iraq are in danger from ISIS.
That makes people like this caller want to hold all Muslims responsible.Listen to some of his unhinged ranting below (warning: explicit language):This is someone who s apparently an Army veteran in addition to a Christian, and no doubt considers himself a paragon of patriotism for this.
Like other right-wing nutjobs who ve served, he doesn t understand that one of the things for which he served was freedom of religion, even religions with which he disagrees.Oh, but wait, these kinds of unhinged right-wing nuts think that freedom of religion only applies to Christianity, and maybe Judaism.
Islam?
They can go sit on rocks and rotate in these people s eyes.The mosque, sadly, regularly receives calls from bigots who buy into the right s narrative of hate and fear.
They ve never received a phone call this extreme, though, and they decided to report it to both the Watauga police and the FBI.
The truth is that someone who s this far gone is capable of anything.It s a sickening, but growing, problem, fanned by the likes of Donald Trump and Ted Cruz.In addition to alerting authorities, this mosque has issued a challenge to the population of their town: Come down to the masjid and visit and meet Muslims and people, and talk to us, and see what s going on.
We re just normal people who want to worship, practice our first amendment, worship freely without threat of violence.
The hate is born of willful ignorance, and this mosque is right that getting to know them can go a long way towards alleviating fear.
The fearful, cowering masses that include this nutboy, though, will never do that.
They thrive on their hate.
They love their fear.
It makes them feel righteous.
Mosques and Muslims are in danger from these people.
Here s hoping this bigot gets caught.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
