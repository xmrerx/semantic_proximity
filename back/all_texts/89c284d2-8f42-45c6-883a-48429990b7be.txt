You just don t expect it in our lives We re Americans.
I mean I feel like I in Africa or something.
I mean, I ve been in Africa at checkpoints before and it s scary.
You never know if you re getting through.
We re in Western United States, we re good people, we re easy to get along with.
We don t create trouble.
This is alarming.
This isn t the attention we want.
We re stewards.
We re good people.
We posted a video released by the FBI showing the shooting death of LaVoy Finicum, father of 11, who traveled to Oregon from Arizona to join the ranchers protest of the unfair treatment by the Federal Government s BLM agency.
Finicum was reportedly shot several times by federal agents during a traffic stop on Highway 395 in Harney County.His daughter, Challis Finch had this to say about her father: He s a great man, and just because he s dead doesn t mean his fight will not go on.
He s now a martyr.
