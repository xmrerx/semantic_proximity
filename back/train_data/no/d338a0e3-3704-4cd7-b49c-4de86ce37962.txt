cairo ( reuters ) - three police officers were killed and eight others injured in a shoot-out during a raid on a suspected militant hideout in giza , southwest of the egyptian capital , two security sources said on friday .
the sources said authorities were following a lead to an apartment thought to house eight suspected members of hasm , a group which has claimed several attacks around the capital targeting judges and policemen since last year .
the suspected militants fled after the exchange of fire there , the sources said .
egypt accuses hasm of being a militant wing of the muslim brotherhood , an islamist group it outlawed in 2013 .
the muslim brotherhood denies this .
an islamist insurgency in the sinai peninsula has grown since the military overthrew president mohamed mursi of the muslim brotherhood in mid-2013 following mass protests against his rule .
the militant group staging the insurgency pledged allegiance to islamic state in 2014 .
it is blamed for the killing of hundreds of soldiers and policemen and has started to target other areas , including egypt s christian copts .
