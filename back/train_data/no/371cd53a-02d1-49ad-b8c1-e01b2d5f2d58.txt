donald trump s inauguration was one of the most disappointing in american history , but he keeps desperately trying to sell it as one of the best.actual attendance at trump s inauguration didn t even get close to a million people as aerial photos show that much of the national mall was empty by the time trump delivered his divisive and negative inaugural address.neilson television ratings for trump s inauguration were not much better as 31 million tuned in to watch a national tragedy unfold before their eyes.but trump is bragging about this number on twitter and comparing it to president obama s second inauguration ratings as if he thinks he deserves some sort of prize for cherry-picking an inauguration that got lower ratings.wow , television ratings just out : 31 million people watched the inauguration , 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 22 , 2017the problem is that trump deliberately chose to compare his inauguration to president obama s second inauguration because his numbers were far lower than obama s first inauguration .
and twitter once again brutally flattened trump s fragile ego with a reality check .. @ realdonaldtrump donald , i m worried you re treating the united states presidency like a television show , dear .

@ realdonaldtrump except that you should compare your ratings to obama s in 2009 , not 2013 .
and in 2009 , obama had 38 million viewers .
oops simon hedlin ( @ simonhedlin ) january 22 , 2017donald trump is supposed to be president now , but he is acting far from presidential and is only demonstrating that he will be just as petty , vain , and thin-skinned as ever before and those traits will only amplify because he has a bigger platform now.featured image via pete souza
