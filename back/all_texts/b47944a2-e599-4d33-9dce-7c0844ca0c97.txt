With Donald Trump winning the election, albeit only via Electoral College because Hillary Clinton kicked his ass in the popular vote by over 2.6 million votes, many have been voicing their opinions as to why they don t like the president-elect.Clearly having enough of the Hollywood hates Trump trope being pushed around by the media, Seth MacFarlane lays out why in the most honest way imaginable.
He posts to Twitter this perfect explanation: Wanna know why Hollywood folks hate Trump?
We live and work amongst his kind every day out here.
His tactics are those employed by the shiftiest of agents, lawyers, and publicists.
We ve learned to recognize the blustery showmanship of a lying con man because we encounter it every day in our business.
We ve learned to smell it, because it s bitten so many of us in the ass.
Most of us love America a hell of a lot, and we don t want America to be conned the way many of us have ourselves.
Trump is not of the People.
Trump is of Hollywood.
And that s the problem.

You are given promises and told whatever you need to hear so that people can get what they need from you, and then they ll up and leave you without even the courtesy of an email or call.Of course, this isn t true of everyone, but in general, this is the case pretty much most of the time, and Seth MacFarlane clearly knows this.Most of Hollywood can likely smell the bullsh*t of Trump 1,000 miles away.
He s lying to get what he wants and doesn t care who he hurts as long as he gets his.
Trump is the epitome of Hollywood, and Seth MacFarlane is exactly right.Trump voters were duped by a conman, and they ll soon find out the error of their ballot.Featured Photo by Christopher Polk/Getty Images
