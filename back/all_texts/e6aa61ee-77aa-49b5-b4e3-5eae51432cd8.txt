WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration next week will propose a 1.6 percent pay increase for federal employees, an administration official said on Wednesday.
The proposal will be included in President Barack Obamaâ€™s budget proposal for fiscal year 2017, which is set to be unveiled on Tuesday.
The pay raise would apply to military and civilian personnel, the official said in a statement.
Federal government workers received a 1.3 percent pay raise this fiscal year as a part of the government funding package that was passed into law in December.
