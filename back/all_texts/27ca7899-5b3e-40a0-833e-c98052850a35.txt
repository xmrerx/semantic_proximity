Anonymous has hacked a number of pro-ISIS Twitter accounts in response to the mass shooting that occurred at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida.The hacker responsible for the action defaced the accounts, mocking them by changing their accounts to display LGBT Pride-themed images and posted gay porn.Twitter responded to an inquiry from CBS local San Francisco affiliate about the matter.
They responded by saying: We condemn the use of Twitter to promote terrorism and the Twitter Rules make it clear that this type of behavior, or any violent threat, is not permitted on our service.
Since the middle of 2015 alone, we ve suspended over 125,000 accounts for threatening or promoting terrorist acts, primarily related to ISIS.
Here are some screenshots that the hacker posted to Twitter:#Daesh in #Irag @dygft9uy4 Still remembering those we lost.

Hackers associated with the collective have vowed to take down and deface as many pro-ISIS outlets they can.
In 2015, a message was put out by the group calling for total war against the terrorist group.
Since then, it has been reported that hackers have taken down tens of thousands of ISIS Twitter accounts.
They also took down a major ISIS website and replaced it with an advertisement for Viagra.Omar Marteen, the gunman responsible for the massacre in Orlando, called 911 just before he went on a shooting spree where he pledged allegiance to ISIS.
Investigators have yet to release information as to whether was actually responsible for the attack as they have claimed to have.
Reports show that Marteen had previously claimed to support the Taliban, Al Nusra, and Hezbollah in addition to ISIS.
The fact that these groups are all currently at war with each other suggests that Mateen was not actually working with any international terrorist organizations but was influenced by their propaganda.Featured image from screenshot via Twitter
