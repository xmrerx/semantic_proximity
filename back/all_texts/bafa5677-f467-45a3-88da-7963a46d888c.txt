Anyone with half a brain knows that foods like fried chicken and watermelon have historically been used to disparage African Americans.
It s another part of our ugly history here, dating back to slavery and Jim Crow.
The idea is to depict us as lazy and intellectually inferior to our white counterparts.
So, with that in mind, what does the owner of a Texas diner do in celebration of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day?
Runs a lunch special of chicken and waffles with a side of watermelon.Sabrina Pyle, who owns Azle Cafe in the Texas town of the same name, insists she wasn t being racist by celebrating a civil rights icon like Martin Luther King, Jr., by promoting racist stereotypes, but it was too late.
Someone saw the social media post promoting her bigoted lunch special, and soon, all of Facebook and other platforms were calling her out on her bullshit.
Pyle defended herself by saying: I wasn t thinking about the historical (context).
I was thinking, we have margaritas and tacos on Cinco de Mayo, so, let s have some fun with Martin Luther King Day.
I just did something distasteful.
I just didn t think it through.
No, you did something racist.
Yeah, we all know your response will be a vehement denial of any racism on your part, but you need to realize how harmful this stuff is, and I hope your business suffers for it.
I never thought I d say this, but I wish I lived in Texas just so I could boycott that shitty little diner of yours.
I am sure there are enough fine people around your area to take that mantle up, though.Watch the local news report below, via WFAA:Featured image via screen capture
