Yesterday, the Trump administration delivered a bombshell that no one saw coming that former Breitbart News chief Steve Bannon, who is now serving as Trump s White House strategist, was being kicked off the National Security Council.
While Bannon released a statement that seemed neutral enough, it turns out that s not how he really feels at all and Trump is in trouble.According to a new report by the New York Times, Bannon aggressively disagreed with the decision to demote him.
In fact, he was apparently so pissed off over being booted off the council that he even threatened to completely leave his position in the administration.
The Times wrote: Mr. Bannon resisted the move, even threatening at one point to quit if it went forward, according to a White House official who, like others, insisted on anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
Mr. Bannon s camp denied that he had threatened to resign and spent the day spreading the word that the shift was a natural evolution, not a signal of any diminution of his outsize influence.
Considering the fact that Bannon did not show up at Trump s press conference with Jordan s King Abdullah II, some bitterness on Bannon s part makes absolute sense.Bannon s position on the National Security Council has been controversial to begin with it was a role he basically tricked Trump into giving him.
Trump had signed off on an executive order without actually knowing what it said and later got upset that he d accidentally and unknowingly given Bannon a position that he probably wasn t meant to have.
Bannon had no relevant experience for a position on the National Security Council, but we all know that s hardly a prerequisite for a job in the Trump administration.
Unfortunately for Trump, the White House is crumbling due to its own erratic, inexperienced staff.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images
