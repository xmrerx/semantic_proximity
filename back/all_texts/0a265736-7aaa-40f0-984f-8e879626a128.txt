On Independence Day, National Public Radio tweeted the entire Declaration of Independence to accompany their annual reading of the most important document in our nation s history.In Congress, July 4, 1776.

NPR (@NPR) July 4, 2017We hold these truths to be self-evident, NPR (@NPR) July 4, 2017that all men are created equal, NPR (@NPR) July 4, 2017that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, NPR (@NPR) July 4, 2017that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
NPR (@NPR) July 4, 2017 and so on.To people who generally listen to NPR and are typically well-informed (or anyone who graduated kindergarten), this was a wonderful expression of patriotism to be proud of.
Then, of course, there are conservatives.While our frenemies on the Right love to wave their flags and call themselves patriots, the Declaration of Independence is apparently on their reading lists alongside the first half of the Second Amendment and parts of the Bible they can use to attack human rights.
Conservatives swarmed NPR to whine and cry because they thought the tweets were get this an attack on Donald Trump.When NPR got to this part, things got a bit crazy:it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, NPR (@NPR) July 4, 2017Seriously, check this out.stop it braeden (@wokepolitik) July 4, 2017The responses to @NPR tweeting the Declaration of Independence are sort of hilarious and sad all at once ???

The reaction to the Declaration of f*cking Independence shows us why.Featured image via screengrab
