Donald Trump unveiled his vice presidential pick on Friday.
He had claimed that he would postpone the announcement due to the tragedy that took place in France on Thursday night, but for whatever reason, he skipped the normal fanfare and tweeted out the announcement of Indiana governor Mike Pence as his running mate just before 11 am.Along with the name of his VP, he also revealed a new campaign logo to the world.Via Twitter screen captureTwitter was quick to respond to his new logo with all the brutal mockery we have come to expect from the social media platform.
Never one to disappoint, the result was absolutely hilarious.Many people picked up on the whole TP and toilet paper thing.
Of course, you can t think about TP without thinking about Beavis and the Great Cornholio.The new #TrumpPence logo is for crap!

T-P.
Toilet Paper.
Obviously a joke waiting to be made.
So you include it in your official logo design?
C mon #AmateurHour Tanner S. Salyers (@TannerSalyers) July 15, 2016Question from #TrumpPence new logo: is the TP campaign single-ply, double-ply, triple-ply extra-padded with racism?

#TrumpPence stole the old @thinkprogress logo.
PLEASE tell me they had it trademarked!

All at once.

Regardless, the resulting comments on Twitter were definitely the best part of Trump s VP announcement.Featured image via Aaron P. Bernstein/Getty Images
