dakar ( reuters ) - saudi arabia has pledged $ 100 million to a new regional military force battling jihadist groups in west africa s sahel region , force member mali said on monday .
the contribution would be a major boost to the cash-strapped force and bring pledged commitments to more than half the roughly $ 500 million the g5 sahel says it needs for its first year of operations .
the g5 sahel - composed of the armies of mali , mauritania , niger , burkina faso and chad - launched its first military campaign in october amid growing unrest in the sahel , whose porous borders are regularly crossed by jihadists , including affiliates of al qaeda and islamic state .
those groups have stepped up attacks on civilian and military targets , including tourist attractions in regional capitals , raising fears the zone will become a new breeding ground for militants .
mali s foreign ministry said saudi arabian authorities made the pledge during a visit to the kingdom late last month by malian foreign minister abdoulaye diop .
saudi arabia s foreign ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
the sunni muslim kingdom is competing with its main rival , shi ite power iran , for influence across west africa and other parts of the muslim world .
donors from both countries have given money to mosques and other causes there .
france , the g5 s most vocal foreign backer , has pressed saudi arabia to take concrete actions to fight islamist militants .
french president emmanuel macron asked saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman to contribute to the g5 when he saw him in riyadh last month .
the european union , france , the united states and each of the g5 countries have also promised to fund the force .
