conservatives are throwing a collective hissy fit because president obama defended colin kaepernick s constitutional right to protest by not standing for the national anthem.the san francisco 49ers quarterback has been sitting during the national anthem in protest of the police brutality and inequality black people have been facing for years .
conservatives have been bashing kaepernick ever since , questioning his patriotism and telling him to leave the country but now he has his strongest ally yet.on monday , president obama , who taught constitutional law for twelve years , confirmed that kaepernick does indeed have the right to sit during the national anthem if he so chooses .
my understanding at least is that he s exercising his constitutional right to make a statement , president obama told reporters during his trip to china .
i think there s a long history of sports figures doing so .
indeed , muhammad ali and jackie robinson are just two of the african-american sports heroes who were doing this kind of protest long before kaepernick came along .
but i don t doubt his sincerity based on what i ve heard , obama continued .
i think he cares about some real legitimate issues that have to be talked about .
if nothing else what he s done is he s generated more conversation around some topics that need to be talked about .
here s the video via youtube.but conservatives , as usual , responded to president obama by letting their racism fly .
@ foxnews @ potus @ kaepernick7 of course he would side with an anti-american mulatto .

cornelius felder ( @ yogi1115 ) september 5 , 2016 @ foxnews nothing keeps blacks from achieving in the usa now but a victim mindset .
injustice/racism are used when they have failed themselves empirical guru ( @ empiricalguru ) september 5 , 2016contrary to what most conservatives think , while president obama did support kaepernick s right to sit during the national anthem , that doesn t mean he agrees with it .
president obama also acknowledged that some veterans feel disrespected by it and said there are other ways to protest.but african-americans have tried several ways to protest police brutality and inequality , and so far , conservatives have found any reason to whine no matter what just like they do about anything president obama says or does.featured image via screenshot
