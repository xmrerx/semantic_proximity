President Obama gave America, and the world, a reminder of the better side of politics today by posting a hilarious video of himself and Hamilton star Lin-Manuel Miranda rapping outside the White House.The cast of the Broadway hit Hamilton came to the White House to perform songs about the Founding Fathers, with the show s creator and Obama even taking time to hang out in the Rose Garden and deliver some freestyle rap.The pair stand together, accompanied by a Redcoat Drummer, poised and ready to drop their beats.
Miranda breaks into laughter as the President kicks off the rap by looking sternly into the camera and saying: This some serious business right here in his best ghetto voice.Obama holds up cue cards while Miranda then freestyle raps on whatever subject comes up.
The cards include Constitution, POTUS, Obamacare, the Federalist papers (ouch!
), the Obama family dogs Sunny and Bo, NASA, carbon footprint, congress, innovation, SCOTUS, and immigrants to which Miranda riffs: we get the job done!
The President smiled widely at the end of the footage, saying:The post immediately of course, did go viral.
Notching up over 8 million views in less than an hour and continuing to attract viewers from across the country and the world.
Supporters were moved by the President giving the nation a reason to be cheerful, amidst the controversy and bitterness of the Trump campaign.However, for conservatives who are busy burning with rage and looking for non-whites to sucker punch on behalf of their glorious leader two men making music in a bid to educate young people about the country is an abomination.Their reaction got a little hysterical.The reactions underscore how bizarre the situation has become in conservative camps.
Every last thing is a partisan issue, and somehow related to Benghazi.
It s just a rap fellas, calm down.Featured image via Screengrab
