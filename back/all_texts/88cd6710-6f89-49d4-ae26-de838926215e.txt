Donald Trump s presidency may be going great for him and his best friend Vladimir Putin, but his daughter s bottom line is really taking a pounding from his authoritarian policies.
Yes, Daddy s little girl was likely hoping like the rest of her family that she would be able to use her father s position to make a lot of money, but things aren t working out quite that way.Nordstrom was recently targeted by the Grab Your Wallet campaign, which encourages people to avoid shopping at any stores that do business with the Trumps.
Bloomberg reports that the department store chain has elected (like other businesses) to stop selling Ivanka Trump s brand this season based on abysmal sales.
Whether this was because every single one of her products, like every member of the Trump family, save Barron, is terrible, or because of the boycotts cannot be said for sure, but in any case, her products have already disappeared from the retailer s online store.
Some products will remain on the shelves for now, but they will be gone as well.
In this case, based on the brand s performance, we ve decided not to buy it for this season, the company said in a statement.
Grab Your Wallet co-founder Shannon Coulter says she is thrilled with Nordstrom s decision to drop Ivanka Trump.
Though some Trump supporters are threatening their own boycott if Nordstrom drops Ivanka s sh*tty merchandise, they can t expect much sympathy from the company.
In an email to employees, co-president Pete Nordstrom said that the concept of if people don t buy it, we won t sell it applies in this situation.Though the company says the decision is sales-driven, it is entirely possible that they just want to distance themselves from Ivanka, who has already attempted to use her father s presidency to push her products.
Her company sent a style alert to journalists Monday promoting a bracelet that Ivanka wore during an interview with 60 Minutes about her father a clear sign that the Trumps know nothing about avoiding conflicts of interest:As Donald Trump continues to threaten to send troops to Mexico, f*ck up diplomatic relationships with countries that have been our strongest allies since World War I, waste our tax dollars on his stupid wall, and attempt to discriminate against an entire religion solely based on his own bigotry, we can expect his daughter s brand to continue to suffer as well it should.Featured image via Boston Globe
