last year obama added an action to his manifesto that would forever put him in the cross-hairs of americans nationwide when he announced that he would be normalizing diplomatic relations with communist-cuba .
cuban-americans were deeply offended and angered that obama would extend the hand of friendship to the very regime that ha tortured and murdered their family members for years simply for having an opinion.here are just a few facts from obamas policy on cuba : * general tourist travel is still prohibited , but americans authorized to visit cuba for any of a dozen specific reasons can do so without first obtaining a special license from the government .
the 12 categories of acceptable travel include family visits , official visits , journalistic , professional , educational and religious activities , and public performances .
* licensed u.s. travelers to cuba can use credit cards and spend money in the country , and are able to import $ 400 worth of goods from cuba , including up to $ 100 in tobacco and alcohol products .
* americans can send more money to cubans , up to $ 2,000 every three months instead of the $ 500 currently permitted .
* u.s. citizens can bring home small amounts of cuban cigars .
* u.s. companies will be able to export cell phones , televisions , memory and recording devices , computers and software to cuba .
cuba is known to have poor internet and telecommunications infrastructure.thankfully in miami on friday , trump announced at his rally that when elected he would be undoing that order unless cuba met our demands first.trump promised to stand with the cuban people in their fight against communist oppression and condemned obama s concessions to the castro regime .
all of the concessions that barack obama has granted the castro regime were done through executive order , which means the next president can reverse them , and that , i will do , unless the castro regime meets our demands not my demands , our demands .
obama can t really seem to shock us anymore however , he has made deals and woven ties with numerous terroristic countries over his 8 years in office , and yet we still see no actually improvement in our own country .
january 2017 will be a blessing for sure.h/t [ conservative tribune ]
