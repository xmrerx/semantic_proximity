When former Tea Party congressman Joe Walsh decided to lash out at President Obama over a U.N. resolution condemning illegal Israeli settlements, it didn t go well.Earlier this week, the United Nations passed a formal resolution condemning Israel s continued refusal to stop building settlements on Palestinian land.
Predictably, conservatives lost their sh*t and have been attacking Obama and the United Nations ever since.Joe Walsh, after having been praised for ripping Donald Trump a new one for refusing to acknowledge that Russia meddled with the election, decided that he missed being despised.
So he accused President Obama of being a Muslim because he thinks only a Muslim would refuse to block a resolution condemning Israel.For the past week, everybody has been asking again why Obama hates Israel.
The answer is simple really: I think Obama is Muslim.
/1 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 29, 2016I ve been saying that for awhile now.
It makes the GOP uneasy when I say he s a Muslim.
It makes my radio stations uneasy when I say it.
/2 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 29, 2016I say it because I believe it.
Look, I know there are many other radio talk show hosts, many other members of Congress /3 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 29, 2016 many other Fox News personalities who privately believe Obama is Muslim but are afraid to say it publicly in fear of losing ratings.
/4 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 29, 2016For better or worse, I m not afraid to say it publicly.
I think Obama is Muslim.
I think in his head and in his heart he has always been.
/5 Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 29, 2016And I think it explains Obama s hatred toward Israel and explains his weakening of America these past 8 years.It s not complicated.
/x Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 29, 2016And Twitter users promptly BURIED Walsh for his idiocy and bigotry.

I guess he was Muslim too.
Stephen Xian (@stephenxian) December 29, 2016@WalshFreedom I suppose you think Hitler was a Muslim?
Was Henry Ford Muslim?
Exactly how deep does your idiocy go, Walsh?
Bill Beck (@Writer614) December 30, 2016For better or worse, I m not afraid 2 say it publicly.
I think Joe Walsh is a deadbeat dad.
I think in his head & heart he has always been.

Do you idiots even hear yourselves think?
Jerry Johnson (@Sr_Penalosa) December 29, 2016@Sr_Penalosa @6r8i @RAZORX50 @WalshFreedom he would have to be the worst practicing Muslim celebrating Christmas and drinking beer.
John Dude (@airwayupthere) December 29, 2016Conservatives like Walsh continue to disrespect President Obama in every way but expect Americans to bow down and kiss Trump s ass, which makes them hypocrites.Featured image via Flickr
