donald trump must really think black people are stupid.the republican nominee has been making a series of pathetic attempts to reach out to black voters on the campaign trail recently as his poll numbers continue to implode .
what the hell do you have to lose , trump asked black voters in front of a white audience earlier this week as he claimed they all live in neighborhoods that are war zones , have bad schools , are unemployed , and live in poverty.well , trump took to twitter on thursday and made yet another pathetic effort to fool black voters into thinking that he actually gives a damn about them.once again , trump claimed poverty and crime are up in african-american communities while claiming that employment is down .
i will fix it , promise , he tacked on at the end.so many in the african-american community are doing so badly , poverty and crime way up , employment and jobs way down : i will fix it , promise donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) august 25 , 2016of course , trump is talking out of his ass.as it turns out the black poverty rate over the last two decades favors hillary clinton and is really damning for republicans.according to blackdemographics.com : during the decade of the 1990s while the nation was experiencing an economic boom the poverty rate of black families dropped from 29 % in 1990 to 19 % in 2000 virtually cutting the disparity in half .
the economic downturn in the decade from 2000 to 2010 caused the increase of the black family poverty rate to 24 % .
since 2010 the black family poverty rate began to decrease sightly reaching 23 % in 2014 , however the disparity has remained relatively unchanged since 2000.as we all know , bill clinton was president in the 1990s and he presided over a strong economy that benefited just about everyone , including african-americans .
but then george w. bush took over and black families began to slip back below the poverty line , especially during the great recession.in addition , trump over-exaggerates the crime in black communities and his claim that the unemployment rate among blacks is up is bullshit , too .
in fact , it s been cut nearly in half since 2011.so twitter ripped trump a new one .
.
