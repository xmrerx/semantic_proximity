athens ( reuters ) - nine turkish citizens were charged in greece with terrorism-related offences on wednesday , accused of hoarding explosives and of links to an outlawed militant organization responsible for suicide bombings in turkey .
the arrest of eight men and a woman in early-morning raids at three locations in central athens on tuesday came days before an expected state visit by tayyip erdogan , the first by a turkish president to greece in 65 years .
greece says the two events are unrelated .
police officials said they were being questioned for alleged links to the leftist dhkp/c , a far-left group blamed for a string of attacks and suicide bombings in turkey since 1990 .
their lawyer said the individuals , who have not been named , were struggling against a fascist regime and had denied any wrongdoing .
they were charged with setting up and being members of a criminal organization , terrorist-related acts of supply and possession of explosive materials , illegal possession of firearms , smoke bombs and fire crackers , court sources said .
the individuals , escorted handcuffed into a central athens court wearing bullet proof vests , have not entered a formal plea .
they are refugees , lawyer alexandra zorbala said .
some have sought , others have received asylum ... they are fighters who are struggling against a fascist regime , against torture and thousands of arrests .
.
one of the charges they face is resisting arrest .
at least one of the defendants entered the courthouse with a black eye .
one of the detainees had been wanted by greek police in connection with an arms and explosives haul off the greek island of chios , close to the turkish coast , in 2013 .
turkey s erdogan is widely expected to visit greece in december , although his visit has not been officially announced .
