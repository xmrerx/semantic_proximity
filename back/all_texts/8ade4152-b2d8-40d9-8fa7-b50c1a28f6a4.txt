TALLINN (Reuters) - NATO head Jens Stoltenberg said on Thursday all countries must comply with sanctions on North Korea as the international community ratchets up pressure on the reclusive regime following its largest nuclear test to date.
Asked if he was worried that Russia was resisting stepping up U.N. Security Council sanctions on North Korea, Stoltenberg told reporters before meeting the European Union s defense ministers: There are already sanctions agreed in the UN and it is extremely important that those sanctions are fully implemented.
