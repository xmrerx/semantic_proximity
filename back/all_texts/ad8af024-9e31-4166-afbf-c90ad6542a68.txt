It is now 14 days until Donald Trump takes over the White House and he is STILL whining about Hillary Clinton.We know Trump still has a bruised ego from losing the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes, but continuing to attack Hillary and brag about how he won is getting old and displays a childishness that no other president-elect has ever displayed.Hillary and the Dems were never going to beat the PASSION of my voters.
They saw what was happening in the last two weeks before the Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017and knew they were in big trouble which is why they cancelled their big fireworks at the last minute.THEY SAW A MOVEMENT LIKE NEVER BEFORE Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017Hopefully, all supporters, and those who want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will go to D.C. on January 20th.
It will be a GREAT SHOW!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017Trump is absolutely obsessed with Election Day and continues to pretend that the Trump movement is this massive thing we ve never seen before.
But again, the facts remains that he lost the popular vote and his electoral win is one of the smallest in American history, like his hands.And Twitter users were quick to humiliate Trump.
@realDonaldTrump She was more popular than you by close to 3,000,000 votes.
Because math ??

The campaign is over & now you have an actual job to do.
Also realize that the new job will limit tanning bed time Kevin (@TheKevinDent) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump Many of your supporters have passion for nativism and jingoism, and they feed into your dangerous leadership qualities.
Jeffrey Guterman (@JeffreyGuterman) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump it s true, racists can be very passionate Andrew W Chamings (@AndrewChamings) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump seriously, how is this helping to heal division and unite America?
It still sounds embarrassingly like you are campaigning.

Hint: Petulant insecurity isn t leadership.

But, semantics.

Abraham Joffe (@Abrahamjoffe) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump Did you win?

Joe Harris (@joeharris) January 6, 2017Donald Trump needs to stop bitching and bragging on Twitter and start focusing on the toughest job in the world.
Anything less is unacceptable and a disservice to our country.Featured image via sreeenshot
