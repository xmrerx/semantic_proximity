Just hours after Trump told millions of voters to watch Alicia Machado s sex tape, it turns out no such tape exists, and the woman in the said tape is a pornographic actress who has a resemblance to the former Miss Universe contestant.That s quite a candidate you got there, Republicans.In a bizarre early morning Twitter tirade, the Republican nominee for president slammed disgusting Alicia Machado, accusing the Clinton camp of expediting her immigration process so she could help her in a debate:Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016Shortly after Clinton brought up Muchado in the first presidential debate, websites (with no credibility) began circulating a claim that Muchado was a pornographic actress:Former Miss Universe winner Alicia Machado, who has been campaigning against Republican nominee Donald Trump for the Hillary Clinton campaign, has appeared in pornographic videos.Snippets of an adult film starring Machado are available on multiple free porn websites.
Machado also appeared topless in Mexican Playboy in 2006 and 2012.
Hillary Clinton invoked the 1996 Miss Universe winner in an attack on Trump during Monday s debate.While it is true Machado posed nude for Playboy magazine, the notion that Machado is a pornographic actress or has a sex tape (that can be viewed by the public) is a completely bogus rumor that has been circulating the internet for years.
The only thing that could even come close to a sex tape is low quality footage from a Spanish reality television program La Granja, in which Machado was kicked off for reportedly having sexual relations with a cast member.
The act was caught on a grainy night vision camera from the studio that run 24/7.And Trump was stupid enough to believe internet rumors kind of like how he believes the National Enquirer.According to Snopes, which looked into the claim:In 2009, a video clip purportedly showing the former Miss Universe winner engaging in anal sex was circulated online, and that is the clip that now most frequently shows up in response to web searches on the phrase Alicia Machado porn..
However, the woman seen in that video is not Alicia Machado the clip was taken from the 2004 DVD Apprentass 4, which features porn actress Angel Dark, and was later retitled to suggest it showed Alicia Machado.Good job, Trump!
You just asked 320 million Americans to watch Angel Dark have sex in a movie that bears a resemblance to your TV show s name.I can t wait to see how Republicans defend this one.Remember when a presidential candidate attempted to slut-shame someone, and told people to watch a sex tape (which doesn t exist) because he got his feelings hurt after being called out?Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images
