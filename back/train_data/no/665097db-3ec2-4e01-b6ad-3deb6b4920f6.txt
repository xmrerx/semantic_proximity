( reuters ) - hurricane irma , one of the most powerful atlantic storms in half a century , has triggered hurricane and storm surge warnings for south florida and the florida keys , the u.s. national hurricane center ( nhc ) said on thursday .
irma , which is about 585 miles ( 940 km ) east-southeast of miami , florida , packing maximum sustained winds of 165 miles per hour ( 270 kph ) , will continue to bring life-threatening wind , storm surge , and rainfall hazards to the turks and caicos islands and the bahamas through saturday , the nhc said .
irma should maintain a west-northwestward trajectory but slow down during the next 36 hours , it added .
