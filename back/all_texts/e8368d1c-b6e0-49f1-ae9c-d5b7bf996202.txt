Comedic icon Tim Allen is taking on microagressions in the latest episode of ABC sitcom Last Man Standing.
In Friday night s installment, entitled Precious Snowflake, Allen, who plays conservative family man Mike Baxter, goes head-to-head with his daughter Mandy over the issue on college campuses.After being asked to speak at her business school s graduation ceremony, Baxter learns his speech has to be examined beforehand to remove any microagressions or objectionable words or phrases.
I know what microagressions are, Baxter says.
It s the liberal attack on free speech and a lot of fun if you do them right.
As Baxter begins to read his prepared statement, he is immediately reprimanded by Mandy for using the term ladies and gentlemen.
No, uh, you can t say, Ladies and gentlemen, Mandy says.
Because it excludes those who don t identify as either.
To quote future Nobel Prize winner Lee Greenwood, I m proud to be an American.
Not just because I have the right to speak my mind or carry an awesome gun, but because it s the land of opportunity, Baxter reads.
Some whiny babies might not think so, but in America, if you work hard, anyone can be successful.
Vanessa responds hesitantly by noting the university will almost certainly find his speech problematic.
The thought police are never gonna approve that speech, she says.
