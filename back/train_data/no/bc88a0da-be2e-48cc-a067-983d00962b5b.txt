a group of mostly pro-life college students came together in detroit last weekend to stand up for the most vulnerable among us .
they were praying to end abortion when a group of loud , vile protesters approached them and and start screaming , my body is true , don t like it , f * ck you !
in their faces .
while protesters screamed at them , the pro-lifers remained calm and peaceful , while praying and doing their best to ignore them .
the more they prayed the rosary , the louder the vile protesters screamed at them , not my ovaries , screw your rosary .
these pro-abortion advocates are doing exactly what democrats are encouraging and even paying them to do .
party leaders like our former president barack obama and now hillary are becoming more and more engaged and vocal in their support of these nasty people .
hillary just released a video of herself telling democrats to , keep fighting !
against trump and the opposition.democrats are bullying innocent people simply because they have an opposing view .
they re attempting to shut down free speech and freedom of religion by threatening people who don t agree with them .
is this really how they plan to save their party ?
is this how they prove they re the party of tolerance or compassion and love ?
is this the future of the democrat party ?
: watch protesters interrupt a pastor during his opening prayer in a town hall meeting being hosted by republican senator cassidy of la .
we all know that these people are being paid , but are they really doing the democrat party any favors by behaving in such a vile and disrespectful way during an opening prayer ?
