copenhagen ( reuters ) - danish police said on saturday divers had found the head and the legs of swedish journalist kim wall , who died in mysterious circumstances on an inventor s homemade submarine .
peter madsen has been charged with killing the swedish journalist who disappeared after she went on a trip with him in his submarine on august 10 .
he denies the charges .
madsen , a dane , was arrested after his submarine sank and he was rescued .
his lawyer betina hald engmark told reuters that she had been informed of the development , but had not received any material or documentation and decline further comment .
police identified a headless female torso that washed ashore in copenhagen later in august as wall s , but a cause of death has not been determined .
madsen has said wall died in an accident when she was hit by a heavy hatch cover on board his submarine .
on saturday a police spokesman told reporters in copenhagen that there were no fractures to wall s skull .
the body parts , a knife and some of wall s clothes in bags weighted down by bits of metal were found in koge bay on friday by danish navy divers who are assisting the police .
police spokesman jens moller jensen told reporters on saturday that the body parts will be investigated further to try and determine a cause of death .
he said that the madsen and his lawyers had not had time yet to react to the new evidence .
a police prosecutor said earlier this week that officers had found images which we presume to be real of women being strangled and decapitated on peter madsen s computer in a laboratory he ran .
madsen said the computer searched by police was not his but was used by everyone in the laboratory .
