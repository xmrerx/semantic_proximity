Interim Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Donna Brazile was crystal clear in what she thinks of Donald Trump and the bombshell tape that showed him boasting about sexual assault: This is who Donald Trump truly is.
During an interview on ABC s This Week, Brazile told George Stephanopoulos that Trump is the same person today as he was in 2005 when the appalling tape was recorded.
You can draw a straight line between what Donald Trump said in 2005 and what he s been saying every day on the campaign trail over the last year and a half, she said on Sunday.
This is not a changed man.
This is who Donald Trump truly is.
The DNC chair listed a few of the previous offensive remarks Trump has made on the campaign trail and pointed to these as more examples that confirmed Trump has not changed.
He was and is a revolting human being.
When you criticize a judge simply because of his Mexican heritage.
When you call women some of the most disgusting things.
When you criticize John McCain.
When you criticize people who are disabled.
This is who Donald Trump truly is.
Brazile doesn t seem surprised by this newest tape from the past.
After all, this is someone who is accused of raping a 13-year-old child.
With everything Trump has done, bragging about grabbing women by the p*ssy is exactly the kind of thing you would expect to come out of his mouth.
But what is surprising is that after everything Republicans have turned a blind eye to over the past few years, it is now that they are finally disgusted by Trump.
I m surprised that the Republicans are disgusted by Trump after all the things he has said and all of the comments that he s made over the last couple of years.
