wow !
this young asian student nails it !
he speaks for every american who has been a victim of obama s failed government experiment .
the left has turned our world upside down and many people in america believe that we are very close to a civil war .
this brilliant young asian student warns the left to turn back now , warning them it s a line you don t want to cross .
he blames them for normalizing violence and completely ignoring the rule of law as a way to threaten people who don t agree with you.here is a part of his message that can be seen in the video below : once you cross that line , you re starting a war you can not win .
you think you re so big and powerful .
step out of your bubble .
step out of the liberal cities , and look at the rest of the country .
you re outnumbered , outmanned and outgunned .
you can not win this if it turns violent .
if you normalize violence , if violence is okay , you can not win .
you can win by reaching out to conservatives .
talk to them .
talk to trump supporters and ask them why they believe what they believe and maybe , maybe you ll find common ground .
maybe you might even convince us to adopt your positions .
who knows ?
put down your fists .
take off your masks .
fight with your words , not sticks and stones .
because if you do not change , you re going to lose .
you need us on your side .
you need to convince us why you re right .
you can not divide us .
you need us on your side because generation z , the kids that are growing up and being born right now , they re projected to be the most conservative generation in decades , more conservative than your grandparents .
these kids are growing up on the internet .
the future s in their hands , and they re on our side .
so unless you change your ways you ve already lost .
