london ( reuters ) - britain s opposition labour party called on prime minister theresa may on tuesday to put post-brexit membership of the single market and the customs union under discussion in talks with the european union .
what an embarrassment - the last 24 hours have given a new meaning to the phrase coalition of chaos , labour s brexit spokesman keir starmer told parliament after a tentative deal with brussels was dashed at the last minute on monday .
will the prime minister now rethink her reckless red lines and put options such as a customs union and single market back on the table for negotiation ?
starmer asked .
speaking of northern ireland , brexit minister david davis said any suggestion that the british government would leave only one part of the united kingdom in the customs union was wrong .
