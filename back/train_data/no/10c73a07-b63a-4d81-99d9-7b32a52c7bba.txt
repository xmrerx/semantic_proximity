poor hillary , she s always the victim of some right-wing conspiracy when members of congress are not allowed to see the contents of the emails hillary had on her private unsecured server that s a pretty big deal ! the government intelligence in hillary clinton s private emails as secretary of state is sometimes considered so sensitive that some congressmen have been hindered in their ability to even read them , a new report thursday says.the material in the emails is classified at a level above top secret , fox reported , meaning that some lawmakers have been required to sign new agreements not to reveal their contents .
the situation highlights the sensitivity of the information that is being pored over , despite clinton s long habit of downplaying their significance.a level above top secret is considered subject to special access programs , requiring the additional security because of the increased sensitivity.congressional reviewers who scoured the sap information in clinton s emails already had top secret/sensitive compartmented clearance the highest level of security clearance but were required to sign extra non-disclosure agreements.last week , intelligence community inspector general i. charles mccullough iii wrote senior lawmakers to advise them that several dozen additional classified emails have been identified including specific intelligence from special access programs .
in a later interview with national public radio , clinton downplayed the ig letter and claimed it was politically biased .
this seems to me to be , you know , another effort to inject this into the campaign , it s another leak , she told the network .
i m just going to leave it up to the professionals at the justice department because nothing that this says changes the fact that i never sent or received material marked classified .
