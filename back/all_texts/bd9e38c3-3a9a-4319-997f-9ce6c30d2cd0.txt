One would think that Donald Trump would ve learned his lesson by now and actually fact-check what he is going to say in advance, but it turns out he hasn t. But then, when has Donald Trump or his supporters ever been concerned with technicalities such as facts?Case in point, Trump told supporters at a rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa on Wednesday night that immigrants who enter the United States should not be eligible for welfare benefits for five years.
The time has come for new immigration rules which say that those seeking admission into our country must be able to support themselves financially and should not use welfare for a period of at least five years, Trump told the raucous crowd at the U.S. Cellular Center, adding that his administration would be putting in legislation to that effect very shortly.
That would definitely be a great idea, one of few positive moves the Trump administration had made in their short time in power if it weren t for one small problem The law, known as the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 (PRWORA) already exists.The piece of legislation was passed by another member of his least favorite family, former President Bill Clinton, back in 1996.
Under Title IV of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act, entitled Restricting Welfare and Public Benefits for Aliens, Section 403 clearly states that immigrants are not eligible for any Federal means-tested public benefit for five years, starting on the date they first enter the country.Naturally, there are some exceptions to what constitutes federal-means tested public benefit, such as certain medical assistance, emergency disaster relief, and public health assistance for some vaccines, but the standard five-year waiting period is quite clear.Instead of taking to Twitter each time he goes to the bathroom in the middle of the night, maybe a better option for the President would be opening Google or possibly even Wikipedia and doing a little background research about what he plans to say next.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images
