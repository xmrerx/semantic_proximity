newsweek reporter kurt eichenwald came under fire thursday after sending a tweet that incorrectly reported that iowa supporters of president-elect donald trump booed astronaut and former senator john glenn when informed of his recent passing.eichenwald s initial tweet ( which has since been deleted ) racked up thousands of retweets and likes in a short time .
mediaitewhen asked why they might have booed , he speculated that it was because glenn was a democrat.he just moved on , said `` maybe they 'll come around . ''
i think context was that glenn was a democrat .
kurt eichenwald ( @ kurteichenwald ) december 9 , 2016but notice the interesting tidbit , that trump said maybe they ll come around .
according to other reports on the ground , trump said this while his supporters were booing protesters.post-election trump : as protesters heckle and crowd boos them , he says : `` i think they 're actually on our side .
they just do n't know it yet . ''

the mainstream media is panicking over the realization that they ve lost their influence over americans , and the market share with advertisers to alternative conservative alternative news sources .
and now , it s their obsession with convincing americans that trump worked with the russians to influence the outcome of our election.after eichenwald was caught fabricating story about trump supporters , he made an apology on twitter : meanwhile , he s still trying to excuse hillary s seizure in nyc at the 9-11 ceremony as pneumonia related : it s time to get over it kurt hillary lost .
america voted for a majority in the house and senate , and for the next two years , there are no more chances at changing that simple fact .
