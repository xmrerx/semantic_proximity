Make America Conservative again.
There really isn t any downside It might be time to rethink the millennial voter.A new paper suggests that Americans are more politically polarized now than they ve been in the past 46 years, and millennials are guiding this trend.The young adults, who were born between 1980 and 1994, are currently more politically polarized than Generation Xers and Baby Boomers, according to the paper, which was published in the journal Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin on Wednesday.
Additionally, millennials are more likely to identify as conservative than either Generation Xers or Baby Boomers were at the same age, said Jean Twenge, professor of psychology at San Diego State University and lead author of the paper.
High school seniors are more likely to identify as political conservatives now compared to 10 years ago.
Most surprising, more identify as conservatives now compared to the 1980s, presumably the era of the young conservative, such as the character Alex P. Keaton in the 1980s show Family Ties.
That goes against the common view of millennials as very liberal, said Twenge, author of the book about millennials titled Generation Me.
So the current view of millennials as liberals might be due to their age young people are more likely to be liberal.
But if you compare young people now to young people in previous decades, those now are more conservative, she said.The data showed that, as entering college students, 23% of millennials identified as leaning far right, compared to 17% of Baby Boomers and 22% of Generation Xers.Less than half 47% of millennials identified as middle-of-the-road, compared to 50% of Baby Boomers and more than half 53% of Generation Xers.Millennials have surpassed Baby Boomers both as the United States largest living generation and as the largest generation in the American electorate.
