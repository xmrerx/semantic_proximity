berlin ( reuters ) - germany s foreign ministry has warned its citizens traveling to turkey that they risk arbitrary detention even in tourist areas , revising its travel advice after a spate of arrests of german citizens that it considers politically motivated .
the change in travel advice , issued on tuesday , marks a new low in relations between the nato allies and is a blow for the tourist sector , which has already been hit by militant attacks and the fall-out from last year s failed coup attempt in turkey .
the trigger for the sharpening of the travel advice was the detention at the coastal antalya airport last week of two germans , one of whom has since been released .
berlin believes they , like 11 others , were detained for political reasons .
there is a risk of similar detentions in all parts of turkey , including in tourist regions , the new advice reads .
it falls short of a formal travel warning , issued for war-afflicted countries like afghanistan , iraq or yemen , which would make obtaining travel insurance harder .
we can t take from tourists the decision whether to travel or not , foreign minister sigmar gabriel said .
but we have described in detail what you should be aware of before you go .
large numbers of european citizens have been caught up in the crackdown following last year s failed coup against president tayyip erdogan , in the wake of which tens of thousands of turks have been imprisoned on terrorism charges .
critics say the crackdown amounts to an undiscriminating purge of erdogan s opponents .
