Donald Trump just posted an outright lie on Twitter addressed to the American people and got righteously taken to the woodshed for it.Since the first day of his dictatorship, Trump has been busy signing executive orders at a pace goes beyond what President Obama did throughout his eight years in office.
Trump has ordered federal agencies to start dismantling the Affordable Care Act, programs that deal with slowing or stopping climate change, and regulations that provide Americans with clean air and clean water.In addition, Trump is an ally of the anti-vaccination movement, has placed USDA scientists who deal with food safety on lockdown, and wants to defund the Civil Rights division of the Justice Department.Trump is also preparing to withdraw the United States from the United Nations, is escalating confrontation with China, and has suggested he will weaken NATO.But Trump insisted on Wednesday night that he is doing his duty to protect American lives.As your President, I have no higher duty than to protect the lives of the American people.

(@JustinCaffier) January 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump If that s true then why do you silence the EPA and deny the science of climate change?
Mikel Jollett (@Mikel_Jollett) January 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump in that case please stop drafting Executive Orders that injure American citizens.
K?
#UnfitToLead Benjamin Byron Davis (@Tooda) January 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump I hope this means protecting ALL Americans, sir.
Black, gay, Muslim, Christian, Latino and everything in between.
Kyle McMahon (@KMacMusic) January 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump You only care about your ego.
If you cared about veterans and the homeless and clean water then you would help instead of a 25 billion wall.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump Of which Americans?
Just the White ones?
Kristina Wong (@mskristinawong) January 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump Congratulations on failing at your highest duty!
Alex Goldschmidt (@alexandergold) January 26, 2017Donald Trump doesn t care about protecting American lives.
The only thing he has done since the inauguration is destroy.
Millions of Americans are about to lose their healthcare.
Millions across the country are going to have to deal with polluted air and water.
And Trump s isolationist foreign policy and bullying tactics are going to put our national security in serious jeopardy.
His refusal to acknowledge climate change is going to put millions of Americans, their homes, and their businesses at risk all along the coastline as the sea level rises.In short, Trump is saying one thing, but doing something completely different.
And most Americans are not fooled.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
