she s just like one of you ha !
hillary clinton breaks out the very phony southern accent during a speech in memphis .
this always cracks me up because i m from the south and we can spot a phony a mile away .
pandering to her base is what clinton does best .
just like obama , she plays to the crowd she s speaking to by adopting their accent or acting like she s just one of them .
this folksy style is cringe inducing for anyone with half a brain but she is speaking to a group of democrats soooooo
