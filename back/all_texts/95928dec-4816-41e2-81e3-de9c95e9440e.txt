It s good to know there are still some judges in America who put the law before political correctness An attorney was removed from court and taken into custody after a judge declared her in contempt for refusing to take off a Black Lives Matter pin.Youngstown Municipal Court Judge Robert Milich said Attorney Andrea Burton was in contempt of court for refusing to remove the pin in his courtroom as instructed.
Burton was sentenced to five days in jail, but she has been released on a stay while an appeal is underway.Burton will stay out of jail during the appeals process as long as she obeys Milich s order not to wear items that make a political statement in court.
If she loses her appeal, she will have to serve the five days in jail.Milich said his opinions have nothing to do with his decision.
A judge doesn t support either side, he said.
A judge is objective and tries to make sure everyone has an opportunity to have a fair hearing, and it was a situation where it was just in violation of the law, he said.WATCH:The Youngstown branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) said its legal counsel is monitoring the case closely as it may violate Burton s civil rights.The judge said his ruling is based on Supreme Court case law in which a judge can prohibit symbolic political expression in courtrooms, even if it s not disruptive.
There s a difference between a flag, a pin from your church or the Eagles and having a pin that s on a political issue, Milich said.Legal analysts say judges have free reign when it comes to what s said, or worn, in their courtrooms.
