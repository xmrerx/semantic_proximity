Something was bothering Donald Trump as he made his victory speech after the election.
The newly minted president-elect took the stage with at least 40 of his closest aides and allies, but according to a high-level campaign source familiar with Trump s thinking, New Jersey Gov.
Chris Christie kept pushing to be near the president-elect and trying to get in shots.
Trump got annoyed, the source told Yahoo News.The election night photo incident was one of several factors Trump insiders cited to explain why Christie was demoted from his position as transition team chair and replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence on Nov. 11.In addition to the three Trump campaign sources who spoke to Yahoo News, two junior staffers also described specific instances of alleged mismanagement by Christie that got the transition off to a slow start.
The two staffers said Christie did alarmingly little work on the transition and was largely absent from the campaign during the weeks leading up to the election, when Trump was widely expected to lose.
According to one account, campaign staffers had been so accustomed to Christie s absence that they were surprised to see him appear at campaign headquarters in Trump Tower on Election Day.
