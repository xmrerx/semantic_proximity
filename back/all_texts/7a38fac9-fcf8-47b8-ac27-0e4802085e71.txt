Thank you to the American Mirror for putting this video together showing Nancy s very bad week.Nancy Pelosi is apparently the best leadership Democrats have to offer America, so drink it in.During two public appearances this week, she confused Iran with Iraq, pronounced words strangely, and claimed Republicans are offering a Mini Me or Mickey Mouse budget.
Ends her very strange press conference by saying, I don t know.
But there s no there there .
We re beginning to wonder if Nancy is still there ?Is Nancy so flustered and panicked by Trump s presidency and her diminished role in Congress that she is no longer able to speak in public?
Or, is it possible (all kidding aside) that she needs to be examined by a medical professional?You be the judge
