Montel Williams isn t afraid to express his absolute disgust and disdain for Republican nominee Donald Trump he s made it perfectly clear in the past that he would never support or vote for him, and continuously speaks out against the business mogul.That s why there was nothing unusual about what Williams did over the weekend, when the radio talk show host called out one of Trump s biggest supporters Pastor Mark Burns.
When Williams saw Burns complaining about the media s hesitance to call the weekend explosions in New York City a terror attack, he couldn t just let it slide.TwitterBurns was merely echoing what Trump himself had said, when the GOP presidential candidate jumped to conclusions and immediately called the explosion a bomb even before officials could investigate or confirm it.
