judge jeanine nailed it tonight describing the unhinged left .
she is so right to say the left is a danger to us all .
she is especially worried for our president and other leaders in dc .
she s so right ! pirro said : we are now in a danger zone of complete hatred and chaos unlike anything we ve witnessed in american history .
the normalization of calling for the assassination , decapitation or the beating of any president is simply shocking .
and it is the extension of this hatred that trickles down and motivates people like the shooter of congressman scalise .
that shooter wasn t crazy .
that s too easy .
he hated republicans and thought they should die .
i worry , though , and you should all worry for our president and all elected officials the trickling down of hate is a danger to us all what s not helping is that the former president and hillary clinton are fueling this rhetoric .
the bitter democrats waisted no time in continuing the violent rhetoric almost immediately after steve scalise was shot !
the ironic thing is that this only damages the democrats ! the chair of the dnc tom perez has been going out giving obscenity laden speeches .
he s the leader of the party and he sets the tone .
how in the world is this negative rhetoric helping anyone ?
the big loser in all of this is the american people .
dc is in gridlock on getting things done when the democrats don t even try to be civil .
