ISIS stormed into Mosul, Iraq last summer.
Much of what took 2,000 years to build has been lost in a matter of months.
There are no Christians left in Mosul Surely, our intelligence community warned Obama this would happen.
If our President is so concerned about the welfare of Muslims (mostly men) supposedly escaping persecution by ISIS, why did he abandon these Christians in Iraq?Nothing is sacred to these monsters.
Christian relics and books from the 1st century have been destroyed by ISIS.
Christian homes in Mosul have been marked by ISIS.
If you are a Christian and ISIS puts their mark on your home, it signifies you are expected to either convert to Islam, pay an extortion fee or face the sword.
Unfortunately, democracy in Iran brought a new wave of persecution for Christians.
When the US withdrew from Iraq completely, the situation became dire.
The government was not capable of taking care of the Christian population and ISIS moved in to eradicate the Christian population and erase any trace of Christianity.
Where Christians have been living for over 1,000 years, there is nothing but silence empty building and homes.
