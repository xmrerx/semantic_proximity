louisville , ky. ( reuters ) - officials for a kentucky county will appeal a federal judge ’ s ruling that invalidated its right-to-work law , the county ’ s lawyer said on thursday .
the ruling came a year after labor organizations sued hardin county after it passed an ordinance that prohibited unions from mandating its members pay dues in exchange for representation .
so-called “ right-to-work ” laws allow employees at unionized employers to skip joining a union and avoid paying union dues .
u.s. district judge david hale ruled on wednesday evening that local regulation of union agreements is preempted by the national labor relations act .
hale ’ s order means that only states can implement such legislation .
democrats , who hold a majority in the state house of representatives , have blocked repeated bills aiming to make kentucky the 26th right-to-work state .
“ these illegal ordinances would have affected all working people , union and non-union , by decreasing wages , lowering median household incomes , increasing poverty and undermining workplace safety , ” said kentucky state afl-cio president bill londrigan .
beginning in late 2014 , several kentucky counties began passing their own laws after advocates claimed kentucky law granted counties the same abilities as the state .
proponents of right-to-work laws say they can be a tool to attract new businesses .
the ruling affects only hardin county in north-central kentucky , one of 12 to have passed a right-to-work law .
four others have passed a first reading .
jim waters , president of the bluegrass institute , said about 80 of kentucky ’ s 120 counties had considered passing a right-to-work law but were waiting for hale ’ s decision .
john lovett , a lawyer representing hardin county , said the case pits the interests of local communities against the nation ’ s most powerful labor unions .
“ few issues are more ‘ local ’ than what a working person is free to do with his or her own money , ” lovett said .
