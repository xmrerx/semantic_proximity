Ivanka Trump really should stop talking about these issues if she is going to continue to be complicit in her daddy s administration.Despite the fact that her dad s policies hurt women and children, Ivanka posted a Mother s Day message on Twitter focusing on pay inequality.Today, on Mother s Day, we must confront that motherhood is now a greater determinant of pay inequality than gender.
https://t.co/n1HhF8PyVc Ivanka Trump (@IvankaTrump) May 15, 2017Pay inequality is a major problem in this country.
Women currently make around 77 cents for every dollar a man makes for the same job and amount of work.
At the same time, women also have to deal with the fact that maternity leave is often not a benefit offered by employers, nor is childcare.
So it becomes even harder for women to make enough money to take care of their families.But while Ivanka may really care abut these issues, the problem is that she has mostly been a bystander whenever her dad signs legislation or an executive order that hurts women.For example, the Trumpcare bill would take healthcare away from millions of women.
Just being a woman would be considered a pre-existing condition.
So would sexual assault and pregnancy.
Not only would a lot of moms suffer under this bill, their children would suffer as well.That s why Ivanka has been repeatedly accused of being complicit.She s a complete hypocrite who pretends to a be a feminist icon but she s not.
And women had no problem calling her out on Twitter for it.
@IvankaTrump You care nothing about women!
You blindly support your father who is a misogynistic sexist bully.
AND YOU DO NOTHING!

Your father doesn t support moms and he also thinks troubled girls such as Lindsey Lohan are better in bed.. Michelle Jackino (@DJackino) May 15, 2017@IvankaTrump Have you met your father, apparently the man you speak highly of isn t @POTUS.

You words are empty!
#traitor Brayz (@BrayleegirlK) May 15, 2017@IvankaTrump Far from what the statistics show.
If your going to be a role model get your facts straight.
@MAGAtrump5 Michelle (@mmbarricelli) May 15, 2017@IvankaTrump Ivanka: Stop talking.
If u cared anything abt women, u d have stepped away from daddy long ago.
Bonnie Rand (@musicalwhisper) May 15, 2017@IvankaTrump You condone your father s locker room talk, his desire for incest among other atrocities against women.
You, lady, have no credibility.
Paulaann (@Paulaann8) May 15, 2017It should also be pointed out that Ivanka Trump pays Chinese workers pennies to manufacture her shitty products and clothing line.
Yet she still claims to care about pay inequality here in America.If she really cared about women she would try to convince her dad to do something that helps them for once in his pathetic life.Featured image via Sean Gallup/Getty Images
