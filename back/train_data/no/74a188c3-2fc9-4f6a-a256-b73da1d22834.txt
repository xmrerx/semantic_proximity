( reuters ) - republicans in the u.s. house of representatives on thursday released details of a 429-page tax bill that calls for slashing taxes on corporations , along with many other changes affecting individuals , families and businesses .
based on publicly released documents and comments from republican lawmakers , here are the bill ’ s main features , which are expected to change as the tax debate unfolds in weeks ahead .
* permanently reduces the u.s. corporate income tax rate to 20 percent from a current statutory rate of 35 percent , a change that is in line with initial republican proposals .
* dramatically reshapes the tax system for u.s. multinational corporations .
worldwide taxation of their foreign profits would end .
a territorial tax system exempting those foreign profits from the corporate tax would be imposed .
* gives multinationals a tax break on $ 2.6 trillion in profits they have stashed offshore on a tax-exempt basis .
the measure would require those profits to be brought into the united states , or repatriated , but not at the full 35-percent corporate tax rate that would normally be due .
instead , those profits would be taxed at only 12 percent for cash assets and 5 percent for illiquid assets .
repatriation tax due under the proposal would be payable over eight years .
* imposes a new 10-percent minimum tax on u.s. companies ’ high-profit foreign units , calculated on a global basis , to discourage shifting profits abroad .
* proposes a tax on foreign companies operating in the united states of up to 20 percent on payments made abroad from u.s. operations .
companies could lower those taxes by putting more operations in the u.s. tax system .
* repeals the 20 percent corporate alternative minimum tax .
‘ pass-through ’ businesses * caps the maximum tax rate on small businesses and other non-corporate enterprises to 25 percent , down from the present maximum rate on “ pass-through ” income of 39.6 percent .
* sets standards for distinguishing between individual wage income and actual pass-through business income to prevent tax-avoidance abuse of the new , lower tax level .
* allows immediate and full expensing of capital investments by businesses .
* allows businesses to deduct interest costs up to 30 percent of taxable income .
exempts from this rule businesses with average gross receipts of $ 25 million or less .
certain public utilities and “ real property trades ” are also exempted .
* preserves the research and development tax credit .
* phases out tax credits for solar , geothermal and wind power .
* consolidates three higher education tax credits into a single credit .
* ends tax-exempt bonds for professional sports stadiums .
* ends deductions for employee entertainment and recreation activities , as well as other fringe benefits .
* consolidates the number of tax brackets from seven to the following : zero tax on income up to $ 24,000 ; 12 percent up to $ 90,000 ; 25 percent up to $ 260,000 ; 35 percent up to $ 1 million ; and 39.6 percent over $ 1 million .
that top bracket is the same as the present level and was added to the bill after critics hammered republicans ’ original proposal to cut the top rate .
* increases the standard deduction for taxpayers to $ 12,000 from $ 6,350 for individuals , and to $ 24,000 from $ 12,700 for married couples .
* repeals the $ 4,050 individual personal exemption .
* preserves the home mortgage interest deduction for existing mortgages , but reduces the amount of interest that taxpayers can deduct from their taxes on new mortgages , capping it at $ 500,000 .
the cap is now $ 1 million .
* caps the deduction for state and local property taxes at $ 10,000 .
repeals the deduction for state and local income and sales taxes , a measure that hurts high-income tax states , such as new york , new jersey and california .
* retains popular retirement savings programs including the 401 ( k ) and ira pension plans .
* expands the child tax credit to $ 1,600 from $ 1,000 , and establishes a new $ 300 credit for each parent and non-child dependent .
also preserves the child and dependent care tax credit .
* preserves the earned income tax credit .
* preserves the deduction for charitable giving .
* changes higher education benefits , such as college tuition , with further details not immediately available .
* repeals the individual alternative minimum tax on high-income taxpayers .
* doubles the exemption from the estate tax on inherited assets and repeals the tax over six years .
* adds $ 1.51 trillion to the federal budget deficit over a decade .
the deficit is now about $ 700 billion a year .
the national debt now exceeds $ 20 trillion .
