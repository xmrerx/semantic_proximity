Tonight the Boiler Gang is talking about the Liberal Left feeling BURNT by the way Bernie flopped over to endorse Hillary after having his nomination stolen by hook and crook as revealed by the wikileaks hacks.
We unfortunately, once again, as though forced by a week of news happenings, dive deep into project Mockingbird/Gladio style stage managed terror events.
We discuss a growing swath of bought and paid for FAKE news, the repealing of the Smith Mundt Act effectively legalizing LYING to the public at the behest of the crime syndicates that own and run the mainstream media.
A candid chat about the ugly effects of the divide and rule tyranny imposed upon us by the propagandists and social engineers with lines drawn in the sand based on identity politics is rounded out by a scathing review of Michelle Obamas comments at the DNC by E.T.
Williams.
We d be remiss if we didn t cover some highlights and lowlights from the RNC/DNC, as well, on this very special 67th edition of Boiler Room.Please like and share the program and visit our donate page to get involved!BOILER ROOM IS NOT A POLICTALLY CORRECT ZONE!
