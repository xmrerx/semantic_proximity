An official investigation into a Tennessee Republican found him to be more dangerous to the personal safety of women than the LGBT people he wants to ban from using public restrooms.Tennessee state Rep. Jeremy Durham has sponsored a bill similar to anti-LGBT laws passed in North Carolina and Mississippi, which Republicans claim are necessary for the security of women.But according to an assessment by Tennessee Attorney General Herbert Slatery, Durham himself represents the true threat to women.During an investigation that is still ongoing, Slatery felt that he should warn Tennessee House Speaker Beth Harwell that Durham has engaged in inappropriate contact with female employees of the legislature and is threat to their safety.
Based upon the information gathered thus far, Representative Durham s alleged behavior may pose a continuing risk to unsuspecting women who are employed by or interact with the legislature, Slatery reported.Slatery went on to list the information gathered from interviews with 34 women Durham has interacted with, including that he held a superior position of power to the women, obtained their contact information under false pretenses, tried to meet with the women alone and contacted them about non-legislative matters, tried to serve them alcohol, and made inappropriate comments and engaged in inappropriate physical contact with some women.
Durham s bill would ban transgender people from using the bathroom that corresponds with their gender identity because he thinks they pose a danger to women.Of course, there is not one example throughout the 17 states and over 200 cities that have protections in place for transgender people of a trans person doing anything in a women s bathroom other than using the facilities.Durham, however, has been labelled a real danger to women and his own access to entire buildings has been restricted.
These proactive steps include reassigning Rep. Durham s office from the War Memorial Building to the ground floor of the Rachel Jackson Building, and limiting his access to the Legislative Plaza, War Memorial Building, Rachel Jackson Building, and 2nd floor of the State Capitol for official legislative business only.
These actions will be taken immediately, Speaker Harwell announced via email to The Tennessean.In short, Republicans are hypocrites and perhaps there should be laws to protect women from them.Featured image via Facebook
