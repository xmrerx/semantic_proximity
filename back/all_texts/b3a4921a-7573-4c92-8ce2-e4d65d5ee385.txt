Ferguson was the a launching pad for Obama s war against law enforcement Following the shooting of a sheriff in Houston, Texas by a black man as well as chants from Black Lives Matter protesters advocating violence against police, GOP presidential candidate Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) issued a statement saying he is proud to stand with law enforcement.While campaigning in New Hampshire, Cruz addressed the attacks.
both physical and verbal, which have been made against police officers across America.Cruz is calling for leadership to act against this assault on all law enforcement officers, in light of the killing of Harris Country deputy sheriff Darren Goforth, which took place in Cruz s hometown.
We stand with our police officers, we stand with our fire fighters, with our EMS, with our first responders, Cruz s statement began.
These are brave humans who risk their lives keeping us safe.
We are seeing a manifestation of the rhetoric and vilification of law enforcement that is coming form the top all the way to the President of the United States and senior administration officials.
Cruz continued:Cops across this country are feeling the assault.
They re feeling the assault from the President, from the top on down as we see, whether it s in Ferguson or Baltimore, the response of senior officials of the President, of the Attorney General, is to vilify law enforcement.
That is fundamentally wrong, and it is endangering the safety and security of us all.I m proud to stand with law enforcement, to stand with the police and fire fighters and first responders.
They are American heroes.
And they need a President who doesn t attack and vilify them and who doesn t seek to tear us apart along racial lines to inflame racial divisions.
Instead we need a President who works to bring us together and unify us behind shared American values.
