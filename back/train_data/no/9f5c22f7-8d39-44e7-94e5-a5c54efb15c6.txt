the clinton carpetbaggers have moved around doing their influence peddling where the money is they landed in chappaqua , ny and have managed to make their home into a fortress complete with a huge wall , guards and now a private street .
seems like traffic is for the little people new castle the road where hillary clinton , the democratic presidential nominee , lives in chappaqua has been made a local-traffic-only street for security reasons and to reduce tourists from flocking to the cul-de-sac.the town board this week voted to add old house lane to the list of such roads .
hillary and bill clinton have lived on the road for more than 15 years , moving there when she ran for a u.s. senate seat.chappaqua is a hamlet within new castle .
the town board also added one other road , green lane , to those restricted to local traffic only .
it s a short cul-de-sac that runs parallel to old house lane.at tuesday s board meeting , town administrator jill shapiro said the police chief had received a request for security reasons.town supervisor robert greenstein said friday he was not positive , but assumed the request came from the secret service .
i think it s for security reasons and also for privacy concerns for the residents certainly living there as well , greenstein said .
he said the little cul-de-sac can be turned into a very busy street .
