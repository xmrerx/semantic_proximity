beirut ( reuters ) - saad al-hariri , who announced his resignation as lebanese prime minister in a televised broadcast from saudi arabia on nov. 4 , will visit egypt on tuesday to meet egyptian president abdel fattah al-sisi , hariri s office said on sunday .
hariri has since saturday been in paris , where he met french president emmanuel macron , and has said he will return to lebanon by wednesday for its independence day celebrations .
lebanese president michel aoun has said he will not accept hariri s resignation until it is delivered in person and all sides in beirut have called for his speedy return .
a leader in hariri s future movement had earlier told reuters hariri would visit egypt on monday .
the resignation sparked a political crisis in lebanon and put it on the front line of a regional power struggle between saudi arabia and iran .
hariri criticized iran and its ally hezbollah , which is in lebanon s coalition government , in his resignation statement , and said he feared assassination .
apart from a brief trip to abu dhabi , he remained in saudi arabia until he flew to france .
his stay in the kingdom led to accusations from lebanese officials and politicians that saudi arabia had coerced him to resign , which he and riyadh denied .
on friday , hariri tweeted that his presence there was for consultations on the future of the situation in lebanon and its relations with the surrounding arab region .
on sunday , arab league foreign ministers held an emergency meeting in cairo , requested by saudi arabia , to discuss ways to confront iran and hezbollah over their role in the region .
in a statement afterwards , the ministers accused hezbollah of supporting terrorism in arab countries .
lebanese foreign minister gebran bassil did not attend .
