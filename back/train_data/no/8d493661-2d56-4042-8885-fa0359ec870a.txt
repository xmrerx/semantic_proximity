brasilia ( reuters ) - brazilian president michel temer had minor surgery on wednesday for a narrowing of his urethra and the operation was successful , his office said .
it was the second time the 77-year-old president had surgery on his urinary tract in two months .
in october , he was operated on to reduce an enlarged prostate that had caused a urinary obstruction .
temer canceled his scheduled meetings on wednesday and flew to s o paulo for tests that were followed by surgery at the city s s rio-liban s hospital .
in november , temer underwent an angioplasty procedure to implant stents in three coronary arteries after his doctors found what they said was a bigger obstruction in one of the arteries .
wednesday s tests came at a crucial moment in temer s presidency , as he scrambles to secure votes to pass a pension overhaul bill to help bring brazil s huge budget deficit under control .
