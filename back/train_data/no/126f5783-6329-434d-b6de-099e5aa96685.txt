beirut ( reuters ) - lebanon s parliament speaker on monday proposed holding a legislative election before the end of the year , bringing it forward from may 2018 .
the proposal supports the national interest ... ( and is ) in the spirit of the law where elections must be held as soon as possible , nabih berri said in a televised statement .
the current parliament s mandate would , under the proposal , end on dec. 31 with the election to take place before that date , he said .
lebanon s parliament has extended its own mandate three times since current lawmakers were elected in 2009 for what was meant to be a four-year term .
in june the cabinet approved a new law which extended parliament s term for 11 months for technical reasons , tentatively setting elections for may 2018 .
sectarian divisions have long plagued politics in lebanon , exacerbated by the syrian conflict and complicated by rivalry between iran and saudi arabia , which back different groups in the country .
lebanese activists accuse politicians of using regional upheaval as an excuse to dodge elections .
political wrangling left the country without a president for 29 months before michel aoun was elected in october last year .
