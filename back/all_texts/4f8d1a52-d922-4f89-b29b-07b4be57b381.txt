The faux outrage from the press over any and every move that President Trump makes is getting so old!
Just ask Sean Spicer He showed his awareness of the ridiculousness of the press with this SMACKDOWN of a reporter during his press conference today:I love how Spicer dismisses the biased media and moves on.
This is exactly how you have to deal with them.

This video perfectly illustrates how childish our media acts and how Sean Spicer responds to them, as though he s talking to a group of kindergarten students.Hilarious!This is by far the funniest video I've EVER seen showing WH reporters behaving like kindergartners.

White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer zinged Alexis Simendinger after the Real Clear Politics reporter whined to Spicer to call on her fellow commie from the New York Times.The mainstream media is clearly a leftist clique united against the Trump administration.
On Thursday, Spicer called on Simendinger during a heated press briefing.Instead of asking her own question, Alexis snarked: Could you help us all by calling on Peter right now?
Could you call on the New York Times, please?
