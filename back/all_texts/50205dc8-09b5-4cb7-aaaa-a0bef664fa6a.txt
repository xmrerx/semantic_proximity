Kellyanne Conway just embarrassed herself again while also demonstrating just how cozy the Trump administration is with white nationalists.It may be Valentine s Day, but as a public employee who represents Trump on a daily basis, Conway should know better.On Tuesday, a white nationalist Twitter account sent a Valentine s Day message to Conway.
Your strength & resiliency in face of vile hatred, bigotry, & sexism of the unhinged Left is a daily inspiration!
Love you!
Well, if Conway had done a little homework, she would have discovered that the Twitter user is a white nationalist whose account proudly boasts that they Hate Anti-American Liberals, Marxists, & Commies with hashtags that say #WhiteIdentity, #Nationalist, and #SteveBannon.
As we all know, Steve Bannon is sympathetic to white nationalists and he is a favorite of white nationalist groups.
Bannon is also Donald Trump s top adviser who is likely pulling the strings in the White House.Anyway, Conway told the white racist, Love you back.
After being called out on Twitter, Conway removed the tweet and claimed that someone else tweeted from her account.Seriously.
I don t know who had access to my account, Conway claimed.
Let me see who tweeted that.
That s terrible.
I denounce whoever it is.
It will be immediately deleted.
Everybody makes mistakes.
Let s just get this straight.
Kellyanne Conway works for the so-called president.
She is one of his top advisers and probably has security clearances.
Yet she claims someone she doesn t know managed to gain access to her Twitter account.
That s a really pathetic excuse the day after Michael Flynn resigned as National Security Adviser for being a security risk.It s more likely that Conway retweeted the white nationalist and decided to lie about doing so.
But either way, Kellyanne Conway looks incompetent.Clearly, Michael Flynn is not the only Trump adviser who should have resigned.Featured Image via screen capture
