abuja ( reuters ) - nigeria s cabinet will be expanded to bring in more people and fresh ideas , for the ultimate benefit of the people of nigeria , president muhammadu buhari said on tuesday .
government officials have privately raised the prospect of buhari reshuffling his cabinet since he returned from medical leave in britain in august , but the presidency had not discussed any changes until tuesday s comments on twitter .
however , buhari did not immediately provide any further details , nor mention any potential reshuffle of ministers current portfolios .
the president s relationship with his cabinet has at times been tense .
it took him six months to appoint his initial team after he was inaugurated in may , 2015 .
ministers have struggled to get access to buhari since then and some are unhappy with their portfolios , according to people familiar with the situation .
a letter from nigeria s oil minister to buhari , leaked at the beginning of this month , said he had failed to secure an appointment with the president despite many attempts to do so .
