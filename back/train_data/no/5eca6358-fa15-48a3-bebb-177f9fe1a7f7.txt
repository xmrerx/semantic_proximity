aden ( reuters ) - yemen s sanaa airport , damaged in an air strike by a saudi-led coalition last week , has been repaired and is ready to receive international flights , the houthi-led government which runs the capital city said on tuesday .
the nov. 14 raid destroyed radio navigation equipment at the airport and in effect put the facility out of service .
the attack happened after the coalition banned naval , air and land transportation to yemen following a missile fired by the houthis that was shot down over the saudi capital riyadh .
the transport minister in the houthi-run government , zakariya al-shami , said that technical civil aviation teams had completed implementation of technical alternatives necessary to restore services to the airport .
it is ready to receive international flights , shami said , according to houthi-controlled news agency saba .
the airport had been mainly used by international relief agencies , including u.n. staff , using united nations flights to sanaa .
the coalition has said that all yemeni land crossings , air and sea ports would remain closed until assurances are made that no weapons can reach the houthis .
the coalition accuses iran of smuggling weapons , including the missile fired towards riyadh airport on nov. 4 , to the houthis through yemeni ports controlled by the group .
iran denies sending any weapons to the houthis .
the closure of yemen s ports , including the main hodeidah port where most of the country s food supplies enter , has raised alarm around the world .
the european union on tuesday urged the saudi-led coalition to reopen yemen s ports and airports .
while fully recognizing the serious security threat incoming from yemen , it is our firm belief that hindering vital humanitarian access to the yemeni population that is already on the brink of famine and subject to a spreading cholera outbreak will not effectively address these security concerns , eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini said .
