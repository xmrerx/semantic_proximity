water stations are set up along marathon courses with the understanding that the water is for the runners .
we think this group of looters didn t get that memo .
they blatantly go about stealing the cases of water right in front of everyone .
hugh brasher , event director for london marathon events ltd , said : it s very disappointing to see water being stolen in this way from the official water stations for our runners these water stations are staffed by volunteers and we are very grateful to them for their work on race day .
we always brief our volunteers not to get into altercations if this kind of thing happens .
we ll investigate this further .
