The United States has some major problems with our water supply.
During a segment on The Daily Show, host Trevor Noah voiced his concerns over the issue using political satire.Noah hilariously connected the issue to both the #OscarsSoWhite controversy and the primary election.
With the poisoning of the entire city of Flint, Michigan being the spark for the new national conversation on water safety and infrastructure, politicians have been quick to jump on the issue.Democrats have hit Michigan s Republican governor Rick Snyder hard over the crisis.
Republicans, have been scrambling to try and distance themselves from Snyder and working to crystallize a narrative that absolves Snyder and the GOP s agenda from culpability in the matter.
If you re going to have a massive lead poisoning problem, it turns out you might as well do it just before politicians turn out to earn your vote in an important presidential primary, Noah said.
That s when you have leverage.
Noah goes on to explain how that while he is happy that Flint is getting help with their water supply, this is a problem all over the US that needs to be addressed.
Playing on the #OscarsSoWhite hashtag, Noah invents one meant to address this huge issue.
Right now America has more color in its water than its Oscars, he said.
#WaterSoBrown.
Noah also quipped that the water in the US is so gross that it looks like that sh*t looks like Trump s bath water.
All across the US cities are reporting that they are finding lead contamination and other horrors in their water.
While at the same time, many cities in California face the possibility of running out of water altogether.We need massive investment in communities to solve this problem.
Doing so would also create vast numbers of good paying jobs that are desperately needed in so many impoverished areas, who have been devastated by the deindustrialization of the US economy.You can watch the clip below.Featured image from video screenshot
