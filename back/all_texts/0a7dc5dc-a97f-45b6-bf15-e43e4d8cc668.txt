Former Speaker Newt Gingrich is convinced that somebody is most likely going to wind up in jail when the investigation into Russia s interference in our election is done, but he doesn t think Donald Trump will be the one who ends up behind bars.
They re going to get somebody.
I don t think they re going to get the president, but they re going to get somebody, and they re going to get him for something.
And they re probably going to go to jail, Gingrich told Fox News on Friday.According to Gingrich, what is playing out right now in the U.S. is no different than an old western movie.
This is like watching an old-fashioned Western movie.
This is an Indian hunting party, Gingrich said.
They re out looking for a couple scalps, and they re not going to go home until they get some.
Special counsel Robert Mueller was already investigating Russia s election meddling and the possibility (or more correctly, the probability) that Trump s campaign was in collusion with the Kremlin.
But on Wednesday, following the bombshell testimony of fired FBI Director James Comey, it was announced that Mueller is also investigating Trump for obstruction of justice.So far, Mueller has reportedly brought in 13 lawyers to assist with the investigation and intends to hire even more.
Gingrich said this is a sure sign that somebody is going to have to take the fall.
Mueller simply has too many high-powered attorneys to just go home without a scalp.
Somebody is going to have to go down, Gingrich insisted.Earlier in the day on Friday, Gingrich had tried to claim that it is impossible for a sitting president to obstruct justice, therefore, Trump is innocent.
Apparently, he forgot that as a member of Congress he voted to impeach Bill Clinton for obstruction of justice.Watch:Featured image via T.J. Kirkpatrick/Getty Images
