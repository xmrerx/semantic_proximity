If you have the stomach to actually follow the Republican debates that seem to happen every other day now, you know that Jeb Bush has a singular mission at this point in his campaign: Attack Donald Trump.
Bush, long considered the establishment favorite to win the Republican nomination, has been pushed around by Trump since the very first debate with very little success at firing back.That s not for a lack of trying.
Bush, whose natural posture is slumpy and whose speech is frumpy, can t help but look like a bullied kid when he tries to defend himself against Trump.
His debate performances have been so lackluster he was even scolded publicly by his Mommy, who probably wishes she had another Dubya right about now.
The dumber brother obviously got all of the charisma.This latest round of attack each other and say Hillary Clinton a lot also known as a debate saw Jeb finally come up with a successful attack against Trump.
When Trump started talking about the government taking private property by eminent domain to construct roads and bridges, Jeb fired back with a story about Trump s attempt to take the property of an elderly woman in Atlantic City by eminent domain so he could provide a nice parking lot for limousines outside one of his casinos.Jeb had the crowd fired up.
Finally, an exchange between Trump and Jeb was going his way.
That is until Trump was offered the opportunity to respond.
As Trump tried to make America great his way out of yet another sordid detail of his past, Jeb chimed in, interrupting him mid-sentence, only to be shushed by Trump, who had already twice asserted that Jeb wanted to be a tough guy.
After his shushing of a grown man, which admittedly was a bit hilarious, Trump got his share of boos, hitting back hard with that s all of his supporters and special interests.
Other than the ridiculously botched introductions, it was the only part of the debate worth watching:Featured image via screen capture
