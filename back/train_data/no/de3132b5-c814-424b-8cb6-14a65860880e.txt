washington ( reuters ) - donald trump ’ s republican presidential campaign , widely criticized for refusing to release the candidate ’ s tax returns , released 10 years of returns on friday for vice presidential nominee mike pence .
the trump campaign also repeated a pledge that trump would release his own returns once the government completes an audit .
pence ’ s returns for 2006 to 2015 showed the indiana governor and former u.s. congressman paid an effective tax rate that ranged from 10 percent to 16.5 percent .
“ these returns are being released with the full support of mr. trump who plans to release his tax returns upon completion of a routine audit , ” the campaign said .
disclosure of tax returns is a standard procedure for all modern presidential candidates .
trump ’ s critics , including the campaign of democratic presidential nominee hillary clinton , have suggested he may be hiding something .
some have speculated that trump may pay little or no tax or that his net worth may be much less than the $ 10 billion he has claimed .
pence and his wife , karen , reported adjusted gross income over the 10 years ranging from about $ 113,000 last year to over $ 187,000 in 2009 , while the effective state and federal tax rate ranged from a low of just over 10 percent in 2013 to a high of 16.5 percent in 2014 , the figures show .
charitable donations amounted to 10 percent of the family ’ s take-home pay , equivalent to an average 7.2 percent of adjusted gross income , a statement released by the trump campaign said .
hillary clinton released her 2015 tax returns last month .
they showed she and her husband , former president bill clinton , had $ 10.75 million in income that year and paid an effective federal tax rate of 34.2 percent .
most of the income came from bill clinton ’ s speaking fees and a book deal by hillary .
clinton ’ s running mate , u.s .
senator tim kaine of virginia , along with his wife , anne holton , released 10 years of tax returns at the same time in august .
they paid a federal effective tax rate of 20.3 percent on income of about $ 313,000 in 2015 .
