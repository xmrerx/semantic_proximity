berlin ( reuters ) - german chancellor angela merkel appointed jan hecker , her refugee policy coordinator , as her new foreign policy adviser , as she braced for tricky talks on a new coalition government next week , where immigration is likely to be a key issue , a government spokeswoman said .
merkel , humbled in last month s national election by a surge of the anti-immigrant far right , is seeking to put together a three-way coalition of her conservatives , the pro-business free democrats and the environmentalist greens - a combination previously untested at the federal level .
members of her conservative bloc resolved their own differences and agreed to limiting migration on monday , paving the way for talks to begin with the other parties .
hecker , a former federal judge , took over the newly created position of refugee coordinator in october 2015 after merkel s decision to allow in over a million migrants .
he led germany s migration treaties with african states and accompanied merkel on a number of foreign trips focused on migration .
the decision reflects growing awareness that refugee and asylum policies are inextricably linked to security issues , said judy dempsey , a senior fellow at carnegie europe .
he had the overview of libya , of the traffickers , of the security of the borders , of the agreement with turkey , she said .
hecker replaces christoph heusgen , who had advised merkel for all 12 years of her role as chancellor , before becoming germany s u.n. ambassador in new york in late july .
with hecker s appointment , merkel breaks for the second time with a longstanding tradition of tapping diplomats to fill foreign and political jobs in the chancellery .
