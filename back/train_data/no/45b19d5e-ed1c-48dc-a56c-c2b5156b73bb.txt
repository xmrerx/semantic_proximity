beijing ( reuters ) - one of china s most-wanted overseas fugitives , a manager in a real estate company sought on charges of corruption and bribery , turned himself in on tuesday after fleeing to canada seven years ago , the anti-graft agency said .
he jian , a manager in the northern province of hebei who had fled in september 2010 , becomes the 49th on a list of 100 most-wanted individuals to return , the central commission for discipline inspection ( ccdi ) said on its website .
reuters could not immediately reach he , his family , or a legal representative to seek comment .
he s assets were frozen after he fled and interpol issued a red notice for his provisional arrest , the agency said , but it did not make clear where he lived after his flight to canada , nor from which country he had returned .
the widely-publicized fox hunt and sky net operations to repatriate overseas fugitives suspected of corruption and economic crimes constitute a key plank of president xi jinping s sweeping anti-graft campaign .
china published its list of most-wanted suspects believed to be hiding overseas in april 2015 .
but it has had limited success in securing cooperation from western countries , including australia , canada and the united states , where many of the most wanted live , largely because of what those governments see as a lack of transparency and due process in china s judicial system .
