Since Jeb Bush started to bring his mother Barbara Bush with him on the campaign trail, it s become more common for the parents of the Republican presidential candidates to swoop in and give their struggling little GOPers a boost.Pastor Rafael Cruz, the father of Texas senator and presidential candidate Ted Cruz, tried to do the same for his own son during a chat with Greg Corombos of WorldNetDaily over the weekend, to basically talk about how his son is going to eclipse Trump and emerge as the nominee.
Considering that Rafael is Ted s campaign surrogate and a religious man, this of course meant some fear-mongering and crazy Christianity references similar to the time he claimed that God was raising up Ted to be the next POTUS.This time, the elder Cruz was on a real mission to convince America that God is behind his son s candidacy and will make sure that he wins the election.
Rafael said: I think what is going to happen is the body of Christ is going to rise up.
Believers are coalescing around Ted Cruz and I think when the people of God realize that we need a man of faith, a man of integrity, a man that you can trust his word two things you can count on Ted Cruz, number one he will tell you the truth, and number two, he will do exactly what he says he s going to do.
That Rafael called his son a man of truth is hilarious, as Cruz was just slammed in the media for spreading false information about Marco Rubio.
Rafael also boasted about his son s ability to be the most outspoken homophobe running for president.
Rafael reference the Supreme Court ruling on marriage equality, proudly stating that his son was the only candidate who said the ruling was not the law of the land, this is an unconstitutional, unlawful decision and five justices have no right to impose their view upon 320 million Americans.
Rafael topped off his insane claims with a warning, reminding Americans that this election is the most important election of our lifetime, and that if they didn t vote Ted into the White House, a lot of our freedoms would disappear .You can listen to the crazy interview below:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/248365072 params= color=ff5500 width= 100% height= 166 iframe= true /]Rafael Cruz honestly just makes his son look like an even more terrifying candidate whenever he speaks.
And now that Jeb Bush has just dropped out of the presidential race, Ted might want to rethink having his bible-thumping dad involved in his campaign affairs.
Clearly, the GOP needs much more help than mom and dad can give.Featured image is a screenshot
