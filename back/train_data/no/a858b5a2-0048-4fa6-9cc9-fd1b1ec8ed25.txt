hey bernie how s that whole queen of wall street/ democrat mob boss endorsement working out for you ? wikileaks has released another batch of emails .
one of those emails is likely from joel johnson , the managing director of the glover park group , a washington dc firm specializing in strategic communications and government relationsthe email was sent on feb. 2 , 2016 to john podesta with the subject matter : friendly advice .
no mercy .
from : joel @ gpg.com to : john.podesta @ gmail.com date : 2016-02-22 00:09 subject : friendly advice .
no mercy.bernie needs to be ground to a pulp .
we can t start believing our own primary bullshit .
this is no time to run the general .
crush him as hard as you can .
other than that , hope all is well and congrats on nevada ! only 4 days ago , the hill named gpg s joel johnson as one their top lobbyists or hired guns for 2016 : joel johnson , the glover park groupclients have a trusted guide in johnson , a former clinton administration official who leads the advocacy efforts of the public relations powerhouse.buzzfeed in september 2015 , susan brophy , managing director of the glover park group , emailed top clinton aide cheryl mills on oct. 4 , 2011 , telling her that a planned speech before a joint session of congress by the korean president was running into some hurdles .
brophy suggested that the state department could move things along in congress.the only problem was , brophy was representing a country she wasn t registered to represent.foreign agent registration act rules require individual lobbyists to register the clients they represent , and lobbying firms are required to file their contacts on behalf of those clients.brophy is a former clinton white house official , and has raised money for ready for hillary , a pro-clinton super pac that shut down when the former secretary of state announced her presidential campaign .
the clintons attended her wedding to lawyer and diplomat gerald mcgowan in 1998.the speech by then-president lee myung-bak did proceed and took place on oct. 13 , 2011.joel johnson , a managing director for glover park group , told buzzfeed news that brophy had in fact been on the team working on the south korean account and that she should have been listed as doing so in their fara documents .
she absolutely was working on the account and had been throughout , and the fact that she had somehow not been listed directly as the principal working on the account was an administrative error , johnson said.johnson also said that brophy should have reported that that contact had been made to the state department and for whatever reason that was not included in our list of activities and it should have been , and i ll go back and make sure we do whatever is appropriate to amend that .
blah blah blah is anyone else sick and tired of the clinton s and anyone attached to the clinton s not having to follow the same rules and laws the rest of america is expected to follow , or face the consequences of our actions ?
we take these reporting requirements seriously and we are as diligent as we ever can be , but in that case there s no question that the email she sent to [ mills ] have been included in the list of contacts glover park group had made on behalf of south korea , he said.yep so are we to believe you took grounding bernie to a pulp seriously ?
