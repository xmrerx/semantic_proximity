this is war and it s a fight for the sovereignty of america two things that donald trump said have been controversial and taken out of context by the left .
much of the protests against trump are based on the promise he made to close the border with mexico by building a wall .
the desire to halt refugee resettlement of muslims to america is the second thing trump said that s gotten everyone on the left freaking out.do americans not have a right to closed borders and proper vetting of muslim refugees ? we are footing the bill with our tax dollars for all the goodies the illegals and refugees get when they arrive .
yes , you pay for this ! the cost of illegals and refugees is billions every year .
we are over $ 19 trillion dollars in debt and climbing rapidly .
we have become a global magnet for immigration due to our generous entitlements for legal and illegal immigrants .
the cost is not sustainable ! the cost is one thing but the danger to americans is another reason to close our borders and stop refugee resettlement .
the fbi director said that the muslim refugees can not be properly vetted before they come to america .
there is testimony by numerous officials claiming that the terrorists are trying to come to america by posing as refugees .
the open borders also leads to opening ourselves up for terrorists and criminals to come to america .
who knows how many have arrived already ? trump s five point plan on illegal immigrationthe american people have a right to the sovereignty of our nation .
we can not survive without borders and trump knows it .
this is common sense policy that s been missing for so long .
the american people are 100 % fed up !
with their safety and tax dollars being toyed with and exploited .
time for a change and time to stand up for it ! america first !
