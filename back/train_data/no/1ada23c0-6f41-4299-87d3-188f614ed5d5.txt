because blaming the muslim migrants who raped and sexually assaulted an untold number of women on new years eve would be politically incorrect and certainly not very hospitable a political scandal is developing in germany as ordinary citizens wake up to the scale of the migrant crime cover-up , and the callous reaction of the mayor of cologne to mass-sex crime on new year s eve.the mayor of cologne has spoken out about the attacks , but her carefully chosen words are unlikely to delight many .
rather than addressing the root causes of the violence unlimited mass migration and a totally failed system of integration the newly elected pro-migrant mayor instead blamed the victims of the sexual abuse for having failed to defend themselves against the immigrant attackers.here is a video of the shocking chaos that took place on new years eve : speaking on live television this afternoon mayor henriette reker , who was near-fatally stabbed in the run up to october elections by an anti mass migration campaigner , said in future women would have to be better prepared in her city to deal with migrants.she remarked : the women and young girls have to be more protected in the future so these things don t happen again .
this means , they should go out and have fun , but they need to be better prepared , especially with the cologne carnival coming up .
for this , we will publish online guidelines that these young women can read through to prepare themselves .what form this guidance will take is presently unclear , the mayor could take inspiration from young victim whose modest clothes protected them from the worst consequences of walking at night in areas controlled by migrant men .
the woman said : fortunately i wore a jacket and trousers .
a skirt would probably have been torn away from me .despite her words of warning towards women in the city they could prepare for more violence against them , she refuted the suggestion there was any link between the attacks and migrants , contradicting her own chief of police.an opposition council member has today sounded the alarm bell on the deteriorating state of control the local government has over the city of cologne , and in an official letter from the council group has warned those planning to come to the famous cologne council next month the city and the police are unable to guarantee the safety of locals and tourists .council group leader and lawyer judith wolter said in her letter to the people of cologne today : i want as a member of the cologne city council to submit a travel warning for the carnival time in cologne city centre .
especially the area in and around the central station , the cathedral and the adjoining area towards the banks of the rhine for tourists ( and locals ) is no longer considered even in normal times as safe .
for months , there is in these areas numerous thefts , open drug dealing , robberies and harassment of all kinds dozens of women were sexually harassed in public and there was at least one rape .
neither the city nor the police are able to guarantee in the territory described the safety of tourists and locals .
especially for women it must be assumed that a high security risk is here in the evening and night hours .
at new year s eve there was a legal vacuum and a no-go area for women .
with the climax of the carnival season it is unfortunately expected to be a similar situation .german police have admitted to losing several urban areas to migrant gangs as so-called no-go zones , but this is possibly the first time a public square in the centre of a european city has been acknowledged by officials as having been lost to criminality , and out of the control of police at night.news of the attacks was suppressed for days , with just short reports of isolated incidents in cologne city centre making it to local outlets on new year s day.the kolnifsche rundschau described the scene at the railways station as largely peaceful and made no effort to describe those who attacked the young women , one of which told press she had fingers on every orifice after she was stripped near naked.only after nearly 100 victims of assault and abuse came forwards to police , and stories of attacks started circulating on social media did the truth of the situation start to slowly emerge , forcing local police to hold a press conference on monday afternoon.despite the chief of police admitting the enormous scale of sexual assault and confirming the attackers were of north african and arab origin , much of the mainstream media is still in damage control mode , either trying to shift the focus from migrants , or avoiding the events completely .
