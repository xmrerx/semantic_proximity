dubai ( reuters ) - a gunfight erupted briefly in aden on saturday when a contingent loyal to president abd-rabbu mansour hadi refused to hand over its positions to a local force , security sources said , and witnesses said one civilian was killed in the incident .
the clash underscores the complex situation in yemen , where a saudi-led coalition is fighting a 2-1/2 year war against iran-aligned houthis who control most of northern yemen , including the capital sanaa .
witnesses said the shooting occurred in al-arish on the aden abyan road , when a group of hadi s presidential protection forces refused to obey an order to hand over a checkpoint to the security belt , a force set up by the united arab emirates , a key member of the saudi-led coalition .
a security source described the incident as a mutiny although it was soon brought to an end .
the mutiny has ended and the situation is under control , the source told reuters .
the local aden al-ghad newspaper quoted the commander of the force , brigadier-general tareq ali hadi , as saying the incident arose from fear that forces under his command would be discharged without any compensation .
witnesses traveling on the road said a military helicopter from the coalition engaged the forces at a checkpoint during the clash .
they said one civilian was killed when he was caught in the crossfire , while three members of his family were injured by shrapnel from a rocket fired by an apache helicopter that struck a nearby house .
yemen has been torn by war since 2015 , when houthi forces backed by government troops loyal to former president ali abdullah saleh advanced on aden , forcing hadi to flee to saudi arabia .
