just take this chemotherapy sweetie .. the government knows what s best for you .
oops maybe not this time a judge formally ended the court-ordered guardianship of an amish girl who resisted a hospital s attempts to force her to resume chemotherapy , bringing a close to the fight that raised questions about the rights of parents in making medical decisions for their children.the judge s decision , announced friday , came more than a year after sarah hershberger s guardian gave up her efforts to force the girl into chemotherapy for leukemia.sarah and her parents went into hiding in the fall of 2013 .
sarah , who is now 12 , no longer shows signs of being sick , said kevin dunn , a probate judge in medina county.cancer free : sarah hershberger , second from right , is pictured at her family s roadside stand in homer township on september 24 .
also pictured are her father and three of her siblingsa visit to her home in august found that sarah was active and working daily on the family farm , she appeared healthy and appropriately developed , he wrote .
she had mris and bloodwork , and the judge over the last year helped facilitate at least one trip to the cleveland clinic .
the mris did not show any cancer , maurice thompson , the family s attorney , told the medina-gazette .
once you have it , you re never 100 percent out of the woods , whether or not you get chemotherapy.i know how she looks isn t really an indication of whether she has cancer , but she s looking very healthy .
however , dunn cautioned her parents that she is not fully recovered and warned that they still have a duty to provide her care under ohio law.her parents are not free to act entirely as they may choose , the judge said.thompson said in a statement that sarah s good health bolsters the case against forced health care that we supposedly can not live without .
the court fight began in the summer of 2013 , when sarah s parents decided to halt treatments because they feared chemotherapy was killing her.doctors at akron children s hospital said sarah s condition was treatable , but they argued she would die within a year if she stopped chemotherapy.the hospital went to court after the family decided to treat sarah with natural medicines , such as herbs and vitamins.maria schimer , an attorney who s also a registered nurse , was given the power to make medical decisions for sarah after an appeals court ruled the beliefs and convictions of the girl s parents couldn t outweigh the rights of the state to protect the child.but schimer decided to drop the effort because it became impossible to monitor sarah s health or make any medical decisions for her after she left home and went into hiding.the family fled their farm in northeast ohio s medina county and sought treatment in mexico before returning home after a few months.like most amish , the hershbergers shun many facets of modern life and are deeply religious.they have said they stopped chemotherapy not for religious reasons , but because it was making sarah too sick.via : uk daily mail
