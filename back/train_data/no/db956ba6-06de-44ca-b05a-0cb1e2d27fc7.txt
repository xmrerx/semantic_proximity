richmond , va. ( reuters ) - virginia ’ s governor vetoed a bill on monday that would have made the state the first in the country to require that parents be notified if students were assigned readings labeled “ sexually explicit. ” a mother ’ s objection to toni morrison ’ s novel “ beloved ” being taught in her son ’ s classroom helped spur the legislation that would have given parents more control over classroom materials .
“ this requirement lacks flexibility and would require the label of ‘ sexually explicit ’ to apply to an artistic work based on a single scene , without further context , ” governor terry mcauliffe , a democrat , said in a statement .
the bill passed the republican-controlled legislature by votes of 77-21 in the house of delegates and 22-17 in the senate .
that would not be enough to override mcauliffe ’ s veto , which would require a two-thirds vote in each chamber .
the measure would have made virginia the first u.s. state to mandate that schools notify parents if teachers planned to use the labeled materials , according to the american library association ’ s office for intellectual freedom .
mcauliffe said the virginia board of education was studying the issue , focusing on existing local policies and potential state policies .
the measure had been opposed by a number of free speech groups , including the american library association and the national coalition against censorship .
the novel by morrison , a nobel laureate , is the story of a runaway slave who kills her 2-year-old daughter to save her from a life in slavery .
“ beloved ” won the pulitzer prize for fiction in 1988 .
the american library association has it on a list of banned or challenged classics .
virginia house speaker william howell , a republican who was among the bill ’ s sponsors , said he was unaware of mcauliffe ’ s veto and had no reaction .
“ i have to see what his veto message said , ” he said .
