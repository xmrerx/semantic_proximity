Donald Trump decided that he would exploit a wounded vet to make himself look good, but as usual, all he ended up doing was making a total ass out of himself.
Again.Trump was visiting Walter Reed Medical Center on Saturday.
So he decided it would be great publicity if he personally awarded the Purple Heart to Army Sgt.
1st Class Alvaro Barrientos.
Things were going pretty well until Trump congratulated him on being wounded in Afghanistan.You see, while the Purple Heart is indeed one of the highest honors that can be bestowed upon someone serving in the U.S. military, it also means that the recipient was either wounded or killed.
As such, it isn t exactly the type of thing you congratulate somebody on.Barrientos was one of four soldiers who was wounded when an Afghan soldier attacked their base in the Helmland province last month.
As a result of his injuries, Barrientos lost his right leg, which had to be amputated at the knee.
You honor that but you sure as hell don t congratulate it.Trump, accompanied by Melania, presented Barrientos with the Purple Heart during a small ceremony at the hospital.
I heard about this and I wanted to do it myself, said Trump.
Congratulations on behalf of Melania, myself, and the entire nation.
Tremendous job.
He may not think words matter, but here in the real world, they most certainly do.
Especially when you are the commander-in-chief awarding the Purple Heart to a service member who just had a leg amputated fighting your country s wars.
Next time Trump decides to use a wounded vet a photo-op, he should be just a bit more careful when choosing his words.You can watch Trump congratulate a wounded soldier for having his leg amputated, here:Pres.
