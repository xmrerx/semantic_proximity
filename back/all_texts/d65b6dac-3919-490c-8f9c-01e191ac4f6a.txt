Owen Wilson as Hansel and Ben Stiller as Zoolander stopped by Saturday Night Live s Weekend Update to offer their professional advice and commentary about the fashion choices of the 2016 presidential candidates and it was hilarious.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5QM7UYi9mA]The pair began the segment by teasing Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.
Well, you know, Hillary is from the 90s, which is really hot right now, Hansel said.
Then Zoolander compared her attire to that of one of his all-time fashion icons Kim Jong-un.
Not to name drop, but I m pretty good friends with his sister, Kim Kardashi-un.
But the real fun began when the pair mistakenly confused Ted Cruz for Tom Cruise.
Using Cruise s past movie titles, the pair said: Next, we ve got Tom Cruise.
Oh, he s totally let himself go.
This is a real Mission Impossible for a stylist.
Makes me keep my Eyes Wide Shut.
He should take his Top Gun and do some Risky Business with a Cocktail.
And finally, they ended with none other than Donald Trump and his fashion choices.
When asked what they thought of Trump, the pair said: Oh, we love him.
Donny is just like us.
He has the classic male model look.
Donny has orange mocha crapaccino.
And this one is called hot mess.
When all was said and done, the funniest jokes were on the Republican front-runner.
