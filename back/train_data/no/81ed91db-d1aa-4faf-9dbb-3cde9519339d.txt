when the majority of students , regardless of color , accept this twisted premise , obama has won his war on america and has successfully divided us by race the state university of new york at binghamton ( suny-binghamton ) is offering a training class titled stopwhitepeople2k16 , to instruct residential assistants ( ras ) on how to deal with uneducated people who don t believe in ideas like white privilege.the class is just one of several available to ras at the school , and was discovered by the binghamton review , a student newspaper .
residential assistants are students who agree to assist with overseeing and monitoring residential life in return for receiving a free room from the school .
apparently , though , binghamton ras also have the responsibility of stopping white people .
the premise of this session is to help others take the next step in understanding diversity , privilege , and the society we function within , the class description says .
learning about these topics is a good first step , but when encountered with good arguments from uneducated people , how do you respond ?
this open discussion will give attendees the tools to do so , and hopefully expand upon what they may already know .
