( but ) we re jumping ahead of anything that s being discussed right now ... as ( the council ) try to get civilians out , he told reuters by phone .
up to 400 militants are believed to remain in a small part of raqqa surrounded by the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) alliance of kurdish and arab militias , he said .
the foreign fighters ( in is ) , we fully expect them to fight till the end - there s a hardcore of ( foreign ) fighters .
but we have seen a rate of four to five isis fighters surrendering a week , including emirs - local leaders within raqqa - over the past month , dillon said , using another acronym for islamic state .
