vatican city ( reuters ) - pope francis , in some his strongest comments ever on nuclear weapons , said on friday that the world should condemn not only their possible use but their very possession .
the appeal came at the start of a two-day conference on nuclear disarmament that has brought together 11 nobel peace prize winners , as well as united nations and nato officials , discussing prospects for a world free of nuclear weapons .
addressing the group , francis spoke of the catastrophic humanitarian and environmental effects of any employment of nuclear devices and added : if we also take into account the risk of an accidental detonation as a result of error of any kind , the threat of their use , as well as their very possession , is to be firmly condemned .
