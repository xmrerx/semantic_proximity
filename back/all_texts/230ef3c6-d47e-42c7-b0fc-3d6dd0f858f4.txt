As Hillary Clinton looks forward to the general election, her shortlist for prospective vice presidential candidates has narrowed to just five, consisting of some of the most progressive figures in Washington and beyond.If Clinton wants so pick up some of the die-hard Bernie Sanders supporters, some of whom have pledged not to vote for the former Secretary of State, she will need to match her moderate-to-progressive image with a full on liberal progressive by her side.While Sanders does not make the list, progressive firebrand Elizabeth Warren makes the list, along with:All candidates show absolute tactics besides Warren and Perez, each candidate comes from a swing state paramount to Democrats clinching a victory.
No president in modern America has won without carrying Ohio, which would explain having Sherrod Brown on the ticket (and he s a solid progressive).
Kaine and Hickenlooper also come from must win states for Clinton and the Democrats, while Perez (who is Hispanic and speaks fluent Spanish), would help drive out the Hispanic and Latino vote.Warren would undoubtedly bring in Sanders core base of support young, white, liberal and Independent.The only trouble with picking Brown or Warren would be that their respective states have Republican governors, which would hurt Democrats chance of taking back the Senate.While Donald Trump has Sarah Palin on his shortlist (along with the hated Chris Christie and Ted Cruz), Clinton has found herself a diverse group of liberals who have fought hard for worker s rights and minority rights.Outlets speculated for months that Donald Trump should pick Governor Susana Martinez or former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice should he want to repair his broken image with women and minority voters.
But, in typical Trump form, he decided to do the opposite and go with a band of moronic ideologues.
Marco Rubio is on his short list, but even Hispanic and Latino don t like him, and women certainly hate Sarah Palin.
His never ending pandering isn t getting him anywhere with the voting blocs that matter.Featured image via John Sommers/Getty Images
