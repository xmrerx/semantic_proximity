WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch on Wednesday rejected a bipartisan healthcare deal aimed at stabilizing Obamacare, saying the Senate bill was too costly.
“No way to pay for it.
Oh my gosh, give me a break.
I appreciate the innovation and the attempt to do it right.
But it doesn’t help,” the Utah Republican told reporters.
“I certainly don’t think it’s a good idea.” As the Republican head of the Senate finance panel, Hatch oversees legislation that addresses the financial aspects of healthcare policy.
