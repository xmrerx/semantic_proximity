the left believes these are all perfectly acceptable topics to discuss with our young children .
whatever you do , just don t mention god ! a public hearing is taking place wednesday morning in the massachusetts state house to look into a controversial sex survey given to middle school and high school students.developed by the centers for disease control and called the youth risk behavior survey , the survey asks students as young as 12 a series of very personal and highly ideological questions.the survey asks students if they are homosexual and if they are transgender .
it also asks if they have had oral or anal sex and if they have performed such acts with up to six people.whether or not they have carried a gun , smoked cigarettes , consumed alcohol and how much also appear on the questionnaire , as well as whether they have taken drugs , such as oxycontin , percocet , and vicodin .
it asks how often their guardian uses a seat belt , if the youngster has a sexually transmitted disease , and where they sleep.the group massresistance says the survey is psychologically distorting and will lead the child to think he is abnormal if he is not doing it all .
the group stated that having children reveal personal issues about themselves and their family can have emotional consequences .
they also complain that the survey results are used by radical groups from planned parenthood to lgbt groups to persuade politicians to give more taxpayer money [ to ] these groups .
though students fill out the survey anonymously , massresistance warns that they are administered by the teacher in the classroom and there is often pressure for all kids to participate .
the test is given nationally and not without controversy .
the chicago tribune reported two years ago that a chicago teacher was reprimanded for telling students they had a constitutional right not to fill out the survey.via : breitbart news
