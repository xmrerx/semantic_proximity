madrid ( reuters ) - peruvian nobel prize-winning author mario vargas llosa said on tuesday that donald trump was a “ clown ” and a “ racist ” who would doom the republican party to defeat if it chose him as its candidate for november ’ s u.s. presidential election .
“ he is a danger to the united states , ” said vargas llosa , who himself ran as a center-right candidate for the peruvian presidency in 1990 .
“ it is a country that is too important for the rest of the world to have in the white house a clown , a demagogue and a racist like mr trump , ” he told a news conference in madrid to launch his new novel , “ cinco esquinas ” ( “ five corners ” ) .
trump , the frontrunner in the republican primaries , has said he wants to build a wall along the u.s. border with mexico and deport 11 million illegal immigrants .
he also suggested , at his campaign launch last june , that mexican immigrants were rapists and drug dealers .
vargas llosa said trump ’ s “ seemingly unstoppable ” campaign would guarantee another term for the democratic party .
“ hillary clinton surely will win a massive victory if the republican candidate is donald trump , ” he said .
vargas llosa , 79 , won the nobel literature prize in 2010 and now lives mainly in madrid .
he is known for books such as “ the time of the hero ” that explore latin america ’ s structures of political power .
