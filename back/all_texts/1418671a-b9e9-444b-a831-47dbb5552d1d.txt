For months now, Donald Trump has been leading the polls for the republican party s presidential nomination.
His devoted followers hang on his every word, while he promises to do impossible things, like build a wall across the Mexican border and ban Muslims from entering the United States.Is Trump taking these voters for a ride?This twelve-minute video compilation, published by the non-profit foundation One World Voice, gives an interesting overview of Trump s many changing faces and contradictory political positions.The video includes clips of Trump praising Bill and Hillary Clinton, stating his pro-choice beliefs, supporting partial birth abortion, praising the Chinese, even giving democrats credit for creating a better economy than republicans have ever been able to create.After more than twelve minutes of video evidence that seems to contradict many of Donald Trump s recent statements on the campaign trail, the video s creators ask: Still think Trump is a true conservative?
Why support him when we have other real conservatives?

He s been sued for fraud over everything from bogus real estate deals to his sham school, formerly known as Donald Trump University.It s likely Trump doesn t mean anything he says.
Over the past several months what s become obvious is that he will say anything that is likely to get him publicity or attention, no matter how disgusting it is.Like Ben Carson s campaign, Donald Trump s bid for president is just another way to gain publicity and boost his bank own account.As Addicting Info reported here, Carson s campaign has been exposed as nothing more than a publicity stunt, designed to boost his book sales and increase the size of his own bank account.
His staff began dropping like flies on New Year s Day, with more and more resignations rolling in all the time.Trump s campaign is not much different than Carson s. Donald Trump has been a money-grubbing attention whore for decades.
A presidential bid is no doubt just a way to get his face on TV and his name in the press, all while bilking his devoted followers out of millions and millions of dollars.
