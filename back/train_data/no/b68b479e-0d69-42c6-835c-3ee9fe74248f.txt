cayenne ( reuters ) - french president emmanuel macron said on friday that he was fully supportive of spanish prime minister mariano rajoy , regarding the crisis taking place in catalonia .
the spanish government moved to impose direct rule over catalonia , stripping the region of its autonomy less than an hour after its parliament declared independence in a stunning show of defiance .
i have always said that i have one interlocutor in spain , it is prime minister rajoy , macron told journalists on the sidelines of a visit to french guiana .
there is a rule of law in spain with constitutional rules .
mariano rajoy wants these rules to be respected and he has my full support , macron added .
european commission president jean-claude juncker , who was accompanying macron , also said it was important to avoid any splits and fractures in the european union bloc .
i do not want a situation where , tomorrow , the european union is made up of 95 different states .
we need to avoid splits , because we already have enough splits and fractures and we do not need any more , said juncker .
the president of the european council , donald tusk , also voiced support to rajoy earlier on friday .
