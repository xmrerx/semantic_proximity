When on the campaign trail, those running for office like to use music to bolster enthusiasm from the crowds, help spread their message, and look as though they re hip to modern day pop culture.
Often times, what these politicians don t think about is the fact that the artists that make the music might not want their music to be used, especially by specific people.
Such is the case with Donald Trump and his use of music by the singing sensation (and goddess) Adele.Trump has continuously used Adele s song from her 21 album Rolling in the Deep.
Of course, the key lyric from that being We could ve had it all.
Basically, implying that a vote for Trump is a vote for everything you could ever want.However, as it turns out, Adele does NOT want Trump using her music, and a spokesman for the singer told The Independent: Adele has not given permission for her music to be used for any political campaigning.
It can also be implied that every time Huckabee tries to use Adele s song Hello in the bizarre way that he does, that this too is frowned upon.Adele has actually chosen to stay out of the political scene altogether, especially after a comment she made in 2011 where she stated that she was a Labour girl.
And if you re unaware, the Labour Party is a center-left party in the United Kingdom.She s not the only one to take issue with politicians using their music.
REM even went so far as to take to Twitter in a very verbose rant, with frontman Michael Stipe saying to Trump and Co.: Go fuck yourselves, the lot of you you sad, attention grabbing, power-hungry little men.
Do not use our music or my voice for your moronic charade of a campaign.
Aerosmith also told Trump to f*ck off in so many words.Lesson from all of this ask permission.However, it must be frustrating when all the good music out there comes from the left side of the aisle.
