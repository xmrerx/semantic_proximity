ankara ( reuters ) - iran said on tuesday u.s. president donald trump can not cause its nuclear deal with six major powers to collapse .
the nuclear deal will not collapse ... those who hope that trump will cause its collapse , are wrong , iranian president hassan rouhani said in a speech broadcast live on state tv .
in october , trump declined to certify that iran was complying with the nuclear agreement reached among tehran , the united states and other powers in 2015 .
his decision triggered a 60-day window for congress to decide whether to bring back sanctions on iran .
congress passed the ball back to trump by letting the deadline on reimposing sanctions on iran pass last week .
trump must decide in mid-january if he wants to continue to waive energy sanctions on iran .
under the deal , nuclear-related sanctions imposed on iran were lifted last year , in return for tehran curbing its nuclear program .
iran has said it will stick to the accord as long as the other signatories respect it , but will shred the deal if washington pulls out .
