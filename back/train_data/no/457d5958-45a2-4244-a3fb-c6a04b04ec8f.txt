newly unearthed video shows bernie sanders giving a hatemongering republican representative a piece of his mind for referring to homos serving in the military.the video , from 1995 , shows then rep. bernie sanders taking to the floor in the house of representatives in response to the slur from republican rep. duke cunningham.cunningham used the term when he said , is there any shocking doubt , the same people that would vote to cut defense $ 177 billion , the same ones that would put homos in the military , the same ones that would not fund brac , the same ones that would not clean up then sanders cut him short : https : //www.facebook.com/huffingtonpost/videos/10153689923086130/ my ears may have been playing a trick on me , but i thought i heard the gentleman a moment ago say something quote unquote about homos in the military , sanders said .
was i right in hearing that expression ?
absolutely , cunningham responded .
putting homosexuals in the military .
was the gentleman referring to the thousands and thousands of gay people who have put their lives on the line in countless wars defending this country ?
was that the groups of people that the gentleman was referring to ?
you have insulted thousands of men and women who have put their lives on the line , sanders continued .
i think they are owed an apology .
even conservative republicans don t use language like that anymore ( at least in public ) , but it is jarring to hear that kind of slur from a member on the floor of the house , just a little over twenty years ago.while duke cunningham didn t back down to sanders , a decade after this exchange , karma caught up with him .
cunningham was arrested and charged with accepting at least $ 2.4 million in bribes and underreporting his taxable income .
in 2005 he pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit bribery , mail fraud , wire fraud and tax evasion .
he spent 2005-13 in prison.featured image via screen capture
