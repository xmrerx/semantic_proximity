moscow ( reuters ) - russian president vladimir putin said on wednesday he had not yet decided whether he would run for re-election in march 2018 , something he is widely expected to do .
not only have i not decided yet who i will stand against , i have not decided whether i will run at all , putin said , when asked who he would run against at the election .
speaking at an energy forum in moscow , putin said presidential hopefuls would have to announce their decision to run in late november or early december .
if putin decides to run , he is widely expected to win a landslide victory in the first round of the vote , because he will face no strong challenge .
a russian court sentenced opposition leader alexei navalny to his third jail term this year on monday , disrupting plans by the long-time outspoken kremlin critic to campaign before russia s coming election .
his current 20-day term in jail means he will miss a campaign rally planned in putin s hometown of st petersburg on oct. 7 - the russian leader s birthday .
in any case , opinion polls show that navalny would lose badly to putin if he ran .
the kremlin on tuesday warned supporters of navalny not to hold unsanctioned rallies , saying the organizers of such events would be prosecuted .
