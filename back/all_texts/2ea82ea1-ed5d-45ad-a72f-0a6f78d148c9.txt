It seemed like it took exactly 30 seconds for every person on the right-wing to take Hillary Clinton s early departure from a 9/11 memorial as proof that she is suffering from some severe medical disorder.
In reality, Clinton did actually become overheated.
Her medical doctor released a statement that explains that Clinton is currently suffering from pneumonia.
It explains why she has been coughing on the campaign trail and why she needed to leave the event she was attending in New York.Politico reports that Clinton s physician, Lisa Bardack released a statement saying: Secretary Clinton has been experiencing a cough related to allergies.
On Friday, during follow up evaluation of her prolonged cough, she was diagnosed with pneumonia.
She was put on antibiotics, and advised to rest and modify her schedule.
While at this morning s event, she became overheated and dehydrated.
I have just examined her and she is now re-hydrated and recovering nicely.
Shocking.
It s almost as if Clinton is a human being who gets sick.
Pneumonia can, of course, turn deadly.
However, given the medical miracles of the modern age, she ll probably be fine.
Just as Clinton s doctor, who you know, actually has a medical degree, and who examined her just today after the incident says she will be.Thanks to right-wing blowhards such as Sean Hannity, this bizarre health conspiracy has gone totally mainstream.
It really says a lot about the power that the right-wing has harnessed when it comes to the media, both in traditional and online formats.
They managed to turn a brief clip of Clinton falling while being rushed into a car into absolute proof that Clinton is suffering from Alzheimer s disease or whatever they believe she has this week.Welcome to the era of Alex Jones-like mass media speculation.Featured image from Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
