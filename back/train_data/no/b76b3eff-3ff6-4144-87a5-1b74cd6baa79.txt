guatemala city ( reuters ) - guatemala s attorney general and a united nations-backed commission against impunity in guatemala searched the offices of millicom international cellular s local unit on thursday as part of a corruption investigation .
the raid comes four months after ivan velasquez , head of the commission , known as cicig , said in july it would investigate tigo , the guatemalan affiliate of emerging markets mobile and media group millicom , over alleged illegal campaign financing and corruption .
tigo declined to comment on the raid .
guatemalan police arrested 17 people in july on suspicion of involvement in a corruption racket allegedly directed by the country s former communications minister , alejandro sinibaldi , who has been on the run since june 2016 .
during the probe , investigators found evidence of payments from telecomunicaciones de guatemala s.a. ( telgua ) , a subsidiary of billionaire carlos slim s america movil , in sinibaldi s account .
cicig said that the payments were made to secure the company favorable treatment in a dispute with tigo .
america movil said at the time it would audit the unit .
in october 2015 , millicom said it had reported to u.s. and swedish authorities potential improper payments on behalf of its joint-venture in guatemala , sending its shares down .
it was not immediately clear if this was related to the current investigation .
