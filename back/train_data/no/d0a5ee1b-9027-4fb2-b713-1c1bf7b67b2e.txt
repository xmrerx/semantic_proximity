united nations ( reuters ) - french president emmanuel macron said on tuesday he wanted to play a mediation role between iran and the united states to ensure that tehran was involved in finding a political solution in syria .
if we don t resolve the syrian problem with iran around the table , then we will not have an efficient response because iran today is among the powers that have an influence on the ground , macron told a news conference .
paris is trying to set up an international contact group on syria to revive stalled peace talks in geneva , but the united states has adopted a staunchly anti-iran stance since president donald trump took power , complicating peace talks between major powers .
noting the u.s. refusal today , i want that the contact group advances and that the united nations and france can serve as intermediaries with iran , macron said .
