conakry ( reuters ) - hundreds of rioters in the guinean bauxite mining town of boke burned down a police and a gendarmerie building on thursday and clashed with security forces wielding batons , leaving 17 people injured , the local red cross said .
guinean authorities managed to avoid the bloodshed of previous days by desisting from using live bullets on the demonstrators in the boke neighborhood of kolabounyi , guinean red cross member oumar kalissa told reuters by telephone .
rioting by angry youths - who say bauxite mining has brought constant pollution and noise but no jobs or services like water and electricity - has paralyzed boke for most of the past week .
despite decades of mining , guinea , africa s top bauxite producer , remains one of the world s least developed countries .
the mines around boke produce some 15 million tonnes of aluminum ore for the west african nation s largest mining companies societe miniere de boke ( smb ) and companie bauxite de guinee ( cbg ) , but their operations have repeatedly halted in the past week and are currently still blocked by demonstrators .
cbg is 49 percent owned by the guinean state and the remainder by alcoa , rio tinto alcan [ rioxxa.ul ] and dadco .
smb is owned by guinea , china s winning shipping ltd , shandong weiqiao [ sdwqp.ul ] and ums international ltd .
the government strongly condemns these acts which are clearly outside law , government spokesman damantang albert camara said in a statement .
