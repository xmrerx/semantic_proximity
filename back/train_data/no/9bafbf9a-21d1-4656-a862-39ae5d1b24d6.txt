the donald trump presidential campaign is in trouble .
he s behind in the polls , by as much as double digits , and many of his donors are asking for their money back .
it s crisis time , so naturally , they are asking for more money .
trump s middle son eric signed his name to the latest fundraising campaign , and it includes a map showing trump winning by a landslide with this message : as one of the most dedicated grassroots leaders in the country you know , momentum matters , the email , sent on behalf of the trump campaign , reads .
and right now all the momentum is on our side .
we re making huge gains against crooked hillary that you can see for yourself .
there s just one problem.the map comes from fivethirtyeight.com s nate silver .
nate rarely screws up , so why does this map show trump winning nearly every state ? because that map is a part of a little experiment .
it doesn t show momentum , as the trump campaign is trying to tell us .
it is a map of how the election would look if only men voted .
while that might be a dream of the trump camp , more than half the electorate are women .
here s that map if only women voted : here s what the map would look line if only women voted : https : //t.co/sjvy67qoue pic.twitter.com/rrc3guxmgl nate silver ( @ natesilver538 ) october 11 , 2016the united states of women vs .

# getinformation https : //t.co/4ctf1fp6ej celestia ( @ ginjasnappy ) october 12 , 2016shame about that 19th amendment , @ erictrump , but good luck with this strategy , asshat .
https : //t.co/djhywrb2ed thereseodell ( @ thereseodell ) october 12 , 2016guys hear me out here : it s very possible @ erictrump has no idea that women can vote .
https : //t.co/eutrbylnys heather reid ( @ hkreid ) october 12 , 2016perhaps pre-suffrage is the america trump wants to take us back to , but at a time when the campaign is under fire for the way the gop candidate treats women , this email was either really stupid or the campaign has no desire to get the women s vote , and no desire to win .
