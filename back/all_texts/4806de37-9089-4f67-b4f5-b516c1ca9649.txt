Chrissy Teigen is a model.
She s not expected to be particularly intellectual, but a series of tweets shows that she s intellectually miles ahead of someone you d expect to have a brain Donald Trump spokeswoman Katrina Pierson..Teigen began her Twitter attack on Pierson on Sunday.
Pierson, apparently not getting sarcasm, retweeted some of the insults, and no, it was not ironic.I relate to @KatrinaPierson in the way that I would also be an incredibly horrible choice of campaign spokesperson christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) August 28, 2016 I get it, @KatrinaPierson.
Get that $.
Sell that soul.
I personally could not go to bed sobbing into my pillow but you re just so strong.
christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) August 28, 2016Can you imagine giving up as hard as @KatrinaPierson?
christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) August 28, 2016 Not many of us could wake up and do what @KatrinaPierson does every day with a straight face.
What an inspiration.

#NeverGiveUp https://t.co/3EMIh2whWb Katrina Pierson (@KatrinaPierson) August 28, 2016Of course, none of this should be a surprise.
To her, words are meaningless at least that s what she said on Thursday when she was asked about Trump s immigration flip-flop:#Trump surrogate @KatrinaPierson: He hasn t changed his immigration position, he has changed the words he is saying.
pic.twitter.com/CLkVeh2yP4 Correct The Record (@CorrectRecord) August 25, 2016Katrina Pierson should be hated by Republicans.
She was born to a teenage mom who *gasp* collected welfare.
She has a criminal record for shoplifting.
She voted for Barack Obama in 2008.
But she has turned against everything that helped make her who she is today.
She accuses other mothers who collect welfare of redistributing wealth.
She decided she hates Obama because he didn t wear a lapel pin.
She also loves Sarah Palin, which explains so, so much.
I doubt Palin has the sarcasm gene either.Featured image via video screen capture.
