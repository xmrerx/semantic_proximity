White House press briefings have gone completely dark.
Sean Spicer and Donald Trump s press team are either skipping daily briefings altogether or they re holding them, but with no video and no audio.Jim Acosta, CNN s top White House Correspondent, might not be able to broadcast the press briefings, but he took to Twitter and let the White House have it.WH briefing about to start.
We re told we cannot use video or audio from this gaggle.

So here is a look at some new socks I bought over the wknd pic.twitter.com/wO9erspwYa Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 19, 2017Make no mistake about what we are all witnessing.
This is a WH that is stonewalling the news media.
Hiding behind no camera/no audio gaggles Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 19, 2017Call me old fashioned but I think the White House of the United States of America should have the backbone to answer questions on camera.
Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 19, 2017No wonder Acosta is pissed, with this:At off camera no audio briefing, Spicer took a question from a Russian reporter but not from CNN.
#pravda Jim Acosta (@Acosta) June 19, 2017And for the inevitable Trump tweet calling CNN fake news, We are real news Mr. President.
#realnews Jim Acosta (@Acosta) February 18, 2017The White House will find and is finding that shutting out the American media is a huge mistake.
Trump is managing to make enemies of the news media.
Not only that, keeping Americans in the dark is a sure fire way to turn Americans against Trump as his administration falls under further and further scrutiny.
While questions over whether Trump colluded with Russia surround the White House, their refusal to answer questions for the American people is certainly not making them look innocent.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images.
