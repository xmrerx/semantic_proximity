( reuters ) - michael flynn , president donald trump ’ s first u.s. national security adviser , pleaded guilty on friday to lying to the federal bureau of investigation about his contacts with russia ’ s u.s. ambassador .
here are five facts about flynn : flynn was national security adviser for just 24 days , from jan. 20 , when trump took office , to feb. 13 .
flynn was fired following disclosures that he had discussed u.s. sanctions on russia with sergey kislyak , moscow ’ s u.s. ambassador , and misled vice president mike pence about the conversations .
on feb. 14 , trump asked then-fbi director james comey in an oval office meeting to end the agency ’ s investigation into ties between flynn and russia , according to news media reports .
trump , who fired comey on may 9 , later denied making such a request .
trump had named the former army lieutenant general to the national security post despite red flags about flynn ’ s russian contacts and advocacy for warmer u.s. relations with moscow , which has been under u.s. economic sanctions for years .
outgoing president barack obama had warned trump not to hire flynn , who had been fired by the democratic president in 2014 .
flynn was an early and vociferous trump supporter during the new york businessman ’ s 2016 white house run .
he made vitriolic appearances on the campaign trail , notably leading the republican national convention in chants of “ lock her up , ” referring to trump ’ s democratic rival , former secretary of state hillary clinton .
in addition to flynn ’ s contacts with russia , special counsel robert mueller ’ s investigation of possible ties between the trump election campaign and moscow has expanded its probe to include flynn ’ s paid work as a lobbyist for a turkish businessman in 2016 , people with knowledge of the inquiry have told reuters .
