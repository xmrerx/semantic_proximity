A Tennessee woman has obviously bought into the left s playbook to act as crazy as possible when at a town hall The ironic thing in what she did is she now cannot vote.
Felons can t vote LOL!WEAKELY COUNTY, Tenn. A Weakely County woman was arrested after reportedly following Congressman David Kustoff and then threatening him.Police say Wendi Wright followed a car down Highway 45 Monday afternoon.
Inside the car were Congressman Kustoff and aide Marianne Dunavant.
Wright reportedly followed the car after it left a town hall on the UT Martin campus.THIS WOMAN LEFT THE TOWN HALL AND ENDANGERED THE LIVES OF THE CONGRESSMAN AND HIS PASSENGER!
WHO DOES THAT?A police report states Kustoff and Dunavant felt they were in danger of being forced off the road.When they pulled into the driveway of someone they know, Wright reportedly ran to the car and screamed while banging on the car and reaching in.She then reportedly blocked the car until police were called and she ran away.Wright later posted about the incident on her Facebook account.She is charged with felony reckless endangerment.This incident is such a sign of the times we re in.
The left is so out of control and so angry.THIS CONGRESSMAN HAS A WIFE AND TWO CHILDREN!The main stream media and Democrat politicians are guilty of feeding this anger and hate with all of their lies and inflammatory language.
Shame on them!Via: wreg
