Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch better start lawyering up President Donald Trump is reportedly thinking about bringing former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani on as his Attorney General, White House sources told Axios on Monday.Axios Mike Allen wrote that Trump has recently pondered the idea of nominating Giuliani for the job currently held by Attorney General Jeff Sessions.The news came soon after Trump s latest broadside at the beleaguered head of his Justice Department.
So why aren t the Committees and investigators, and of course our beleaguered A.G., looking into Crooked Hillary s crimes & Russia relations?
Trump tweeted on Monday morning.Trump s views on his attorney general have soured in the months since Sessions decided it was best to recuse himself from any investigations involving the Trump campaign, which he was closely associated with.
That includes all of the Russia-related investigations, which special counsel Robert Mueller is overseeing.In an interview last week with The New York Times, Trump said he wouldn t have hired Sessions if he knew he d recuse himself from the Russia investigation.
So Jeff Sessions takes the job, gets into the job, recuses himself, Trump said.
I then have which, frankly, I think is very unfair to the president.
How do you take a job and then recuse yourself?
If he would have recused himself from the job, I would have said, Thanks, Jeff, but I can t, you know, I m not going to take you.
It s extremely unfair, and that s a mild word, to the president.
So he recuses himself.
I then end up with a second man, who s a deputy.
When Trump was first selecting his top cabinet officials after winning the November election, Giuliani insisted on being named the secretary of state.
He reportedly was not interested in other top posts, including the attorney general.
