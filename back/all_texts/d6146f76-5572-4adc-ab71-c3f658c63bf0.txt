Is karma knocking on her door?Mayor Lyda Krewson released a statement following the verdict saying, I am appalled at what happened to Anthony Lamar Smith.
Krewson s comment drew a rebuke from Neil Bruntrager, Stockley s lawyer.
How do you promote all those things by creating distrust in a system that clearly worked under these circumstances?
Bruntrager said.
It is irresponsible and a disservice to the community to make statements like that.
It s an insult to Judge Wilson to make statements like that.
And it falsely encourages the belief that an injustice was done here when in fact justice was done.
