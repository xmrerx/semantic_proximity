( reuters ) - u.s. airline alaska airlines on tuesday said it would discontinue a daily flight between los angeles and havana , cuba , after jan. 22 , due to the recent changes in cuba travel policies by the u.s. government .
the u.s. government made it tougher last week for americans to visit cuba and do business in the country , making good on a pledge by president donald trump to roll back his democratic predecessor s move toward warmer ties with havana .
the regulations include a ban on americans doing business with some 180 cuban government entities , holding companies , and tourism companies .
the airline which started the los angeles-havana flight in january this year , said it will redeploy the aircraft to other markets with stronger demand .
passengers who have tickets booked to havana after january 22 will be rebooked on another airline at no additional cost or a full refund , the company said .
