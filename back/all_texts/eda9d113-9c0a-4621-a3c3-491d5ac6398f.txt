As President Obama prepares to leave office, he leaves behind a stunning, historical legacy: 75 months of continuous job growth, a record not seen since 1939.That s right, President Obama has overseen a feat not matched since at least 78 years ago.
While the Bush Administration lost millions of jobs (800k a month in 2008), the Obama Administration has created over 2 million in 2016 alone, and a whopping 11.3 million over the course of his presidency.Because of the hard work and dedication of this man, 11.3 million more Americans can rest easier at night knowing they have employment in a recovering economy.The unemployment rate, which peaked at 10 percent in October 2009, has slipped down to 4.7 percent, as of December 2016.Not only have millions of Americans been put back to work, the average American saw their earnings rise almost three percent in the last year alone, the largest increase since President Obama took office in 2009.As the final weeks come to a close, the President can look back and know that he built this and never wavered in that promise.While the Republicans called his signature achievements Obamacare, the auto bailout, Wall Street reform job killing programs, the facts speak for themselves.
Rhetoric v. results.It s amazing, really.
The only President s that have managed this kind of economic growth to this magnitude are Presidents Obama and Roosevelt, both of whom are Democrats.After listening, for 7 years, to John Boehner and Paul Ryan and Mitch McConnell exclaim Where are the jobs!?
we can finally lay it out of them, in black and white: 11.3 million.
Thanks for your help.
Barack Obama, the job-creating president, will be handing over the keys to Donald Trump.
The facts laid out above should not be forgotten.
After years of unprecedented obstruction, nothing would be more unjust than to give credit, no matter how slight, to Donald Trump.Featured image via Winn McNamee/Getty Images
