There have been a lot of strange things to happen over the course of this election cycle, but what you re about to witness may be in the top ten, maybe even the top three.As much as it s nice to see one time foes Donald Trump and Ben Carson getting along so splendidly, albeit likely for illegal reasons, this new bromance took a turn for the awkward while at a fundraising event in Mar-a-Lago, Florida, when the two were seen dancing together while being serenaded.While the singer sang what could easily be the whitest version of Ben E. King s Stand By Me ever sung, Trump and Carson casually swayed back and forth to the easy listening tune in front of a crowd of eager donors who can t wait for Trump to turn all of America into a casino and/or golf resort.Of course, the singer would swap in words like Donald Trump, stand by me and while I know this may make most sane people vomit, or likely laugh at the idea of Trump actually caring about anyone other than himself, Trump did seem to like it.There s really no other way to describe what happened, so please check it out for yourselves.Watch the video here via Washington Post: Featured image via video screen capture
