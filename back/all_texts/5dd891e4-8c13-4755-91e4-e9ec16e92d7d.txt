Professor Olga Cox, who teaches Human Sexuality at Orange Coast College, told her class in December that the election of Donald Trump was an act of terrorism.
Despite this, Cox was recently nominated and selected by her fellow faculty members for the Professor of the Year award.According to students, it is an Orange Coast College tradition for the recipient of the annual Professor of the Year award to be the keynote speaker at the school s graduation ceremony each year.
It s an act of terrorism, Professor Cox said to her class in December regarding President Trump s election.
One of the most frightening things for me, and most people in my life, she continued, is that the people committing the assault are among us.
It is not some stranger from some other country coming in and attacking our sense of what it means to be an American and the things that we stands for.
And that makes it more painful.
Here s the video that captures Professor Olga Cox s disgusting remarks:Her comments were videotaped by OCC student Caleb O Neil, who was suspended by the school for allegedly unlawfully recording the indignant professor until the school retracted its punishment in the face of backlash.The selection for the Professor of the Year award is made by a committee that consists of faculty, staff, and administrators, and is based on a rubric that takes into account multiple factors including teaching, service to the campus, and community involvement.
Despite the nationwide negative attention and condemnation from the community in the wake of these incidents, this committee recommended Professor Cox as their choice to receive Professor of the Year and the OCC administration accepted the committee s nomination.Doug Bennett, the Executive Director of College Advancement for OCC, confirmed to Red Alert Politics in an email that Professor Cox had won the nomination for Professor of the Year award but declined to accept it.
A member of the campus community nominated Professor Cox for the award, the committee selected her through the rubric, but the award isn t being made because she has declined, says Bennett.
