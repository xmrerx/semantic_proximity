this is why trump is getting the great numbers and large crowds .
he s being the anti-candidate and saying what s on his mind instead of scripted answers like the other candidates .
it s real refreshing .
he s commenting on what happened when the black lives matter thugs ran bernie sanders off of a stage during a rally .
trump couldn t be more on target with his remarks .
