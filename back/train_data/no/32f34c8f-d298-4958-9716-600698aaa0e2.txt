( reuters ) - lockheed martin corp received pentagon approval on tuesday to begin production of 200 new heavy cargo helicopters for the u.s. marines , the department of defense said .
the long-expected award for the ch-53k king stallion will on average cost $ 87 million each and $ 105 million including spare parts and certain service contracts , a defense department official had told reuters last week .
the approval of the $ 27 billion program , which includes more than $ 6 billion in research and development costs , is a major milestone for the largest u.s. defense contractor .
the new helicopter , developed by lockheed â€™ s sikorsky helicopter business , can lift 36,000 pounds and would replace the ch-53e super stallion , which has operated as the backbone of field logistics for the u.s. marines since the mid-1980s .
the first four helicopters are scheduled for delivery next year , with another two to follow , the defense department said .
the marine corps intends to transition eight active duty squadrons , one training squadron , and one reserve squadron from ch-53e to ch-53k , according to the statement .
