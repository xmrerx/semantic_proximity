tripoli ( reuters ) - the libyan capital s mitiga airport was evacuated on tuesday and civilian flights were repeatedly suspended as rival armed groups clashed nearby , officials said .
flights had restarted around midday on tuesday after being suspended for several hours during the morning and the previous evening , mitiga spokesman khaled abukhrais said .
but by late afternoon heavy gunfire resumed and the airport was shut .
unfortunately the air space has closed again and the airport has been evacuated for the safety and security of passengers and workers , due to renewed clashes , an airport statement said .
mitiga is a military air base near the center of tripoli that has also hosted civilian flights since the international airport was largely destroyed by fighting in 2014 .
the clashes began when the special deterrence force ( rada ) , a group that controls mitiga and operates as an anti-crime unit aligned with the u.n.-backed government , conducted raids in the nearby neighborhood of ghrarat .
rada spokesman ahmed bin salem said the group targeted in the raids had tried to attack the airport area after a wanted drug dealer had been killed when he fired on a rada patrol .
the area of ghrarat is now under the control of our forces and it s being treated as military zone so we can clear any resistance , bin salem said .
one member of rada had been killed and two wounded , and there were several casualties among their opponents , he said .
tripoli is split among various armed groups that have built local power bases since libya s 2011 revolution .
there have been fewer heavy confrontations in the capital since groups linked to a previous , self-declared government were pushed out of the city earlier this year , but armed skirmishes , kidnapping and other criminal activity are still common .
