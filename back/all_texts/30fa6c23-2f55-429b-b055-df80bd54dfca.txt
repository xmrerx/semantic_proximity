Bill Maher had every one of his panelists in stitches as he read these.During Real Time on Friday night, the HBO host noted that Us Weekly ran a list of 25 things we don t know about Hillary Clinton.
After lampooning some of them, Maher declared that the other candidates deserve equal time.So he and his staff put together 25 things we don t know about Ted Cruz and read some of them during the show, and guest panelist Van Jones couldn t help but laugh his ass off, which greatly amused Maher.
I spent my entire freshman year of high school stuffed in a locker, Maher began about Cruz.
As a child I used to imagine what it must be like to have an imaginary friend.
My nickname at Princeton was F*ckface Mirrors don t show my reflection.
I named the stick up my ass, Hank.
At that point, Jones was laughing so hard that Maher told him he should take some heart medication.
And then he continued.
My Cuban half once robbed my Canadian half at gunpoint.
My children love to play hide and seek, sometimes for weeks at a time.
Jesus once descended from heaven just to punch me in the face.

I smell with my tongue and 25 other things you didn t know about Ted Cruz, thanks to @BillMaher.
WATCH:https://t.co/pToAJBnMBC Real Time (@RealTimers) April 23, 2016This is without a doubt the most hilarious take-down of Ted Cruz to date.
And he totally deserves it.While Republican front-runner Donald Trump seems to be saying stuff just to make conservatives happy even if he may not necessarily truly believe what he is saying himself, Ted Cruz actually does believe the bullshit he says.
Ted Cruz is probably the most dangerous candidate in the GOP field, but the good news is that most Americans, including his own Republican colleagues, hate him.
And that makes him the perfect fodder for comedians like Bill Maher.Featured Image: Screenshot
