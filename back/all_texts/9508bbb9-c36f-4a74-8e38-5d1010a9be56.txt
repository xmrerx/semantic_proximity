Donald Trump is getting ripped to pieces on Twitter right now for already signaling that he might try to find a way to skip the scheduled presidential debates against Hillary Clinton.On Friday, the Republican nominee complained on Twitter that two of the debates are scheduled for Thursday nights on the same time as NFL games, which he called unacceptable.
As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games.
Same as last time w/ Bernie.
Unacceptable!

In recognition of Trump s cowardice, Twitter users helpfully came up with a multitude of hilarious #TrumpDebateExcuses of their own.
