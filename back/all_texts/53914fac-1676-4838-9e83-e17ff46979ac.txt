During a sit down with Trump voters, CNN got their take on the alleged president s first 100 days.
With polls showing Trump as the most unpopular president in history, some of the former reality show star s most ardent supporters have stood by him but others are fed up.
One Trump supporter has had it with Trump s broken promises, such as the vow to work on the opioid epidemic spreading across America.
Another Trump voter, Scott McCommons, said that he was disappointed with Trump s first 100 days, calling it was a disaster.
He s got enough time to get on Twitter, and rant and rave, and on top of that lie on Twitter, he said.
I voted for the man to make America great again, and I m willing to give him a chance, but he s not doing what I thought, that he made promises at rallies that I went to.
I expected him to work a little harder [on health care], he continued.
Be a little more reasonable instead of threatening people.
That s unpresidential.
I voted to send him to Washington strictly because I thought he would make change, nobody would push him around.
He s used his power against people, I think that s wrong.
gt s been a disaster, I think, in the first 100 days.
If I were to vote tomorrow, I would not vote for him, he added.Watch courtesy of CNN:As the CNN host pointed out, Trump campaigned as the ultimate deal maker.
One strong supporter of Trump s blamed House Speaker Paul Ryan for that.
McCommons said Trump isn t willing to sit down at the table and negotiate.
If only Trump supporters were warned that the alleged billionaire was a con man.
Oh wait, they were.
And now, here we are having to deal with a hot mess as Donald Trump once again targets millions of Americans health care while still insisting that Mexico will pay for his vanity-wall.Image via screen capture
