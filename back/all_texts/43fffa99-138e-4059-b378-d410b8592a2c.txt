After Beyonc came out with her new single Formation, which instantly became another hit for the artist, there was a lot of buzz surrounding the content of the lyrics.
The song speaks truth to power and depicts the ongoing conflict that far too many people of color face in regards to police brutality.
The song, however, doesn t have the usual music behind it that many of her past hits have had.
So, if people aren t being critical of the content of the song, they re being critical of the composition and beat.
Well, not all people, pretty much just white people.
White people who would prefer Beyonc stick to pure pop and dance.To top it off, after Beyonc stole the show at the Super Bowl halftime performance, even more people became critical of the legendary singer.
She was far too black for the folks over at Fox News, and seemingly many other places as well.
After all, how dare she speak the truth and hurt the feelings of those who are too afraid to hear it?Saturday Night Live, noticing the ridiculousness of everyone criticizing Beyonc for her new song, perfectly satirized the outrage and confusion coming from far too many white people.
In a sketch titled The Day Beyonc Turned Black, they show white people everywhere freaking the f*ck out and losing their damn minds after listening to her new song.
It s as though they just found out, that after all these years of Beyonc releasing hit after hit that white people adore, all of a sudden she releases a song that shows her as a powerful black woman speaking truth to power, and no one knows what to do with themselves.
Heaven forbid people of color have their own voice and not just be forced to cater to white people all the time, right?Anyway, this is absolutely brilliant.Featured image: Screencap
