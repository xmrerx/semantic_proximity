21st Century Wire says Despite the mass media distraction of the improbably Active Shooter attack at Fort Lauderdale Airport earlier this afternoon today was the big day, the dramatic release of the unclassified portion the US Intelligence report of the alleged Russian Hack of the 2016 US Election.
Meanwhile, at Trump Tower, President-Elect Donald Trump was given the full classified version of the report today, and was unimpressed, declaring that the alleged hacking of the Democrat National Committee (DNC) had absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.
Note that it is still an alleged hack because US intelligence agencies Have yet to produce any actual evidence that the Russian government were involved in either the DNC Leaks or the Podesta Email dump on Wikileaks.Instead, the report s main thrust is accusing the Russians of running all of the so-called fake news articles that flooded Facebook and social media during the 2016 election cycle claiming that it all traces back to St. Petersburg, Russia despite earlier investigative reports published by both The Guardian and Buzzfeed which placed the fake news empire in Macedonia, where teenagers netted small fortunes by pumping out imaginary stories on hundreds of cut-out websites during the 2016 election.
Putin Aspired to Help Trump CNN and other US media outlets were quick to down-shift their headlines away from saying that the Russian government Hacked the US Elections, now saying that Putin Aspired to Help Trump.
After a 90-minute briefing at Trump Tower with national intelligence chiefs, Donald Trump, under pressure from his party and the US media, issued a statement seeming to acknowledge some hacking of the cyber-infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, but was clear to ad the caveat that whatever happened had absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election.
While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber-infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines.
There were attempts to hack the Republican National Committee, but the R.N.C.
