Twitter has finally decided to take action against the white supremacists running rampant on the social media platform.
The same day the company vowed to take a stronger stance against hate speech, they suspended numerous alt-right accounts.Richard Spencer was one of those who was suspended.
He runs the National Policy Institute, an alt-right think tank, and has said he wants blacks, Asians, Hispanics and Jews removed from the U.S. On Tuesday, Twitter removed his personal verified account, the account for the National Policy Institute, and his online magazine.Naturally, Spencer is losing his shit.
USA Today reports: This is corporate Stalinism, Spencer told The Daily Caller News Foundation.
In a YouTube video, entitled Knight of the Long Knives, an apparent reference to the purge of Nazi leaders in 1934 to consolidate Adolf Hitler s power, Spencer said Twitter had engaged in a coordinated effort to wipe out alt-right Twitter.
I am alive physically but digitally speaking there has been execution squads across the alt right, he said.
There is a great purge going on and they are purging people based on their views.
Paul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers were also banished by the Twitter gods.Heidi Beirich, spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, said the organization had contacted the social media platform and asked that more than 100 white supremacists accounts be removed for their incessant hate speech, which clearly violates Twitter s terms of service.
They have done nothing, Beirich said on Monday.
It appears that on Tuesday, Twitter finally decided to do something.Beirich also pointed out that two of the alt-right accounts, including Spencer s, had been verified.
This means Twitter has decided it is an account of public interest.
Twitter has stood up against the vitriol of the alt-right before, but this is the first time they have purged so many accounts in one fell swoop.Featured image via CS Monitor
