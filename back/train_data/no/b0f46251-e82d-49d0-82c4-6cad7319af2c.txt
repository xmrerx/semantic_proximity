brussels ( reuters ) - european union leaders agreed on thursday to prolong for another six months the bloc s economic sanctions on russia , imposed over the annexation of ukraine s peninsula of crimea and moscow s support for rebels in east ukraine .
the sanctions , which target russia s energy , defense and financial sectors , would otherwise expire at the end of january 2018 .
donald tusk , the chairman of eu leaders meeting in brussels on thursday and friday , said the 28 were united on roll-over of economic sanctions on russia .
moscow says it will never return crimea , which it annexed in 2014 in a move that has not been recognized internationally .
the west says russia has also been providing a lifeline to separatists in eastern ukraine , where a conflict with kiev troops has killed more than 10,000 people since 2014 .
