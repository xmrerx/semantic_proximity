Another day, another Democrat who is backing the nominee for the Supreme Court seat that the Senate Republicans stole from President Obama.
We have previously reported on how traitorous Democrats like Joe Manchin (DINO-WV) and Heidi Heitcamp (DINO-ND) have turned tail and voted with Republicans on many issues most notably falling in line with Republicans in order to confirm right-wing potential Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch.
Now, we have a third to add to that list: Joe Donnelly of Indiana.
Donnelly said of his decision to be a traitor to his party on this issue: After meeting with Judge Gorsuch, conducting a thorough review of his record, and closely following his hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee, I believe that he is a qualified jurist who will base his decisions on his understanding of the law and is well-respected among his peers.
The only redeeming statement Donnelly has made is his expressing his opinion that the Senate should still have a 60-vote threshold when it comes to confirming Gorsuch or any other nominee for the Supreme Court.
That is paramount, because it means that there is a true bipartisan Senate consensus for the Court s nominations and confirmations, which is a rule set by the founders to make sure that one party and its views do not dominate the judiciary.Of course, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell cares not one whit about that; he and his fellow GOP cronies have insisted that Gorsuch will be on the Court one way or another.
This means he is willing to breach the 60-vote rule to make sure Gorsuch makes it to the Supreme Court.
What the Republicans did to President Obama s nominee Merrick Garland is a travesty and a disgrace, and the Democrats should do the same for Gorsuch.
For those who won t PRIMARY THEM.
We have no time for DINOS in these troubled times.
