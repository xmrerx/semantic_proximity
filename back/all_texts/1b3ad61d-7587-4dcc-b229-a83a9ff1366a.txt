MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish government will hold a special cabinet meeting at 6 p.m. local time (1600 GMT) to enforce direct rule over Catalonia, Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said on Friday, after the region declared independence from Spain.
Spain is a serious country and a great nation and we will not tolerate that a few people try liquidate our constitution, Rajoy told journalists after the upper house of parliament allowed him to take control of Catalonia.
