In case you haven t heard, a man was assaulted by uniformed airport cops then physically pulled down the aisle of the airplane to make way for employees who were trying to get to Louisville, KY.
The videos are below and are really upsetting.
United Airlines offered any passenger $800 if they would leave the flight.
After no one took the offer, the cops took the man off by force.DELTA AIR LINES DID THE OPPOSITE:Five days after the storms that wreaked havoc on Delta s operations, Channel 2 s Jim Strickland was back at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport to find out if recovery is complete.Strickland noticed Paris to Atlanta was one of them, a vast recovery from more than 3,000 flights canceled since Wednesday s storms.Strickland found Amanda Kowalesky in Midtown, Atlanta.
She s supposed to be in West Palm, but with day one of her three day weekend shot at the airport, she stayed home.She s now lugging fears about a dream trip this summer.
If there s a storm am I not going to get to Ireland in time?
Kowalesky said.
We re going to see U2 play in Dublin, that s a once in a lifetime thing.
Delta flew her bag to Florida at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport.
I found baggage left in the residue of the airline s spring break meltdown, Kowalesky said.They said the flight was canceled and pandemonium broke out.After a Sunday cancelation, Eyelyn Rubin flew in this morning from Newark.
Delta apparently didn t know her bag made it.
They told you it was going to Arkansas?
Strickland asked.
Yes, Rubin answered.Delta says it will hand deliver bags that don t catch up to their owners.Suzanna Wasserman is missing a bag after missing her weekend cruise out of Miami.
Delta going to do for you?
Strickland asked.
We don t know, we can t get anyone on the phone, Wasserman said.Delta says it s working on compensation.
Strickland Skyped with Yahoo travel editor Laura Begley Bloom, who gave up her family s seats on three consecutive days.
Delta paid a total of near $11,000.
I wanted to get to Florida to have my vacation, but the money kept getting better, Bloom said.
We walked away with a pretty hefty chunk of change from Delta Air Lines.
Via: wsbtvIN CASE YOU VE BEEN LIVING IN A CVE THE PAST 48 HOURS:If you ve flown much then you know that airlines overbook flights.
When that happens, they usually offer free tickets to anyone willing to give up their seat.In this case, EVERYONE wanted to stay on the plane including one man who eventually had to be physically tossed off by uniformed men He claimed to be a doctor and needed to get home to see patients in the morning.
We re sure you ll hear more about this man but we can t verify that he s a doctor.
We just find it odd that he would endure this treatment by the security at the airport.
It was a disturbing situation for sure!<strong>In the fine print when you buy your ticket, the airline reserves the right to toss you if they re over booked This isn t the way to do it!
</strong>Does anyone else out there REALLY miss the good old days of flying?
I do!Flying these days can be a nightmare check this one out:A United passenger was forcibly removed from a flight from Chicago to Louisville after he refused to voluntarily give up his seat.Fellow passengers on the flight posted jarring videos late Sunday night of uniformed men dragging the man off of the flight after what United called an overbook situation.
Flight 3411 from Chicago to Louisville was overbooked, a United spokesperson told Yahoo News when asked about the incident.
After our team looked for volunteers, one customer refused to leave the aircraft voluntarily and law enforcement was asked to come to the gate.

Passengers were allowed to board and United offered $800 to anyone who gave up their seat, but when there were no volunteers, United said a computer would randomly select four passengers.
The man in the video claimed to be a doctor who had patients to see in the morning and refused to leave, at which point airport security dragged him off the plane.The United Contract of Carriage lays out specific policies for passengers who are not allowed to board overbooked flights but doesn t cite policy for removing passengers who are already seated on such flights.Via: <a href= https://www.yahoo.com/news/video-shows-guards-dragging-passenger-off-united-flight-132930349.html >Yahoo</a>
