brasilia ( reuters ) - the brazilian government s plan to overhaul the costly pension system will be in trouble if it does not clear the lower house of congress this year , and it still lacks the votes needed for approval , the speaker rodrigo maia said on friday .
maia told reuters that cabinet changes by president michel temer benefiting coalition allies should make it clear by next week whether the government can muster the two-thirds super majority of votes needed to pass pension reform in the house .
they don t have the votes yet ... if the bill is left for next year it will be hard to pass , he said in an interview .
