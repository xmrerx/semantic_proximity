Donald Trump is starting another week in the White House with yet another attack on the media and the reporters that dare to cover his minions accurately.On Monday morning, Trump took to Twitter to warn the media to be nice to him and his dishonest team.
Likely inspired by a set of recent interviews in which his senior adviser, Kellyanne Conway, was blasted and taken to task for her ridiculous defense of Trump s wiretapping claims, Trump tweeted this little gem: It is amazing how rude much of the media is to my very hard working representatives.
Be nice, you will do much better!
Perhaps Trump and his team might do better if they followed his advice, too considering they ve made more enemies in the last few weeks than any administration in modern American history.And this wasn t Trump s only attack on the media, either.
After watching Morning Joe hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski criticize his presidency for the last several weeks, Trump finally made the decision to unfollow them on Twitter.
Seriously, it s almost as if we have a teenager living in the White House.If Trump wants the media to cover him more favorably, then perhaps he might try actually doing his job well for once or just doing his job, period.
Trump is the laziest, most incompetent POTUS America has ever had and his team is just as much as a failure.If the coverage has been negative, it s because Trump and his people actually suck, plain and simple.
But instead of trying to improve and fix what is being criticized, Trump would rather just go on Twitter, bully the media, and cry about it.Featured image is a screenshot
