( reuters ) - magellan midstream partners lp said on tuesday it was investigating the cause of a nearly 11,000-barrel gasoline spill from two above-ground fuel storage tanks at its houston-area terminal in texas during hurricane harvey .
the leak at the galena park terminal is the biggest spill reported so far relating to the storm , which unleashed record flooding in the state in late august , destroying homes and killing scores of people .
the environmental protection agency has said federal and state authorities responded to spills linked to harvey at about a dozen industrial facilities .
the exact cause of the tank failures is now under investigation , magellan spokesman bruce heine said .
he said the company believed it was related to the flooding .
magellan has cleaned up much of the spill , and recovered an undisclosed amount that escaped off the terminal s property into a nearby ditch and the houston ship channel , heine said .
clean-up activities at the facility are continuing and we are currently removing and replacing affected soil , he said .
the spill occurred on aug. 31 , heine said .
magellan had initially reported a smaller volume of gasoline spilled to state authorities , but adjusted its estimate upward after it was able to make a full assessment , he said .
it s magellan s long-term practice to conservatively report a product release to appropriate agencies and local authorities as soon as we become aware of a potential incident , he said , explaining the smaller initial estimate .
in other words , we do not wait until absolute confirmation , as we want to give the earliest possible notice .
magellan has said that much of the rest of its infrastructure has returned to normal after the storm .
