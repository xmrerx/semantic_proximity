MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin is not in touch with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s team, Russian news agencies cited Vladimir Putin’s spokesman Dmitry Peskov as saying on Monday.
A senior Russian diplomat said last month the Russian government had been in touch with members of Trump’s political team during the U.S. election campaign.
