dr. scott was interviewed after the meeting between black pastors and donald trump .
he said that over 100 people were in the meeting and that those who hadn t endorsed trump were going to pray on it .
what really stuck with me is that one of the pastors said other pastors support trump but are afraid to openly support him for fear of losing parishioners .
pretty sad , huh ?
( daily caller ) dr. darrell scott , pastor of new spirit revival center in cleveland heights , ohio , said the monday meeting between black pastors and donald trump was a meaningful dialogue and we voiced concerns that were sensitive to the african-american community .
scott , speaking at trump tower in new york city said , i didn t have concerns [ with trump ] because i was already convinced , but there were concerns that the liberal media has put out portraying mr. trump in a light that i know he s not the type of person he was depicted to be .
so what we were able to do today was allow to see his heart for themselves and to make up their own minds about him .
and they find out that he s not the person that the media has depicted him to be .
