najaf , iraq ( reuters ) - for more than 1,000 years , the al-hawza al-ilmiyya south of baghdad has been one of the hearts of shi ite islamic scholarship , training the clerics who lead shi ite communities across the muslim world .
thousands of students , from teenage boys to university graduates , study islam at its schools in the holy cities of najaf and kerbala .
shi ites , who are the majority in iraq , were repressed under dictator saddam hussein , a sunni muslim , but now lead the iraqi government since saddam was overthrown in 2003 .
clerics trained at the hawza have wide social and political influence , both inside iraq and abroad .
this year , around 200 fully fledged clerics will graduate , completing a process that requires at least ten years of study .
in the najaf school , a typical day will see clerics in flowing black robes and white turbans giving lectures to groups of students sitting on the floor of a great hall , lined with pointed arches and elaborate mosaics .
