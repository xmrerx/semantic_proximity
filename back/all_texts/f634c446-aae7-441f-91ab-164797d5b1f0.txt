Just one day before California and New Jersey have their primaries, the Associated Press reports that Hillary Clinton has reached the threshold of delegates (including pledged and non-committed) to win the Democratic Primary.The AP reports that Clinton clinched the nomination just after 8 p.m. Eastern Time when about 25 superdelegates came out and backed Clinton.This is an historic moment, as the Democratic Party has made the move to make Clinton the first woman nominated to a major political party for President of the United States.Democrats were also the first major party to nominate a woman for the Vice Presidential position in 1984, with Geraldine Ferraro.Before the hour s big superdelegate shift, Clinton was 24 delegates away from clinching the nomination, and was expected to make up the difference when the polls closed in California and New Jersey, which would have sent her way over the top.Should Clinton clinch the amount of pledged delegates needed for a majority, which estimates put at 2,206, there would be no chance of a contested convention in Philadelphia this July.Talking to reporters on Monday, Clinton said: I certainly am going to be reaching out to Sen. Sanders and hope he will join me in that, because we ve got to be unified going into the convention and coming out of the convention to take on Donald Trump and to repudiate the kind of campaign he is running and make it very clear that s not the kind of president or commander-in-chief we want.
Tonight, Democrats prove once again to be the progressive party.
While the GOP nominates a sexist demagogue, the Democrats have chosen the first woman ever for president.
Truly a day to remember.While Sarah Palin spirals into the abyss of being forgotten (along with other Republicans associated with Donald Trump), Clinton is just getting started.Featured image via David McNew/Getty Images
