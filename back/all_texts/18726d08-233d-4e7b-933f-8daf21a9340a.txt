As you probably know by now, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz reached deep into his bag of desperation when he decided to prematurely name Carly Fiorina as his potential vice presidential running mate.
Keep in mind, it is pretty much mathematically impossible for Cruz to get the nomination through elected delegates, so his only hope is in Donald Trump not getting to the much desired 1,237 delegates needed to secure the Republican nomination.
Then, Cruz can go to the convention and try his best to figure out a way to get things to go in his favor.
The thing is, Trump still has the popular vote by a large margin, so the will of the people is clearly not with Cruz.Anyway, back to Fiorina.As if Ted Cruz wasn t already horrible enough on his own, he decided to double-down on people not liking him by adding a woman who is against a woman s right to choose.
Not only that, she lied about Planned Parenthood, was the CEO to a company that she promptly flushed down the toilet, including outsourcing jobs, and has absolutely no public policy experience whatsoever.Speaking of Planned Parenthood, some clever person just took the website CarlyFiorinaForVicePresident.com and pushed it to go directly to the Planned Parenthood Action Fund donation page.carlyfiorinaforvicepresident.comNot only quick thinking on the part of whoever put this together, but absolutely, breathtakingly brilliant.Just to remind you, Carly Fiorina loved to lie time after time about Planned Parenthood, and fed directly into the baby body parts myth that circulated unsubstantiated for several months.The fact that now her new mythical potential to be vice president now leads people directly to donating for Planned Parenthood isn t only amazing retribution, but pure magic.Well done, internet.
Well done indeed.
