donald trump repeatedly attacked former president barack obama each time he went golfing but the alleged billionaire has just taken his 13th golfing trip in the two months he s been on the job .
each one of trump s defenders seems to have an old tweet blasting obama for his golf trips , which pale in comparison to trump s lavish vacations .
last week , white house press secretary sean spicer tried to explain why golfing trips are ok for trump but were not ok for obama .
and now we have newt gingrich s old tweet coming back to haunt him.the disgraced former house speaker tweeted in 2013 , trump and president obsma both golf but trump doesn t charge the taxpayers $ 920,000 for a golf weekend in florida .
trump and president obsma both golf but trump does n't charge the taxpayers $ 920,000 for a golf weekend in florida .
newt gingrich ( @ newtgingrich ) march 8 , 2013we can only assume gingrich meant obama , not obsma .
well , he did inadvertently get that right .
each time trump goes to his mar-a-lago resort , it costs taxpayers $ 3 million , not $ 920,000 .
the alleged president is on track to spend $ 1 billion in 4 years to house his wife in new york city and vacationing in mar-a-lago virtually every week.the internet pounced on gingrich s hypocritical tweet .
@ newtgingrich hey newt , it 's so cool how you 're not even embarrassed to shart in public .

the former house speaker has been strangely quiet over donald trump s repeated trips to the golf course , and what s really disturbing is that he regularly goes golfing at trump-owned golf clubs , meaning that there is another conflict of interest for us to deal with .
trump is literally profiting from his presidency .
in 2011 , the former reality show star tweeted , i play golf to relax .
my company is in great shape .
@ barackobama plays golf to escape work while america goes down the drain .
meanwhile , trump broke another campaign promise , this one to repeal and replace obamacare .
instead , he offered tax breaks for the wealthy while throwing the elderly , veterans and lower-income americans under the bus .
then he went golfing after his plan failed miserably.photo by win mcnamee/getty images with added tweet .
