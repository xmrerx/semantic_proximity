last week , donald trump junior became a new focus for senate investigators in the case against russia regarding the 2016 election .
the new york times did a piece on wednesday detailing the fact that junior was scheduled to meet with them ( behind closed doors , of course ) the following day and , well , you know the rest.it wasn t the article , explosive though it was , that captured the internet s attention , though .
it was the hilariously badly-staged photo that don jr. apparently staged for todd heisler , a photographer on the times staff , and the image it was clearly trying and failing miserably to portray : i , too , casually arrange photographs of my 100 children to face outwards so i can only see the backs of frames pic.twitter.com/pa0chp5ayj ashley feinberg ( @ ashleyfeinberg ) september 8 , 2017see the problem ?
obviously when they were setting up the shoot , son of the deal decided he needed the world to know how much he loves his five kids .
so he took essentially every picture ever taken of them , put them in shiny frames , and arranged them to best be captured by the camera , dad s studious face aglow with the glare of hard work emanating from his computer monitor stern in the background.facing away from him.it was just too good to pass up , and so twitter did not : the photos must earn the right to face father the september son ( @ bagofbadgers ) september 8 , 2017i do n't want to know what he uses those giant scissors for sam lloyd ( @ lloydwithtwols ) september 8 , 2017his photos shoots are all awkward af pic.twitter.com/lovhqrvpyr pauisanoun ( @ pauisanoun ) september 8 , 2017welp , he 's always seemed to be somewhat genetically inferior .

? thekierhawk ( @ kieranstrange ) september 9 , 2017a quick google search says that todd heisler of the new york times is a professional photographer with thousands of shoots under his belt , a pulitzer prize , and an emmy .
