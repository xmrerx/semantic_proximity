House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) implied during a Wednesday press conference that President Donald Trump s daughter, Ivanka Trump, has been complicit in her father s actions, which the lawmaker described as not acting in the interest of the American people.
Pelosi s remarks came after she was asked about comments Ivanka Trump made during an interview on CBS This Morning.
CBS host Gayle King had asked Trump to address those who say she is complicit in her father s White House.
In an interview today, Ivanka Trump said, I don t know what it means to be complicit and that not to conflate lack of public denouncement with silence when it comes to issues like Planned Parenthood.
What do you make of these comments?
an-off camera reporter asked Pelosi.
We re not here to talk about the president s family, but the fact is, I think everybody knows what the word complicit is, and what it means is you re not acting in the interest of the American people, Pelosi responded.
Without going into what lack of impact family members who profess to believe in climate crisis or women s right to choose or any of the other things, but have no impact on the policy of the president of the United States, that s for the public to make a judgement, the minority leader continued.PELOSI S RANT: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GUL3-iB5_pMVia: WFB
