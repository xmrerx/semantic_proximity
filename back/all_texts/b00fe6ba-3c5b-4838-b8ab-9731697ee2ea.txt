Wow!
Bernie and Hillary have been making hay over the Flint water crisis for months now, using the crisis to secure votes from the black community.
Leftists have been converging on the city like rats in search of the last peice of cheese on earth and now we have proof that Obama s EPA knew about the crisis, but didn t think the people of Flint were worthy of protecting.An internal Environmental Protection Agency memo showed officials didn t think Flint is the community we want to go out on a limb for while residents of the Michigan town drank lead-contaminated water.House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform Chairman Jason Chaffetz presented an internal memo between the EPA official who oversees Michigan, a branch manager in the EPA s Region 5, the associate director of the water division for Region 5 and an EPA environmental engineer about the water crisis in Flint.In the memo, one of the officials it wasn t clear who based on the screen shown by Chaffetz said Flint wasn t worth helping.
Perhaps she already knows all this, but I m not so sure Flint is the community we want to go out on a limb for, the memo stated.Chaffetz was incredulous at the memo.
Are you kidding me?
he said, looking at Susan Hedman, the former director of EPA s Region 5, which oversees much of the Midwest including Michigan.
Why isn t Flint the community they go to?
Of all the communities, the community having trouble is the one you go all out for, Chaffetz said.
