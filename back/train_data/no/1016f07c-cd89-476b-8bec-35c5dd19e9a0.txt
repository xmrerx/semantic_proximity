london ( reuters ) - saudi arabia said on tuesday that iran s talk of a possible rapprochement with the kingdom was laughable .
saudi foreign minister adel al-jubeir told reporters in london that iran would have to change its policies for any rapprochement .
iran s foreign minister , mohammad javad zarif , last month said the islamic republic would soon exchange diplomatic visits after the regional rivals severed diplomatic ties last year .
the comments of the foreign minister are laughable , al-jubeir said .
if iran wants to have good relations with saudi arabia , it has to change its policies .
it has to respect international law .
at this time , we do not see ... that they re serious about wanting to be a good neighbor , al-jubeir said iran s zarif was quoted by the iranian students news agency ( isna ) that diplomatic visits could take place after the haj pilgrimage ends in the first week of september .
but al-jubeir said that diplomatic exchanges with iran over arrangements for the haj did not represent a normalization of relations and that such contacts had nothing to do with politics .
we had the haj season , and when we have the haj , we try not to politicize it ...
but this is not normalization , he said .
the meetings around the haj , have nothing to do with the politics .
it s a religious issue .
relations between iran and saudi arabia are at their worst in years , with each accusing the other of subverting regional security and supporting opposite sides in conflicts in syria , iraq and yemen .
al-jubeir also said that if the rift with qatar continued for two years then so be it .
saudi arabia , egypt , bahrain and the united arab emirates ( uae ) severed ties with qatar in june over doha s alleged support for militants .
