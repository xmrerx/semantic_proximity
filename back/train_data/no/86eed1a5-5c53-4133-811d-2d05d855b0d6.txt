paris ( reuters ) - the french military has targeted islamist militants in northern mali near the border with algeria and took 15 militants out of action , an armed forces spokesman said on thursday .
it was not immediately clear if the operation had any connection to the pursuit of assailants who killed four u.s. soldiers in an ambush on oct. 4 in western niger , about 400 kilometres to the south .
the french operation in the region of abeibara took place overnight on monday and targeted members of islamist militant group ansar dine , the spokesman said .
it involved french mirage jets , attack helicopters and forces on the ground , he added without providing details on how many of the 15 militants targeted had been killed or wounded .
france intervened in mali to ward off an offensive by islamist militants that began in 2012 .
around 4,000 of its troops remain in the region as part of operation barkhane , where they work alongside around 10,000 u.n. peacekeepers in mali .
the u.s. deaths have drawn attention to counter-terror efforts in the arid sahel region where an islamist insurgency involving countless armed groups has been intensifying for years , regularly killing local soldiers .
