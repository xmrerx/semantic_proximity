berlin ( reuters ) - germany will spend an initial 10 million euros to help remove mines from the northern syrian city of raqqa , the handelsblatt newspaper said in friday editions .
the foreign ministry is set to announce the increased funding as part of a pact with the united states on friday , the paper added .
the agreement calls for germany to help fund tetra tech , a u.s. government contractor working to clear mines from raqqa , where u.s.-backed militias last month declared victory over the islamic state extremist group .
the u.s. military continues to press germany for additional aid in syria , but germany is waiting for measures on how to stabilize syria , the newspaper said .
norbert roettgen , a member of chancellor angela merkel s conservatives , told the paper that financial aid for rebuilding must be combined with a reliable solution and political stability for syria .
the paper said the german contribution to the effort to de-mine raqqa could be stepped up if the situation stabilized .
