legendary newsman dan rather think trumpcare epic asskickingon monday house republicans officially pass bill dubiously refer american healthcare act except neither american healthcareinstead bill repeal affordable care act strip ten million american health insurance coverage raise cost care significantly
bill nothing cover people improve healthcare one iota
yet trump praise piece shit bill wonderful
dan rather disagrees write scathing post facebook call republican trump screw american people
seven year hear republican horrible obamacare best could come
rather write
rush job seem new idea fix core problem
seem prove point always rhetoric actually try make health insurance either cover people lower cost
indeed always tear legacy america first black president
affordable care act perfect slow rise cost healthcare make uninsured rate drop alltime lowsrather slam donald trump break every promise make campaign trailthe ball firmly court gop
control government president trump make promise campaign trail lower premium keep doctor everyone stay insured etc
basically version healthcare would better tell han christian andersen fairy tale
everyone sense issue know itlegislation campaign speech

word actually tell something win lose
cover much might cost
gop plan get pick apart politician interest group side
start look popular ant picnicin conclusion rather sham paul ryan republican put hatred racism rabid base health life million people rely affordable care actso stand
president trump swing full weight administration behind ryan plan
maybe enough arm twist skeptical republican
maybe effort fall apart spectacular failure
mr trump promise replace repeal obamacare day one
affordable care act yes obamacare still law land
