baghdad ( reuters ) - iraq s kurdish leadership rejected on sunday a demand by the iraqi government that it cancels the outcome of an independence referendum as a precondition for talks to resolve the dispute .
kurdish leaders who met to discuss the crisis in the town of dokan renewed their offer to resolve peacefully the crisis with baghdad .
the kurdish parties are ready for talks between erbil and baghdad , they said in a statement , referring respectively to the seat of the semi-autonomous kurdistan regional government ( krg ) in northern iraq and the federal capital of iraq .
the talks between erbil and baghdad should be under the supervision of international parties , the statement added .
among those at the meeting were krg president masoud barzani , iraqi president fuad masum a kurd who holds a largely ceremonial position in the federal state and hero talabani , widow of jalal talabani , a kurdish leader who died earlier this month .
they rejected what they described as military threats from iraqi forces against kurdish peshmerga fighters , and pledged to defend kurdish-held territory in case of an attack .
the krg and the shi ite-led central government in baghdad have been at loggerheads since the sept. 25 vote and its loud call for kurdish independence .
tension between two parties has flared around the multi-ethnic oil city of kirkuk , which peshmerga forces took in 2014 when iraqi security forces collapsed in the face of an islamic state onslaught .
the peshmerga deployment prevented kirkuk s oilfields from falling into jihadist hands .
