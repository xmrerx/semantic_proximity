Filmmaker and activist Michael Moore said there is no doubt in his mind that Donald Trump will go through with banning Muslims from the United States, just like he said he would.Speaking to Variety, Moore said that he has already done his grieving over Trump s win, which he saw coming long before it became a reality.
I went through my five stages of grief months and months ago when I realized he was going to win, he said.Moore said that he has taken him literally and seriously since day one, which is why he fully expects Trump to do all the horrible things he said he would on the campaign trail, like building a wall along our southern border to keep out all the rapey Mexicans.
You do have to take Trump at his word, Moore said.
I still hear people say, Oh, he s not really going to build the wall.
Oh, he is going to build it.
He knows that he s got to deliver at least a version of the wall.
This, Moore explained, is why he absolutely believes Trump will go through with enacting his Muslim ban.
He s shown how he s going to do it, Moore said.
He s going to get away with it by making it a ban on Muslims who come from the following countries.
He needs just enough cover for his crowd to say, Oh, he s being reasonable there.
He s not banning all Muslims.
Moore also said that he was profoundly affected by Meryl Streep s powerful speech denouncing Trump at the Golden Globes.
I had tears in my eyes, Moore said.
It was so powerfully delivered by the perfect person.
She was talking about human empathy.
It was not about being a Republican or a Democrat.
It was about: Have you no decency, sir?
Trump s supporters like to say that they don t take what he says literally.
But that is a mistake.
As Maya Angelou said, When someone shows you who they are, believe them the first time.
We know who Trump is.
And we also know it s going to be a long four years.Featured image via Kevin Winter/Getty Images For AFI
