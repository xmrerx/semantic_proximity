can we just stop allowing muslim refugees and visitors into u.s. from countries who hate us already ?
how about we focus on the 1 % of pakistani s who are christian that face daily persecution at the hands of muslims ? update : tashfeen malik posted a pledge of allegiance to isis before her deadly attack .
she used a fake address on her passport.via abc : for the visa application , the address she listed in her pakistani hometown , abc news discovered today , does not exist .
malik received a her green card this summer , u.s. officials said.tashfeen malik , the female terrorist involved in the san bernardino attack should have never been granted an american visa if the immigration and nationality act holds any weight.malik , who was found to have a pakistani passport , obtained the k-1 visa in islamabad , pakistan .
however , american visa laws that are meant to detect potential terror threats trying to infiltrate the country should have blocked the female jihadist from obtaining that visa.as the center for immigration services notes , section 214 ( b ) of the immigration and nationality act states that individuals who appear likely to overstay their temporary visas and try to settle permanently in the united states are not to be issued one .
the regulation is meant to detect individuals seeking a visa who do not have permanent families in their home country and whether or not they have enough money to travel back to their home country once their visa is expired.this screening process is meant to expose individuals trying to to get into the country for the purpose of resettling permanently and overstaying their visa , as so many do.nonetheless , malik was able to obtain a visa in islamabad despite the screening process which should have detected the fact that she was a young woman resettling in the us to potentially raise a family with her radical jihadist husband syed farook.malik passed her dhs screening : under section 214 ( b ) , malik should have been denied a visa , as there was ample evidence that she would overstay her visa.but , malik could have obtained her visa the same way the 9/11 hijackers obtained theirs : through the visa express program.as reported by the hayride , the visa express program allowed 9/11 hijackers abdulaziz alomari , salem al hamzi , and khalid al midhar to obtain their visas in saudi arabia without even being interviewed by consular officials at the american consulate.the terrorists simply obtained their visas by sending officials their applications and supporting documents through a designated travel agency.this allowed the three terrorists to go undetected despite red-flags that they were single , young men with not enough funds to return back to their home countries once their visas expired.likewise , if malik gained her visa through the visa express program at the american consulate in islamabad , it would explain how she was allowed to enter the country despite overwhelming suspicions that she would overstay her visa.the immigration and naturalization service ( ins ) admits that there are so many visas given out each year around the world that it is impossible to conduct background checks on every single person.and , we all saw what happened yesterday in san bernardino.via : gateway pundit
