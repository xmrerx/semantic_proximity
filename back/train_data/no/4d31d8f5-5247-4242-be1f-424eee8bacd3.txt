istanbul ( reuters ) - an istanbul prosecutor has issued arrest warrants for the parents of a former police investigator who gave evidence at the trial of a turkish banker in the united states last week , the hurriyet newspaper reported on wednesday .
turkey has called for the arrest of huseyin korkmaz after he testified at the trial of mehmet hakan atilla , a former executive of state-lender halkbank who is accused of helping iran evade u.s. sanctions .
the istanbul prosecutor s office was not immediately available for comment .
u.s. prosecutors have accused atilla of working with turkish-iranian gold trader reza zarrab and others to help iran evade u.s. sanctions through fraudulent gold and food transactions .
the case has strained relations between turkey and the united states , which are nato allies .
atilla has pleaded not guilty and halkbank has denied involvement with any illegal transactions .
but zarrab has pleaded guilty and testified for u.s. prosecutors .
korkmaz said he fled turkey in 2016 fearing retaliation from the government after leading an investigation in 2013 into zarrab which implicated high-ranking officials .
hurriyet said the istanbul prosecutor s order to arrest korkmaz s parents came after his testimony in the u.s. case in which he said he gave documents related to the 2013 investigation to his mother to keep .
last week , turkish police summoned a federal bureau of investigation ( fbi ) official over statements made by korkmaz in the u.s. court , the state-run anadolu agency reported .
