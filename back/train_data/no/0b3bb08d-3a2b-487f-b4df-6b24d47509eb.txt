istanbul ( reuters ) - turkey s parliament has approved the government s 2018 budget , which includes increased spending on defense and projects a rise in the fiscal deficit to 65.9 billion lira ( $ 17.28 billion ) .
the 2018 budget , approved by parliament late on friday , introduces changes in tax regulations , such as tax increases for companies and motor vehicles , to help pay for increased security .
in 2017 , turkey s budget is expected to show a deficit of 61.7 billion lira , more than twice the 2016 budget deficit of around 30 billion lira .
turkey s 2018 budget also projects tax income of 599.4 billion lira , up some 15 percent from estimates for 2017 , and a 5.8 billion lira primary surplus .
over the past two years , turkey s current account deficit has widened due to increasing government incentives to boost the economy and defense spending .
next year s budget deficit to gross domestic product ratio is expected to be 1.9 percent .
the government says the additional defense spending is urgently needed to modernize the military , the second-largest in the nato alliance , and meet the costs of domestic and foreign security operations .
turkey s economy has rebounded from a downturn that followed an attempted coup last year , helped by a series of government stimulus measures .
gdp grew 11.1 percent year-on-year in the third quarter , its fastest expansion in six years , according to official data .
