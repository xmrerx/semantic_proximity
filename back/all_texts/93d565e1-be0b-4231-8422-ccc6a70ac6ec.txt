One has to wonder why in the world people would support Ted Cruz.
His policies are the essence of Republican backwardness and even members of his own party don t like him.
In addition, he s lied throughout his campaign for the Republican nomination.
Yet, Cruz is still hanging in there for the nomination.
In fact, he s actually enjoying a surge as of late as Republican voters try to figure out who is less worse, Donald Trump, or creepy Ted Cruz.
Cruz appears to have found a niche as Republicans have to vote for Cruz as the alternative to Trump.Yet, who are these voters that are now siding with Cruz as he surges in the polls?
Samantha Bee sums it all up when she took down Ted Cruz s appalling group of supporters on her show Full Frontal.
First, there s Colorado pastor Kevin Swanson, who appears in a video clip (see below) saying, Homosexuals are worthy of death to which Bee commented, Wow, For a guy who hates gay people, Swanson s got some fabulous dance moves.
Then there s the reverend Flip Benham, who was convicted of stalking an abortion doctor and was part of a protest where people chanted, Jesus hates Muslims.
Bee declared, In your face Donald Trump, Cruz supporters hated Muslims before it was cool.
Not to be outdone, there s pastor Mike Bickle, who is the poster child for anti-Semitism.
Bickle declared: The lord said I m going to give all 20 million of them the chance to respond to the fisherman and if they don t respond to grace, I m going to raise up the hunters and the most famous hunter in recent history is a man named Adolph Hitler.
Bee s segment was funny but she sends an important message: Ted Cruz and his supporters are dangerous.Watch video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXkEeTfdQeA] Featured image via video screenshot.
