MOSCOW (Reuters) - A Kremlin aide said on Wednesday it was entirely logical that Russian President Vladimir Putin would speak with U.S. counterpart Donald Trump during multi-lateral events taking place at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) summit in Vietnam this week.
It s entirely logical that they will shake hands, that they will discuss certain issues, Kremlin aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters.
We are also ready to hold a separate, exhaustive bilateral meeting.
The time frame for such a separate meeting has not been agreed upon, but the possibility is being assessed.
