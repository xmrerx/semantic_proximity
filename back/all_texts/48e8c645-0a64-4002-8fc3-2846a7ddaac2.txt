On Sunday s broadcast of CNN s Reliable Sources, a panel discussed the role Roger Ailes legacy.
The Fox News founder is retiring from his position as the network s CEO due to a massive wave of allegations from female employees of sexual harassment.The episode began with the show s host, Brian Stelter posing the question, When you take stock of Roger Ailes legacy, his impact on media, do you think we would have Donald Trump as the GOP nominee without Roger Ailes?
Political analyst Jeff Greenfield wasn t ready to say that Trump would not be a political success if it were not Ailes.
Roger Ailes did to the media what Donald Trump did to the political process.
What Greenfield is saying is that both Ailes and Trump are spectacular at rallying hardcore right-wing conservatives to support whatever narrative they choose to promote.While Greenfield isn t ready to put the burden of Trump on Ailes shoulders, Jane Hall, a former regular guest on Fox News said that you would not have Donald Trump without Roger Ailes.
It has been rumored that Ailes next major project besides the autobiography he is going to write would be to work on Trump s presidential campaign.
Panelist and Trump supporter, Jeff Lord, didn t provide any more credibility to those rumors.
That being said, he did mention that Ailes would be very useful on the Trump campaign trail.Fox News, right-wing extremism, and now Trump exist in a reinforcing feedback loop that has caused so much harm to the United States and the world.
They have given megaphones to the biggest loons out there in the United States.You can watch the panel discussion below.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qn3AgNq2QikFeatured image from video screenshot
