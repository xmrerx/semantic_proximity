For the entirety of the last week, there has been an endless string of politicians and pundits filling the internet and airwaves with accusations that the Black Lives Matter movement has created a negative view of police officers across the United States.
Even President Obama scolded social media commentators, asking those that communicate there to not give into over generalizations about the police.Oddly enough, those same people have been very quiet about the extremely racist rhetoric coming from both police officers and their supporters (whatever that means).Take for example this extremely racist and inappropriate post that the Texas Sheriff s Deputies Facebook page shared just after the shooting in Dallas, Texas that resulted in the deaths of five police officers:This isn t an over generalization.
It isn t just a funny post that was posted by those trying to find humor to cope with stress, hurt, and anger as one of the admins claims.
It is an incredibly racist, inappropriate, and misinformed image macro.
During a time when racial tensions in the United States are at a boiling point, when people are seriously concerned there is going to be a full-blown race war, a pro-cop page shares something like this.
There are a plethora of examples of police officers, saying, writing, and sharing racist things on the internet or elsewhere.Police officers and their supporters need to think twice about what they post online.
There is no justification for this type of humor ever but especially right now in this precarious time.
One cannot support or be a good cop and support inflammatory racist messaging like this.
Right now, more than ever, police officers need to take a cue from homeland security if you see something, say something.Featured image from screenshots
