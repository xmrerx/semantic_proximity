the clintons are afraid of the truth so be it !
if a special prosecutor is brought in to investigate them then that would be fine , right ?
they have nothing to hide , right ?
just like bill had nothing to hide with the paula jones case let s face it , faulty testimony is their mojo .
they can t tell the truth because so much of their political career has been a lie !
