ankara ( reuters ) - qatar s emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani will hold talks in ankara on thursday with turkish president tayyip erdogan , an ally of doha in its dispute with gulf arab neighbors .
saudi arabia , the uae , egypt and bahrain cut diplomatic and trade links with qatar three months ago , suspending air and shipping routes with the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas .
they say qatar supports regional foe iran and islamists .
qatar denies the charges and says the economic boycott aims at neutering an independent foreign policy it says promotes peaceful regional reform and fighting terrorism .
last month turkey held joint military exercises with qatari forces in the gulf state .
it has said it will deploy 3,000 troops at a military base there and has increased trade with qatar since the start of the embargo .
turkey s presidency announced sheikh tamim s trip in a statement on wednesday but gave no details of the talks , which will coincide with a visit to ankara by the prime minister of kuwait , which has sought to mediate in the gulf arab dispute .
