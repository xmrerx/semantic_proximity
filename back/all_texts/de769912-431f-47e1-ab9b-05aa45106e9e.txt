According to Donald Trump, Joe The Plumber was right when he said the only American thing we can do is elect a white Republican President, emphasis on white.
On Thursday, the Trump campaign somehow managed to lower the bar of decency even more than they already have.
Speaking on The Donald s behalf, his campaign chair made a promise that will make Trump s poorly educated white supremacist supporters happy Trump will only pick a white man for Vice President, regardless of qualifications or other factors, because minorities are apparently incapable of being good at the job.
He needs an experienced person to do the part of the job he doesn t want to do, Paul Manafort told the Huffington Post.
He seems himself more as the chairman of the board, than even the CEO, let alone the COO.
There is a long list of who that person could be, the campaign chair continued, and every one of them has major problems.
But no matter what their problems, every single one of them is better than those blacks and Mexicans, according to Manafort.
He says that the campaign likely won t choose a woman or a member of any minority group:Only Trump s idiot supporters would view choosing a running-mate based on their qualifications for the job rather than sex and skin color pandering.
Is this really who Republicans want to lead the nation someone who wants to literally build a wall to keep brown people out of the country, someone who thinks simply being from Mexico makes one a drug dealer, someone who tweets out white supremacist propaganda and encourages his supporters to beat up black people at his rallies (even offering to pay their legal fees)?featured image via Getty Images/Spencer Platt
