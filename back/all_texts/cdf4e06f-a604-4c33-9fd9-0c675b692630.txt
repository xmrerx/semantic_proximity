Tom Perez must not have taken the class about winning friends and influencing people.
How can you win over voters with such bitterness and anger?
The Democrat Party has sunk to a new low with this classless thug.
Who goes out there and speaks like this?
We reported (see below) on the last speech Perez gave and he said the same nasty things.
What gives?
Are the deems so desperate that they re now resorting to profanity-filled speeches that make false claims about Republicans and President Trump?
We think it s a losing strategy!Perez has a long radical history connected to La Raza and other open borders organizations.
His track record is full on radical.
e s in cahoots with Obama to continue the fundamental transformation of America.
Anyone who s a Democrat should be shocked that he s taking the party in such a far left direction.
Do your research and you ll know why he was the choice for Dem Chair.He just fired all Democrat Party staffers and is bringing in all new people.
The party is clearly taking a new direction and it s not a good one for any American.
DONALD TRUMP DIDN T WIN
