Pepsi got hammered by just about everyone for their lame attempt at glamorizing anti-Trump and Black Lives Matter violent protesters in an ad campaign with Kendall Jenner that made protesters look like they popped off the pages of a J.
Crew magazine for a party/protest.Here s the Pepsi ad:The marketing team for Pepsi really needs to review the actual footage of these violent Antifa and Soros-funded Democrat thugs, because in reality they are about as far away from the pages of J.
Crew as they could possibly be.Here s a picture of the Antifa protesters in Berkeley, CA taken at today s rally.
Sorry Pepsi, we re just not seeing the resemblance PRICELESS!
This Trump supporter couldn t have done a better a better job of mocking Pepsi with this is perfect shot of a Pepsi can in front of Antifa terrorists in the background: Photo of the day.

The anti-Trump terrorists and the Black Lives Matter thugs don t just threaten anyone who disagrees with them, they leave them bloodied and beaten.
Here are just a few of the photos of Trump supporters that were taken today at Berkeley, California after anti-Trump terrorists once again used violence to shut down anyone who disagrees with their political views.
Cheers Pepsi Here s what a real protest in a post-Obama world looks like a far cry from Pepsi s glamorized version:https://twitter.com/TEN_GOP/status/853376478003826688
