berlin ( reuters ) - hungary could face financial consequences if it defies a european court ruling ordering it to accept its allocated share of refugees arriving in europe , german chancellor angela merkel said in a newspaper interview .
the remarks suggest a hardening of germany s line on the right-wing hungarian government of viktor orban , who has been outspoken in his opposition to an agreement that each european union country should agree to take in a quota of refugees .
anyone who rejects this solidarity must accept that this will not be without consequences , including for negotiations over future financial support , merkel said in the interview with nordwest zeitung published on friday .
merkel s tougher line , which comes a week before parliamentary elections in which the conservative is running for a fourth term as chancellor , mirrors the position of martin schulz , her social democratic rival , who has long been a fierce critic of orban s nativist style .
more than 1.5 million migrants and refugees have arrived in europe since 2015 , many fleeing war in the middle east .
the eu s highest court ruled on sept. 6 that member states must take in a share of the refugees , dismissing complaints by slovakia and hungary and reigniting an east-west row that has shaken the union s cohesion .
a suspension of financial support could have serious fiscal consequences for hungary , which has prospered on the back of large claims on eu cohesion and development funds .
hungary has been allocated 25 billion euros ( $ 30 billion ) in european structural and investment funds via a range of programs over the period 2014-2020 , according to the european union website .
orban , who has built border fences and made keeping out migrants a key plank of his re-election campaign for next year , this week announced plans for a national consultation on brussels plans to distribute asylum-seekers in the eu .
