ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey and Russia have agreed to focus on a political solution in Syria, Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said on Monday.
Erdogan said he was glad Turkey had started to send agricultural goods to Russia but wanted the last restrictions on bilateral trade lifted.
He was speaking after a meeting with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin in the southern Russian city of Sochi.
