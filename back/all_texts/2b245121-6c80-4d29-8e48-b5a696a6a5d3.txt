It is quite possibly the work of an enemy of Trump there are many.Yet the fact a book with such a title even exists must be an acute embarrassment to the Trumps.Say what??
?Melania Trump has started legal action against the Daily Mail and other outlets for what she claims is a defamatory article about her past.Charles Harder, an attorney for Trump, said in an email that the legal action goes beyond just the Daily Mail and is not limited to the United Kingdom, where the Daily Mail is headquartered.
Mrs. Trump has placed several news organizations on notice of her legal claims against them, including Daily Mail among others, for making false and defamatory statements about her supposedly having been an escort in the 1990s, Harder said in an email.
