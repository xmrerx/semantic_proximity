In case anyone was confused about how the whole kneeling for the national anthem thing came about, it was the former 49er s quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had the bright idea to kneel, as a way to bring attention to how unfairly blacks are treated by law enforcement.A few days ago, the entitled NFL athlete, Seattle Seahawks rookie, defensive-lineman, Malik McDowell, found himself in a little hot water with the law.
Unfortunately for McDowell, his disrespectful interaction with the female law enforcement officer who was attempting to arrest him for disorderly conduct was all caught on camera and shared with TMZ.From Deadspin: The video features a male officer who appears to be tasked with transporting McDowell, but not the one who originally arrested him putting handcuffs on McDowell.
At the same time, McDowell is taunting a female cop standing nearby.
Are you scared of me?
he asks her repeatedly.
Why is you a cop then?
McDowell and the officer go back and forth about why he was arrested for disorderly conduct, and he calls her a bitch multiple times.
Bitch, I got money.
That s why I can talk shit, McDowell says, adding that the officers will never make as much money as he s made in the past few months.McDowell then apparently shouts at some passersby, Hey, they re trying to plant some shit on me!
which causes the officers to laugh.
I got a lot of fucking money you broke-ass niggas, McDowell says as they search him.
Put me in fucking jail, please, so I can bond out.
NFL fans reacted to the kneeling players disrespect for our flag, our active and retired military and law enforcement officers by turning off their TV s and skipping the games, leaving empty seats in NFL stadiums across the nation for 11 weeks in a row.
