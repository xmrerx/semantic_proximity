In a bombshell revelation, The New York Times named Israel the source of the classified information that Trump leaked to the Russian government last week.Today, an Israeli intelligence officer disclosed to BuzzFeed that Israel is very concerned about Trump actions despite the fact that the Israeli government said they wouldn t change their intelligence relationship with the White House.
We have an arrangement with America which is unique to the world of intelligence sharing, the official explained.
We do not have this relationship with any other country There is a special understanding of security cooperation between our countries.
To know that this intelligence is shared with others, without our prior knowledge?
That is, for us, our worst fears confirmed.
Earlier this year the same unnamed Israeli official told BuzzFeed that Israeli Intelligence had major concerns over Trump and what he might disclose to Russia a very close ally to Israel s top adversary, Iran.The President has a visit scheduled in Israel for next week as part of a large global tour that includes Saudi Arabia and the Vatican.
This might not be the best time for Trump to travel to Isreal, seeing as he may have just outed them to their biggest enemy.
It will be interesting to watch how this unfolds.Photo by Michael Reynolds-Pool/Getty Images
