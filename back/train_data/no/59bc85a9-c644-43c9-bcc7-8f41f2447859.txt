berlin ( reuters ) - germany is best suited to host a new nato military logistics command , the top u.s. army general in europe said on tuesday .
nato allies this month backed plans for two new military headquarters - an atlantic command and a logistics command - to help protect europe in the event of a future conflict .
lieutenant general ben hodges told the berlin security conference that germany - already host to many u.s. troops - was well-placed to take on the logistics role given its geographical location in the heart of europe , and its existing capabilities .
i can t imagine any other country being better suited than germany to take on that responsibility , from a geographical standpoint , a capability standpoint , hodges said .
diplomats have said that germany is eager to host the logistics command but no decisions have been made .
hodges , who is due to retire next month , has repeatedly pushed for increased focus on improving the ability to move troops and equipment across europe in the event of a future conflict .
nato began beefing up its defenses after the 2014 annexation by russia of ukraine s crimea peninsula , deploying troops to the baltic states and poland , strengthening its presence in the black sea and starting to modernizing its forces .
the kremlin , which denies harboring any aggressive intentions toward europe , has condemned the moves as an attempt to encircle russia .
