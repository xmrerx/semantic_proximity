President Trump visited Michigan to promote the auto industry and jobs.
While he was at Willow Run, he had a chance for a photo with the governor of Michigan.
A priceless exchange happened between Trump and Snyder.
Trump looked over and asked the governor to come over even though you didn t endorse me .
The best part is when Trump says, I never forget Hahaha!
People from Michigan will appreciate this because Snyder is a Republican governor who in reality is a Democrat.
He refused to endorse Trump during the election!
When Trump held his very last rally in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Snyder was a no-show.
What a putz!
This is why we love Trump he calls em as he sees em!
