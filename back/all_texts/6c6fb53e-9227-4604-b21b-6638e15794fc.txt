According to polls conducted in November by CNN, NBC News and Gallup, 45 percent of Latino voters now say they see the GOP as hostile.
Compare that to responses from November 2012, when the same polling organizations found that 18 percent of polled Latinos held the same views.Over the past three years the number of Latino voters who say they view the Republican Party as hostile has more than doubled.Even more telling, more than three times as many young Latino voters have a negative view of the party today.
The recent polls show that 65 percent of Latino voters, between the ages of 18 and 35, now see the Republican Party as hostile toward them.This is bad news for the Republican Party, which cannot win the general election without Latino voters.According to GOP election strategists, in order to win the White House in 2016, republicans need at least 45 percent of the Latino vote.Republican party strategist Whit Ayres broke it down nicely, in March of last year.
As Ayres points out here:Clearly that s not going to happen when the party frontrunner is Donald Trump, a man whose entire platform is built on racist hate and religious bigotry.While it s tempting to single out Trump as the culprit behind the numbers, if Trump is to blame for anything it s the fact that he s brought the party s long-existing racist undertones into the spotlight.The GOP has been using dog-whistle politics to rile up their racist, religiously bigoted base for decades.
The Trump campaign is simply the predictable progression of the Southern Strategy.But as Addicting Info explains here and here, in catering to race hated and right-wing religious extremists, republicans have created a no-win situation.The party has built a base that only responds to dog-whistles.
That means that the only way to motivate regular GOP voters is by scapegoating immigrants, minorities and people who do not subscribe to the doctrine of right-wing Christian fanaticism.At the same time, every time republican candidates spew the kind of racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric that appeals to their base, they further alienate voters outside of their base.How do you bring new people into a political party that is united by the idea of keeping other people out?You don t.Demographically speaking, however, there just aren t enough angry, bigoted white people left in America to keep the Republican Party going.
For these reasons (and many others) the republican party is on its way to oblivion, which is exactly where it belongs.Featured image from Wikipedia, public domain
