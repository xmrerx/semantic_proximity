dubai ( reuters ) - a ballistic missile fired by yemen s armed houthi group at saudi arabia was shot down on thursday near the south-western city of khamis mushait , the saudi-owned al-arabiya channel reported .
it was the second ballistic missile fired from yemen this month , after an earlier rocket was brought down near king khaled airport on the northern outskirts of the capital riyadh .
a saudi-led coalition fighting the houthis in yemen has closed air , land and sea access in a move it says is meant to stop a flow of iranian arms to the houthis , who control much of northern yemen .
the blockade has cut food imports to seven million people on the brink of famine .
air defense intercepted a ballistic missile , fired by the houthis toward khamis mushait , arabiya said on its twitter account , without giving details .
the houthis and allied militias loyal to former yemeni president ali abdullah saleh , who have fired dozens of missiles into saudi territory during a 2-1/2 year war , said on their official news agency they had launched a mid-range ballistic missile that hit its military target with high precision .
saba , quoting a military source , added the successful test was a new start of locally made missile launches .
saudi arabia and its allies , who receive logistical and intelligence help from the united states , accuse the houthis of being a proxy of iran .
the coalition has launched thousands of air strikes against the houthis who still control much of yemen s main population centers including the capital sanaa and the strategic port and city of hodeidah .
the conflict has led to one of the world s worst humanitarian crises and killed at least 10,000 people .
