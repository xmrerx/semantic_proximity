moscow ( reuters ) - one of president vladimir putin s top allies said on sunday she saw no logic in deploying u.n. peacekeepers along the border between russia and ukraine , something kiev and washington favor .
putin this month suggested armed u.n. peacekeepers be deployed to eastern ukraine to help protect ceasefire monitors from the organization for security and cooperation in europe ( osce ) and to help end a conflict between ukrainian troops and russia-backed separatists , which has killed more than 10,000 people since 2014 .
german chancellor angela merkel has called the proposal interesting , while kurt volker , the u.s. envoy to ukraine peace talks , says the suggestion gives negotiators more ideas with which to seek a resolution to the conflict .
but differences about where the peacekeepers would operate risk sinking the plan .
putin originally said the peacekeepers could be deployed along the line of contact between ukrainian government forces and pro-russian separatists , but later said they could also be deployed in other areas where osce inspectors work .
washington and kiev also want peacekeepers to be deployed along those parts of ukraine s border with russia which kiev does not control .
however , valentina matviyenko , speaker of the russian upper house of parliament and a close putin ally , said on sunday moscow strongly objected to that idea .
i don t see any logic in such a proposal , matviyenko , visiting turkmenistan , told reporters , the interfax news agency reported .
those who would like to surround the residents of the self-proclaimed republics of donbass ( donetsk ) and luhansk with barbed wire or to simply destroy these people ... will not succeed .
