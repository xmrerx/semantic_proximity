quito ( reuters ) - ecuador s president on wednesday tapped urban development minister maria alejandra vicuna to replace jailed jorge glas as vice president while he is investigated in a corruption scandal centered on brazilian construction company odebrecht .
in a political drama that has riveted the small andean country , glas was jailed on monday night after prosecutors determined he was linked to the payment of bribes by odebrecht .
he has not been formally charged .
glas , a close ally of leftist ex-president rafael correa who served as his vice president and strategic sectors minister , has maintained his innocence and claimed the new administration of president lenin moreno is seeking to smear him for political gain .
moreno on wednesday announced that vicuna , a low-profile former lawmaker from the ruling country alliance party , would take on the role of vice president during glas temporary absence .
the investigation into glas and his sidelining from the current government has caused a rift between moreno and his fiery predecessor and onetime mentor correa , who says glas is the innocent victim of a political witch hunt .
tensions are due to rise further between the two politicians with moreno planning a referendum in early 2018 on whether to ban elected politicians from running for indefinite re-election , a move widely seen as aimed at barring correa from becoming president again .
fallout from the massive odebrecht corruption saga continues to sweep latin america .
the company , which has admitted to paying bribes to win contracts in a number of countries , has already paid $ 3.5 billion in settlements in the united states , brazil and switzerland .
the scandal has embroiled politicians across the region .
glas , 48 , was accused by a fugitive former oil minister of being the ringleader of a bribe network in the energy sector .
