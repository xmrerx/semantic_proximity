If MSNBC had referred to Donald Trump as a rich asshole, Fox News would have thrown a collective hissy fit about it.
But the conservative network has no problem insulting the former Secretary of State with a level of vitriol that does not belong in broadcast news.After interrupting Hillary s live speech on Wednesday, in which the Democratic nominee was talking about how real successful businessmen are able to succeed without destroying the lives of others to achieve their goals, Fox turned the commentary over to Antonio Sabato, Jr., who was eager to disrespect her.
Just give her a broom so she can fly away, that witch, he said.
Oh, we cannot stand her and please stop talking.
I m not sure who the we he was referring to is, but the Calvin Klein model then demonstrated why he is paid to keep his mouth shut and pose for the pretty picture by professing his support of the racist Republican nominee.
She s talking about Trump, she s talking about mistakes.
What has she created?
What has she done in the last in her entire life, she s done absolutely nothing.
I can t stand her talk anymore and I think the American people have to wake up.
Donald Trump is the only way.
Here s the video via YouTube.It s outrageous that this kind of rhetoric is allowed to be used during a live news broadcast.
It s even more outrageous that there were four women sitting with Sabato, Jr. and none of them bothered to smack him down for using such a term to describe the potential first female President of the United States.Make no mistake, this was a sexist attack against Hillary Clinton by a Donald Trump shill who seems to have no problem with Trump s anti-Semitism and anti-immigrant stances despite the fact that he and his parents are immigrants and his maternal grandmother was a Jew who survived the Holocaust.It doesn t get more hypocritical than that.Featured image via screenshot
