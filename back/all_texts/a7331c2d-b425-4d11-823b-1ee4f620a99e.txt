Flashback to February 18.
201: In a remarkable dispute just two days before a pivotal Republican primary, Pope Francis said Donald Trump s plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border is un-Christian, prompting Trump to respond that it was disgraceful for the pope to question his religion.
A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not building bridges, is not Christian, Francis told reporters Wednesday aboard the papal plane.
This is not in the Gospel.
The pope s comments were first made public on Thursday.
They obviously got to the pope, Trump said.
He doesn t know me the Pope heard only one side of the story.
In response to Pope Francis comments, candidate Trump told his supporters that I am a Christian and I am proud of it, and also attacked the Mexican government for using the pope as a pawn.
There can t be a good economy without good businessmen, without their capacity to create and to produce, he said, shattering his reputation as an enemy of the free market economy.The Pope recognized that the essential value of work and employment is only possible when companies are sound and successful.
Moreover, only an economically healthy society can keep a democracy afloat, he suggested.
The world of work is a human priority, Francis said, and it s also a priority for the pope.
There s always been a friendship between the church and work, starting with Jesus, who was a worker.
When work is weakened, it s democracy that enters into crisis, he said.
There s a social compact.
Without denouncing unemployment benefits, Francis insisted that state intervention wasn t a real solution.
A monthly check from the state that allows you to keep the family afloat doesn t solve the problem.
It has to be resolved with work for everyone, he said.
