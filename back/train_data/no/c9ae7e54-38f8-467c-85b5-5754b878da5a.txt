dubai ( reuters ) - the vast majority of about 200 businessmen and officials implicated in a sweeping crackdown on corruption are agreeing to settlements under which they hand over assets to the government , crown prince mohammed bin salman told the new york times .
we show them all the files that we have and as soon as they see those about 95 percent agree to a settlement , which means signing over cash or shares in their companies to the saudi treasury , the newspaper quoted prince mohammed as saying .
about 1 percent are able to prove they are clean and their case is dropped right there .
about 4 percent say they are not corrupt and with their lawyers want to go to court .
prince mohammed repeated a previous official estimate that the government could eventually recover around $ 100 billion of illicit money through settlements .
the government said two weeks ago that it had questioned 208 people in the crackdown and released seven without charge .
dozens of princes , senior officials and top businessmen are believed to be held in riyadh s opulent ritz carlton hotel as their cases are processed .
over 2,000 saudi bank accounts have been frozen during the probe , causing concern that the crackdown could damage the economy .
but the government has insisted that the companies of detained businessmen will continue operating normally .
we have experts making sure no businesses are bankrupted in the process , prince mohammed told the times .
he dismissed suggestions that the crackdown aimed to strengthen his political power as ludicrous , noting that prominent people held at the ritz had already publicly pledged allegiance to him and his reforms .
a majority of the royal family is behind him , prince mohammed said .
under saudi law , the public prosecutor is independent .
we can not interfere with his job the king can dismiss him , but he is driving the process .
you have to send a signal , and the signal going forward now is , you will not escape .
