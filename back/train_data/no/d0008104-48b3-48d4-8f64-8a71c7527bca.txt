what is it that they don t get ?
does anyone even listen to these inciters of anger and hate ?
this is pitiful ! warning : profanity/strong racial languagethis week on the new black panther party s black power radio , national chairman hashim nzinga said since america has declared war on us , evidenced by military police in the black neighborhood protecting the rich , the new black panthers should be looked upon as founding fathers who declare war and are willing to die or kill to save our babies and to save a black nation that is dying before our eyes .
nzinga said , america is about protecting the rich and the powerful .
he added , we pay taxes .
they have declared war on us and it s nothing but state racism .
so if we say we are at war , we should be applauded like george washington , nzinga continued .
we should be applauded like thomas jefferson .
we should be applauded like the founding fathers of the country .
this is not the hate hour , this is the love hour , he added .
we have to love ourselves enough to be willing to die or kill to save our babies and to save a black nation that is dying before our eyes .
