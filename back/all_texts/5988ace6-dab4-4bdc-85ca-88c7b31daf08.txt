There may be trouble in paradise amid the folks over at the Donald Trump campaign.
After the recent tapes were leaked showing Trump to the misogynistic sexual predator that he so absolutely is, we haven t been hearing much, if anything, from Trump s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway.Then, while being interviewed by Chris Matthews on MSNBC, Conway may have revealed something she might leave the campaign.Matthews asks Conway:So, are you with the campaign til the bitter end?
Conway responded: I m with the campaign to the bitter end .
unless Seemingly taken aback like the rest of us at home, Matthews presses Conway: Unless what?
Conway quickly scrambled together an answer.Then, when pressed on it later by Rachel Maddow, Conway put together a reason that involved if her family needed her, and not at all around the fact that her candidate is a racist and misogynistic pervert.The fact that she said unless is absolutely telling of how she may feel about her current position within the campaign.Only time will tell to see if Conway stands by her candidate or not until the bitter end, but one thing is for certain, it s likely getting harder for her by the day.Watch Conway admit she may leave here: Trump s campaign manager @KellyannePolls just admitted she may leave the campaign.
