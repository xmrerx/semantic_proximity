Mark Wahlberg has been a rapper.
He appeared shirtless and grinning on a 40-foot billboard in Times Square.
He launched his own burger chain.
And he starred in some of the greatest movies ever made, including Boogie Nights, Three Kings, The Departed, and Lone Survivor.
Wahlberg went on an emotional tear, evincing a raw and heartfelt respect for the real sacrifice he d portrayed in Lone Survivor.
He said he had no respect for anyone who might suggest that filmmaking comes close to its degree of difficulty.
I don t know it just hit me in a way that uh I don t know, it just really upset me that those guys were never gonna see their families again.

You don t do what these guys did.
For somebody to sit there and say my job was as difficult as somebody in the military s. How fucking dare you.
While you sit in a makeup chair for two hours.
Don t expect Wahlberg to opine on politics.

They might buy your CD or watch your movie, but you don t put food on their table.
You don t pay their bills.
