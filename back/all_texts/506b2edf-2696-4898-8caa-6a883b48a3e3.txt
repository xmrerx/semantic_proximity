Fox News continues to outdo itself for its incompetent so-called journalism.
A Fox News host said that Bernie Sanders is basically a communist for wanting free college tuition for young Americans.
While the host has no clue to what a communist is, what the host said about millions of Americans was the true insult.In a startling display of disdain for middle and lower-income Americans, Fox host Gretchen Carlson said that if rich kids get to go to school on their parents dime, then it s because their parents worked incredibly hard : Where he said, you know, poor people should be able to go to college free, like rich kids.
Free?
If that s actually true, quite possibly their parents worked incredibly hard to be able to pay for them, the full ride to go to college!
What her silly statement implies is that parents of kids who can t afford to send them to college without assistance means that they are not hard workers.
The shear arrogance is striking.
How much money a person makes is not indicative of whether he/she works hard!
The shear stupidity coupled with arrogance is very disturbing.
It s puzzling how such people can have a platform on television.The host also went on to demean younger generations for supporting Bernie Sanders.
Alarmed by the overwhelming support Sanders has received from young voters, Carlson dismisses them as lacking an understanding in what she believed were Sanders communist policies.
She said: We have fought wars!
Men and women have died in this country to fight against communism and many of these same principles, quite honestly Katherine, I mean, it s astounding.
The more these people continue to spew such nonsense, the more obvious it is why Sanders has enormous popular appeal to Americans.
It s time to give the American Dream back to everyone and not a select few.Watch Here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E8DKt6MhUGo]Featured Image via Screen Capture
