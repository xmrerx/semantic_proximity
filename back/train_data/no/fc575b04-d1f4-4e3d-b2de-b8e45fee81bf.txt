pristina ( reuters ) - two kosovo men pleaded guilty on wednesday to planning attacks at a world cup soccer match in albania against the visiting israel team last year .
kosovo police arrested 19 people in november 2016 on suspicion that they had links with the islamic state militant group and were planning attacks in kosovo and neighboring albania .
nine of them were charged .
the state prosecutor said some of them were in contact with lavdrim muhaxheri , islamic state s self-declared commander of albanians in syria and iraq , who ordered them to attack .
police said muhaxheri was killed in june this year .
...
i accept guilty plea , defendant kenan plakaj said in court .
he is accused of making explosives , after police found half a kilo of explosives at his house , the indictment said .
the other defendant , besart peci , also pleaded guilty .
sentences were not announced .
another defendant facing trial had kept in his basement 283 grams of self-made explosives .
the same triacetone triperoxide explosive was used in attacks in paris and brussels and has been found in various foiled bombings in europe since 2007 .
no militant attacks have been staged in kosovo , whose population is largely ethnic albanian muslim .
but at least 200 people have been detained or investigated over offences related to islamic state , and a total of 300 kosovars have gone to syria to fight for islamic state .
more than 70 have been killed .
international and local security agencies in kosovo are worried that many of those returning from combat zones will pose a security threat .
in 2015 , kosovo adopted a law introducing jail sentences of up to 15 years for anyone found guilty of fighting in wars abroad .
