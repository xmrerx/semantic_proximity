cox s bazar , bangladesh ( reuters ) - wild elephants trampled to death two rohingya muslims in bangladesh on monday when they rampaged through a settlement where the refugees were taking shelter after fleeing a military offensive in neighboring myanmar .
more than 410,000 refugees from myanmar have poured into bangladesh since aug. 25 when attacks by rohingya militants on security posts triggered a myanmar army operation that the united nations has described as ethnic cleansing .
there are elephants in the forest , close to the place where many rohingya refugees are clearing forest to make huts , police official chailau murma told reuters .
an elderly person and a toddler were killed when the elephants rampaged through the area , he said .
three other people were taken to hospital to be treated for injuries , a refugee camp leader said .
police said the elephants later disappeared back into the forest .
the refugees are facing dire conditions with insufficient food , water , medical care and shelter , and regular drenchings from monsoon rains that have turned roads into quagmires .
bangladeshi authorities say they aim to move everyone out of so-called spontaneous sites , usually beside roads where people try to make shelters wherever they are , into one big camp where aid supplies can be properly distributed .
