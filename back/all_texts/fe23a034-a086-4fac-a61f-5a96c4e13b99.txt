Marco Rubio, the latest victim of the Trump train that has wreacked havoc on the Republican Party, has bowed out of the race for the nomination after getting destroyed in Florida, becoming the latest victim in a long line of Republican candidates that has now trickled down to just three.
Stephen Colbert bid farewell to Rubio with an epic sendoff, putting together a compilation of absurdities committed by Rubio throughout his campaign for the presidency.
Yes, Florida senator and boy whose birthday party your parents made you attend, Marco Rubio, has joined the ranks of the fallen, Colbert said.
When Rubio told his supporters there is nothing more they could have done for him, the host replied, Well, you could have voted for him, but besides that, no.
Colbert added: Rubio was the last tribute fighting on behalf of the establishment of Capital City.
He was supposed to become the Jeb Bush people liked.
Instead he became Jeb Bush.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1AWywH4OxcE]Colbert touched on some of the most important moments in the Rubio campaign, including his big mistake in stooping to Trump s level by making fun of his hands.
You know what they say about men with small hands, Colbert asked.
They win Florida.
Rubio, the darling of the Republican establishment was expected to perform much better but continuously finished in third place behind Trump and the other creepy guy Ted Cruz.
He has stated that he would not run on anyone s ticket as vice-president if he s asked.
No loss for America there folks.
