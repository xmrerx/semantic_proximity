Our first black President of the United States has quite an impressive list of accomplishments.
Sadly, not one of his accomplishments has anything to do with helping the black community who believed him when he said he would help them find jobs.
Many Americans in fact, believe that the former president actually set race relations back 50 years.While every first is probably not on the list below, most of them are.
