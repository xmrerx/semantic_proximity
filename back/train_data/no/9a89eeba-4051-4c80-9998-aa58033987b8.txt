new york ( reuters ) - republican candidate donald trump ’ s odds at becoming the next president of the united states took a hit following his loss to senator ted cruz of texas in the iowa caucuses , two online betting sites said on tuesday .
on tuesday morning , both ladbrokes plc and paddy power betfair plc said the real estate tycoon ’ s odds of winning the november election were now 7/1 , compared to 3/1 on monday .
that reduced his chances for victory to 13 percent from 25 percent on monday .
cruz won monday ’ s republican iowa caucuses with 28 percent of the vote compared with 24 percent for trump , whose aggressive and unorthodox campaign has been marked by unorthodox and controversial stances such as calls to temporarily ban muslims from entering the united states or build a wall along the u.s.-mexican border .
senator marco rubio of florida has taken over as the favorite to become the republican nominee after a stronger-than-expected third place finish in the caucuses , ladbrokes said .
his odds for the nomination were 4/5 on tuesday , giving him a 56 percent chance .
trump ’ s odds were 11/4 , giving him a 27 percent chance .
“ this could be the first sign that the trump bubble is about to burst , ” said matthew shaddick , head of political odds at ladbrokes , said in a statement .
“ the betting is now firmly pointing toward a clinton-rubio showdown in november. ” trump ’ s odds have improved since he declared his candidacy in june , when they were 100/1 , giving him a 1 percent chance , ladbrokes said .
