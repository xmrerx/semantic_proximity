sydney ( reuters ) - thousands of people rallied for marriage equality in australia s second-biggest city of melbourne on saturday ahead of a postal survey on same-sex marriage which could lead to its legalisation .
australia is one of the only developed english-speaking countries not to have legalised same-sex marriage , despite strong popular support and the backing of a majority of lawmakers .
shadow attorney-general mark dreyfus , of the opposition labor party , called on the conservative liberal party-led government to do more to ensure the debate did not turn ugly ahead of the postal survey next month .
i m particularly calling on the prime minister of australia to speak out against any bile or hate speech that we might see in this campaign , he told the rally .
prime minister malcolm turnbull last week urged supporters and opponents of same-sex marriage to show mutual respect as their campaigns turned increasingly vitriolic .
[ nl4n1lb1tj ] rally organiser anthony wallace from activist group equal love said 15,000 people attended the event , making it one of the largest gay rights rallies in australian history .
police declined to estimate the size of the crowd .
the rally is an annual event , which this year began and ended at the victorian state library , where a mass same-sex wedding ceremony was held .
australians will vote over several weeks from mid-september in the non-compulsory postal ballot on whether to legalise same-sex marriage .
same-sex marriage is supported by 61 percent of australians , a 2016 gallup opinion poll showed , but the issue has fractured the turnbull government and damaged his standing with voters , now at a six-month low .
