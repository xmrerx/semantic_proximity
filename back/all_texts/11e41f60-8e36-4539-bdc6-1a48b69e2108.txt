Daily Shooter 21st Century WireJust as ISIS is being routed in Deir Ezzor, Syria, and soon out of Raqqa, and driven from its remaining strongholds in Iraq we discover how the US government has been busy keeping the organization thriving within its own shores.What you are about to read is simply breathtaking, but should be of no surprise to our readers.
These new court findings reaffirms much of what 21WIRE and the Daily Shooter column have been reporting for the last five years that the FBI is responsible for the majority of so-called terrorist attacks in the US.According to a new legal case filed against the FBI, court filings have revealed how the agency allowed an alleged home grown ISIS attack to take place in Garland, Texas on May 4, 2015. International criminal lawyer Jennifer Breedon shows the FBI was complicit in the attack, and even enticed the two terrorists to carry out the attack, and where agents had pretended to be ISIS in order to keep their entrapment operation going.
She explains: Some of the facts are indicating that they had an undercover agent that was trying to get in with ISIS trying to find out these ISIS groups, and he wanted to make himself higher up in ISIS ranks to know more of their fighters.
Apparently, he stayed in the car behind them, which came out in another case filing with the FBI.
They did not prevent it because if the attack had been carried out successfully, and people died, it was likely this undercover agent and his supervisors in the FBI felt that this would promote him up to high ranks within ISIS the undercover agent would be promoted up, because the attack was then successful.
Read Breddon s full interview here.On the surface this is a clear case of entrapment by the FBI, but upon deeper examination it s now clear that the FBI seems to have aided and abetted a terrorist attack on US soil.While other mainstream and alternative media outlets were busy promulgating the official narrative, 21WIRE actually called-out the staged event, designed to leverage a far right, anti-Muslim agenda, and stoke irrational fears of endless ISIS attacks on US soil.PROVOCATEUR: Professional provocateur Geller provided the PR bait for media, the FBI-run American ISIS cell.The contrived event was marketed as a controversial Muhammad Art Exhibit and Cartoon Contest, organized by a cut-out politcal front group, American Freedom Defense Initiative, led by anti-Muslim activist and professional provocateur, Pamela Geller, and featured far-right Dutch politician Geert Wilders, as its keynote speaker.
Media personality Geller claimed to have purposely chosen the venue following the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) gathering who held a Stand with the Prophet conference in late January 2015 after the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris earlier that year.According to the victim s attorney Breedon, the FBI had an undercover agent that was trying to get in with ISIS trying to find out these ISIS groups, and he wanted to make himself higher up in ISIS ranks to know more of their fighters.
American journalist Trevor Aaronson further explains the derelict role of James Comey (image, left) in FBI s attempt to cover its own fingerprints on this dodgy operation: Hours earlier, the FBI had sent a bulletin to local police with Elton Simpson s photo, warning that he was interested in the event.
FBI Director James Comey said in a press conference following the shooting that the FBI did not have reason to believe Simpson was planning to attack the event, even though the bureau had spent years trying to build a case against him.
ENTRAPMENT: The unwitting youngster, Elton Simpson, was groomed by a paid FBI informant, and brought to the scene of the staged attack.
After the FBI-staged attack , 21WIRE was one of few media outlets to report how a paid FBI informant was not only handling , but directing what appeared to be a naive and vulnerable federal target for entrapment a new young Muslim convert named Elton Simpson from Phoenix, Arizona:It s now been revealed that gunman , Elton Simpson, was already under surveillance by the FBI and was even the subject of a terror investigation.
More importantly, we can also confirm Simpson was being handled by an FBI informant.
Court papers filed in Arizona name the FBI undercover informant as Mr. Daba Deng, a Kenyan and who, from 2007, was paid $132,000 by the FBI to become friends with Mr. Simpson , and who appears to have groomed Simpson through a local mosque, and helped to develop Simpson s ideas about jihad .So keen was CNN at the time to convince its audience that Garland was a real terrorist event, it took the trouble of creating its own cartoon version of the attack in a desperate attempt to make the official story believable:SYNTHETIC TERROR: CNN uses cartoon to make the Garland Shooting look like a real terror event.At the time, and almost comically, CNN tried to push the official narrative, appearing totally clueless of the fact that the attackers were under FBI supervision for years: He wasn t well-known to federal law enforcement and was not on the FBI s radar, one of the officials said.
Investigators were combing through evidence retrieved from the shooters Arizona home to help piece together a timeline of how their plot came together, the official said.
It was as if CNN had copied and pasted their report from an FBI press memo issued after the event (perhaps it was).
CNN s coverage of the event was equally ridiculous, not picking up on the fact that a small platoon of heavily armed US special ops mercenaries were pre-positioned at Geller s event in anticipation of the made-for-TV terror attack that followed:#BREAKING Update from SWAT Team Leader.

Mohammed Cartoon Shooting Reeks of a Staged False FlagGarland was a clear case of the US government creating a terror threat where there was none, and this wouldn t be the first time either.As previously noted, The Guardian reported on the scale and scope of this trend in 2014: In some cases the FBI may have created terrorists out of law-abiding individuals by suggesting the idea of taking terrorist action or encouraging the target to act.
The list of FBI-related terrorist incidents inside the US is a long one.
The formula for creating a terror icon required a confidential informant to guide and manage the future suspect right up to the point of arrest, or in some cases, like the World Trade Center Bombing in 1993, the FBI have even allowed the terrorist incident to take place.In Garland, as with so many other high profile terror and mass shooting events, 21WIRE s investigations have turned out to correct, while the mainstream media have been completely wrong.The following infographic is from the Program on Extremism these are likely contrived, if not inflated numbers meant to represent suspected ISIS members supposedly hiding out all over America:We've updated our ISIS in America numbers (100) and added a new statistic: Average prison sentence (10.1 years).
