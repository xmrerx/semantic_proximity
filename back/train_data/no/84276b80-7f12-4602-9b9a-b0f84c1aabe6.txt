buzzfeed s ben smith was interviewed by tucker carlson tonight proving he is the type of guy who doesn t care about reality but just wants to make up his own rules .
remember that buzzfeed published information that there was a dossier on donald trump that had salacious accusations in it .
that should tell you just how slimy this guy is but here s where it got heated : tucker went on to question smith on hiring practices by buzzfeed basically , buzzfeed is racist in that they prefer any race over whites .
tucker gets into it with smith claiming that it is in fact racism if you don t hire white people .
racism goes both ways ! why are buzzfeed s racial hiring quotas not racist ? https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? time_continue=684 & v=riavxxkarfm
