Judging by how disastrous Donald Trump s first overseas trip went, it couldn t have been any more clear that Trump is not physically fit enough to deal with the exhausting demands of being president.
He lacked the stamina and energy, as he was reportedly exhausted by the second day and he even had to make use of a golf cart to follow behind other world leaders as they walked.This was truly humiliating for Trump, especially after spending his entire presidential campaign insulting Democratic rival Hillary Clinton s stamina even though she has traveled extensively during her time as Secretary of State and worked tirelessly on her presidential campaign despite having pneumonia.
Yet, Fox News is choosing to ignore the obvious and decided to defend Trump, which was absolutely ridiculous.On Wednesday, Fox News host Jon Scott stated that because Trump has the energy to tweet incoherent thoughts at night, he truly has the stamina to be president.
Yes, really.After midnight, Trump had sent out a tweet whining about the constant negative press covfefe.
This obviously went viral for its insanity, and Trump eventually followed it up with another weird tweet in the early hours of the morning:Trump is obviously losing his mind, but Fox News believes that as long as he can tweet, Trump is good enough to lead the country.
Scott commended this unpresidential behavior and argued: People are enjoying it, you ve got to give him that.
It was a big issue during the campaign.
He often accused Hillary Clinton of not having the energy, the stamina to be president.
So, he was up tweeting at 12:06 a.m., even if it wasn t exactly a, well, coherent tweet.
And then at 5:00 a.m., he deleted it.
So, I guess the president is, as he said, a man who needs only a few hours sleep.
At any rate, he got 126,000 retweets and 160,000 likes for covfefe.
Absolutely disgusting.
No wonder Trump likes Fox so much.
