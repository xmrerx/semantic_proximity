Feel the Bern of a lot of gullible young people who were fed a big line of Bullsh*t Socialist Senator Bernie Sanders (VT) is the proud new owner of a summer home in the Champlain Islands, Seven Days has confirmed.The Burlington resident last week plopped down nearly $600,000 on a lakefront camp in North Hero.Sanders new crib has four bedrooms and 500 feet of Lake Champlain beachfront on the east side of the island facing Vermont, not New York.
The Bern will keep his home in Burlington and use the new camp seasonally.
We ve traveled up to the islands many times over the years almost always on day trips, Sanders wife, Jane O Meara Sanders, told Seven Days in a written statement.
We ve been impressed with the North Hero community, eaten at the North Hero House and Shore Acres and have suggested them to friends who were looking for a beautiful place to stay or have dinner.
St. Anne s Shrine in Isle La Motte is my favorite church and it is nearby.
Last Tuesday, the day of the closing, a relaxed-looking Bernie Sanders posed for a photo at Hero s Welcome General Store on Route 2.
The store, a bit south of his new abode, serves a sandwich called Feel the Bun in the senator s honor.
The $6.99 deli delight consists of a HUGE homemade roll, sliced turkey, fresh apple chutney, hot pepper relish, lettuce, tomato and provolone cheese.
It s not fair that the Billionaire Class controls 99 percent of the bread, the menu description reads.
Here s a sandwich for the rest of us to keep us nourished until everything cool is free!
