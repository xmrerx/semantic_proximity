washington ( reuters ) - u.s. house speaker paul ryan said on tuesday that he does not agree with critics of republican presidential frontrunner donald trump who have labeled trump authoritarian or fascist .
“ i don ’ t see it that way , ” ryan told reporters in the capitol .
he was responding to a question about whether he agreed with critics such as senator elizabeth warren , who has called trump authoritarian , and mexico ’ s president enrique peña nieto , who has likened trump ’ s “ strident tone ” to the ascent of 1930s fascist leaders adolf hitler and benito mussolini .
ryan also said he was not worried that the republican-majority house of representatives might switch to democratic control as a result of the november elections .
“ i ’ m not concerned about the house flipping because we are in control of our own actions . ”
