WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi on Wednesday called for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to resign following a Washington Post report that he did not disclose two conversations last year with Russia’s ambassador, Sergei Kislyak.
“Now, after lying under oath to Congress about his own communications with the Russians, the Attorney General must resign,” Pelosi said in a statement.
“Sessions is not fit to serve as the top law enforcement officer of our country and must resign.”
