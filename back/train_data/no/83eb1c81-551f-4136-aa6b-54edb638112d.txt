one nation under socialism please check out : john mcnaughton fine art the forgotten man our previous report on that incredible painting : john mcnaughton is a special american painter because of his subject matter and the intensity in which he portrays our current government troubled and corrupt .
the forgotten man painting is amazing in its symbolism.here s how mcnaughton describes the painting : against the background of a darkening sky , all of the past presidents of the united states gather before the white house , as if to commemorate some great event .
in the left hand corner of the painting sits a man .
that man , with his head bowed appears distraught and hopeless as he contemplates his future .
some of the past presidents try to console him while looking in the direction of the modern presidents as if to say , what have you done ?
many of these modern presidents , seemingly oblivious to anything other than themselves , appear to be congratulating each other on their great accomplishments .
in front of the man , paper trash is blowing in the wind .
crumpled dollar bills , legislative documents , and , like a whisper the u.s. constitution beneath the foot of barack obama.the forgotten man mcnaughton never sells his original paintings but he made an exception this time .
he sold this painting to sean hannity so hannity could give it to donald trump .
