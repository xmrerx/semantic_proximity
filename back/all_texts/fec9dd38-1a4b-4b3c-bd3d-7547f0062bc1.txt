I went back the second time and made sure they didn t change it, she concluded.
As we reported earlier this week, voters in numerous areas of Texas have made a series of complaints that votes are being switched from Trump to Clinton.One election official responded by claiming the problems were caused by voters not understanding how to use the machines properly.
Typically, we ve found it s voter error with the equipment, Frank Phillips, Tarrant County s election administrator, told WFAA.
Sometimes they vote straight party and then click on other candidates or do something with the wheel .There is not an issue with the equipment.
However, Trump supporters continue to point to the reports as evidence that vote fraud may be taking place.
