geneva ( reuters ) - the united nations appealed on monday to countries worldwide to take in 1,300 mainly african refugees stranded in libya , many of them mistreated while kept in appalling conditions in detention .
niger has agreed to temporarily host the most vulnerable being evacuated , including unaccompanied children and single mothers , pending their processing and departure for resettlement , the u.n. high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) said in a statement .
in order to address the immediate protection needs and extreme vulnerabilities of the persons of concern who will be evacuated to niger , unhcr urgently requests 1,300 places for resettlement for this situation , the agency said .
the unhcr intends to evacuate between 700 and 1,300 people from libya to niger by the end of january 2018 , it said , calling for the resettlement places to be made available by the end of march .
a first group of 25 refugees from eritrea , ethiopia and sudan were evacuated from libya to niger last month , it added .
this is a desperate call for solidarity and humanity .
we need to get extremely vulnerable refugees out of libya as soon as possible , said volker turk , unhcr assistant high commissioner for protection .
images broadcast by cnn earlier this month appeared to show migrants being auctioned off as slaves by libyan traffickers , sparking outrage in europe and anger in africa .
numbers of detainees swelled after boat departures for italy from the smuggling hub of sabratha were largely blocked this year .
on friday , the international organization for migration ( iom ) , called on social media giants to make it harder for people smugglers to use their platforms to lure west african migrants to libya where they can face detention , torture , slavery or death .
facebook and whatsapp did not reply to requests by reuters for comment .
