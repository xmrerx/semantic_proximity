sydney ( reuters ) - australia s upper house senate on wednesday passed a measure to legalize same-sex marriage , perhaps as soon as next week , after lawmakers dismissed a conservative push to allow religious objectors to refuse service to same-sex couples .
australians overwhelmingly endorsed legalizing same-sex marriage in a postal survey run by the national statistics agency and the bill easily passed the senate by 43 votes to 12 .
conservative lawmakers had pressed for broad protections for religious objectors , among them florists , bakers and musicians , to refuse service to same-sex couples .
but amendments for lay celebrants to refuse to solemnize same-sex marriages and permitting caterers opposed to the unions to refuse service at wedding receptions were either defeated or abandoned during two days of debate in the senate , where same-sex marriage supporters are in the majority .
the australian people voted to lessen discrimination , not to extend it and we , the senate , have respected that vote by rejecting amendments which sought to extend discrimination , or derail marriage equality , labor senator penny wong , who voted down all the amendments , told parliament .
the bill moves to the lower house next week , where conservative lawmakers hope for a renewed push to add measures exempting objectors to same-sex marriage from existing laws against discrimination .
i do not think we have made these changes in a way which advances rights fully , said center-right national party senator matt canavan .
prime minister malcolm turnbull s liberal-national coalition government and the main opposition labor party have said they wanted to pass the law through parliament by dec. 7 .
if the legislation passes as expected , australia will become the 26th nation to legalize same-sex marriage , a watershed for a country where some states held homosexual activity illegal until 1997 .
