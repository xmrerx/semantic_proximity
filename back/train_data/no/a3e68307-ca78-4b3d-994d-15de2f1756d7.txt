beijing ( reuters ) - china s ruling communist party on wednesday opens its 19th congress , at which president xi jinping will map out his ambitions for the country for the next five years and beyond , likely to be high on aspiration and short on concrete details .
here are some key factors to watch out for : - will xi resurrect the position of party chairman ?
xi is currently the party s general secretary , but not its chairman , a title mao zedong and his two successors , hua guofeng and hu yaobang , both held .
becoming party chairman would put xi at the same level as mao and could allow him to effectively end three decades of collective leadership , giving him unparalleled power .
- what will happen to chief corruption-buster wang qishan ?
speculation has swirled that wang , 69 , could be asked to stay on past an unofficial retirement age limit , either in his current role , or possibly in a new position with an economic portfolio .
- who will be on the new standing committee , the apex of power in china ?
currently made up of seven men , most of whom are expected to retire and be replaced by new faces .
possible names include li shulei , wang s deputy at the anti-corruption watchdog ; the chongqing party chief chen miner , who is close to xi ; and the provincial party boss of guangdong , hu chunhua .
if xi becomes party chairman the significance of the standing committee would become diminished , as power would be concentrated in xi s hands rather than in the standing committee .
- a series of new personnel appointments , like the foreign minister and central bank chief , will be decided , though some may not be formalized and announced until the annual meeting of parliament in march .
- changing the party s constitution .
some sort of reference to xi and his theories will be included in the revised constitution - a further sign of his tightening grip on power .
- bolstering the anti-corruption and security systems .
a new national supervision commission , which would combine the roles of several party and government bodies that currently combat graft , will likely be set up .
- the national security commission , already headed by xi , could also get new powers , potentially making it more important than the central military commission , which runs the people s liberation army .
that would give the national security commission more power to tackle domestic and foreign threats .
the exact role of a more powerful commission is still unclear , including if it will have overall command of both the military and the domestic security forces .
- whether xi will anoint a successor .
xi s rise to the top was confirmed at the 2007 congress , when he first joined the standing committee and then became vice president the following year .
any successor would have to join the standing committee at this congress and be young enough to serve at least three five-year terms .
if there is no obvious successor , it will increase speculation that xi could stay on in power after 2022 , when the next congress occurs , and when xi should , according to precedent and age limits , step down after two terms in office .
- whether xi reaffirms 2013 reform pledges to let market forces play a decisive role in the economy , a catchphrase rarely mentioned now .
signals on new reform initiatives will be important , especially concerning state-owned enterprises , the fiscal system , property taxes and land rights .
also important is if there are any fresh measures to tackle industrial overcapacity and debt issues .
any fresh measures to tackle overcapacity and debt issues .
- any hints on policy priorities for the next five years , both monetary and fiscal , though analysts don t expect the congress to unveil any major policy changes .
economic and policy agendas for 2018 will be set at the annual economic work conference later this year .
- new expressions on the economy and reforms , following xi s use of the terms new normal to describe the more moderate pace of economic growth , and supply-side structural reform .
- how the punishing war on pollution is affecting china s business and government leaders as they prepare for a tough winter campaign aimed at meeting politically sensitive smog reduction targets .
fighting pollution is now a key criterion on which the performance of officials will be judged .
