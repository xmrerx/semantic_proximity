sao paulo ( reuters ) - cesar mata pires , the owner and co-founder of brazilian engineering conglomerate oas sa , one of the largest companies involved in brazil s corruption scandal , died on tuesday .
he was 68 .
mata pires died of a heart attack while taking a morning walk in an upscale district of s o paulo , where oas is based , a person with direct knowledge of the matter said .
efforts to contact his family were unsuccessful .
oas declined to comment .
the son of a wealthy cattle rancher in the northeastern state of bahia , mata pires links to politicians were central to the expansion of oas , which became brazil s no .
4 builder earlier this decade , people familiar with his career told reuters last year .
his big break came when he befriended antonio carlos magalh es , a popular politician who was bahia governor several times , and eventually married his daughter tereza .
brazilians joked that oas stood for obras arranjadas pelo sogro - or work arranged by the father-in-law .
after years of steady growth triggered by a flurry of massive government contracts , oas was ensnared in operation car wash which unearthed an illegal contracting ring between state firms and builders .
the ensuing scandal helped topple former brazilian president dilma rousseff last year .
trained as an engineer , mata pires founded oas with two colleagues in 1976 to do sub-contracting work for larger rival odebrecht sa - the biggest of the builders involved in the probe .
before the scandal , forbes magazine estimated mata pires fortune at $ 1.6 billion .
he dropped off the magazine s billionaire list in 2015 , months after oas sought bankruptcy protection after the car wash scandal .
while mata pires was never accused of wrongdoing in the investigations , creditors demanded he and his family stay away from the builder s day-to-day operations , people directly involved in the negotiations told reuters at the time .
he is survived by his wife and his two sons .
