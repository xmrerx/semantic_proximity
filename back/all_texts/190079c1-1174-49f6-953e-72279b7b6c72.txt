WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said on Thursday he expected to have legislation to replace, as well as repeal, the Affordable Care Act this year.
“Our legislating will occur this year,” Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said at a news briefing.
“What date all of this gets phased in on is something we do not now know,” partly because the administration is not in office yet.
