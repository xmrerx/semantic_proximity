Fox News host Megyn Kelly shut down a liberal guest in a blistering Thursday night exchange about President Barack Obama s silence on the senseless killing of Kate Steinle at a San Francisco tourist area.Kelly observed that the president was only too willing to speak out on the Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown and Freddie Gray killings, but was noticeably silent on Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who d been deported five times and had seven felony convictions.
When asked repeatedly this week to speak to this case, White House spokesman Josh Earnest declined to weigh in, other than to refer folks to the Department of Homeland Security, Kelly said.
A stark contrast to what we saw after Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson [Missouri], a man we now know was attacking a police officer at the time of his death.
Liberal talk show host Richard Fowler made the ridiculous claim that the woman would be alive today if Congress had passed immigration reform legislation.
Stop that!
Stop that!
Stop that!
Answer my question please, Kelly said.
Give an answer!
You can t!
There s no excuse for it!
He picks and chooses the victims he wants to highlight.
And apparently, this victim wasn t deemed worthy.
When political consultant Marc Thiessen asked Fowler to explain his statement that Obama doesn t support sanctuary cities for illegal immigrants, Fowler veered off into left field and again brought up lack of immigration reform, placing the blame on Republican lawmakers for not acting on immigration reform.
That s a dodge!
Support what you just said, Richard!
Kelly shot back.
Stop it You keep making these assertions and then you dance off to the sidelines.
You said the president doesn t support sanctuary city policies.
What do you base that on?
I base it on the fact that if we had comprehensive immigration reform there would be no need for sanctuary cities, Fowler repeated.
And I m pretty sure the White House would tell you the same thing tonight.
