washington ( reuters ) - tentative plans for u.s. secretary of state john kerry to visit cuba before mid-march for a human rights dialogue have been canceled , two u.s. officials said on thursday , amid concerns over the cuban government ’ s human rights record .
kerry told a congressional hearing on feb. 23 that he might be in cuba “ in the next week or two ” to hold a dialogue on human rights , ahead of president barack obama ’ s scheduled trip to the island on march 21-22 .
the sources said the trip had been canceled because u.s. and cuban officials were deep in negotiations on issues including which dissidents obama might see in havana and that a trip in the timeframe kerry had mentioned was not seen as constructive .
state department spokesman john kirby said he had no updates regarding kerry ’ s potential travel to cuba .
“ the secretary is still interested in visiting in the near future , and we are working with our cuban counterparts and our embassy to determine the best timeframe , ” kirby said in an emailed statement .
u.s. critics of obama ’ s opening to cuba have complained that the president has received little in return for restoring diplomatic relations with the former cold war foe .
on feb. 24 , the cuban government granted seven dissidents who were out of prison on parole a one-time permission to travel outside the country in an apparent gesture to the united states ahead of obama ’ s historic visit .
