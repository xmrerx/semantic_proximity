Fox News host Bill Hemmer asked Congressman Michael McCaul (R-TX), If she wins next Tuesday, what happens to that investigation?
McCaul: Well that s something I ve been talking about that hasn t been mentioned very much, and that is, this investigation will continue whether she wins or not.
But assuming she wins, and the investigation goes forward, and it looks an indictment is pending, at that point and time under the Constitution, the House of Representatives would engage in an impeachment trial, they would go to the Senate and impeachment proceedings and removal would take place https://twitter.com/TEN_GOP/status/793918006359298048
