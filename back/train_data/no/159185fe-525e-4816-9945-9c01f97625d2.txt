mexico city ( reuters ) - mexico s congress on friday approved a law that enshrines the use of the army in the country s long war against drug cartels , overriding protests from the united nations rights body and activists who fear it will encourage abuses by the military .
the ruling institutional revolutionary party and some members of the center-right opposition national action party backed the bill , which now will head to president enrique pena nieto s desk to be signed into law .
known as the law of internal security , the bill establishes rules for the military s role in battling drug gangs , a conflict that has claimed well over 100,000 lives in the last decade .
the military has been mired in several human rights scandals , including extra-judicial killings of suspected gang members and the 2014 disappearance of 43 students near an army base .
supporters of the legislation say it will set out clear rules that limit the use of soldiers to fight crime .
rights groups are not convinced , saying the bill empowers security forces instead of improving the police and could usher in greater abuses and impunity .
the united nations , amnesty international and mexican human rights organizations all lobbied lawmakers not to pass the bill .
