On Sunday, Donald Trump called for his Republican presidential primary rival, John Kasich, to drop out of the race.
He s taking my votes, Trump said.
Well, Trump, that s not how any of this democracy thing we have works but okay.Trump lamented the fact that Kasich has not dropped out of the race, claiming that Kasich is taking more votes away from (referring to himself in the third person) Trump than Cruz.
All he s doing is just, he goes from place to place and loses, and he keeps running.
Well, why doesn t Marco Rubio do that?
Why doesn t Jeb Bush do that?
Why didn t all of them do that?
Now if he wants to go and have his name put in nomination in the convention, he can do that.
He doesn t have to run and take my votes.
Now, not to second guess Trump s clearly well-researched analysis, I highly doubt that people who plan on voting for Kasich are going to flock to Trump over Cruz.
Or even that they would even bother voting for either of the two candidates.
Kasich, while not nearly as moderate as he would like people to think he is, is the choice candidate for those Republican voters who want the GOP to retain some shred of dignity.While Kasich is far behind in the primary race, his continued run does pose a threat to Trump s campaign.
The RNC s only hope at this point to prevent a Trump nomination is a contested convention.
Even if Trump receives the most amount of delegates, if he does not receive a majority of delegates, Republicans can deny him a nomination.Every delegate that Cruz and Kasich soak up puts Trump further away from having a majority of delegates.You can watch Trump cry about Kasich s campaign below:Featured Image from (Photo by Scott Olson/Getty Images)
