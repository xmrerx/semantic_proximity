berlin ( reuters ) - environmental policy dominated negotiations on forming a new german coalition on monday , as the greens pushed their would-be partners for a quicker exit from coal power .
chancellor angela merkel s conservatives , who lost seats in last month s election , hope a deal with the pro-business free democrats ( fdp ) and the greens will keep her in office , but the unlikely partners are far apart on a host of issues .
merkel urged party leaders at the weekend to show more willingness to compromise after three weeks of exploratory talks also failed to paper over differences on transport , immigration and euro zone governance .
what s lying on the table isn t enough for us , said greens chairwoman simone peter in response to a suggestion by the two other camps that 10 coal-fired power stations be shuttered .
the greens are holding out for carbon dioxide emissions cuts that would require the closing of 20 coal plants .
earlier , a discussion paper seen by reuters showed that the two more pro-business partners wanted to cut coal power by 3-5 gigawatts by 2020 .
the ecologists wanted an 8-10 gigawatt cut .
peter told reporters that the greens disagreed on the size of cuts in carbon dioxide emissions that were needed by 2020 .
the conservatives and the fdp believed cuts of up to 66 million tonnes were needed by 2020 , while the greens believed cuts of up to 120 million could be needed .
