Charles Payne and economist Liz Peek discuss the booming Trump economy and why the hateful media won t report on it: Payne: These are blue collar jobs maybe that s not sexy to the main stream media.Peek: How many of those economists are talking about how the market is up 13%?Payne is so correct about the media s lack of interest in the booming Trump economy.
The American people see it and are feeling it too.
As long as President Trump keeps his focus and continues improving the economy, he ll be great.
