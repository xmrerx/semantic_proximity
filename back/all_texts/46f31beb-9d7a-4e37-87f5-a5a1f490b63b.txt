When Ken Nwadike, founder of Free Hugs Project, attended both a Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders rally in order to offer free hugs to attendees he inadvertently summed up the core difference between the two.In an effort to make America love again, Nwadike provided his free hugs at the Wisconsin rallies of both candidates.
At the Trump rally, his offers were met with hostility, flagrant racism, and even threats of physical violence.One woman shouts at him: White is better!
A man tells him: I don t want any drugs as if that could be the only thing on offer from a young black man in America.When one man tells Nwadike he hates him, Nwadike responds that the feeling is not mutual explaining that he has love in his heart for all people, even those who don t agree with him.
The man responds: First of all there is no love in this world.
Really?
You have to wonder how he feels about his parents, his friends, his community no love?
Really?Another woman yells: Are you for Trump?
I will punch you if you are not!
She pulls her arm back and balls her fist, in preparation to launch a genuine punch.The whole scene is very scared, very angry, very hateful people unwilling and unable to engage with affection, compassion, and understanding.
Whipped into a despairing, disgusting mob by their candidate.
It is sad, and hopeless.Things looks quite different at the Bernie Sanders rally.
Nwadike can barely keep up with the demand for hugs.
Men and women, boys and girls, all fly at him enthusiastically, keen to reach out and accept the love and affection of another human being.
The attendees are visibly much more racially diverse, open, communicative and frankly, happy.
The mood is joyful, hopeful, and there are smiles and welcomes going around like wildfire.The video serves as a window into two Americas:Featured image via screencapture
