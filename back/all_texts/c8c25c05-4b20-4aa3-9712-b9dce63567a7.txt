Late Show host Stephen Colbert is no fan of Donald Trump and his administration of bigots.
Therefore, he was, of course, incensed at Attorney General Jeff Sessions racist attack on a sitting federal judge regarding Trump s bigoted Muslim Ban.Judge Derrick Watson infamously blocked Trump s Muslim Ban 2.0, and in the decision he said the whole thing read like a neon sign flashing Muslim ban, Muslim ban.
On Thursday, Sessions went full dog whistle when he criticized Judge Watson s decision, saying the following: We are confident that the president will prevail on appeal and particularly in the Supreme Court, if not the Ninth Circuit.
So this is a huge matter.
I really am amazed that a judge sitting on an island in the Pacific can issue an order that stops the president of the United States from what appears to be clearly his statutory and Constitutional power.
Of course, that brings back the fact that accusations of racism have dogged Sessions for decades, and rightly so.
He is a throwback to a time we really should be trying to get away from, and here he is, the nation s top law enforcement officer.
Shameful, but true.
Therefore, Stephen Colbert s tweet on the matter is more than fitting:Sessions is "amazed" an "island in the Pacific" judge can block the travel ban.
Just like how I'm "bewildered" a "racist elf" can be AG.
Stephen Colbert (@StephenAtHome) April 21, 2017That is exactly what Jeff Sessions is a stone cold racist.
A stone cold racist who is now in charge of the civil liberties of the citizens of the United States of America.
You really can t make this stuff up.Thank you for telling it like it is, Mr. Colbert.
Goodness knows, we need more voices like yours.Featured image via Zach Gibson/Getty Images
