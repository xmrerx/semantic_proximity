During an interview on CBS s Face the Nation Sunday morning, President Obama lambasted Donald Trump for his recent comments regarding defending the United States NATO allies.
He saw the comment as being indicative of the Republican presidential candidate of not having enough foreign policy experience.
You know for Mr. Trump, who has in the past suggested that America s weak and not looking out for its allies, to then maybe not have enough information or understanding to go out and say that America might not stand by its solemn commitment to protect those same allies who stood with us after 9/11 when we were attacked I think is an indication of the lack of preparedness that he has been displaying when it comes to foreign policy, Obama said.President Obama went on to say that Muslim Americans are willing to assist in the fight against the Islamic State.
He condemned Trump and others who have used hateful rhetoric against Muslims here at home and abroad.
But that requires leaders, political leaders, religious leaders, business leaders, all of us to send a very clear signal that we are not going to be divided in that fashion, Obama went on to say.
And I think the kinds of rhetoric that we ve heard too often, from Mr. Trump and others, is ultimately helping do I.S.I.L.
s work.
President Obama is absolutely correct.
Trump s rhetoric is hurting the United States and our allies.
He is too dangerous, xenophobic, and unpredictable to be allowed to have any type of power over the nation s military.You can watch the interview in full.Featured image via video screen capture
