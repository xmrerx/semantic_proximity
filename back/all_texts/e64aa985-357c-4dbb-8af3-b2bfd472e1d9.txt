It s not clear whether Donald Trump s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway thought she could go on The View and think she could get away with lying, but that definitely seemed to be what happened Thursday morning.While Trump still hasn t had the courage to appear on the morning talk show himself, Conway took the plunge and surrounded herself with five very opinionated ladies who haven t ever been known to hold back.Conway tried to sell the same tired lines she s been selling to cable news outlets all over the place, but the ladies weren t having it.
Not.
One.
Bit.At one point, Whoopi Goldberg asked point blank: Where are his damn tax returns?!
And when Conway tried to pathetically pivot, Goldberg didn t let up, saying: What is Donald Trump hiding by not releasing that information?
I want to know since every other president has had to do it, where are the tax returns?
Then after more lies about Trump being audited, etc.
Goldberg bluntly interrupts the poppycock and says: It s bull!
And it is.This went on for a little longer, but Conway was left utterly steamrolled by the end of the interview, and deservedly so.
She s representing one of the most unqualified and smarmy scam artists this country has ever seen and has no right to even think about becoming president.
Yet, somehow, there he is, the smug orange ass and his band of merry morons.Watch it all unfold here:[ad3media campaign= 975 ]Featured image via video screen capture
