if there s one thing about donald trump that isn t presidential ( aside from literally everything ) it s the people he has selected for top-level positions a raging anti-semite and racist as white house chief strategist , a man who was too racist to be a judge for us attorney , and a guy who actually got caught holding plans for a national registry of muslim immigrants in his hands during a photo-op with the donald for homeland security secretary , for example.that a minority of americans was able to elect someone like trump is embarrassing enough but the people he is appointing to high-level roles makes us a laughingstock .
recently , legendary actor john cleese was watching it all unfold on american television and noticed that it looks as though trump is assembling the crew for a pirate ship rather than people who will lead the united states.watching us tv today reminded me of my remark on conan o'brien .

christian mcintire ( @ xtianmcintire ) november 18 , 2016 @ johncleese more diversity on a pirate ship , methinks .
deborah m. budd ( @ deb_budd_sw ) november 18 , 2016as trump s children scramble to cash in on his presidency and the donald himself has already openly used his position for his own benefit , one must wonder if cleese is more right than he realizes .
in any case , we can surely expect conservatives to boycott cleese s current stage show by ( if starbucks is an indicator ) buying as many tickets as they can and writing trump on them.featured image via getty images ( clemens bilan/drew angerer ) /screengrab
