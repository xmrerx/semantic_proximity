lima ( reuters ) - indigenous villagers ended a 43-day protest that had halted production in peru s largest oil block after signing a deal with the government , tribal leaders and officials said on tuesday .
as part of the agreement , the government of president pedro pablo kuczynski promised to apply an indigenous rights law before awarding any new , long-term oil drilling contract for block 192 a chief demand of protesters , the energy and mines ministry said in a statement .
canadian frontera energy corp operates block 192 under a two-year contract but has not produced any oil from it since achuar , quechua and kichwa indigenous tribes seized oil wells on sept. 18 .
protesters wanted the government to clean up oil pollution in the region and to commit to including tribes in talks on long-term oil drilling plans .
the blockade was one of scores of conflicts that sometimes disrupt mining and energy operations in peru , the world s second biggest copper producer and a relatively small oil producer .
talks between the government and frontera over a long-term drilling contract ended with no deal , state-owned oil company petroperu announced earlier this month .
aurelio chino , a chieftain in the pastaza river basin , told reuters that protesters were no longer occupying company installations .
a statement by the leaders of 16 villages that took part in the protests said the protest would end .
the government also promised villagers that it would start implementation of an emergency healthcare program in the next 10 days and would form a commission to direct environmental clean-ups in block 192 , the ministry said .
frontera will be summoned to take part in dialogue sessions with villagers to discuss their needs , it added .
frontera has said that the protest did not have a not a material impact for the company .
