If you listen to Donald Trump at any of his many rallies, you d think he made all of the products within his many, many product lines here in the good old U.S. of A.
However, facts and reality tell a different story from the one currently pouring out of the orifice on the front of his face.As it turns out, Trump likes to save a few bucks himself and ship his manufacturing needs overseas.
This, of course, killing jobs in the United States, but boosting jobs overseas.
So, he s not lying when he says he ll put people to work, because he s been doing it in China, Peru, Bangladesh, etc.
for years now.
Too bad those jobs aren t here at home.Noticing the hypocrisy spewing out of Trump s mouth at nearly all of his rallies is none other than the Hillary Clinton campaign.
They just put together a brilliant new ad that hilariously shows some Clinton staffers going and buying some Trump merchandise, because they re sure all of it must be made in America.
However, it seems as if none of it was actually made in the U.S.A. as Trump likes to boast that s where goods should be made.If only he practiced what he preached.Watch the brilliantly hilarious attack ad here:So @jess_mc & @Zac_Petkanas went to Trump Tower, bought Trump swag & talked to voters about where it was made.
Gold.
