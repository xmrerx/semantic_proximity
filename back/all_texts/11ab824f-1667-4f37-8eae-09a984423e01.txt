HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s information minister said on Tuesday he did not know whether ministers would attend a cabinet meeting called by President Robert Mugabe at his State House offices, the first since a military takeover last week.
I do not know whether anyone will attend, SK Moyo told Reuters hours before parliament was due to sit to start proceedings to impeach the 93-year-old leader.
Cabinet meetings normally start at 0730 GMT.
