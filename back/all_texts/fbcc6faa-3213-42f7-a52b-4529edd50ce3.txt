HERE S THE SCOOP ON WHAT HAPPENED IN DECEMBER: Ivanka Trump just had a bumpy start to her Xmas holiday an out-of-control passenger on her flight began verbally berating her and jeering at her 3 kids.Ivanka was on a JetBlue flight leaving JFK Thursday morning with her family when a passenger started screaming, Your father is ruining the country.
The guy went on, Why is she on our flight?
She should be flying private.
The guy had his kid in his arms as he went on the tirade.
Ivanka ignored the guy and tried distracting her kids with crayons.
JetBlue personnel escorted the unruly passenger off the flight.
As he was removed he screamed, You re kicking me off for expressing my opinion?!
EXCEPT THE OBNOXIOUS PASSENGER TWEETED AN HOUR EARLIER THAT HE WAS HARASSING IVANKA TRUMP:The husband of the unruly passenger tweeted an hour before the plane took off, Ivanka and Jared at JFK T5, flying commercial.
My husband chasing them down to harass them.
:!BTW Ivanka, her family and bunch of cousins were all in coach.JetBlue later released a statement, saying, The decision to remove a customer from a flight is not taken lightly.
If the crew determines that a customer is causing conflict on the aircraft, the customer will be asked to deplane, especially if the crew feels the situation runs the risk of escalation during flight.
Our team worked to re-accommodate the party on the next available flight.
A passenger sitting in front of Trump entourage made it clear that he felt the flight crew made the right call.
He said the irritated passenger could be seen visibly shaking.
the secret service was on the plane but stayed out of the disturbance.The intolerant left proved yet again that they are unhinged losers!
