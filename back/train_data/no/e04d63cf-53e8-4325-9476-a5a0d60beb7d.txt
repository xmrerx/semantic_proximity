yet another reason not to vote for this disaster of a secretary of state ! state department spokesman john kirby said in a press conference on friday that libya has struggled since 2011 , when then-secretary of state hillary clinton led the charge for u.s. military intervention in the libyan civil war .
after the intervention in 2011 i think we ve all seen that libya has struggled since 2011 , kirby said .
he pointed to the power vacuum that dictator muammar gaddafi s ouster created as a source of instability , and said that since 2011 , violent groups like the islamic state have filled that vacuum .
we know that groups like isil try to use ungoverned spaces there , as they have in syria , to try to propagate their own twisted form of ideology and violence , he said.kirby said that the international community is laboring to recover the security situation in libya .
there is a concerted effort by the international community to do what they can , to do what we must , to try to get at better security and stability there in libya , he said .
