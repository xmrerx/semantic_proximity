So the moderator of the Democratic debate met with the campaigns of the candidates but didn t give away any questions?
Really?
And we re supposed to believe this?
A pre-interview took place to discuss the issues at play in the race .
Isn t that giving the questions away?I d call that a strategy session because we shouldn t forget that Ben Rhodes and David Rhodes are brothers This Saturday s second Democratic debate will be a much smaller affair than the first.
With only three candidates on stage, CBS News plans to delve deep into the issues with each candidate and have taken advantage of the smaller pool by doing some intense research.
Moderator John Dickerson and his team met with each of the campaigns for more than an hour to discuss the major issues at play in the race, sources on the campaigns said, describing the pre-interview as informational in nature.
Dickerson is not giving candidates previews of his questions for the debate.
Prior to the CNN debate, the campaigns said moderator Anderson Cooper did not reach out directly to them before the candidates took the stage.
Dickerson and his team were very interested in getting to better know the senator s stand on a wide spectrum of issues, what he would do about income inequality in this country, said Bernie Sanders spokesman Michael Briggs.
He said they discussed issues where there are real differences between the candidates including gun control, the death penalty and raising taxes on the middle class.
John Dickerson s a smart, impressive guy who cares a lot about the issues, Briggs said.
I m sure we ll see a smart, issues-oriented debate.
