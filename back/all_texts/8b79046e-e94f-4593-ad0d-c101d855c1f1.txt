Donald Trump threw another temper tantrum on Twitter as the investigation closes in on him.You know that the investigation must be getting closer to nailing Trump to the wall by how he is acting right now.Over the last few days, Trump has been trying to blame his crimes on President Obama and Hillary Clinton while simultaneously insisting that no crimes were committed.
Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn t?
It s all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2017Since the Obama Administration was told way before the 2016 Election that the Russians were meddling, why no action?
Focus on them, not T!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2017Hillary Clinton colluded with the Democratic Party in order to beat Crazy Bernie Sanders.
Is she allowed to so collude?
Unfair to Bernie!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2017It has been a hilarious circular firing squad that Trump can t seem to stop stepping in the middle of, which is exactly the reason why top law firms in this nation want nothing to do with him.And on Tuesday morning, Trump threw another hissy fit and accused President Obama of colluding with Russia.You heard that right.
Trump just accused President Obama of committing treason against the United States and then he claimed that no collusion exists.
Trump then demanded an apology.The reason that President Obama did NOTHING about Russia after being notified by the CIA of meddling is that he expected Clinton would win.. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017 and did not want to rock the boat.
He didn t choke, he colluded or obstructed, and it did the Dems and Crooked Hillary no good.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017The real story is that President Obama did NOTHING after being informed in August about Russian meddling.
With 4 months looking at Russia Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017..under a magnifying glass, they have zero tapes of T people colluding.
There is no collusion & no obstruction.
I should be given apology!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 26, 2017These are the rantings and ravings of a desperate man who knows that his time as president and a free man is running out.
The reason why President Obama could not act at the time is because Trump was claiming that the election was rigged.
Any move Obama made to stop Russia would have drawn cries of election rigging by Trump, especially had he lost due to Russia being stopped.
Also, the extent of the meddling was still under investigation and Obama still retaliated by slapping sanctions against Russia prior to leaving office, the very same sanctions Trump is trying to remove.By accusing President Obama of treason, Trump has crossed yet another line, demonstrating once and for all that he is unfit to hold office and should be impeached.Featured Image: David Becker/Getty Images
