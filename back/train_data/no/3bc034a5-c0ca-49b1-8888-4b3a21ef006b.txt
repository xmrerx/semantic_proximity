hunger strikes for the oppressed seem to be all the rage , both at home and abroad the refugee crisis has many faces .
alongside the urgent need of many , there are also some who believe they can exploit this culture of welcoming to make shameless demands , said christian ragger who represents the carinthia branch of the freedom party of austria in the regional parliament.he is making reference to events currently underway in st. kanzian .
on tuesday 20 asylum seekers went on hunger strike because they were given residency permits , as the law provides for , and not passports , and because they are not receiving 2000 euros of pocket money each month.the most bizarre thing is that these striking asylum seekers also want to hold a press conference .
they apparently assume that related reports in the media will ensure their demands are met .
