The intimidation tactics of Mueller s FBI are way off base according to reports that claim Mrs. Manafort was manhandled :Just how rough special counsel Robert Mueller is playing with Paul Manafort goes back before this week s indictment to the FBI s no-knock raid in July.It has been reported that the agents checked Mr. Manafort and wife Kathleen for guns as they broke into the Alexandria condo pre-dawn by picking the lock.A source familiar with the case told The Washington Times the search was even more intrusive: An agent patted down Mrs. Manafort before she was allowed to get out of bed.
Agents felt up Mrs. Manafort lying in bed to see if she had guns, the source said of the intimidation.In all, 12 FBI agents entered the home, guns drawn, and stayed for hours.The aggressive search of a prone sleepy woman is, the source said, a hallmark of Mr. Mueller s top prosecutor, Andrew Weissmann.
A former mob prosecutor in New York, he specializes in turning witnesses against bigger prey and is not afraid to make things rough for spouses, too.
Weissmann will want to maximize the trauma to his family, said Sidney Powell, a Dallas appeals attorney critical of his tactics.A spokesman for the special counsel s office declined to comment.Via: WT
