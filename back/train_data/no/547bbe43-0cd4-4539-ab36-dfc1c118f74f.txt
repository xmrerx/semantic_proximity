rome ( reuters ) - italy s highest court on friday upheld a four-year jail sentence on the former chairman of generali cesare geronzi for his role in the 2003 bankruptcy of food company cirio .
the decision , by the rome-based court of cassation , is final and can not be appealed .
however , three of the four years will be wiped out under a national amnesty and geronzi , a symbol of old-style italian capitalism , will not actually serve any jail time because of his age , 82 .
in april 2015 an appeals court had handed geronzi a four- year prison sentence for bankruptcy , confirming the previous sentence in a long court battle that started in 2003 .
geronzi s lawyers over the years have argued that he had no specific powers over cirio at the time of its bankruptcy , when he was at the helm of lender capitalia , and that he had acted correctly .
the rome court of cassation also ordered on friday a new trial for cirio s ex-chief , sergio cragnotti , who was handed a sentence of eight years and eight months in 2015 .
