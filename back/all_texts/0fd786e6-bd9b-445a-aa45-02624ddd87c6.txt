Veteran newscaster Tom Brokaw called out political hack Andrea Mitchell on her ridiculous Comey narrative.
He said, deal with facts in to Mitchell in an effort to snap her back into reality.
Her judgement is so clouded by her hate for all things Trump that she can t see that Comey needed to be fired ASAP.
Brokaw even said he didn t know anyone who thought Comey was doing a good job!
Brokaw is a left-leaning journalist so his judgement isn t clouded with a pro-Trump agenda:Tom Brokaw: One of the things that I learned during Watergate is that we dealt with it every day on a factual basis.
There was not a lot of speculation.
Now, of course, the media landscape has changed a lot, and we have that going on 24/7.
I do think, however, that all of us as reporters have to take a deep breath and say let s deal with the facts as we know them at this point.
Our obligation I think is to sort it out, truth from fact, and deal with the truth.
Amen!
Thank you Mr. Brokaw!
