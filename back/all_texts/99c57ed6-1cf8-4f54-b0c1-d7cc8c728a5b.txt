If Donald Trump keeps tweeting about the NYC terrorist like this he will prevent justice from being served.Earlier this week, a terrorist killed eight people using a vehicle.
Police captured him alive.
So now we not only can get information that could be vital, we can try him in a court of law and get justice for the victims and their families.But justice won t happen if a fair trial cannot be had.And that s why Trump needs to stop tweeting about it right now.On Wednesday night, Trump seriously damaged the suspect s ability to get a fair trial by calling for him to receive the death penalty.NYC terrorist was happy as he asked to hang ISIS flag in his hospital room.
He killed 8 people, badly injured 12.
SHOULD GET DEATH PENALTY!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2017Trump opened his big mouth again on Thursday morning, spouting about how he wants to send the suspect to Guantanamo Bay prison.
However, such a move is illegal because the suspect holds a green cardWould love to send the NYC terrorist to Guantanamo but statistically that process takes much longer than going through the Federal system Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2017 There is also something appropriate about keeping him in the home of the horrible crime he committed.
Should move fast.
DEATH PENALTY!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 2, 2017Also, there are no such statistics that Trump is referring to.
So not only is he making it impossible for the suspect to receive a fair trail, he is demonstrating his complete ignorance of the justice system.Featured Image: Alex Wong/Getty Images
