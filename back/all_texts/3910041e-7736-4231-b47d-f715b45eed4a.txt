Trump can t pick good people to save his life.
He s got a paranoid lunatic for the National Security Council, he s got a white supremacist as his chief strategist, and the list goes on.
One of his picks for an ambassadorship is David Friedman for Israel.
This isn t just someone who supports the worst of Israel, he also made a bizarre attack on The New York Times over their coverage of Trump s pussy grabbing comment by invoking the Holocaust.Seriously, he did that.
Back in October, not too long after the Access Hollywood tape came out, Friedman said: While the revelation of Mr. Trump s demeaning comments caught on tape some 11 years ago brought him, as one would expect, widespread negative attention, The New York Times ran with the story with all the journalistic integrity of the worst gossip rag.
If only the Times had reported on the Nazi death camps with the same fervor as its failed last-minute attempt to conjure up alleged victims of Donald Trump, imagine how many lives could have been saved.
As Peter Beinart wrote in a column for Haaretz, where he published several of Friedman s idiotic comments, Invoking the murder of six million Jews in an effort to discredit women who accuse a powerful man of sexual assault is wrong.
FLAT wrong.There really is no way to describe this as anything other than disgusting and absurd.
Beinart also pointed out that the Times coverage of these accusations has nothing whatever to do with how they covered the Holocaust.
It also has nothing to do with the times that we live in the Holocaust was 75 years ago.
Press coverage of anything was very different than it is today, in the age of the Internet.Friedman is probably one of the worst people imaginable to nominate for any high-level position in our government.
But that s how Trump rolls, and if Congress decides they like him for whatever reason, then he ll become our new ambassador to Israel, despite being a complete moron.Featured image by Brian Blanco via Getty Images
