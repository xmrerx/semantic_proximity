21st Century Wire says The military industrial complex has been a huge winner under Obama.Watch a video of this report here:The US is in control of over half of the world s arms industry, with Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Australia, Iraq, and Israel as its five biggest customers.The second largest arms exporter is Russia, but they only hold a 14% share of the global market.The industry has benefitted immensely from the administration of Nobel Peace Prize Winner Obama, as around $200 billion worth of deals have been signed during his tenure in the Whitehouse.The deals have sent Apache attack helicopters to Qatar, cluster munitions and bunker busters to Saudi Arabia, and Hellfire Missiles to countries all over the world.The Obama administration succumbed to a $170 million lobbying campaign by the arms industry to relax arms export controls in 2013, and is now looking to relax restrictions on exports to Vietnam and even Libya.Yes, the same Libya that the US, along with its NATO allies, turned into a failed state just a few short years ago.An arms industry executive, speaking to Reuters, even openly admits that the rise of ISIS has been great for business: Everyone in the region is talking about building up supplies for five to ten years.
This is going to be a long fight.
It s a huge growth area for us.
We might, perhaps, understand this as a legitimate phenomenon, if it was not for the fact that it was the US who created and supported the terrorist group, initially under the guise of moderate rebels , throughout Syria.This is just more proof that the military industrial complex is the only winner to emerge from increased global conflict.How might foreign policy decisions be different if they were not influenced by the arms industry?THE RISE OF THE ARMS INDUSTRY: 21st Century Wire Military Industrial Complex Files
