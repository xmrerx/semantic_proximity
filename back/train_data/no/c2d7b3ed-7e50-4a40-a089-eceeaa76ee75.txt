harare ( reuters ) - a u.s. citizen accused of attempting to subvert president robert mugabe s government was released from zimbabwe s maximum security jail on friday , a day after the high court ordered her to be freed on bail , reuters witnesses said .
judge clement phiri ruled on thursday that there was a patent absence of facts in the state s case against 25-year-old martha o donovan , whose arrest last week centered on accusations she insulted 93-year-old mugabe in a twitter post .
she denies the accusation .
reuters witnesses saw o donovan leaving prison in a united states embassy vehicle .
o donovan and her lawyers did not speak to reporters waiting outside chikurubi maximum prison on the outskirts of harare .
state prosecutors accuse o donovan of writing a twitter post in october calling mugabe a selfish and sick man .
the government has since last year been targeting activists and government critics who use social media to speak out against mugabe , cash shortages in banks and a foreign currency crunch that has caused a sharp rise in prices .
amnesty international said it feared o donovan would not be the last to be arrested in the government s clamp down on social media platforms .
activist pastor evan mawarire , whose # thisflag movement last year organized the biggest stay-at-home demonstration in a decade , is on trial on a charge of subversion .
he faces a separate trial for a similar offence .
