Minnesota governor Mark Dayton believes that Philando Castile was killed because he was a black man.
The governor made his point of view crystal clear in public statements given on Thursday.
Would this have happened if those passengers, the driver were white?
he asked.
I don t think it would have.
Dayton said he has spoken with Minnesota s senators, Amy Klobuchar and Al Franken, and the area s House representatives and would be demanding a Justice Department investigation.
I can t say how shocked I am and deeply, deeply offended that this would happen to somebody in Minnesota, Dayton said grimly.
