A bodyguard to a much-reviled white supremacist picked a fight outside a Trump rally and was stabbed nine times as a result.
Now he needs medical treatment and (despite working as a bodyguard) doesn t have health insurance to help with the costs.Tony Foreman, bodyguard to notorious racist and rabid Trump fan, Baked Alaska (or Tim Gionet, if you prefer to use his real name), was stabbed by two men on Saturday after picking a fight with two men, Edgar Khodzhafaryan, and Arsen Bekverdyan, in the parking lot.According to Baked Alaska the bodyguard, a member of white wing extremist group the Oath Keepers, was attacked for being white in Los Angeles and because of his allegiance to The Donald.
The police, however, say the attack was not tied to race or political ideology but rather to the argument, which was not related to either.Interestingly, as Republicans work overtime to take healthcare away from millions of Americans like Mr. Foreman, his Nazi supporters are complaining that he lacks insurance.
They even set up a medical fund on fellow white supremacist Charles Johnson s crowdfunding site, which eats up about 25% of the money raised in fees (compared to GoFundMe s 8%).According to Santa Monica police spokesman Lt. Saul Rodriguez, the dispute began when the not-so-friendly white nationalist made a comment to the suspects which led to an argument.
Everyone got out of their vehicles and a fist fight began.
Ultimately, the bodyguard was stabbed.
Rodriguez says that there is nothing here that would lead us to believe it was targeted or a hate crime or anything like that no matter how much the alt-right screams that he was attacked for being a cracker.Nevertheless, the Nazi wing of American politics is quite sure that this happened because Foreman is white:Anti-Trump and anti-white violence is escalating in the United States of America.
From eggs, to fists, to bike locks, and now knives, everyday Trump supporters seem to be in real danger in their own country.It s unfortunate that he picked a fight and got himself stabbed, but the victim mentality on the Right needs to end.Featured image via screengrab
