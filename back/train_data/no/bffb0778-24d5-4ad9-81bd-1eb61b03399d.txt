thousands of students from berkeley high school walked out of class and flooded the uc berkeley campus wednesday morning in protest of tuesday night s general election victory for republican nominee donald trump.the outraged reaction to the announcement of trump s victory follows the chaotic scene earlier this morning , when a crowd of about 200 people comprising largely uc berkeley students marched from campus down telegraph avenue to oakland city hall.note the mexican flags : students planned to begin a different protest against trump beginning wednesday at noon , while activist group bamn also announced an emergency response protest later in the evening.students from bhs and uc berkeley swelling at the base of the campanile chanted , trump loves hate and not our president while a news helicopter circled overhead .
i m here because trump discriminates against many , many minorities , but if we can unite together , then we ll make a majority against him , which is what we need to do to survive this , said gigi mancuso-jackson , a bhs freshman at the protest.via : dailycal
