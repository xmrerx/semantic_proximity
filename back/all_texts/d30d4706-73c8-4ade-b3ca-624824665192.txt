While on the campaign trail for Hillary Clinton in Ohio, Vice President Joe Biden was talking about the dangers of a Donald Trump presidency and what that would do to the average citizen.However, while speaking, a protester started shouting at Biden about the Iraq War.
And while he could have simply ignored this protester or let the crowd drown him out with chants of Hillary!
Biden instead hushed the crowd to field his question.After Biden answered the question, the protester, still upset, let the vice president know that his friend had died.
This is when Biden says: So did my son.
It was a poignant moment and one that let the protester know that Biden understands what it s like to lose someone so close to you.
And in an additional gesture of empathy, Biden told the protester that if he s serious about asking questions in regard to Iraq and his friend, that he can come backstage and will answer his questions.This is why we love Joe Biden.
He s a man of the people.Watch the moment here:Video: Biden stumping for Clinton in OH when man protests over Iraq War: My friend died!
Biden: So did my son.
