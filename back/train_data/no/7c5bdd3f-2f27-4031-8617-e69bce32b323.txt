dhaka ( reuters ) - pope francis landed in bangladesh on thursday after a diplomatically sensitive trip to neighboring myanmar , where he made no direct reference to the plight of rohingya muslims who have fled to bangladesh in their hundreds of thousands .
bangladesh is hoping the thursday-saturday visit , during which the pope will meet a group of rohingya in dhaka , will help pressure the international community to find a lasting solution to the problem of the periodic influx of rohingya from buddhist-majority myanmar .
