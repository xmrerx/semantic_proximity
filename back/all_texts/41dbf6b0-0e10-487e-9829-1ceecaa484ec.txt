This past week the world has been hit with many newsworthy stories from the White House that all contain one common theme: Russia.
From Trump sharing classified information with Russian government diplomats to the fallout of the FBI Director James Comey firing over the investigation of Russian election interference, all signs point to Trump having deeper Russian ties than he would like to admit.A Dutch documentary was released this month by Zembla production company called The Dubious Friends of Donald Trump, that explores the history and connections the president has in Russia and to explain the facts behind the swirling allegations.The filmmakers highlight Russian mafia oligarchs while investigating the President s business partners, as well as his history with the country that started with his first Russian visit back in the 1980s.The film contains interviews with some of Trump s shady friends, fraud investigators, a former CIA agent, attorneys, and U.S. Senators.The filmmakers interview former U.S. intelligence officer Malcolm Nance who speaks about the President s aversion to any critical assessments of Russia: If you re a gambling addict and you owe someone a lot of money, you will never insult your bookie, Nance says.The focus of the documentary is on answering questions the world has about Trump s connection with Russia: Why does Trump deny his business connections with Russia and what do they say about him?
How compromising could these connections be?
