Proving once again that conservative Christianity is a religion of pure hate, a clerk in West Virginia decided it wasn t enough to process the marriage license of a newlywed lesbian couple, she also had to scream her anti-gay religious beliefs at them:Samantha Brookover and Amanda Abramovich went last week to get married, according to the Charleston Gazette-Mail.
The couple had loved ones and cameras in tow.The West Virginia couple said Debbie Allen, the deputy clerk who processed their marriage license, gave them a biblical earful.
They say Allen huffed and puffed, slammed things around then yelled at them for two or three minutes about her views that what they were doing was wrong in her eyes and God s.Allow me to be blunt for a second: No one, but no one, gives a flying fuck about your views Ms. Allen.
They are as abhorrent and ugly as your soul.
Period.
Got that?
Ok, let s move on.This is the lie at the heart of the right s demands for religious freedom.
They don t just want the freedom to practice their religion (which they already have), they want the freedom to impose their religion on everyone around them.
They literally feel persecuted because they can t persecute others without consequence.To see this in action, pay attention to what Allen says about her unwanted screed: I just told them my opinion, she told the paper.
I just felt led to do that.
I believe God was standing with me and that s just my religious belief.
When people start to pressure Gilmer County, where Allen is employed, to fire or rebuke the clerk in even the mildest fashion, she is going to squeal about Christian persecution and she ll be the next Fox News warrior in the fight to defend Christian values that aren t actually under assault.But at least she didn t try to deny them their marriage license, so that s a bit of progress, right?
