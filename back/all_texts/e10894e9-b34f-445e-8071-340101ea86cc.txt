The insane thing about Donald Trump s horrific attitude toward women is that every time he is asked to defend himself, he only ends up validating the claims that he s a misogynist.
His sexist, anti-woman views are so engrained in him that he honestly doesn t even know that he s proving everyone right and a post-debate encounter between the business mogul and a female journalist displayed this perfectly.Alexi McCammond is an associate news editor for Bustle, and was covering Monday night s presidential debate at Hofstra University.
While she was there, McCammond managed to get close to Trump and nab a very short, but very revealing interview with the Republican nominee himself.
As she got closer to The Donald, McCammond started filming with her cell phone, stuck her hand out and asked Trump, How would you respond to young women who are nervous about voting for you?
What happened next couldn t have been a better representation of how women will be treated under a Trump administration.
This is what McCammond described: Trump then looked at me, grabbed my right wrist (which was the hand holding the phone), said, Put that down, and pushed my hand down.
And luckily, there s video of that:When @realDonaldTrump grabs my wrist, tells me to put that down and pushes my phone away #Debates2016 pic.twitter.com/0puNWFfhwC Alexi McCammond (@leximccammond) September 27, 2016While McCammond made it clear that she wasn t hurt (physically or emotionally) by Trump s actions, this was definitely an important moment because even though Trump had tried not to answer her question, his actions certainly DID answer.McCammond posted this video on the night of the debate, but it is just now picking up steam hopefully, women everywhere (and the people who care about them) take this into consideration when they head to the polls in November.Featured image via Spencer Platt / Getty Images
