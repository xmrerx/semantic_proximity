berlin ( reuters ) - turkey summoned germany s ambassador to its foreign ministry on monday , berlin said , amid a mounting row between the two nato powers .
der spiegel magazine said ankara wanted to raise a german parliamentary motion last year that declared the 1915 massacre of armenians by ottoman forces a genocide - a description that turkey has long fiercely rejected .
there was no immediate comment from turkish authorities on the summons or the broader dispute , which has been exacerbated by the german parliamentary vote and berlin s criticism of ankara s rights record .
germany s foreign ministry said it was the 17th time its envoy martin erdmann had been summoned , underlining the divisions at a time when european powers are counting on turkey to help contain migrant flows , and to confront islamic state militants over its borders with iraq and syria .
germany has criticized mass arrests carried out in turkey since last year s failed coup against president tayyip erdogan and demanded the release of around a dozen german or turkish-german citizens arrested in recent months .
chancellor angela merkel , who is seeking re-election on sunday , has called for turkey s eu accession talks to be called off .
germany also says it is limiting arms sales to turkey .
turkey says germany has ignored ankara s requests for the extradition of suspects it believes are linked to the putsch and accused berlin of using nazi-like tactics by banning pro-erdogan rallies on german soil .
turkey , which says the killings of christian armenians during world war one do not amount to genocide , already recalled its ambassador to germany after parliament passed the resolution last year .
