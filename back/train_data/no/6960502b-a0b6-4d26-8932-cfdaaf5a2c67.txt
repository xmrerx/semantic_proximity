baghdad ( reuters ) - a russian islamic state fighter was sentenced to death by hanging in iraq on tuesday , authorities said , a rare conviction of a foreign militant on terrorism charges .
the unnamed man was captured after running out of ammunition in western mosul , a spokesman for iraq s supreme judicial council said in a statement .
the russian was a member of daesh operating in mosul since 2015 , he added , using an arabic acronym for the sunni muslim militant group .
thousands of foreigners have been fighting for islamic state in iraq and syria .
security and aid officials told reuters over the weekend that iraqi authorities were holding 1,400 foreign wives and children of suspected militants - most from turkey , others from former soviet states including tajikistan , azerbaijan and russia .
iraqi forces , backed by u.s.-led coalition allies and kurds , retook mosul in july following the group s occupation of the country s second largest city in 2014 .
the sunni militant group still controls territory in iraq and is expected to revert to more conventional insurgent tactics such as bombings as its self-proclaimed caliphate falls apart .
