baghdad ( reuters ) - the iraqi government plans to soon start paying the salaries of kurdish peshmerga fighters and civil servants working for the kurdistan regional government ( krg ) , iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi said on tuesday .
the semi-autonomous krg has been struggling to pay the peshmerga and its employees since 2014 , after baghdad stopped payments to it because of a dispute about oil-sharing revenue .
we will soon be able to pay all the salaries of the peshmerga and the employees of the region , abadi told reporters the cost of a three-year war on islamic state added to the kurdistan region s financial difficulties , and iraqi troops captured the oil region of kirkuk from the peshmerga two weeks ago , halving the krg s oil income .
paying kurdish salaries would help defuse tensions in the northern iraqi region , where a referendum vote in favor of kurdish independence in september triggered economic and military retaliation from the iraqi government .
the peshmerga had taken over the multi-ethnic region of kirkuk in 2014 , after the iraqi army collapsed in the face of islamic state , preventing the militants from controlling its oilfields .
