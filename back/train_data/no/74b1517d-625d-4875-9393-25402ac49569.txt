lagos ( reuters ) - britain is considering a request to sell military equipment to nigeria to help it fight boko haram islamist militants , foreign secretary boris johnson said on thursday .
british soldiers were already training nigerian 28,000 troops confronting the militants in the northeast , johnson told reuters in the commercial capital lagos .
they have put out a request for more help with materiel - equipment of one kind and another .
we are going to look at that , he said .
we will look at that very seriously on counter-ied provision , on a request for more help with attack helicopters , for instance .
let s have a look at what we can do , he added , without going into further detail .
boko haram militants have killed more than 20,000 people , forced around 2 million to flee and attacked nigeria s neighbors in a campaign to carve out an islamist caliphate .
britain s foreign office was unable immediately to provide details of military sales to nigeria in the last few years .
