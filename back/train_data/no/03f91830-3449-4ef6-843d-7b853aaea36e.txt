mexico city ( reuters ) - venezuela s former chief prosecutor luisa ortega met mexico s attorney general on thursday , a mexican official said , weeks after she fled her homeland accusing venezuelan president nicolas maduro of involvement in corruption .
ortega , who was removed from her position earlier this month , said a week ago she had evidence that maduro was involved in graft with construction company odebrecht .
the 59-year-old ortega has said she would give details of the corruption cases to authorities in the united states , spain , mexico , brazil and colombia .
mexican attorney general raul cervantes met ortega for around 10 minutes in mexico city , an official at the attorney general s office said .
he gave no further details of the meeting and spoke on condition of anonymity .
late on thursday , ortega posted a picture on twitter of herself with cervantes in mexico , saying the two had met to coordinate actions in the fight against corruption .
pictures posted on social media earlier on thursday showed ortega arriving at mexico city airport .
ortega says she has been persecuted by opponents in an effort to hide details of high-level corruption and that she has proof of it .
she was a key player in venezuela s government before breaking with it in march .
ortega left venezuela for colombia and traveled to brazil to meet prosecutors last week .
odebrecht admitted in a settlement with u.s. and brazilian prosecutors to paying bribes across 12 countries to win contracts .
according to a u.s. court ruling , odebrecht paid about $ 788 million in bribes in countries including brazil , argentina , colombia , mexico and venezuela between 2001 and 2016 .
mexico s government has been sharply critical of the maduro administration , accusing it of undermining democracy .
