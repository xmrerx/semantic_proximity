chicago ( reuters ) - illinois governor bruce rauner on friday vetoed a bill passed by the democratic-controlled legislature in april to spend nearly $ 3.9 billion on state services that have not been funded due to an ongoing fiscal 2016 budget impasse .
the republican governor called the legislation “ an empty promise. ” “ the bill purports to appropriate $ 3.89 billion , including more than $ 3 billion in general funds that the state does not have , for higher education and social service providers , but provides no source of funding , ” rauner said in his veto message .
the political stalemate between rauner and democrats has left illinois as the only u.s. state without a complete fiscal 2016 budget , operating instead on court-ordered spending and a muddled patchwork of ongoing and stopgap appropriations .
rauner called on lawmakers to pass complete balanced budgets for the current and next fiscal years , although the governor has proposed funding most fiscal 2017 services with a temporary spending plan and k-12 schools with a full-year budget .
illinois ’ new fiscal year begins on july 1 .
the democrats ’ spending bill passed with enough votes in the senate to override a veto , but fell short of that margin in the house .
the measure would have sent money to cash-starved state universities and colleges , covered tuition grants for low-income college students , and funded health and human services that were not subject to court orders .
the measure also appropriated about $ 63 million for unpaid wage increases owed to about 24,000 unionized state workers .
