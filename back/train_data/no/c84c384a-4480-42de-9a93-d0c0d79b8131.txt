madrid ( reuters ) - archaeologists in spain have unearthed more bodies from mass graves dating back to the 1936-1939 civil war and the ensuing dictatorship of general francisco franco , including some still wearing rotting leather boots .
the digs in a local cemetery in valladolid , central spain , come amid renewed efforts by volunteer associations and victim campaign groups to shed a light on the bloody past and bring closure for relatives still searching for family members .
four mass graves have now been excavated in valladolid and 228 bodies recovered there since april 2016 .
these graves are believed to be among more than 2,000 mass burial sites thought to exist across spain from the civil war - an ideological struggle between right and left - more than 80 years ago .
historians estimate as many as 500,000 combatants and civilians were killed on the republican and nationalist sides in the war .
after it ended , tens of thousands of franco s enemies were killed or imprisoned in a campaign to wipe out dissent .
i hope that with forensic analysis we can find out who they once were , said julio del olmo , one of those working on the exhumations .
the local council in valladolid partly financed the excavation , in one of the few examples to date of authorities backing such digs .
after franco died in 1975 , spain passed an amnesty law in a bid to smooth the transition from dictatorship to democracy , pardoning the crimes of the fascist regime .
but there is increasing interest from new generations to face up to the past .
for some , this lack of accountability meant that some of their relatives were never laid to rest .
another similar , smaller-scale dig also took place in the village of huesca near zaragoza in northern spain , at the request of a man searching for his great uncle .
two bodies were found there .
august 30 is the international day commemorating the victims of enforced disappearances .
