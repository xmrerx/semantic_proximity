JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The family of murdered model Reeva Steenkamp welcomed the increased sentence of 13 years and five months handed down on Paralympian Oscar Pistorius on Friday and said it showed that justice could prevail in South Africa.
This is an emotional thing for them.
They just feel that their trust in the justice system has been confirmed this morning, Tania Koen, a spokeswoman for the Steenkamp family, told Reuters.
