Close your eyes and picture Speaker of the House Paul Ryan (R-WI) telling a white radio host that he wouldn t rule out an all-white party.
Now picture his political career and his personal life being destroyed.
Will the same thing happen to Maxine Waters, the woman the Democrat Party is talking about electing as their next leader?Waters joined The Breakfast Club radio show on Monday morning and was asked if it was time for black people to form their own political party.
No, not at this point, Waters said.
You have to show that you re willing and you re able to put the numbers together and exercise your influence.
We still are not voting our influence yet, she continued.
What we should do is organize our power, exercise our power, particularly in the Democratic Party because that s where most of us are.
Waters then suggested that when black people are strong enough they may branch out into their own party.
