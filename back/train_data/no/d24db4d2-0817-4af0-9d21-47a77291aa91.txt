ankara ( reuters ) - turkey s economy minister said on thursday his predecessor zafer caglayan , charged in the united states with conspiring to evade u.s. sanctions against iran , had done nothing to harm his country .
caglayan did not do anything against turkey s interests , nihat zeybekci told reporters .
