MOSCOW (Reuters) - A court on Wednesday ruled that Russian airline Aeroflot cannot tell staff what size clothing to wear after a stewardess complained she had been taken off international routes because she did not fit into the regulation-size uniform.
The stewardess, Yevgenia Magurina, said she had been transferred to lower paying domestic flights because she exceeded what she said was Aeroflot s maximum uniform size of 48.
On Wednesday, Magurina partially won her appeal in a Moscow court against an earlier court decision which had gone against her.
The court ordered Aeroflot to pay Magurina the amount she deemed her salary had been docked as a result of the regulation - around 17,000 rubles ($296.53) - and to pay her compensation for moral suffering of 5,000 roubles, TASS reported.
The court however did not rule that Aeroflot s actions were discriminatory.
Magurina said after the decision she was satisfied with what she called a victory even though the court had not found Aeroflot guilty of discrimination.
Thank God we have solved this issue inside our country.
We were ready to go further and of course it would have been a shame for Russia to expose such things outside of the Russian Federation, she told reporters.
After the ruling, Aeroflot said it was satisfied that the court did not rule it was discriminating against employees, TASS news agency reported, and would look at amending its staff regulations once it had fully studied the court s decision.
