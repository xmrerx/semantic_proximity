how this is even possible ?
this man is obviously the victim of an insane law that was somehow allowed to pass without even considering the consequences a texas man is battling a court order that mandates he must pay tens of thousands in child support for a child whom he did not biologically father and whom he met only once.in 2003 , a child support court in texas ruled that gabriel cornejo , 45 , had to pay child support to his ex-girlfriend , who had recently given birth , because she vowed there was no way he wasn t the rightful dad.cornejo , who is currently raising three children of his own and two nephews , claimed he was not made aware of this and only found out about the child support payments last year when a deputy served him with court papers claiming that the state of texas lists him as having another child .
he soon met the minor for the first and only time describing her as a wonderful girl but after taking a dna test , learned she was not his after all.he soon met the minor for the first and only time describing her as a wonderful girl but after taking a dna test , learned she was not his after all.only cornejo s ex-girlfriend and the state still want the $ 65,000 in back payments.texas family code , chapter 161 , states that even if one is not the biological father , they still owe support payments that accrued before the paternity test proved otherwise .
in cornejo s case , that amounts to some $ 65,000 .
