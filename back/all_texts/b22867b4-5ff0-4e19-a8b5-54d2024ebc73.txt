Donald Trump just got absolutely humiliated on Twitter after he made a pathetic attempt to cozy up to Minnesota Democratic Rep. Keith Ellison with a compliment.Trump kicked off Wednesday morning with a tweet about Ellison, complimenting the Democrat in his effort to head up the Democratic National Committee.
Of course, no Trump compliment is complete without the undeserving president bragging about himself, so Trump congratulated Ellison for predicting that he would win the election:Trump is referring to the time Ellison spoke with ABC s This Week in 2015, in which Ellison weighed in on the 2016 election.
In the segment, Ellison spoke up and warned Americans that even though no one was taking Trump very seriously, he might have a real chance of becoming the Republican nominee, and might even win the presidency.
Ellison had said: Anybody from the Democratic side of the fence who s terrified of the possibility of President Trump better vote, better get active, better get involved because this man has got some momentum.
We better be ready for the fact that he may be leading the Republican ticket.
Any idiot could see that Ellison is actually against Trump in that statement, and was trying to mobilize people to get out and vote against the former reality television star.
But of course, Trump is a moron and still decided to compliment Ellison for saying he had a chance at winning the election.It seriously backfired on him less than two hours later.
Ellison, who has been criticizing Trump ever since the beginning of his disastrous, shameful presidency, saw Trump s tweet and practically destroyed him:Brutal and so perfect all at once!
