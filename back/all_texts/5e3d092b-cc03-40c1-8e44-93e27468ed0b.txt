By now you ve probably heard about the remarks Clueless star and Fox News contributor Stacey Dash made about race, segregation and BET.
However, if you haven t they went something like this: I think it s ludicrous.
We have to make up our minds.
Either we want to have segregation or integration.
If we don t want segregation, then we need to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the [NAACP] Image Awards, where you re only awarded it you re black.
If it were the other way around, we would be up in arms, it s a double standard there shouldn t be a black history month.
We re Americans.
Period.
Well, as you can only imagine that didn t go over so well.
The twitterverse had her name trending within hours and pretty much everyone had something to say regarding Dash s ridiculous remarks.
In fact, BET responded themselves.
First by tweeting a link that displayed Every Time Stacey Dash Proved She Was Clueless :Every Time Stacey Dash Proved She Was Clueless: https://t.co/mto8DSxVhe pic.twitter.com/NBDorO6Jna BET (@BET) January 20, 2016THEN they tweeted:?
Soooooo @REALStaceyDash can we get our check back or nah?
#Remember #YouWereOnTheGame #AndWeDontMeanTheRapper pic.twitter.com/2vWq03J0c9 BET (@BET) January 20, 2016Dash clearly forgot that she guest-starred on BET s The Game.
She also clearly forgot all of these moments in her life as well while making her dimwitted remarks.
Roland Martin tells it like it is:.
@REALStaceyDash says there should not be Black networks or awards shows.
So why has she done interviews/photo spreads w/Black magazines?
rolandsmartin (@rolandsmartin) January 20, 2016Hey @REALStaceyDash.
Did you tell @FoxNews you attended the 2011 @NAACP Theatre Awards?
I know.
Pesky facts!

Wow.

That was a pretty smooth cover shoot for the Black men's magazine Smooth!
#OscarsSoWhite pic.twitter.com/OIAnRA1bz5 rolandsmartin (@rolandsmartin) January 20, 2016Oops.According to Dash, she herself is ludicrous and a bad American for appearing in programming on BET, going to award shows for only people of color, and for appearing on magazines meant for the black community.
She really and truly seems clueless as her former role suggests.It s clear why Fox News hired her.
Dash will say the things that clearly don t make sense to appeal to the audience that Fox has built up over the years old, white people who are angry and scared of anyone who doesn t look or sound like them.
It s too bad, really, because she s in a role where she could reach out to that audience to offer some much-needed clarity, but instead she caters to their myopic minds by agreeing with them and telling them what they want to hear.Featured image: Twitter
