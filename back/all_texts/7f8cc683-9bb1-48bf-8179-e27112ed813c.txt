WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Vice President Mike Pence will preside over the Senate’s vote on sweeping tax legislation, his office confirmed on Tuesday.
“The @VP will preside over the historic vote,” Alyssa Farah, a spokeswoman for Pence, said on Twitter.
Republicans may need Pence’s vote in favor of the legislation to break a tie.
