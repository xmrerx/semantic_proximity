WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mexico’s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo said on Wednesday the issue with renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) is “not tearing apart what has worked” but rather finding a way to make the agreement better.
Negotiators from the United States, Mexico and Canada kicked off talks on Wednesday to update the 1994 trade deal.
