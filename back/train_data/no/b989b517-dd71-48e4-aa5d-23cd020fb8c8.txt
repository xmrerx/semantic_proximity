santiago ( reuters ) - taxi drivers protesting the growth of mobile ride hailing applications such as uber and cabify blocked the main road to chile s principal airport in capital santiago on monday , leading to one death and wreaking havoc on travelers plans .
santiago-based latam airlines , the region s biggest carrier , as well as budget carrier sky suffered delays , local media reported .
television images showed traffic backed up for miles ( kilometers ) , while many passengers resorted to walking along the highway .
one 65-year-old brazilian tourist stuck in traffic died of a cardiovascular event , chilean police said without offering any further details .
a medical helicopter evacuated the man , but it was too late , they added .
this takeover of the airport by the taxi drivers has significantly hurt the image of chile , the image of the airlines , and has hurt people traveling or arriving in the country , claudio orrego , the governor of the santiago metropolitan region , told reporters .
he added that the government would bring charges against those responsible for the protests , and that at least 15 people had already been arrested .
legislation is advancing slowly through chile s congress to regulate uber and cabify , which remain in a legal gray zone .
while some authorities have promised to sanction users of the widely used applications , they have also expressed a desire to bring the services within chile s existing regulatory framework .
