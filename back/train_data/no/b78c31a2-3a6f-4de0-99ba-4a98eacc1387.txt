seoul ( reuters ) - a south korean court on wednesday assigned five state attorneys to defend disgraced former president park geun-hye , following her defense team s resignation last week in protest at the extension of her detention period until april next year .
park is standing trial accused of bribery , abuse of power and coercion , having been forced to step down in march after parliament voted to impeach her at the end of 2016 .
she has been held in detention since late march , although under south korean law a defendant in a criminal trial at a lower court can be detained for a maximum of six months .
citing concerns that park could destroy evidence if she was released , the seoul central district court issued an additional arrest warrant on oct. 13 in order to extend her detention by six months .
the court s move prompted her entire defense team to quit in protest at a session on oct. 16 .
having lost her legal team , park gave health reasons for her failure to attend a session three days later .
after witnessing the collapse of the presumption of innocence and the principle of investigation without detention , we concluded that our efforts to defend park will be meaningless , park s former lawyer , yoo yeong-ha , told the court last week .
the court s decision to issue an additional arrest warrant will remain as one of humiliating moments in south korea s judiciary history , yoo said .
a seoul central district court spokesman said five state attorneys had been appointed to take over park s defense .
citing court sources , yonhap news agency reported the new defense team would have to review about 120,000 pages of court documents to prepare for upcoming hearings .
park s supporters have asked a united nations body to investigate whether park was being prevented from getting proper medical treatment and possible violation of her human rights due to her detention .
