Rush Limbaugh nailed it today when he said: Trump s a different animal.
They [the press] don t know how to deal with it, and he s making em look like children.
In this press conference today there was a man in the front row from CNN, a reporter in the front row, and he kept shouting at Trump like a little child.
He demanded that Trump take his question.
He started shouting at Trump while Trump was answering other questions, and Trump refused to take the question and looked at the him and said, No, you re fake news.

And that s when I started laughing and applauding here when we were covering this live.
