washington ( reuters ) - u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson has spoken to saudi foreign minister adel al-jubeir about the situation in saudi arabia , a u.s. state department spokeswoman said on thursday , where a crackdown on corruption has led to dozens of arrests .
state department spokeswoman heather nauert also said the u.s. charge d affaires in riyadh met on wednesday with saad al-hariri , who resigned as lebanese prime minister while in saudi arabia .
asked about reports hariri was being held in the kingdom , nauert declined to say where the meeting took place or to elaborate on hariri s status .
she described the talks as sensitive , private , diplomatic conversations .
in his conversation on tuesday with jubeir , nauert said , tillerson urged that the saudi government conduct any corruption prosecutions in a fair and transparent manner .
saudi authorities have arrested dozens of royal family members , officials and businessmen in the anti-corruption crackdown that began on saturday .
they face charges ranging from money-laundering to extortion .
the line between public funds and royal money is not always clear in saudi arabia , an absolute monarchy ruled by an islamic system in which most law is not systematically codified and no elected parliament exists .
the trump administration has endorsed the purge , cementing a dramatic strengthening in the relationship under u.s. president donald trump that in part has been driven by both governments determination to confront iran s growing regional power .
many experts see the crackdown as a move by crown prince mohammad bin salman , who heads a new anti-corruption body , to amass more power to enact political , economic and social reforms and to ensure that he succeeds his father , king salman .
