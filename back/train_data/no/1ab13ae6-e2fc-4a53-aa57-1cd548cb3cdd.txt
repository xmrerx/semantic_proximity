dubai ( reuters ) - kuwait s deputy foreign minister said on wednesday that the six-nation gulf cooperation council would continue to operate despite a row among three of its members and qatar that it has unsuccessfully sought to mediate .
saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and bahrain plus non-gcc member egypt cut off diplomatic , travel and trade ties with qatar in june , accusing it of supporting militants and their arch-foe iran .
doha denies the charges and says their move is aimed at curtailing its sovereignty .
western nations have called for the countries , which are all close u.s. allies , to settle their differences in talks .
the heads of state from the three boycotting countries skipped a gcc summit hosted by kuwait s ruler in december , and the uae called for the formation of a bilateral committee with saudi arabia on economic , political and military issues .
but kuwait appears determined to preserve the loose union set up in 1980 as a bulwark against larger neighbors iraq and iran , and said its reconciliation efforts would proceed .
despite the spat which appears to have no end in sight , the gcc s work will not be frozen or disrupted , khaled jarallah was quoted by state news agency kuna as telling reporters on the sidelines of a conference in kuwait .
after the summit in kuwait , we are not worried about the future of the council , jarallah added .
mediation efforts have not stopped , and a breakthrough will be achieved one day .
