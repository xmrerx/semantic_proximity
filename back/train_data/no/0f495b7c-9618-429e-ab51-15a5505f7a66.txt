bernie sanders is so focused on pandering to blacks , trashing whites and bashing police officers , he doesn t even notice when he s stuck his decrepit old foot in his mouth hillary and bernie are so busy pandering to the black vote , they almost forgot the majority of americans are not black and their constant barage of disparaging remarks and insults directed at white voter just might make some white americans not want to support them being a white person in the united states of america , i know that i have never had the experience that so many people in this audience have had , clinton said .
i think it s incumbent upon me and what i have been trying to talk about is to urge white people about what it is like to have the talk with your kids , scared that yours or daughters even could get in trouble for no good reason whatsoever , like sandra bland and end up dead in a jail in texas .
that is what i will try to do to deal with what i know is the racism that stalking our country , she said .
when you re white , you don t know what it s like to be living in a ghetto and to be poor , sanders said .
you don t know what it s like to be hassled when you walk down the street or get dragged out of a car .
i believe as a nation in the year 2016 , we must be firm in making it clear : we will end institutional racism and reform a broken criminal justice system .
