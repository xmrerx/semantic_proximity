The new head of Donald Trump s presidential campaign is already getting rave reviews from a core block of the right-wing coalition that hopes to propel him to the White House: racists.Steve Bannon, who runs the right-wing website Breitbart, is getting cheered on by the so-called alt right, the coalition of white power advocates who have come out of the woodwork to support Trump.White nationalists today invest a lot of energy worrying about growing Hispanic and Muslim populations in the U.S.
Turns out, Breitbart News spends a lot of time worrying about those things, too.
And in Bannon, they see a media-friendly, ethno-nationalist fellow traveler.
Latterly, Breitbart emerged as a nationalist site and done great stuff on immigration in particular, VDARE.com editor Peter Brimelow told The Daily Beast.VDare is a white supremacist site.
It s named after Virginia Dare, the first white child born to British colonists in North America.
Brimelow said he and Bannon met briefly last month and exchanged pleasantries about each other s work.Richard Spencer, of the white nationalist group National Policy Institute also told the Daily Beast that he was happy to see someone who shares a similar world view elevated to a major position within the Republican Party.Since Bannon has been in charge of Breitbart, since the death of its founder Andrew Breitbart, Breitbart News has been the launching pad for this segment of the right that was once kept much further below the radar within the mainstream conservative movement.His elevation to the head of the Trump campaign is being seen as a triumph of this world view on the right, and Trump s campaign, with its explicit bashing of Latinos and Muslims, appeals strongly to this group.The nominee himself was slow to distance himself from the endorsement of former klansman David Duke, and Trump has often promoted the work of white supremacists who back his campaign on his Twitter account.Featured image via YouTube
