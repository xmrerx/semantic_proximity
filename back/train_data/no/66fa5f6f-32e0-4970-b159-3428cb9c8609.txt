cairo ( reuters ) - egypt will raise the price of tickets on cairo s loss-making metro system from next july , tripling the present fare for many commuters , the state-owned newspaper al-ahram said on sunday .
commuters will be charged a base fare of 2 egyptian pounds ( 11 u.s. cents ) for the first 9 stops , and an additional pound for 9 more stations , the newspaper , quoting transport minister hisham arafat , said .
a maximum fare of 6 egyptian pounds will be charged for commuters who ride one line from start to finish , though discounted rates for government workers and students will be maintained .
currently , commuters can cover an unlimited number of stops and can even switch lines for the same base fare of 2 egyptian pounds .
the move comes as part of an effort by the transport authority to cover operational costs after the floatation of the egyptian pound , the newspaper said .
the government angered cairo residents , already hit by a sharp rise in living costs , when it doubled the price of metro tickets in march for millions of commuters , an increase which followed losses of 500 million egyptian pounds which have put the network at risk , media reported in march .
