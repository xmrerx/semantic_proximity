It s become quite clear that as much as Fox News wants to make the appearance of being honest and inclusive, it s very much on the surface, so don t believe everything you see.Recently on Fox News, Megyn Kelly interviewed Orange is the New Black star Laverne Cox.
The pair discussed Cox being transgender with topics surrounding growing up, transitioning, as well as her love life.
However, many were left scratching their heads that talk about North Carolina s discriminatory law, HB2, better known as the bathroom bill, wasn t discussed.Here s the thing it was.
It was just edited out.Well, Media Matters has the edited dialogue and created a meme that Cox passionately posted on her Twitter account to make sure that people know she did, in fact, discuss the horrendous bill.
Not only did she discuss it, she tore it to shreds with the truth.First, after being questioned why she didn t discuss the bill, she said:@dfoxfarrington we did talk about legislation specifically North Carolina's unconstitutional #HB2 but it didn't make it to air Laverne Cox (@Lavernecox) May 18, 2016Then later, she posted what was said: When a trans woman is called a man, that is an act of violence Discriminatory bills like HB2 in North Carolina misgender trans people The perpetuation of myths about who trans people are [is] at the root of this Those bills are about making us not exist.
But I m a testament that trans people do exist.
There are trans people all over this country that exist.
