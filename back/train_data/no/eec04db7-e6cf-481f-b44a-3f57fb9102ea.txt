johannesburg ( reuters ) - zimbabwe opposition leader morgan tsvangirai is out of danger in hospital in south africa after being airlifted from harare at the weekend following the sudden onset of severe vomiting , a party source said on tuesday .
tsvangirai , who is due to challenge president robert mugabe in elections next year , was recovering well but had been told by doctors to avoid stress and strain until at least the weekend , the source said .
the 65-year-old s symptoms came on suddenly at a meeting of his opposition coalition , the movement for democratic change ( mdc ) , on thursday evening in kadoma , a city around 160 km ( 100 miles ) southwest of the zimbabwe capital .
the mdc sought to play down tsvangirai s hospitalization , describing it as routine and denying local media reports that he was on life support after being airlifted to johannesburg in the early hours of saturday morning .
tsvangirai has been receiving treatment for colon cancer since last year but says he is in good health .
his sudden illness was not thought to be related to his cancer or cancer treatment , two party sources told reuters .
it comes a month after vice president emmerson mnangagwa , a favorite to succeed 93-year-old mugabe , was rushed to south africa for emergency medical care .
mnangagwa , who has since returned , denied local media reports he had been poisoned .
