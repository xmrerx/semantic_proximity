WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said the United States should decrease the amount it spends on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
“We are paying disproportionately.
It’s too much and frankly it’s a different world than it was when we originally conceived of the idea,” Trump said in an interview on CNN.
“We have to reconsider.
Keep NATO, but maybe we have to pay a lot less toward NATO itself,” he said.
