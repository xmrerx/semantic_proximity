marseille , france ( reuters ) - a french judge has ordered a prominent russian businessman and lawmaker suleiman kerimov pay a 40 million euro ( $ 47.25 million ) bail for his release pending a tax fraud and money laundering investigation , a judicial source said on wednesday .
kerimov was arrested on nov. 20 in nice on the french riviera , prompting the kremlin to intervene and say it would do everything in our power to protect his lawful interests .
kerimov appeared before a judge for the bail hearing on tuesday , the source said .
russia s state-run rossiya 24 tv station reported after his arrest that kerimov had denied any guilt .
another russian lawmaker , rizvan kurbanov , last month described kerimov s arrest as an unprecedented demarche by the french .
originally from the mainly muslim russian region of dagestan , kerimov built his lucrative natural resources business through a combination of debt , an appetite for risk , and political connections .
he owned top flight soccer club anzhi makhachkala until he sold it in 2016 .
kerimov s fortune peaked at $ 17.5 billion in 2008 before slumping to just $ 3 billion in 2009 , according to forbes magazine .
the investigation centers on the purchase of several luxury residences on the french riviera via shell companies , something that could have enabled kerimov to reduce taxes owed to the french state , a source close to the investigation told reuters after kerimov s arrest .
