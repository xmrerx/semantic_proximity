riyadh ( reuters ) - a shi ite muslim judge abducted in eastern saudi arabia a year ago has been killed by his kidnappers , the saudi state news agency spa reported on monday .
sheikh mohammed al-jirani disappeared last december from outside his home in the qatif region , which is home to about one million shi ite muslims in the predominantly sunni muslim kingdom .
spa said a security officer and one of the kidnappers were killed in a clash on dec. 19 and a second kidnapper was arrested .
it also said the judge s body had been found in the remote farming district of awamiya but did not say when he had been killed .
authorities said earlier this year that three men being sought in connection with the abduction were already on a wanted list for their suspected involvement in terrorist attacks in eastern saudi arabia .
since 2011 the region has been shaken by frequent , though mostly peaceful , protests by the shi ite minority .
however , shi ite militants , angry over what they say is repression of their community , have sometimes attacked saudi security forces in the oil-producing eastern province where qatif is located .
