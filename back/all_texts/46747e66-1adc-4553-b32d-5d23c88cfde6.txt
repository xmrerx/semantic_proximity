Secretary Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump have very different views on just about everything.
Jimmy always wonders about whether people are really paying attention to those issues or not.
For the most part, he thinks it doesn t matter what a candidate says, it just matters which candidate says it.
To put this theory to the test, we asked diehard members of Team Hillary if they agreed with some stuff Hillary has said.
But the quotes we asked about were not from Hillary, they were actually quotes from Donald Trump.
So will these Democrats agree with Donald Trump?
