Donald Trump keeps pretending that everyone is so happy and optimistic since he took office.
Twitter users were quick to blow apart his delusional alternate reality.In yet another post on his favorite social media platform, Trump declared that there is great optimism in America in response to a Bloomberg report that CEOs are more optimistic now than they have been in years.Great optimism in America and the results will be even better!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 14, 2017Of course, that s all because Trump is gutting regulations that protect workers and the environment and has promised to slash corporate taxes to new lows.But while America s wealthy CEOs are smiling about how much wealthier they are about to become, such moves have not made Americans very optimistic at all.Because while Trump s decisions are making CEOs happy, they re not the ones who will suffer because of them.In response to Trump s declaration, Twitter users were quick to point out that the American people are not at all optimistic about what is happening in Trump s America.
@robbystarbuck @realDonaldTrump @markets And bad for the healthcare of the most vulnerable Americans, but yay job growth.

@realDonaldTrump The CEOs may be optimistic about sales.
But the people do not seem as optimistic about your presidency.

@realDonaldTrump The American people were actually much more optimistic about both Obama and Bush.

Nothing cheers me up more than thoughts of an early death.
Dan Howdle (@DanHowdle) March 14, 2017@realDonaldTrump yeah, that s what happens when you give tax breaks to CEOs Troy Osinoff (@yo) March 14, 2017The bottom line is that the American people are not confident in Trump and they are sure as hell not optimistic, especially since Trump is busy doing everything he can to make the future of this country less certain.CEOs may be getting richer but the rest of us definitely aren t and we re the ones who have to live the environment these CEOs pollute and we are the ones who have to work in the unsafe and unfair working conditions that will result from Trump s assault on regulations.
We re also the ones who will have to suffer because of Trumpcare.
The CEOs, meanwhile, can pay for all the fresh air, water, and healthcare money can buy and they ll continue to help Trump make the world worse for the rest us while laughing all the way to the bank.Featured image via Aude Guerrucci-Pool/Getty Images
