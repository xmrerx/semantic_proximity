congresswoman shelia jackson lee joined roland martin to talk about the devastation left from hurricane harvey .
to get a picture of what s happening in houston the congresswoman tried to explain at the 2:20 mark that , many people don t know that we are 50 feet below sea level and are still flooding .
huh ? ? ?
whaaaat ? ? ? ?
yes , she opened her mouth and removed all doubt she s clueless ! facts : sea level = houston : downtown houston stands about 50 feet ( 15 m ) above sea level , and the highest point in far northwest houston is about 125 feet ( 38 m ) in elevation .
land along the texas gulf coast is sinking at the rate of about 2 inches per decade , which may not seem like much.don t forget that race card : 3:45 martin starts to talk about the black folks is the storm racist now ? jackson lee and martin went on to pull out that race card : houston neighborhoods have been hit , but a majority of them have been african american neighborhoods that are underwater .
that s where we keep going back to , explained lee.as of now , congresswoman lee wants to , make sure the president complies and keeps the promises that he made .
that people can return to their lives .
