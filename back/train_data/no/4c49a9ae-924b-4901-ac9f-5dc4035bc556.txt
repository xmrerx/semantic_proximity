yaounde ( reuters ) - crop-eating fall armyworms have attacked nearly 37,000 hectares of maize in northern cameroon , officials said on wednesday , accentuating an already dire humanitarian crisis provoked by the islamist militant group boko haram s cross-border insurgency .
more than two dozen african nations have reported outbreaks of the invasive central american variety of the pest , which is harder to detect and eradicate than its african counterpart .
they have now spread to all of cameroon s 10 administrative regions , though maize crops in the extreme north region have only been heavily affected since july , deputy agriculture minister clementine ananga messina told reuters .
the armyworm attack endangers the entire maize sector and is creating serious risks of food insecurity , because it s the most commonly grown cereal in cameroon , she said .
the extreme north region bordering chad and nigeria has been hit hard by boko haram , whose campaign of violence and cross-border attacks has sent more than 93,000 nigerians fleeing into cameroon where some 235,000 people have also been displaced .
across the lake chad region around 1.5 million people are confronting a food crisis , according to the united nations .
cameroonian authorities have launched an action plan to fight against the infestation , but so far pesticides have failed to contain it .
there are no effective means to fight armyworm currently existing in cameroon , said agriculture ministry expert andre marie elombat assoua .
the chemical products now being used by farmers are ineffective and too expensive .
around 12 million cameroonians , more than half of the national population , regularly consume maize .
it is also an important ingredient for the central african nation s breweries and in the production of feed for livestock .
though the fall armyworm prefers maize , it also attacked sorghum and millet , two of cameroon s other staple crops , earlier this year .
