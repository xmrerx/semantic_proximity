manila ( reuters ) - the philippine congress approved a bill that removes a proposed 900 million pesos ( $ 17.87 million ) for the police war on drugs , now that police are no longer leading the operation , but which provides them with body cameras to record arrests .
senator loren legarda , the head of senate s finance committee , said on monday that congress re-allotted the police-requested budget because the drug enforcement agency was now leading the controversial war on drugs in which thousand of suspected dealers and users have been killed .
the bill , approved by congress last week , is expected to be endorsed by president rodrigo duterte , who launched the crackdown , on tuesday .
duterte this month ordered the police to return to the drugs war , following a near eight-week layoff , but in a supporting role only .
most of the money steered away from the war on drugs would go towards military and police housing , and the balance would be used to buy body cameras for police engaged in anti-drug operations .
maybe they would be fearful if they are monitored , to lessen if not totally eliminate untoward incidents , legarda told the anc news channel .
the anti-narcotics crackdown has drawn international criticism , with rights groups pointing out lapses in police operations and alleged executions of drug suspects .
police say they have shot dead more than 3,900 drug suspects in self-defence during the 17-month campaign , but surveys have showed doubts among filipinos about the validity of police accounts .
