Stephen Colbert came under fire from conservatives this week for a late night monologue that could best be defined as a rant against Donald Trump.
It ended with Colbert saying, The only thing your mouth is good for is being Vladimir Putin s cock holster.
This is far from the first time Colbert has gone after Trump.
Back in 2011, when the potential to run for president was only a rumor, and when Trump was best known for propagating the birther theory about President Obama, Colbert poked fun at Trump s pointless and non-sequitur way of speaking.In the video, Colbert began by talking about a GOP presidential debate that barely anyone chose to attend.
About halfway through, though, Colbert started poking fun at Trump s style of saying nothing but using a lot of words to do it.
In this, Trump compared gay marriage to using a long putter (post all jokes in the comments).TRUMP: It s like in golf.
A lot of people I don t want this to sound trivial but a lot of people are switching to these really long putters, very unattractive.
It s weird.
You see these great players with these really long putters, because they can t sink three-footers anymore.
And, I hate it.
I am a traditionalist.
I have so many fabulous friends who happen to be gay, but I am a traditionalist.Colbert figured that that form of logic could be applied to other things as well, like raising the debt ceiling or Medicare.
He compared it to almond butter.
Medicare would be like cuff links.Here s the video:Colbert wasn t too far off at all.
Trump as Oval Office Occupier continues the same sort of speaking style, often making no sense at all.
The perfect example was when he was far more interested in the chocolate cake he was eating when he bombed Syria than in the bombing itself.
In fact, he forgot the name of the country he bombed.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
