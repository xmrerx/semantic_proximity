Now we know for sure that Nancy Pelosi has lost it!During a press briefing on Thursday, Pelosi criticized the President Trump s visit to Saudi Arabia first during his inaugural foreign trip.
I thought it was unusual for the President of the United States to go to Saudi Arabia first.
Saudi Arabia!
Pelosi said.
It wasn t even alphabetical.
I mean, Saudi Arabia.

That is a question that I have.
This is just the latest odd thing Pelosi has blurted out during press briefings.
