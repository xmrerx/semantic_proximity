LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s parliament will vote on whether to accept the government s deal on exiting the European Union by December 2018 or January 2019 if negotiations with Brussels progress as anticipated, Brexit minister David Davis said on Thursday.
If it goes to the timetable (EU negotiator) Mr Barnier expects, or wants to go to, which is October of 2018, it s likely the European Parliament will vote December or January... we will have that put before the house before then, there s no doubt about that, Davis told parliament.
