( reuters ) - a raucous republican party debate on thursday drew the biggest audience for a televised u.s. presidential match-up in 2016 , according to early ratings data , but viewership was well below the record set last august .
the fox news channel ( foxa.o ) debate among republican front-runner donald trump , marco rubio , ted cruz and john kasich drew 16.9 million viewers , according to early nielsen data provided by the network on friday .
