sacramento , calif. ( reuters ) - california will increase the amount of money new parents can receive through the state ’ s paid family leave program under a bill to be signed on monday by democratic governor jerry brown , his office said friday .
the measure , passed last month by the state legislature , would increase the amount paid to new parents or people caring for a sick family member to as much as 70 percent of their regular income for the poorest workers , up from 55 percent .
those earning more would still get an increase in payments , to 60 percent from 55 percent .
the state also plans to eliminate a seven-day waiting period imposed on receiving the benefits .
the legislation aims to help more people take family leave , especially poorer californians who could not afford to stop work if they only got 55 percent of their regular income , according to the bill ’ s author jimmy gomez , a democratic assembly member .
the program , administered through the state ’ s disability system , would apply to all parents who take off time from work to bond with a child within one year of birth , adoption or placement as a foster child .
it would also provide payments to people who take time to care for seriously ill family members .
