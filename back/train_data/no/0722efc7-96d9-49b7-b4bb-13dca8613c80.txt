johannesburg ( reuters ) - south africa s ruling african national congress should discipline president jacob zuma for bringing the party into disrepute , housing minister and presidential hopeful lindiwe sisulu said on friday .
sisulu s comments are the latest swipe taken at zuma by former allies as the anc fractures ahead of an elective conference in december where a new party leader will be chosen .
zuma can remain head of state until a 2019 parliamentary election .
sisulu , a veteran cabinet minister who comes from a prominent family in the struggle against apartheid , is seen as an outside bet to succeed zuma .
she said a report presented at the anc s policy conference in july found that scandals surrounding zuma had caused tensions and disquiet within the party .
if we all agreed at the policy conference that that is what happened to the president , why was he not taken through a disciplinary process ?
sisulu told eyewitness news , a domestic news service .
i have been insisting that there must be a disciplinary process so that if there is an interpretation that you put the anc into disrepute , that is an offense .
spokesmen for sisulu and zuma did not respond to calls for comment .
members of the anc have called for zuma to step down in recent months following a series of corruption scandals , a much-criticized cabinet reshuffle and a failure to handle an economy that slipped into recession this year .
lawmaker makhosi khoza , a strident critic of zuma , quit the anc on thursday , labeling nelson mandela s 105-year-old liberation movement alien and corrupt .
nkosozana dlamini-zuma , former chair of the african union and zuma s ex-wife , and deputy president cyril ramaphosa are viewed as the frontrunners to take over as anc leader .
dlamini-zuma has the support of zuma s powerful faction within the anc while unionist-turned-business tycoon ramaphosa is more popular with investors .
