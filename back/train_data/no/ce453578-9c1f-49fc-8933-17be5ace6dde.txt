dhaka ( reuters ) - several small opposition parties in bangladesh have called for a half-day strike on thursday against a power tariff increase , which could cause traffic chaos in the congested capital as pope francis arrives for a three-day visit .
the strike will begin on thursday morning and end in the early afternoon , after the pope is expected to land in dhaka following a visit to neighboring myanmar .
strikes in bangladesh often involve street protests .
the communist party of bangladesh , which is leading the protest against the increase in electricity prices by an average of 5.3 percent from next month , said it had no intention of disrupting the pope s visit but the action was necessary given the burden on the people .
but police said there would be no problem .
we will be able to control the situation during the strike and there is nothing to worry about , said police spokeswoman sahely ferdous .
dhaka is one of the most densely populated cities in the world , with an average traffic speed of just 7 kph ( 4.3 mph ) , slightly faster than an average walking speed , according to the world bank .
congestion in dhaka eats up 3.2 million working hours per day , it says .
( bit.ly/2zkyr6l ) pope francis visit will include a mass and meetings with a group of rohingya muslim refugees from myanmar .
more than 600,000 rohingya have fled to bangladesh following violence in myanmar since late august .
