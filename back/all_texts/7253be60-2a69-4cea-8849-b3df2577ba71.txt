In case people weren t already aware, lesbians exist.
I know, shocking, right?
I mean, one even wrote this article.
Reading this could be exposing you to unadulterated homosexuality.
Yet, if you re not gay, it s not going to turn you gay.
Just as me watching every Disney film featuring an extremely heterosexual princess did not turn me straight.
So, how great would it be if their were a lesbian princess?However, it looks as though some folks just couldn t wrap their heads around a simple, innocent request to give Elsa from Disney s hit movie Frozen a girlfriend.I hope Disney makes Elsa a lesbian princess imagine how iconic that would be Alexis Isabel (@lexi4prez) May 1, 2016Dear @Disney, #GiveElsaAGirlfriend Alexis Isabel (@lexi4prez) May 1, 2016It would be iconic, and about damn time.
Although, many of us already assumed Elsa was gay, and maybe Merida from Brave too.
Oooh, how cute would they be together?Unfortunately, there are still a lot of stupid people out there who love to make sure their hatred of the LGBT community is as visible as possible.
The homophobia speweth over:Why?

(@WitchySmiles) May 2, 2016#GiveElsaAGirlfriend is disgusting Conrad Schwarz (@ConradAnCat) May 2, 2016This person apparently believes homosexuality is an alternative who knows, maybe it is for them.
Who am I to judge?.
@Disney Please #DontGiveElsaAGirlfriend.
#GiveElsaAGirlfriend is a terrible idea.
Don't make alternative sexuality an issue for children.
EvangelicalArminians (@ArminianSociety) May 2, 2016This person thinks everyone is gay now.
In a perfect world, but alas, no #GiveElsaAGirlfriend , are y'all fr?
Why does everyone have to be "gay" now?
Disney characters?
Wow.
mini sosa (@AlyssaAriyanna) May 2, 2016Then there s just your typical homophobes:#GiveElsaAGirlfriend?
No I'm sorry but this is sickening.
brandon (@handstomyseIf) May 2, 2016And the people who think exposing their children to lesbians would fuck things up:Dear Disney Don't fuck up my daughter's favorite movie!#GiveElsaAGirlfriend my ass!!!?

Kaz (@FluffetteKaz) May 2, 2016The fact that #GiveElsaAGirlfriend is trending makes me so happy, I wish I had gay @Disney characters to look up to ??
Tyler Thompson (@the_tythompson) May 2, 2016#GiveElsaAGirlfriend there is no reason not to, it's time to teach children of all genders that homosexuality is just as normal and valid wasd (@phancied) May 2, 2016#GiveElsaAGirlfriend WE NEED THIS.
So many families could benefit from this, lets bring kids up to accept all kinds of love.
Jenny 2.0 (Jasmine) (@LaurenToMyHolly) May 2, 2016Some pointed out the delicious hypocrisy:#giveelsaagirlfriend if it's "okay" for a girl to date a beast&sexualize a fish, then ofc its okay to date the same gender.
#loveislove Reana (EP trash) (@reana_s_) May 2, 2016Ya think?
!Although, this tweet pretty much sums things up perfectly:Spoiler alert: Frozen was a metaphor for a closeted person learning to love herself and your children adored it.
#GiveElsaAGirlfriend Twitnter is Coming (@OhNoSheTwitnt) May 3, 2016No matter which way you look at it, it shouldn t matter either way, and the all the homophobes out there really need to let it go.
