( reuters ) - the u.s. department of justice has hired a retired marine corps major general to head the office in charge of bringing overseas criminal defendants to the united states for trial , a task that has grown in importance as the work of u.s. prosecutors increasingly crosses national borders .
vaughn ary , a lawyer who was in the marine corps for 28 years , has been chosen as director of the department ’ s office of international affairs , according to an internal personnel announcement seen by reuters .
a justice department spokesman declined to comment on the appointment .
ary could not be reached for comment .
ary resigned last year as the convening authority for u.s. military commissions , a job that put him in charge of operations at the guantanamo bay , cuba , tribunals .
he had angered some defense lawyers and military judges by pushing a plan to increase the pace of trials at the guantanamo naval base by requiring judges to live there .
the plan was scrapped .
the justice department ’ s office of international affairs is in the middle of negotiating the extradition of drug kingpin joaquin “ el chapo ” guzman from mexico .
in another case , it has asked countries such as switzerland and honduras to hand over defendants in a sweeping investigation of corruption in soccer and its world governing body , fifa .
the office is also charged with negotiating the transfer of evidence across borders through agreements known as mutual legal assistance treaties .
more resources are going toward the office as a result of the increase in workload , assistant attorney general leslie caldwell of the justice department ’ s criminal division said on friday in a speech at a legal conference in san diego .
caldwell said she was “ very excited ” about a new director of the office of international affairs , and said that the person would start on monday .
she did not name the person .
