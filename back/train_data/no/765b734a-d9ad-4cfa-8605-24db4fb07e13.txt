brussels ( reuters ) - an arbitration clause in an investment treaty between the netherlands and slovakia does not violate eu law , an adviser to the eu s top court said on tuesday , in a legal case on an issue that has sparked fierce public debate .
the advocate general gave his opinion on an arbitration clause contained in an investment treaty stemming from 1991 between the netherlands and czechoslovakia , before the latter split into two countries and became a member of the european union .
in 2008 a dutch insurer launched arbitration proceedings against slovakia and was awarded 22.1 million euros ( $ 26.51 million ) in damages .
slovakia sought to annul the decision , arguing arbitration treaties violated eu law .
the arbitration clause in the investment protection agreement concluded between the netherlands and slovakia is compatible with eu law , the advocate general said .
arbitration clauses have been sharply debated in the wake of the eu s efforts to conclude trade deals with other nations and regions , seen by critics as undermining national judiciary processes .
the european court of justice usually follows the advice given by the advocate general .
