Sen. Bernie Sanders says that he doesn t think it s likely that Donald Trump will be reelected to a second term now that the American people have had a chance to see what he s really about.
Speaking in New York, the Vermont Senator said he thinks that Trump will be a one-term president.
In terms of the first three months in office, Donald Trump is the least popular president in the history of polling, Sanders said.
I do not believe that if Trump continues these policies that he s going to be reelected.
Nor do I think that the Republicans are going to do well in 2018.
Sanders explained that a wave of progressivism has taken hold and is sweeping across the country.
This, he added, does not bode well for conservatives.
The momentum right now is with the progressive movement in this country, Sanders said.
And I think the Republicans are on the defensive and will be on the defensive increasingly.
The senator offered up Tuesday s special election in Kansas to replace now-CIA Director Mike Pompeo as an example of this trend.
Although it was a deep red district that Trump won hands down in the presidential election, Republican candidate Ron Estes just barely managed to scrape by with a narrow win over civil rights attorney James Thompson (D).
The Republicans had to spend money like crazy at the end to beat him, Sanders said.
I think that s a very good omen for the future.
Judging by the way the beginning of Trump s presidency has gone, you have to wonder if Trump will even get the chance to run for reelection.
The FBI and both houses of Congress are investigating the probability that he colluded with Russia to steal the election.
If he is found to have committed treason, he will most likely end up impeached and may have to worry more about a prison term than a second term.Featured image via Scott Eisen/Getty Images
