Donald Trump sat down with for an interview with Chuck Todd Sunday morning during an episode of MSNBC s Meet the Press.
During the interview, Todd questioned Trump on the matter of former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke.
Duke has been a vocal supporter of Trump throughout the GOP primary.
He is also now running for a U.S. Senate seat.
Duke says that he was inspired to run for office because of Trump s campaign.Trump has previously denounced Duke s views and his endorsement of his campaign.
Trump says in the interview that he does not support Duke s senatorial run.
However, after a bit of grilling from Todd, Trump implies that he might vote for Duke under certain circumstances.
Todd said: David Duke announced his Senate candidacy claiming your agenda for his own, or essentially saying glad that you spoke out.
Newt Gingrich said, every Republican should repudiate this guy no matter what he says.
Trump responds by saying I did and I do.
That s when Todd asks Trump: Would you support a Democrat over David Duke, if that was what was necessary to defeat him?
Trump then says that it would depend on the Democrat who is running for office.
Though he does say that he wouldn t support Duke.
I guess, depending on who the Democrat was, but the answer would be yes.
Look, the answer is, as quick as you can say it, rebuked.
Is that OK?
Rebuked.
It shouldn t matter who is running against Duke, as long as they are better than Duke himself.
It s nearly impossible to imagine a candidate that could be worse than Duke running on a Democratic ticket.
Even if someone is a firm believer in not supporting the lesser of two evils relative to their political position, you do everything you can to support that candidate if their opponent happens to be a former leader of one of the worst hate groups in the United States.You can watch the interview below.Featured image via video screenshot
