the majority of americans would likely find the choice of obama toilet paper to be humorous .
the american flag floor mats however ( see image below ) , are far from funny vladimir putin fans now have the perfect place to toast to the russian leader thanks to a newly opened cafe dedicated solely to the action man president.welcome to the incredibly patriotic president cafe in eastern siberia , located around 4,000 km ( 2,500 miles ) from moscow , where putin s face covers the walls and barack obama s smiling face is on the toilet paper.graffiti-daubed pictures of obama , as well as david cameron and his german counterpart angela merkel , also greet visitors to the toilet with floor mats featuring us flag adding to the anti-western vibe.visitors can also pose for photos with a life-size picture of the russian leader at the bar which opened last month in the working-class city of krasnoyarsk , reuters reports.so what inspired him to open the putin cafe ?
when we got together with partners to open a new cafe , we thought of a concept that would attract customers and guarantee its success , he said .
and it then dawned on us : russia still had no cafe or restaurant fully dedicated to putin , russia s most popular politician !
this is how our concept appeared .
then we worked on the design .
he added : people react the way they consider appropriate , and we give them this opportunity but , in general , we see this as entertainment .
