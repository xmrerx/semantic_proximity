Trump supporters became triggered after Budweiser s Super Bowl ad that told the story of co-founder Adolphus Busch s journey from Germany to the United States as a legal immigrant.
After finding out that immigrants are responsible for their favorite wife-beatin fuel, the Right flew into a frenzy and began yet another in a long string of successful (for the targeted companies) string of boycotts.Very quickly, #BoycottBudwiser was trending as Trump s uneducated followers unleashed their ( there? )
rage against the company:#boycottbudwiser Budwiser owned by Brazilian company.
Nothing 'USA' about them.
Moth-balled the Clydesdales.
Sad!!
????????
Alison for Trump (@Alison4Trump) February 6, 2017I have never drank Budwiser in my lifetime, nor do I ever plan to drink Budwiser as long as I live.
#BoycottBudwiser Levi Flaman (@LeviFlaman) February 6, 2017Dumbass, you are selling alcohol to kids in colleges that get killed from driving drunk.
GET OFF YOUR HIGH HORSE!
#boycottbudwiser #Trump# (@RlzLionKing) February 6, 2017@Budweiser Why no Clydesdales this year?
Too busy making a political statement?
#boycottbudwiser Joshua Schafer (@jschafer5) February 6, 2017#boycottbudwiser Funny how many confuse illegal immigration with Legal immigration.
Budweiser must be confused.
Glad I'm a Miller man.

Do you really think these libtards drink beer.
No way.

#SUPER BOWL #boycottbudwiser DAISY (@OllieLove44) February 6, 2017Now, you might have noticed something a little off with the boycott specifically with the spelling.
This, of course, is an indicator of the intelligence level of the average conservative, but it also functions as a source of endless entertainment for those of us who need a good laugh.
Naturally, the internet piled on, mocking the Right for somehow failing so hard that their stupidity is trending on Twitter:I'm guessing this is the guy who started #boycottbudwiser pic.twitter.com/fxHA1H3h75 Vanessa (@foxnfeather) February 6, 2017#boycottbudwiser ???
REALLY???
Please be *wiser* and learn to spell Colleen McNellis (@C0L_Train) February 6, 2017This is why #DeVos should not be secretary of education.
#boycottbudwiser #Stupid pic.twitter.com/2GnKtxkuvF Alex F. Suarez (@GoldbrainGDS) February 6, 2017I see Betsy DeVos taught the "special snowflakes" on the right how to spell #boycottbudwiser.
Education is important, even to spell a beer.
Mike (@FallenAngel722) February 6, 2017I don't get #boycottbudwiser (misspelled)-I thought this ad showcased the American dream.I have a prob w/illegal immigration,not immigrants Trisha Douglas (@trishakdouglas) February 6, 2017Devos is already affecting our education Lmao??
Trump supporters can't even spell Budweiser #boycottbudwiser pic.twitter.com/43BJlOHU5J Chris Smith (@Lilyachttty) February 6, 2017Besides spelling, #boycottbudwiser is protest of what?
White, LEGAL immigration?
The guy even spoke English, unlike my German ancestors.
Lisa Falkenberg (@ChronFalkenberg) February 6, 2017Guys, let's totally #BoycottBudwiser okay?
Meanwhile, Budweiser is double-LOLing at the ignorance.
MR. WILL WONG (@mrwillw) February 6, 2017hey, supporters of the pumpkin, how about y'all learn to spell first before going around boycotting everything #boycottbudwiser sai sailaja seshadri (@Saisailu97) February 6, 2017It might be a good idea for Trump supporters to #boycottbudwiser after they stop trying to boycott public schools Progressive Spring (@progressspring) February 6, 2017Ultimately, any conservative boycott is doomed to fail, even against Budwiser, Budweiser, or any other beer company.
After all, their idea of a Starbucks boycott was to buy lots of coffee and tell the barista their name is Trump.
Budwiser s erm, Budwiser s commercial was nothing aside from a history lesson about the company, but the Right s reaction proves that they aren t just concerned with keeping our country safe.
They are boycotting a company for a commercial that supports legal immigration the same thing they say is their concern.Read more:Featured image via screengrab
