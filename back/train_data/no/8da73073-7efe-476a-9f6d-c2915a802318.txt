abu dhabi/dubai ( reuters ) - the united arab emirates central bank has asked banks and finance companies in the uae to provide information on the accounts of 19 saudi citizens , banking sources told reuters on thursday .
saudi authorities have previously confirmed that almost all the 19 have been detained in a sweeping corruption investigation .
one of those is prince alwaleed bin talal , chairman of international investment firm kingdom holding .
the regulators request was contained in a circular sent earlier this week and banks have responded , the sources said , adding that the banks had not been asked to freeze the accounts .
officials at the central bank were not available to comment .
commercial bankers said they believed uae authorities were acting at the request of saudi authorities , but this was not confirmed .
