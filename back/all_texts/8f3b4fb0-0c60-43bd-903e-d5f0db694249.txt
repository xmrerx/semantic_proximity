Donald Trump is likely pleasing the GOP establishment lately because he hasn t been totally crazy.
However, the embarrassing video of a Black female pastor, Faith Green-Timmons, shutting him down when he tried to use her church podium like a campaign rally went viral, and of course Trump couldn t resist attacking the pastor like the toddler that he is at heart.Trump phoned in to his buddies over at Fox and Friends Thursday morning, and said that the audience was great but the pastor was, quote, a nervous mess.
Trump told the Fox hosts: Something was up, because I noticed she was so nervous when she introduced me.
She called NBC, ABC when she got up to introduce me, she was so nervous, she was shaking.
And I said, Wow, this is sort of strange.
And then, she came up.
So she had that in mind, there s no question about it.
Now, of course this is likely untrue.
The pastor of Flint, Michigan s Bethel United Methodist Church did not look at all nervous when she shut Trump down, but of course facts don t matter to The Donald.
All that matters is that he was embarrassed in public and video of it went viral, so the person who caused him said embarrassment must pay.
Here is video of that Fox and Friends exchange: This is not a person who has the character or temperament to be president, and of course that is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to all the things about Donald Trump that utterly disqualify him from being President of the United States.
Part of being in public life especially political public life is the ability to take criticism.
That is simply an ability that Trump does not possess.
His ego and narcissism will not allow him to let any slight perceived or real go without launching some kind of attack, usually full of childish, untrue, low-road insults.Remember, America this man could be your next president, and he reacts like a 2-year-old anytime anyone disagrees with him for any reason whatsoever.Featured image via Wonkette
