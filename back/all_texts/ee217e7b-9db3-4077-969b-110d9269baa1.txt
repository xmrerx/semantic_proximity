A video of a terrified and previously abused puppy being shown love for the first time by her handler has captured the hearts and minds of many.
The puppy, Priscilla, is crying out as a caretaker pets her.
Not knowing how to react to the love she s shown for the first time, Priscilla cries out in anguish and fear but as the video progresses, amazing things happen.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iogpZHkfN2I]Defenseless and petrified, Priscilla keeps snapping her head back to the hand of the caretaker, anxiously anticipating what the caretaker will do next.
Watching Pricilla s trauma gives the viewer an idea of the magnitude of abuse Priscilla previously suffered.However, after a few strokes around her head, eyes, and ears, Priscella slowly yet surely calms.
Later on in the video, Priscella is in the arms of her caretaker and she seems both comfortable and reassured that the people around her mean no harm.The last part of the video shows a happy Priscilla playing with her handler and another dog.
She is bright, happy, and physically healthy, unlike the Priscilla we saw in the previous video.
Not much is known about Priscilla other than the clear abuse she clearly incurred from her previous owner and that she is from Romania.It is striking what a little love and affection can do.
If we treated all creatures in this manner, including each other, one can only imagine how wonderful the world we live in would be.Featured Image via YouTube Screen Capture from Daily Mail
