beijing ( reuters ) - china s foreign ministry said on friday that it opposed north korea s use of ballistic missiles in violation of united nations security council resolutions .
the emphasis on curbing north korea s missile and nuclear capabilities should not come at the expense of pushing for a peaceful and diplomatic resolution , ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said after north korea fired a missile that flew over japan s northern hokkaido island far out into the pacific ocean .
hua said china had made enormous sacrifices to implement united nations security council resolutions and that its sincerity could not be doubted .
