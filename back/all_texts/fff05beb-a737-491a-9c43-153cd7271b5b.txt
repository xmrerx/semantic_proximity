WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Paul Manafort, a former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, has strong family and community ties and does not pose a serious flight risk, his lawyers argued in a court filing on Thursday.
A $10 million unsecured bond “will more than suffice to assure his appearance as required” in any court proceedings, the lawyers said.
Manafort and associate Rick Gates have been charged with money laundering, tax fraud and failing to register as foreign agents of Ukraine’s former pro-Russian government.
