madrid ( reuters ) - the catalan government is considering calling a snap election , pro-independence party cup politician carles riera said on tuesday , though he added that the far-left party would oppose such a move .
the regional elections are a weapon to cancel the oct.1 ( referendum ) and the will of the majority of catalonia , riera told a news conference .
secessionists in catalonia say that a banned independence vote held on oct. 1 - which drew only a 43 percent turnout and was mostly shunned by catalans who wish to remain in spain - has accorded them a mandate to claim statehood .
