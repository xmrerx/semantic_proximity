On Monday morning, Donald Trump appeared on Fox & Friends and raged over his loss in Colorado.
The Republican frontrunner s tantrum was so bad that it caused a GOP Senator to absolutely lose his shit on Twitter.Senator Cory Gardner was livid that Trump has been bashing the state after his loss, especially since the rules for delegate counts were set up months ago.
However, it was only after his embarrassing defeat that he decided he no longer wanted to play by the rules typical Trump.
After all of the whining, Senator Gardner decided to put The Donald in his place in an epic rant:If you can t figure out the Colorado GOP delegate process how can you figure out how to balance the national budget?

#copolitics Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016How can you protect Israel at the UN when you re completely baffled by the @cologop convention process?
-CG #copolitics Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016 How on earth are you going to defeat ISIS if you can t figure out the @cologop convention?
-CG #copolitics Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016The answer to those questions, of course, is that he has no plans.
He never has.
He tells his poorly educated supporters that he does, but he can t give out all of his secrets because someone might steal his ideas.
His supporters, in turn, tell everyone else this load of baloney as if it s completely normal that a man who is running for President of the United States is refusing to tell people what he is going to do for the country.
The senator had a lot more to say:Spoke to dozens of Trump supporters this weekend, listened to his surrogate speak twice, not 1 person complained abt process until he lost.

@tedcruz showed up to the @cologop convention.
@realDonaldTrump only sent a surrogate.
Cruz swept.
Elections are won by those who show up.
Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016Darryl Glenn came out of nowhere to win @cologop convention for US Senate.
That should be the story.
Not @realDonaldTrump s temper tantrum.
Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016I ve attended CO GOP conventions for years.
It requires organization & attn to grassroots to win.
Cruz had it.
Trump didn t. End of story.
Cory Gardner (@CoryGardner) April 12, 2016That should be the end of the story, but Trump is a terrible loser.
Instead of just admitting that Cruz won fair and square, someone must have cheated.
It s a conspiracy!The reality is that Trump throws these fits because it furthers the narrative that he is the underdog fighting against the big, bad GOP establishment.
And because his supporters do not have the common sense of a toddler, they believe him.It s not every day that a Republican senator so thoroughly owns Trump, so we must give credit where credit is due: bravo Senator Gardner.Featured image via Andrew Renneisen/Getty Images (altered)
