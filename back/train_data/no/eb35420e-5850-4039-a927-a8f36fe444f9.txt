beirut ( reuters ) - two rockets struck near damascus airport at dawn on friday , lebanese tv station al-mayadeen reported , an attack it said had probably been carried out by israeli warplanes from outside syria s borders .
al-mayadeen gave no further details in the report carried in a news flash on screen .
an israeli military spokeswoman declined to comment on the reports of the air strike , saying : we do not respond to such reports .
earlier this month , the syrian army reported an israeli air strike on a military site in syria s hama province .
israel says it has hit arms convoys of the syrian military and its iranian-backed ally hezbollah nearly 100 times in the past five years .
israel , which fought a 2006 war with hezbollah , sees red lines in the shipment to the powerful shi ite group of anti-aircraft missiles , precision ground-to-ground missiles and chemical weapons .
the syrian observatory for human rights , which monitors syria s civil war , said the attack earlier this month was on a facility of the scientific studies and research centre , an agency which the united states describes as syria s chemical weapons manufacturer .
syria s government denies using chemical arms .
in 2013 it promised to surrender its chemical weapons , which it says it has done .
