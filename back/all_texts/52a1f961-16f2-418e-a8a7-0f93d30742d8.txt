Rep. Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.) held a town hall earlier this week and it did not go well for him.
The Republican congressman told his constituents that taxpayers don t pay his salary and saying otherwise is bullcrap.
You say you pay for me to do this?
That s bullcrap, video shows Mullin saying.
I pay for myself.
I paid enough taxes before I got here and continue to through my company to pay my own salary.
This is a service.
No one here pays me to go, he added.Go figure, no one was impressed with his remarks.
When his constituents pushed back, Mullin tried to spin his comments, saying, this is a service for me, not a career, and I thank God this is not how I make my living.
Amy Lawrence, Mullin s spokeswoman, told the press that he was just trying to say that he doesn t want to be a career politician, that s all.
The congressman reiterates in the video that his work as the representative of the Second District of Oklahoma is a service, Lawrence said.
His aspiration is to be a career legislator and not a career politician.
He is not, nor does he ever aspire to be, a career politician.
His priority will always be to serve his constituents to the best of his ability.
Mullins owns Mullin Plumbing, a lucrative company with multiple smaller subsidiaries.
But comprehending exactly how this negates the salary he earns as a congressman requires a special type of mental gymnastics.
For the record, base pay for a U. S. congressman is $174,000.The good news for Mullin is that after telling his constituents that they don t pay his salary, he probably won t have to worry about the possibility of becoming a career politician.You can watch Mullin sabotage his career below: Featured image via Wikipedia
