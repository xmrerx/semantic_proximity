WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday that evangelical Christians would love his choice to fill an open seat on the Supreme Court, adding that he is pretty certain who it will be but “not 100 percent.” “I think the person I pick will be big, big,” Trump said, according to a partial transcript of a Christian Broadcasting Network interview set to air in full on Sunday.
“I think evangelicals, Christians will love my pick.” Trump has said he would make his decision this week and announce it next Thursday.
