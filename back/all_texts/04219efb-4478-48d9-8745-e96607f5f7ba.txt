Senator Lindsey Graham: I have reason to believe DNC, Hillary & DOJ Colluded on Hillary email Investigation.
So lets get to the bottom of THAT!
We should focus on the DOJ and the other intel agencies being politicized causing their efforts to get to the truth to be compromised.Think back on the chance meeting between Loretta Lynch and Bill Clinton on the tarmac.
Lynch compromised herself when she lied about the reason for their meeting.
Yes, she lied.
Anyone who thinks they just say on the tarmac and talked about grandkids is a total idiot.
There is no way they didn t discuss things about the email investigation into Hillary.Don t forget about the emails from Wikileaks and all of the back and forth about the email investigation.
