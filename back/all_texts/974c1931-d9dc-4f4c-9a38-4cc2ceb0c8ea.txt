The terrorist who killed three people and injured dozens in Westminster on Wednesday was a married 52-year-old living with his family in an inner city suburb of Birmingham, according to police and a neighbour.Khalid Masood was born in Kent on Christmas Day 1964 and was described by a neighbor in Winson Green on Thursday as very calm and part of a very reserved family .
But in fact the man who crashed a rented Hyundai into dozens of people on Westminster Bridge and stabbed PC Keith Palmer to death was a violent convicted criminal with multiple offenses to his name, including assaults, grievous bodily harm, possession of offensive weapons and public order offenses.His first conviction was in November 1983 for criminal damage and his last conviction was in December 2003 for possession of a knife, according to Scotland Yard, who finally named him on Thursday afternoon.
They were a nice family very reserved, said his neighbour Iwona Romek, a factory worker, who confirmed his identity to the Guardian.
He was very calm.
I saw the photos on the TV and knew it was the man who lived here.
The attack in Westminster came out of the blue not only for police, who stressed he had never been convicted of any terrorism offenses, but also for some who knew him in Birmingham, where he and his family lived on the modern Quayside estate about a mile from the city centre.However, he was once investigated in relation to concerns about violent extremism .
May described that case as historic , but Downing Street declined to say whether that was during her time as home secretary between May 2010 and June 2016, repeating May s position that it was some years ago .Watch Brigette Gabriel explain how non-assimilation plays a major role in terror attacks by Muslims:He had lived in Winson Green, Romek said, before moving out, it is believed to a flat above a restaurant on Hagley Road, which was raided on Wednesday night.
He regularly wore traditional white Islamic robes, the neighbor said.
