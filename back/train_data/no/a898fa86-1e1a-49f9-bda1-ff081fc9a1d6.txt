paris ( reuters ) - the french island of martinique escaped hurricane maria largely unscathed but a communications blackout with guadeloupe meant it would be several more hours before damage there could be assessed , a senior french civil protection official said on tuesday .
maria , the second major storm to hit the caribbean this month , lashed guadeloupe s southern shores as it tracked northwest toward the virgin islands and puerto rico .
in martinique , reconnaissance operations are still underway but already we can see that there is no significant damage , jacques witkowski , france s head of civil protection and crisis response , told a news briefing in paris .
he said the hurricane was currently less than 70 km ( 43.5 miles ) south of guadeloupe .
right now we re in a blackout zone , so it s very , very hard to communicate with guadeloupe , witkowski said .
video footage released by the guadeloupe prefecture showed tree-bending winds whipping through deserted streets and shaking lamp posts when the storm first hit .
it urged residents to stay indoors and take shelter in their most secure room .
guadeloupe prefect eric maire said up to 400 millimeters of rain were forecast in some parts of the island .
a storm surge could also flood low-lying coastal areas .
we ve already got some early information of flooding , flooded houses and submerged roads , maire said in a video recording posted on the prefecture s twitter handle .
airport group guadeloupe pole caraibes said guadeloupe s main international airport would be closed until at least 14:00 local time ( 1800 gmt ) on tuesday .
