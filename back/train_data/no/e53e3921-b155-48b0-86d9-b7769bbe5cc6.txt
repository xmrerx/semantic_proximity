istanbul ( reuters ) - turkey s president tayyip erdogan said on saturday iraqi kurdish authorities would pay the price for an independence referendum which was widely opposed by foreign powers .
iraq s kurds overwhelmingly backed independence in monday s referendum , defying neighboring countries which fear the vote could fuel kurdish separatism within their own borders and lead to fresh conflict .
they are not forming an independent state , they are opening a wound in the region to twist the knife in , erdogan told members of his ruling ak party in the eastern turkish city of erzurum .
erdogan has built strong commercial ties with kurdish authorities in northern iraq , which pump hundreds of thousands of barrels of oil daily through turkey for export to world markets .
we don t regret what we did in the past .
but since the conditions are changed and the kurdish regional government , to which we provided all support , took steps against us , it would pay the price , he said .
turkey has repeatedly threatened to impose economic sanction , effectively cutting their main access to international markets , and has held joint military exercises with iraqi troops on the border .
however , after erdogan said that iraqi kurds would go hungry if ankara halted the cross-border flow of trucks and oil , it has said that any measures it took would not target civilians and instead focus on those who organized the referendum .
iraq s defense ministry said on friday it plans to take control of the borders of the autonomous kurdistan region in coordination with iran and turkey .
turkish prime minister bin yildirim , speaking on saturday , did not refer specifically to those plans , but said ankara would no longer deal with kurdish authorities in erbil .
from now on , our relationships with the region will be conducted with the central government , baghdad , he said .
as iran , iraq and turkey , we work to ensure the games being played in the region will fail .
