berlin ( reuters ) - germany s social democrats are still not available to join chancellor angela merkel s christian democrats in a continuation of their grand coalition government after talks with other parties failed , a party document showed on monday .
given the results of the sept. 24 election , we are not available for entry into a grand coalition , read a spd paper due to be discussed by party leaders that was obtained by reuters .
we are not afraid of new elections .
the comments came after merkel s efforts to form a three-way coalition government failed , pitching germany into its worse political crisis for decades , raising the prospect of fresh elections and casting doubt over her future .
the spd won just 20.5 percent in the september election , its worst post-war result after it lost stature as junior partner in the often awkward coalition dominated by merkel .
