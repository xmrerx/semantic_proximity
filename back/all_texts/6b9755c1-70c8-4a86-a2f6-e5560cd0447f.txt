IT WAS AN ALL OUT BRAWL AT THE NV DEM CONVENTION: The Hill Reported: Tensions were high at the Democratic convention in Nevada Saturday, with Bernie Sanders supporters demanding delegate recounts, booing Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) and causing other disruptions, according to local media reports.
Keep on booing and boo yourself out of this election .we had our Nevada caucus and Hillary Clinton won, BarbaraBoxer Sanders supporters were angry over a voice vote that adopted a set of temporary convention rules as the permanent rules, according to the Las Vegas Sun.And supporters also reacted angrily to the count of delegates attending the convention, which put Hillary Clinton at an advantage.
Final numbers announced later in the day showed 1,695 Clinton supporters in attendance to Sanders s 1,662.
The focus has been all on the Trump/Third Party situation but the Bernie/Hillary situation is what the press might want to focus on an all out brawl happened at the NV Dem Convention.
