this is priceless.donald trump has not even taken office yet , but he and his supporters are already getting their asses handed to them by people from other countries and proving themselves to be complete embarrassments to our nation.when trump attacked union steelworkers 1999 on wednesday he did so using his favorite attack platform : twitter.if united steelworkers 1999 was any good , they would have kept those jobs in indiana .
spend more time working-less time talking .
reduce dues donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) december 8 , 2016of course , trump took a lot of heat for attacking the labor union simply because they were telling the truth about his pathetic deal with carrier .
