If you haven t figured it out by now, Donald Trump loves himself a lot.
In fact, he may love himself more than anything or anyone else on this planet.
His raging narcissism is obvious and if you don t see it, well, you re probably a few sandwiches short of a picnic.So, leave it to Trump to walk in and introduce his wife Melania at the Republican National Convention by making it all about himself, not his wife.He walked in, blasphemously, to Queen s We are the Champions, while covered in a smoky green haze reminiscent of how a WWE wrestler would enter before a performance..@realDonaldTrump makes a grand entrance at the #RNCinCLE https://t.co/aUYikTbReQ https://t.co/ceoOcf87l5 CBS News (@CBSNews) July 19, 2016It was absolutely ridiculous, yet not at all surprising.
However, the internet responded appropriately, and brilliantly:He did it.
He actually did it.
Trump did the WWE entrance.

Did he really need to walk out like that?
Of course not, but he did, because of course he did.
Trump wouldn t have it any other way.
I mean, how boring if he just walked out like a normal human being, or like any other politician introducing their spouse?If it s not clear to you by now that Trump is only in this race for himself wake up.Featured image via Twitter
