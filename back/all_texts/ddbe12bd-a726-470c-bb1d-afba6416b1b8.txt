And once again, the snowflakes want to erase parts of history they know nothing about.
And what s more, they attack and penalize those who try to defend it.This week, an Atlanta judge was suspended upon posting his thoughts about Confederate monuments and so called anti-fascist protesters on Facebook.
Judge James Hinkle wrote, It looks like all of the snowflakes have no concept of history.
It is what it is.
Get over it and move on.
He went on to add, The nut cases tearing down monuments are equivalent to ISIS destroying history.
ISIS AND ANTIFA BELOW- BOTH HATE AMERICA AND DEAL WITH CONFLICT BY USING VIOLENCE AND DESTRUCTION.He noted that, Confederate monuments in Virginia have the rear ends of horses facing north.
Following these posts, Hinkle was told by Gwinnett County s chief magistrate that he was suspended.
Chief Judge Kristina Blum released the following statement: I have made it clear to all of our judges to conduct themselves in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity, impartiality, and fairness of the judiciary.
I consider any violation of those principles and policies to be a matter of utmost concern.
Hinkle, who also served as the mayor of Grayson for over twenty years, previously made his views well known on social media when he posted he was proud to be a deplorable infidel.
While many have been calling for his permanent removal, Hinkle has stated that he did not see what he did wrong.
But you know, he went on to say, with the way things are going in the world today, I guess everything s controversial.
JUDGE HINKLE RESIGNED AFTER TELLING THE TRUTH AND BEING PUNISHED FOR IT.
