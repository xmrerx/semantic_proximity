recently re-released footage from a 1988 appearance on the oprah winfrey show gives insight into what donald trump really thinks of women.in the video , trump appeared with his then-wife ivana trump and told winfrey that we get along very well , and there s not a lot of disagreement because ultimately ivana does exactly as i tell her to do .
like many of trump s predictions and investments over time , that marriage also ended up going bust .
he and ivana divorced in 1991 after she found out he had been having an affair with marla maples , a former beauty queen.trump then married maples in 1993 , and that marriage lasted until a breakup in 1997 and a divorce in 1999 .
he married his current wife , former model melania knauss , in 2005.the comment hints at other sexist remarks and claims that trump has made over the years .
these include : an ad from a republican super pac opposed to trump compiled his sexist comments , and had every day women read them out loud to demonstrate how much of a turn off his candidacy might be in a general election .
the ad has so far received 3 million views on youtube.https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=oksrjsuy0vspolls show trump does have a problem with female voters.a cbs news/new york times poll in october found that 57 percent of registered women voters had an unfavorable view of trump .
now , it s up to 63 percent.in a head-to-head match-up with hillary clinton , trump trails 50 to 40 percent .
the reason is women , who give clinton a whopping 20 point advantage over trump 55 to 35 percent.even when it has won presidential elections , republicans have performed poorly with female voters .
the prospect of trump s long paper trail of sexist comments , combined with the likelihood that the democratic nominee will be a woman , could predict an epic electoral failure for the party.featured image via youtube
