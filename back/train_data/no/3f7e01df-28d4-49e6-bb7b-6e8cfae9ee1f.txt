istanbul ( reuters ) - a former turkish beauty pageant winner may face up to a year in prison over a tweet referring to last year s failed military coup that cost her miss turkey title , the private dogan news agency said on thursday .
an istanbul prosecutor has indicted 18-year-old itir esen , who in september was stripped of her title after one day , for publicly humiliating a segment of the society following three official complaints over her tweet , dogan reported .
on july 16 this year , esen tweeted : i had my period on july 15 morning to celebrate the day to commemorate martyrs .
as a representation of our martyrs blood , i am commemorating this day by bleeding .
she later deleted the tweet and deactivated her twitter account .
dogan said the indictment included a statement by esen in which she said her tweet was shared in an ironic way to commemorate those who died on july 15 , 2016 and there was no intent to insult any part of turkish society .
around 250 people , mostly unarmed civilians were killed and over 1,000 wounded in the failed coup bid on july 15 , 2016 .
the day was later declared democracy and national unity day and a public holiday in turkey .
more than 150,000 state employees have been suspended or sacked and over 50,000 have been jailed pending trial in a security crackdown following the attempted coup .
rights groups and some of nato-member turkey s western allies have voiced disquiet about the crackdown , fearing the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent .
