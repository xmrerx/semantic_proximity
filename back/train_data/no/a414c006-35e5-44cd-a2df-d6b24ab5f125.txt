beirut ( reuters ) - the leader of lebanese shi ite group hezbollah , sayyed hassan nasrallah , said on sunday that saudi arabia had forced lebanon s prime minister saad al-hariri to resign , and called for calm and patience in lebanon .
hariri , a political ally of saudi arabia resigned on saturday in an unexpected declaration from the kingdom , citing a plot to assassinate him and slamming hezbollah and its iranian backers for sowing strife in the arab world .
the resignation of the prime minister , a sunni muslim , toppled a coalition government that included hezbollah .
the resignation was a saudi decision dictated to prime minister saad al-hariri and forced on him , nasrallah said in a televised broadcast , adding that there was no domestic reason for hariri s decision .
nasrallah urged lebanese not to hold protests in response to the resignation , saying this will not lead to any result .
we urge against political escalation , he said .
nasrallah also said legitimate questions were being raised in lebanon over whether hariri was being detained in saudi arabia .
hariri allies in lebanon have denied suggestions that he had been detained .
saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman has tightened his grip on power through an anti-corruption purge by arresting royals , ministers and investors including billionaire alwaleed bin talal , one of the kingdom s most prominent businessmen .
