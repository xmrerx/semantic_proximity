in 2016 , ben & jerry s co-founder , ben cohen s net worth was estimated to be $ 150 million .
in typical liberal fashion , ben s fine with sitting on an astronomical net worth , he just wants to make sure the government has the ability to take even more from the every day american s paycheck ben & jerry s co-founder ben cohen announced monday he has created a new flavor celebrating benrie sanders s white house run .
nothing is so unstoppable as a flavor whose time has finally come , cohen wrote on his facebook page alongside a picture displaying a pint of bernie s yearning ice cream.the new flavor isn t an official ben and jerry s ice cream .
jerry and i have been constituents of bernie sanders for the last 30 years , cohen said of the longtime vermont senator .
but he noted that his company with fellow co-founder jerry greenfield is not directly involved with the flavor.who knew the political revolution could taste so sweet ?

when we re out speaking on his behalf people always ask if there s a ben and jerry s flavor .
there s not , cohen added .
but if i were going to come up with one , this is what it would be .
cohen s website describes bernie s yearning as plain mint ice cream beneath a solid layer of chocolate on top .
the chocolate disc represents the huge majority of economic gains that gone to the top 1 percent since the end of the recession , the flavor s packaging states .
beneath it , the rest of us.eating instructions include taking a spoon and whacking the chocolate disc into lots of pieces ; mixing the chocolate pieces around ; and sharing the result with your fellow americans .
