colombo ( reuters ) - a british woman won 800,000 rupees ( $ 5,200 ) in compensation from a sri lankan court on wednesday after being wrongly deported for having a buddha tattoo on her arm .
buddhism is accorded the foremost place in sri lanka s constitution and about 70 percent of the island s 21 million people are buddhist .
but there is no law banning buddha tattoos .
the supreme court also ordered police involved in the 2014 arrest and detention of naomi coleman to pay her 50,000 rupees ( $ 325 ) each , the government s information department said on in its website ( www.news.lk ) .
coleman was deported contrary to the law governing immigration and emigration , the government said .
coleman was not present in court .
a lower court had decided to deport coleman partly because she could have been vulnerable if allowed to stay as some sri lankans could have been offended by the tattoo , officials said .
in 2013 , sri lanka , a former british colony , denied entry to a british man because of his buddha tattoo .
