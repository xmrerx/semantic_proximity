dubai ( reuters ) - the four arab countries boycotting qatar added 11 more individuals and two other entities , including a major group of islamist scholars , to their terrorist blacklists for the gulf state , saudi state news agency spa reported on thursday .
the lists now include the qatar-based international union of muslim scholars ( iums ) which was formed in 2004 mostly by clerics belonging to the muslim brotherhood and is chaired by the influential sheikh youssef al-qaradawi .
a statement issued by saudi arabia , egypt , the united arab emirates ( uae ) and bahrain said they also blacklisted the international islamic council ( iic ) .
the two entities listed are two terrorist organizations that promote terrorism by using islamic rhetoric as a cover to facilitate terrorist activities , the statement said .
the move deepened the rift between the four countries and qatar , the world s top gas exporter and host to the biggest u.s. military base in the middle east .
the countries cut ties with qatar in june , accusing it of financing militants in syria and allying with iran , their regional foe .
the saudi-led quartet also added 11 individuals to their lists , including the acting brotherhood leader mahmoud ezzat ibrahim .
the muslim brotherhood movement led the arab spring protests in 2011 that toppled some autocrats in the middle east and north africa .
the gulf states rulers see the group , whose political ideology challenges the principle of dynastic rule , as a security threat .
the iums membership includes the saudi cleric salman al-awdah , who was arrested by saudi authorities in september , the tunisian rached ghannouchi , head of the ennahda party , and moroccan scholar ahmed raissouni .
mediation efforts of the qatar crisis led by kuwait and shuttle diplomacy by western officials , including u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson , have failed to end what has become the worst rift between gulf arab states in years .
