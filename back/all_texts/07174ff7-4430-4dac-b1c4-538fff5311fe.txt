When she s not shamelessly bashing people who don t think human action is dangerously warming the planet or radically confusing the role of the First Lady, CNN anchor Carol Costello is busy making ridiculously stupid comments on-air.This mainstream media dummy actually said the Chattanooga mass murderer Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez reminded her of Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev.
The Muslim murderer who slaughtered four Marines before being blasted by police was a good-looking kid and was also popular in high school, Costello said.
This guy actually reminds me of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, she said.
Good-looking guy.
Everybody liked him.
He was popular in high school.
Very well-educated.
Both of them were wrestlers, and then something happened.
This is just another example of a media madam living in a bubble where she s blinded to see that the only comparison that should be made between the Marine Murderer and the Boston Marathon bombers is that they were all sick animals and cowards.
Idiot.
