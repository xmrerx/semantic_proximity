How very moderate and tolerant of Sadiq Khan, to make one of his first acts as London s new Mayor to threaten the United States.
Perhaps someone will explain to London s new Muslim Mayor that after 8 long years of being kicked around, America s about to elect a new leader who won t be entertaining threats or opinions of local Mayor s in foreign countries.
A poll in April found that two-thirds of British Muslims would not tell the government if a friend or family member became involved with extremists.The new Muslim mayor of London has issued a warning to Donald Trump: Moderate your stance on Muslims, or they will launch more attacks against America.Trump recently praised Sadiq Khan for winning London s mayoral race, and said he would be willing to create an exception in his policy restricting Muslim entry into the United States in order to allow Khan to visit.
But in a statement Tuesday, Khan dismissed Trump s invitation, and also denounced his views on Islam as ignorant, suggesting Trump s policies would increase the terrorist threat in both the U.S. and U.K. Donald Trump s ignorant view of Islam could make both of our countries less safe it risks alienating mainstream Muslims around the world and plays into the hands of extremists, he said.
Donald Trump and those around him think that Western liberal values are incompatible with mainstream Islam London has proved him wrong.
