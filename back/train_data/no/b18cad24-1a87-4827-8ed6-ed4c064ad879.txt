@ realdonaldtrump : - based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular individual mandate has been terminated as part of our tax cut bill , which essentially repeals ( over time ) obamacare , the democrats & republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new healthcare plan !
[ 0658 est ] - wow , @ foxandfrlends dossier is bogus .
clinton campaign , dnc funded dossier .
fbi can not ( after all of this time ) verify claims in dossier of russia/trump collusion .
fbi tainted .
and they used this crooked hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the trump campaign !
[ 0824 est ] - all signs are that business is looking really good for next year , only to be helped further by our tax cut bill .
will be a great year for companies and jobs !
stock market is poised for another year of success !
