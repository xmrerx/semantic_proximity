paris ( reuters ) - french president emmanuel macron s popularity rose above 50 percent for the first time since he was elected in may with people approving of the way he defends the country s interests abroad , a poll showed on tuesday .
the poll , conducted by ifop-fiducial for paris match magazine , saw the head of state s popularity jump 6 percent compared to the same survey in november .
it comes after macron undertook a three-day tour to africa promising a break from the past .
during the trip , he was praised for his direct approach with students at a university in burkina faso .
the french appreciate his way of making contact with people and to speak openly even if he didn t announce anything , said ifop s deputy chief frederic dabi .
seventy-three percent of the 978 people surveyed said macron defended the country s interests well , a 5 percent rise from november .
the jump in popularity also comes at a time when the french right is more fractured than at almost any point in the modern-day fifth republic , leaving opposition to macron negligible .

the poll , carried out between december 1-2 , said that some 42 percent of people saw the far-left insoumise party as the main opposition to macron compared to just 22 percent for the conservative the republicans and 21 percent for the far-right national front .
