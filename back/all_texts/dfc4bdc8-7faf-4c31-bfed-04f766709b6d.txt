FBI files reveal missing email boxes in Clinton case, allegations of evidence tamperingBuried in the 189 pages of heavily redacted FBI witness interviews from the Hillary Clinton email investigation are details of yet another mystery about two missing bankers boxes filled with the former secretary of state s emails.The interviews released earlier this month, known as 302s, also reveal the serious allegation that senior State Department official Patrick Kennedy applied pressure to subordinates to change the classified email codes so they would be shielded from Congress and the public.The details about the boxes are contained in five pages of the FBI file with a staggering 111 redactions that summarize the statements of a State Department witness who worked in the Office of Information Programs and Services (IPS).
The employee told the FBI that, Initially, IPS officials were told there were 14 bankers boxes of former Secretary of State Hillary CLINTON s emails at CLINTON s Friendship Heights office.
Friendship Heights is a neighborhood that straddles the Northwest neighborhood of the District of Columbia and Maryland.The State Department witness further explained to the FBI that on or about December 5, 2014, IPS personnel picked up only 12 bankers boxes of CLINTON s emails from Williams & Connolly.
The officials were not sure if the boxes were consolidated or what could have happened to the two other boxes.
Clinton s chief lawyer at Williams & Connolly, who leads all Clinton-related legal matters, is David Kendall.
