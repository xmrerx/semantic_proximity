detroit ( reuters ) - u.s. republican presidential front-runner donald trump said the move by ford motor co ( f.n ) to build a manufacturing plant in mexico “ is an absolute disgrace ” and shows the need to renegotiate the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) .
earlier on tuesday , ford confirmed plans to build a plant in san luis potosi and an investment of $ 1.6 billion .
“ this transaction is an absolute disgrace , ” said trump ’ s statement , sent to reuters by email .
“ our dishonest politicians and the special interests that control them are laughing in the face of all american citizens. ” trump said deals like the one michigan-based ford made to build a plant in mexico “ will continue until we can renegotiate nafta to create a fair deal for american workers. ” ford did not have an immediate comment on trump ’ s statement , but two weeks ago its chief executive , mark fields , said ford would not back away from foreign investments if they made sense .
“ we are a global , multinational company and we will invest to keep us competitive and we will do what makes sense for the business , ” fields said .
ford currently has more workers and makes more vehicles at its u.s. plants than do detroit rivals general motors co ( gm.n ) or fiat chrysler automobiles ( fcau.n ) ( fcha.mi ) , and has fewer workers and makes fewer vehicles in mexico than the other automakers .
gm has about 12,000 hourly paid workers in mexico , while fca has 9,547 and ford has 6,191 , the companies said on tuesday .
in the united states , ford has 55,300 hourly paid plant workers , gm has 54,000 and fca has 36,600 , the companies said .
in 2015 , 80 percent of ford ’ s north american production came from its u.s. plants while 63 percent of gm ’ s north american production came from its u.s. plants and for fca 64 percent of its north american production came from its u.s. plants .
