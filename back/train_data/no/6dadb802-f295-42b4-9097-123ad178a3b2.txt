washington ( reuters ) - the united states hopes a new package of u.s. regulatory changes affecting cuba will encourage people-to-people interactions and provide additional incentives for havana to make economic and trade reforms of its own , u.s. officials said on tuesday .
the regulatory reforms , which were introduced earlier on tuesday , loosen travel restrictions on cuba and ease limits on the use of u.s. dollars in trade transactions there just days ahead of president barack obama ’ s historic visit to the former cold war enemy .
u.s. officials told reporters the new rules would allow more cubans to work legally in the united states without having to defect , but they declined to predict how that might affect major league baseball .
“ it certainly does address the ability of cuban athletes who can earn salaries in the united states to do so , ” one official told reporters in a briefing .
