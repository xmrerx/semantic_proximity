lilongwe ( reuters ) - police in malawi have arrested 200 suspected members of vigilante mobs that have been killing people they believe are vampires , a spokesman said on tuesday .
nine people have been killed since mid-september in southern malawi where there is a widespread belief in witchcraft .
the violence has prompted the united nations and the u.s. embassy to declare some parts of the country no-go zones .
the attacks spread last week to blantyre , malawi s second largest city where a 22-year-old man was stoned then burned to death and another was stoned to death .
both were accused of bloodsucking , although medical experts deny the existence of vampirism in malawi .
amos daka , head of the medical society of malawi , said his group was not aware that any one has adequate clinical evidence to support any of the many claims to date .
president peter mutharika has visited parts of the country affected by the violence .
this month , the united nations pulled staff out of two areas in southern malawi .
