After a report aired on One America News if you haven t heard of it, this is the news network that spawned mouthbreathing bleached bigot and Queen of White Grievance Tomi Lahren Donald Trump s FAKE NEWS tantrum over the whole golden showers thing stretched into yet another day.
INTELLIGENCE INSIDERS NOW CLAIM THE TRUMP DOSSIER IS A COMPLETE FRAUD!
@OANN Trump tweeted in all-caps Saturday morning.INTELLIGENCE INSIDERS NOW CLAIM THE TRUMP DOSSIER IS "A COMPLETE FRAUD!"
@OANN Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 14, 2017Yes, nestled among hard-hitting reports about how Obama started the war on cops and something approaching three billion complaints about piss-gate was OANN fact-checking the full report, which was published by Buzzfeed.
Sure, everyone has said from the beginning that some parts of the report are unsubstantiated, but that didn t stop OANN anchor and apparent Pleasantville extra Liz Wheeler from triumphantly celebrating the fact that not everything in the reports everyone has said from the start have some inaccuracies was inaccurate.Now, Wheeler is not an intelligence insider.
In fact, it would be an amazing feat if she managed to open a can of soup without adult supervision.
But to Trump, Wheeler s report is all the proof he needs to shut people up about that thing he allegedly did with the nice Russian ladies at a hotel in Moscow.
Naturally, there was mockery to be had for The Donald:@realDonaldTrump It is certainly very rare that information in capital letters is ever wrong.

@oann is a radical right wing site w zero credibility.
That's like me citing my cat for evidence of a claim Stefanie Iris Weiss (@EcoSexuality) January 14, 2017.
@realDonaldTrump Angel, I'm sure "OANN" writes lots of nice things about you but nobody's heard of that news source.
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 14, 2017@realDonaldTrump By intelligence insiders, do you mean the Kremlin?
Kris Sanchez (@KrisSanchez) January 14, 2017@realDonaldTrump Oh, I get it this must be some new company that will gladly take your money in exchange for positive coverage.
Kris Sanchez (@KrisSanchez) January 14, 2017@realDonaldTrump why "insiders?"
Why not actual US intelligence officials, whose job it is to brief you?

@realDonaldTrump @OANN Your "credible" source is a conservative news channel that just added Corey Lewandowski.
Speaking of fake news.
Nick Jack Pappas (@Pappiness) January 14, 2017@realDonaldTrump @OANN Your credible news site also has some FREAKY FACTS about Friday the 13th.

@realDonaldTrump The key to persuasive writing is Caps Lock.
Simon Hedlin (@simonhedlin) January 14, 2017@realDonaldTrump NO ONE HAS CLAIMED THAT.
Jimmy Smagula (@JimmySmagula) January 14, 2017Interestingly, it was announced that former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski joined OANN as a commentator on Thursday just before Trump tweeted praise for the specious report.Trump may be tweeting about the intelligence insiders at OANN, but he has been ignoring the actual intelligence officials who have told him the report is very, very real.
Every claim simply has not been substantiated yet just as literally the whole world has been reporting from Day One of Shower Time.Here s what is actually being reported: CNN and numerous people in the intelligence field have verified that documents exist accusing Trump s campaign team of directly colluding with Russia (and, yes, there s a bit in there about Trump giving some Russian women money to pee on his bed while he watched).
The documents, which have been floating around since well before October, contain claims that are not fully vetted and some that have been recognized as inaccurate from the very beginning.
Trump and Obama were both briefed on the documents on the same day, which sent Trump into a seemingly neverending all-caps tantrum over the situation.To make matters worse for The Donald, the BBC now reports that at least four sources back the claims, and a CIA contact told them that there is video and audio of Donald Trump in compromising situations with women in both Moscow (Putin s neighborhood) and St. Petersberg, which is known as a lively center of child prostitution attracting some Western men to take trips there.
I saw the report, compiled by the former British intelligence officer, back in October, BBC correspondent Paul Wood said earlier this week.
He is not, and this is the crucial thing, the only source for this.
After reaching out for information, Wood says a source affiliated with the U.S. intelligence community explained there is more than one tape, not just video, but audio as well, on more than one date, in more than one place, in both Moscow and St. Petersburg.
To make matters worse for Trump, at least three people have responded to Penthouse magazine s $1 million bounty on video of Trump enjoying golden shower time.
Are the allegations true?
We don t know but Trump is reacting more like a child who just smacked his classmate with a chair and immediately ran to the teacher to scream he hit me first in an effort to avoid trouble than an innocent man.Featured image via Getty Images (Spencer Platt)/screengrab
