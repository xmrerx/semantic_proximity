beijing ( reuters ) - chinese police have detained 11 people in connection with a deadly skyscraper fire in the northern port city of tianjin , the municipal government said on sunday , after an investigation found numerous fire code violations .
the blaze which killed 10 and injured five early on friday morning was caused by renovation materials catching fire on the 38th floor of a serviced apartment building , the tianjin government said in a post on its official weibo account .
it said the companies responsible for the renovations had left a fire prevention water tank empty , rendering firefighting equipment useless and allowing the fire to spread quickly .
fire safety has come under scrutiny and attracted increased media attention in china after a deadly blaze last month killed 19 in the far southern fringe of beijing , which has led to citywide evictions seen by some people as unfairly targeting the vulnerable underclass .
sparks from drilling work caused a blaze at a warehouse storing rubber products in a logistics park in china s eastern shandong province on friday , though no casualties were reported .
on sunday , another fire broke out at a small insulation factory in xian , in northwestern shaanxi province .
no casualties were reported .
all but one of the dead in the tianjin fire were renovation workers who were sleeping on site , against regulations .
all were men and all were migrant workers from other chinese provinces .
tianjin party secretary li hongzhong said authorities would carry out citywide fire safety inspections in response to friday s blaze , the official tianjin daily reported .
