obama s cowardly backdoor gun confiscation starts with those who ve risked their lives defending our rights.in what amounts to a backdoor gun grab , two senate republicans are demanding to know why the va stripped 260,000 veterans of their second amendment rights.as of december , the va has reported 260,381 individuals to the fbi as mentally defective and therefore not permitted to purchase a gun , guns.com is reporting.u.s .
sen. chuck grassley , an iowa lawmaker who is currently the senate judiciary committee chairman , finds this unacceptable .
our military heroes risked their lives to protect and defend this country and all that we stand for , including our most basic constitutional rights , said grassley in a statement .
now the very agency created to serve them is jeopardizing their second amendment rights through an erroneous reading of gun regulations .
the va s careless approach to our veterans constitutional rights is disgraceful .
in an effort to fix the issue , grassley , along with senate veterans affairs committee chairman sen. johnny isakson , r-ga. , penned a letter to va secretary robert mcdonald last week and another to the subcommittee over the agency s funding , questioning the practice.making a due process argument , the lawmakers argue the va uses the fiduciary trustee status of a veteran to regulate firearms possession without ever seeking to find out if the service member is a danger to themselves or others .
the use of the va regulation , adopted for a totally unrelated purpose , is suspect , especially in light of the supreme court holding that the second amendment is a fundamental right , reads the letter to mcdonald .
that holding changed the legal calculus by which a regulatory scheme can survive constitutional scrutiny and it is not clear how these regulations would fare under that increased scrutiny .
