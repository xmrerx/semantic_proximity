When Florida Governor Rick Scott walked into a downtown Gainesville Starbucks, he probably expected to just get some coffee but after what happened to him, he ended up running away like someone was about to destroy his final Horcrux.
On Tuesday, the adult version of Bat Boy didn t even get to purchase his latte when a customer lit him on fire (not literally, though it is rumored that fire is his weakness) for his mishandling of, well, everything since he took office: You cut Medicaid so I couldn t get Obamacare.
You re an asshole.
You don t care about working people.
You should be ashamed to show your face around here.
Scott replied that he has created one million jobs since he took office a number that is shockingly true but the woman, like anyone who looks upon the rest of Scott s record, was thoroughly unimpressed by the alleged human whose solution to poverty is wasting taxpayer dollars drug testing the poor.
A million jobs?
she asked as she looked around the room.
Great, who here has a great job?
I was looking forward to finishing school.
You really feel you have a job coming up?
She added that Scott stripped women of access to public healthcare.
Shame on you, Rick Scott, she yelled as he hastily retreated out the door.
We depend on those services.
Rich people like you don t know what to do.
When poor people like us need health services you cut them.
Shame on you Rick Scott, she said one final time.
You re an embarrassment to our state.
Sweet, said the man who caught the incident on camera.I think we can all agree with him.Watch this glorious moment unfold below:Featured image via screengrab
