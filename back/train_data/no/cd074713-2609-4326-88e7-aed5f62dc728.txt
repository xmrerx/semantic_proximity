london ( reuters ) - ethnic minorities in britain have a lower employment rate than white people and are under-represented in senior public sector jobs , prime minister theresa may will say on tuesday , releasing the findings of a government audit on racial disparity .
bogged down by brexit and a botched snap election since taking control of the ruling conservative party last july , may has struggled to deliver on social reforms to tackle what she has called burning injustices that exist in britain .
attempting to relaunch that agenda , may will publish the findings of a race disparity audit , which will not , she says , come as a surprise to many .
people who have lived with discrimination don t need a government audit to make them aware of the scale of the challenge , may will say according to extracts of remarks due to be delivered at a launch event on tuesday .
but this audit means that for society as a whole for government , for our public services there is nowhere to hide .
these issues are now out in the open .
and the message is very simple : if these disparities can not be explained then they must be changed .
the data covering 130 topics including health , education , employment and the criminal justice system will be made publicly available on a website , with new datasets being added over time .
may will describe it as an essential resource in the battle to defeat ethnic injustice .
