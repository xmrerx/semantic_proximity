Donald Trump is now so desperate to improve his shattered image that he s trying to improve it by attaching himself to Ronald Reagan.Before he turned in for the night on Monday, Trump posted a picture of himself shaking hand with the former Republican president in an effort to seemingly suggest that the torch was being passed at that moment.An old picture with Nancy and Ronald Reagan.

Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 9, 2017@Izor28 @tonyposnanski @realDonaldTrump I don t think Reagan would have liked the bullying, narcissism, lack of decorum, and unfitness.

Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) January 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump He d be rolling over in his grave over what you ve done to his party and country.
Cameron Atfield (@CameronAtfield) January 9, 2017@realDonaldTrump The Reagan kids don t like you invoking their father or mother s name.
https://t.co/BWJSvNKJLu Anthony Breznican (@Breznican) January 9, 2017Indeed, Michael Reagan absolutely trashed Trump throughout the campaign.
No way do I or would my father support this garbage, he wrote.
My father would not support this kind of campaign, if this is what the Republican Party wants leave us Reagans out.
Ron Reagan also slammed Trump during the campaign, especially after Trump criticized Carly Fiorina s looks.
I can t think of two people who are more diametrically opposed, Reagan said.
This egotistical, narcissistic guy with the weird comb over swanning in his private plane.
I mean, look in the mirror, fat boy.
Look at that hair, you re ridiculous!
Where do you get off talking on anybody s appearance?
It s just so unchivalrous.
My father would recoil at that sort of thing.
@tonyposnanski @JeramieLorson @realDonaldTrump The Reagans would be horrified by Trump and his shit show.

Reagan told me that day he thinks you re overrated.
