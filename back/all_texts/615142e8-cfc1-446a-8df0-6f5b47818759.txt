While Helen was collecting benefits, her husband, Fidelis Agbapuruonwu, was earning $1.5 million per year as a lawyer, according to court documents obtained by News4.In 2001, Fidelis received the prestigious Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship which helped pay his way through law school.The Paul & Daisy Soros Fellowships for New Americans offers up to $90,000 for two years of graduate education.
Paul Soros, older brother to Democratic mega-donor George Soros, created the fellowship program in 1998 to honor the contributions of immigrants and children of immigrants to the United States, and help fund graduate study for immigrants who are poised to make significant contributions to US society, culture or their academic field.
As a lawyer at Mayer Brown, Agbapuruonwu worked on a number financial and civil cases, according to a search of federal court records.In one of his cases, Agbapuruonwu assisted a pro bono team in 2011, which helped a woman from El Salvador win asylum in the U.S. from the continuous and severe physical, emotional, and psychological abuse inflicted by her ex-boyfriend.
