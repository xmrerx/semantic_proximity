lima ( reuters ) - three peruvian policemen were killed in an attack on patrol vehicles in a drug-trafficking region controlled by a remnant band of shining path rebels , the interior ministry said on thursday .
authorities are investigating the attack , which occurred late on wednesday in the jungle region known as the vraem , where most of peru s cocaine is produced , the ministry said .
the maoist-inspired shining path largely ended its armed rebellion in the 1990s on orders from the group s leaders .
but a faction that refused to put down its weapons occasionally ambushes state security forces in the region , where rebels work with drug traffickers .
so far this year , nine police or military officers have been killed in the vraem in a sign the shining path faction has regrouped after two top leaders were killed in 2013 , said peruvian security analyst pedro yaranga .
this is going to continue , he said .
peruvian president pedro pablo kuczynski called the latest incident a cowardly attack and the interior ministry said it would increase security operations in the region .
