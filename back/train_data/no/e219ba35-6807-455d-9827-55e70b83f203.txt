what happens when a black police officer sings the national anthem at a ball park ?
is that racist as well ?
when will disney owned espn figure out their fans aren t watching for their ignorant , racist commentary ?
espn magazine senior writer howard bryant argued in has latest column that police officers and military personnel should not sing the national anthem before sporting events.but it s not because he thinks they have bad voices but rather because it amounts to a display of staged patriotism signaling an authoritarian shift at the ballpark .
why don t more athletes speak out on behalf of their communities ?
bryant wrote .
perhaps more of them would if there wasn t a chilling force looming over them .
bryant s column became a subject on a fox and friends weekend segment , and the gang totally disagreed with him.anna kooiman noted that bryant had written similar columns , in which he took the exception to doing the flyovers and singing the national anthem and god bless america .
in today s political climate , where kids in some district can t recite the pledge of allegiance , she asked what is the problem here with expressing some patriotism ?
it s not forced patriotism !
peter doocy said that , according to bryant , these displays are feeding into the 9/11 hero narrative , which butts heads with the black lives matter movement.he does not believe that police officers on 9/11 were heroes , he said , and then wondered why a sporting magazine was opining about politics in the first place .
