it s so funny that a lefty effort to harm president trump has totally backfired again !
for starters , it s not like trump s even in town for three weeks !
liberallogic : hey !
let 's put up a # trumpchicken in washington dc while he is in new jersey .
# imwithstupid kambree kawahine koa ( @ kamvtv ) august 10 , 2017 he s in new jersey for 17 days while the white house has repairs done .
we re guessing this guy didn t get the memo on that ! a man named taran singh brar gave a statement about why he thought it was important to put a giant chicken with golden hair on the white house lawn : we are out here to criticize our president for being weak and ineffective as a leader and being too afraid to release his tax returns , too afraid to stand up to putin and now engaged in a game of chicken with kim jong un .
yet he wants a military parade in dc .
it s all incongruous , and we are here to make fun of him for that .
i found my spirit animal y'all # trumpchicken pic.twitter.com/jfe6vxtawg simar ( @ sahluwal ) august 9 , 2017 lots of funny comments on twitter referred to the inflatable chicken as the trump chicken .
one twitter user even said he d found his spirit animal .
responses by conservatives were positive and supportive of president trump : we agree that it s pretty darn cute and that it sure has backfired on this guy .
