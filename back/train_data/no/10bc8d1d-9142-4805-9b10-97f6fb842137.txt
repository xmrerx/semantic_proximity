united nations ( reuters ) - u.s .
ambassador to the united nations nikki haley on thursday called on countries to suspend providing weapons to myanmar over violence against rohingya muslims until the country s military puts sufficient accountability measures in place .
we can not be afraid to call the actions of the burmese authorities what they appear to be - a brutal , sustained campaign to cleanse the country of an ethnic minority , haley told the u.n. security council .
it should shame senior burmese leaders who have sacrificed so much for an open democratic burma .
