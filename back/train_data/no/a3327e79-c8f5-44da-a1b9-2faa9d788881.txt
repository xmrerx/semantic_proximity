21st century wire says various parties in washington are quietly laying down the rhetorical tarmac for an increased us military operation in syria.recent remarks by us secretary of defense ash carter ( see report below ) in davos appear to dovetail with similar words yesterday from us vice president joe biden who stated , we are prepared to have a military solution for this operation , and taking out daesh ( isis ) .
the following was reported by press tv yesterday , but as yet , we can not corroborate the story : the united states denies its special operations troops have taken over an airfield in northeastern syria , near the country s border with iraq and turkey .
a spokesman of the united states central command ( centcom ) said friday that the military denied that us forces have taken control of any airfield in syria .
however , a spokesperson for the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) told al jazeera earlier this week that the us special operations forces had taken over the airfield near the city of rmeilan in syria s hasakah province to support kurdish fighters against the daesh ( isil ) takfiri group .

we re looking for opportunities to do more , and there will be boots on the ground i want to be clear about that but it s a strategic question , whether you are enabling local forces to take and hold , rather than trying to substitute for them , carter told cnbc from the world economic forum in davos , switzerland .
i don t think we or anybody else can substitute for them , but there s a lot we can do to enable them , including being on the ground with them .
