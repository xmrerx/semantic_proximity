lisbon ( reuters ) - a women s rights group has called a rally to protest against a portuguese court ruling that upheld a light sentence for a woman s attackers on the grounds they may have been driven to it by her adultery , an offence punishable with death in the bible .
judges neto de moura and maria luisa arantes rejected the prosecutors appeal to toughen the suspended sentence and fine , saying the depressive state of the two defendants - the woman s former husband and her former lover - was a mitigating factor .
we read in the bible that an adulteress should be punished with death , the judges in the porto court of appeal wrote .
they also referenced the symbolic sentences given to men who murdered adulterous wives in the late 19th century in portugal .
these references are merely intended to stress that the society has always strongly condemned adultery by a woman and therefore sees the violence by a betrayed , humiliated man with some understanding , they wrote in their oct. 11 verdict .
the umar women s union for alternative and response called the verdict in portugal s second-largest city revolting and said it perpetuated the ideology of victim-blaming .
evoking the bible does not combine with the rule of law in our country and discredits the judicial norms , umar said in a statement .
in the 2015 attack , one of the men assaulted and held the victim while the other attacked her with a nail-spiked club .
her injuries were not life-threatening .
both were convicted and sentenced to pay large fines in addition to suspended time in prison of about a year each .
umar and the feminist movement por todas nos ( for all of us women ) called a protest rally in downtown lisbon for friday .
protests were also called in porto under the slogan male chauvinism is not justice , but crime .
ultra-orthodox patriarchy - one of the cornerstones of the fascist dictatorship of antonio salazar up until the 1974 revolution - still survives in parts of portugal .
