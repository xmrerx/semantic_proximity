HARARE (Reuters) - Lawmakers from President Robert Mugabe s ruling party will meet at the party headquarters on Monday to discuss impeaching the 93-year-old leader after a noon deadline passed without him resigning, ZANU-PF s chief whip Lovemore Matuke said.
The ruling party removed Mugabe as ZANU-PF president and first secretary on Sunday, capping a dramatic week after the military seized power on Wednesday saying it wanted to remove criminal elements around the president.
