Hillary Clinton s campaign also announced Sunday night that it had canceled tentatively planned events with Sen. Bernie Sanders for Monday.Instead, her primary rival will now be on the campaign trail Wednesday in Iowa and Wisconsin instead.
Wednesday s Des Moines stop was added to make up for appearances tentatively scheduled in Iowa on Monday, October 3, the campaign said in a release.Sanders will be in Des Moines, Iowa, in the morning, and will host rallies in Madison and Green Bay, Wis., in the afternoon.He will discuss the Democratic nominee s plan to build an economy that works for everyone, not just those at the top, and Donald Trump s plan, which would benefit himself and other millionaires and billionaires, the campaign said.Though unclear if it s related, the schedule change comes a few days after audio from a February fundraiser leaked that made public Clinton s take on fans of her then-rival Sanders, who she suggested were overly idealistic.
There s just a deep desire to believe that we can have free college, free healthcare, that what we ve done hasn t gone far enough, and that we just need to, you know, go as far as, you know, Scandinavia, whatever that means, and half the people don t know what it means but it is something that they deeply feel, she said.Sanders, who ran for president as a member of the Democratic Party, said of course it bothered him that Clinton said he sold a false promise to his supporters.But, he said Sunday, his supporters should still vote for her.
