if you d prefer breakfast , then there is another fbi available french toast , bacon and ice cream , also for $ 10.duffy s irish pub , situated at 2106 vermont ave nw , will have their james comey show featuring the covfefe cocktail .
although few details are known about the event or the contents of the covfefe cocktail , duffy s is decked out with 15 screens and serves what have been voted the best wings in dc , hopefully all left ones.another option is the partisan , located at 709 d st nw , and their comey viewing party .
the partisan will be opening at 10 am for all of the comey action , but suggest grabbing breakfast at red apron butcher s d street location first .
after that , you can pull up a seat in the partisan and watch it all go down while enjoying either a last word or drop the bomb cocktail at $ 6 each.unfortunately , not everyone wanting to watch the show with an early morning drink will be in washington , however , those in houston , tx , will be in luck with axelrad at 1517 alabama st playing host to the comey testimony viewing the super bowl of washington .
axelrad will open at 8:45 am and will be offering $ 1 off their political drinks including impeachmint and bad hombre .
muffins , granola , and coffee will also be available.who said you had to stay home to enjoy all of the comey testimony fun on thursday morning ? featured image via eric thayer/getty images
