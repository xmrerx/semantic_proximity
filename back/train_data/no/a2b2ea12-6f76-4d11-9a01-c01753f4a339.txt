barcelona - prime minister mariano rajoy urged catalans to turn out in force in a december election to restore normality to a region buffeted by attempts to split from spain .
in his first visit to barcelona since madrid imposed direct rule on catalonia and sacked its separatist leaders , rajoy said the dec. 21 election would safeguard the economy and stop companies moving out of the economically important region .
we want a massive turnout to begin a new political era of tranquillity , normality , coexistence and respect , rajoy told the catalan wing of his conservative people s party ( pp ) .
we must urgently bring back normality to catalonia ... to reduce social tension and stop damage to the economy .
despite opposition to the early election imposed by madrid as a way to resolve the impasse , the two leading pro-independence parties , pdecat of deposed leader carles puigdemont , and the erc , have said they will participate .
however , they failed to agree to run on a united ticket , potentially harming the separatist camp s chances of winning a majority in the regional parliament .
the far-left pro-independence cup party , whose support was key to puigdemont s government , decided on sunday to run in the upcoming election .
madrid s imposition of direct rule on catalonia has widened a rift between political parties both in regional politics and at the municipal level .
on sunday , the party of barcelona mayor ada colau voted to break its pact to govern with the catalan socialist party ( psc ) , citing the latter s support for the application of direct rule .
some 54 percent of spaniards evaluate positively madrid s handling of the catalan crisis , but only 28 percent of catalans share this view , according to a poll for newspaper el pais .
on saturday , 750,000 people marched in barcelona to call for the release of separatist leaders from pre-trial detention .
