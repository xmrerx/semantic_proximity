This GOP civil war just keeps getting more entertaining.Sarah Palin helped create Ted Cruz by endorsing him for the Senate in 2012 and now she is destroying him four years later after he called Trump supporters such as herself low information voters.
Basically, he called Palin stupid and she threw a hissy fit about it.
You know, because the truth hurts.Anyway, America s village idiot took aim at Cruz on her Facebook page in a rant shredding the Texas Senator with the same slams that have been used against her in years past.
Calling GOP frontrunner supporters low information disengaged voters, Ted Cruz s insinuation reeks of all the reasons America knows the status quo has got to go , Palin wrote.
The arrogance of career politicians is something at which the rest of us chuckle, but Cruz s latest dig strays from humorous into downright nasty.
And then really let him have it.
Where s information on any Cruz success whilst in his short, half-term U.S. Senate seat, proving his resume s advantage over another career politicians s lawyerly executive inexperience that includes never having created a single private sector job, but boasting of his constitutional law teacher creds?
(Remember America experimented with that resume before; how d that work out for the country?)
Then she proceeded to list even more reasons why Cruz is a bad candidate, including his association with Glenn Beck, her mortal enemy.
She also threw Carly Fiorina in his face by quoting her word for word on how she felt about Cruz prior to endorsing him.Info on consistency with his big endorsement this week, as Carly tells it like it is so very recently?
Ted Cruz is just like any other politician.
He says one thing in Manhattan, he says another thing in Iowa.
He says whatever he needs to say to get elected, and then he s going to do as he pleases.
I think people are tired of a political class that promises much and delivers much of the same.

In the 24 hours, Cruz has been the butt of one of President Obama s jokes, called out as a liar by Donald Trump at the GOP Debate, and has now been trashed by the queen of the Tea party trailer park.
I think we can all agree we need more popcorn if this feud continues.Featured image: Flickr/Flickr
