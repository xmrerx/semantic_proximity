chicago ( reuters ) - illinois ’ governor on wednesday proposed boosting the shrinking ranks of the illinois state police in an effort to quell a steady increase in gun violence spilling over from chicago ’ s neighborhoods onto the city ’ s expressways .
bruce rauner ’ s proposed budget would add a projected 170 troopers through two cadet classes , one this year and another during the 2019 fiscal year .
seventy of these troopers would be sent to the chicago area .
“ those officers will allow us to send more patrols to the chicago area , to the expressways to counter the violence that has spilled over onto the highways there , ” the republican governor told lawmakers in his springfield budget address .
the number of illinois state police troopers has declined significantly since 2008 when there were 2,105 sworn officers , according to state police data .
that number dropped by more than 400 troopers to 1,671 as of last year .
rauner took office in 2015 .
feuding between rauner and democrats who control the legislature has kept illinois without a full operating budget since july 2015 , which has meant no cadet hires for the state police in 2015 and 2016 .
a six-month fiscal 2017 budget expired on dec. 31 .
at the same time , the number of shootings on chicago-area expressways has consistently increased , with law enforcement placing the blame on increased gang activity .
there were just nine chicago-area expressway shootings in 2011 and 2012 .
shooting incidents jumped to 19 in 2014 from 16 in 2013 .
the number nearly doubled to 37 in 2015 and rose again to 47 in 2016 .
three of last year ’ s shootings were fatal .
there have been two confirmed shootings on the expressways so far this year and six others that are unconfirmed , illinois state police spokesman jason bradley said by email .
the violence in 2016 came as part of a broader surge in violence across chicago , the nation ’ s third most populous city .
with the additions to police numbers , there will be an increase in overall state police headcount of about 140 to an estimated 2,651 for the 2018 fiscal year from an estimated 2,511 for fiscal 2017 .
the cost of the two classes for the 2018 fiscal year will be $ 10.5 million , the proposed budget said .
the annualized cost of the new officers , including salaries and benefits , will be $ 20 million .
