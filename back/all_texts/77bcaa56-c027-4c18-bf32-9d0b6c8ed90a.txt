Donald Trump might be desperately trying to win over the Latino vote with his false claims that he loves Hispanics, but he s going to have a really hard time especially when he continues to expose himself as a racist in his everyday interactions.On Monday, Trump s campaign cancelled an interview with freelance journalist Marcos Stupenengo at the very last minute.
Stupenengo, who is originally from Argentina, was already in the Trump Tower and had gotten the campaign s approval to do the interview with Trump for TV Azteca.
While he was waiting for Trump, Stupenengo took a phone call and was heard talking in Spanish.
Nearly as soon as the words came out of Stupenengo s mouth, the Trump campaign did a complete 180 and turned him away.
According to a Buzzfeed report: But as he waited to conduct the interview, Stupenengo received a call, and began speaking in Spanish.
That s when the Trump campaign informed him they had no interest in taking part in an interview with him, according to a source with knowledge of the incident.
Once Trump s campaign decided to cut the interview, one of Trump s Secret Service agents was forced to tell Stupenengo that he had to leave.
The agent apologized to Stupenengo, and said that he didn t know what was happening.
When Buzzfeed reached out to Stupenengo, the journalist s comments were short: I can say that after 13 years of journalism worse things have happened to me.
Team Trump is actually lying through their teeth and denying that this incident ever happened.
Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said: There was no interview scheduled.
We do not know this individual or anything about the alleged situation.
Stupenengo isn t the only Spanish-speaking reporter that has been shunned by Trump.
Last August, Trump kicked Univision s Jorge Ramos out of a press conference, telling him to Go back to Univision.
