mexico city ( reuters ) - two human heads were discovered in a cooler outside an office of broadcaster televisa in the mexican city of guadalajara , authorities said on tuesday .
it was not clear who the heads belonged to , but the cooler contained a threatening message signed off with cjng , the spanish initials of a drug gang , the jalisco new generation cartel , a security official in the western city said .
a second official at the office of the jalisco state prosecutor said the cooler was left outside an office of the televisa station .
however , media in the state suggested the gruesome find was directed at an official , not at the broadcaster .
elsewhere in the city , authorities found a second cooler containing a message threatening a judge , and a bag with suspected human remains with another threat , the second official added .
both officials declined to be identified .
in recent years , the cjng has become one of the most powerful mexican drug gangs , and authorities blame it for violence that has convulsed much of central and western mexico .
