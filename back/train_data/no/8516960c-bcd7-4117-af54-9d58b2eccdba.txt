the media and the democrat party has been coming down pretty hard on president trump for not doing enough to call out the rise of hateful anti-semitism , as though trump has a direct line to the anti-semites .
well , as it turns out , the first person to be arrested for his involvement in a string of bomb threats that were made to jewish community centers is an openly racist , leftist journalist .
let that sink in .
when 31 year old disgraced journalist juan thompson was arrested in connection with making threats against eight jewish community centers , he immediately took to twitter ( where his feed is filled with hateful , racist views ) to blame a white former girlfriend for framing you so you d be raped in jail what else ?
juan thompson , of missouri , is accused of making the threats as part of an extensive cyber-stalking campaign against his ex-girlfriend to harass and intimidate her , the u.s. attorney s office for the southern district of new york announced on march 3.thompson was fired by the intercept last february after he was accused of fabricating sources in a story about the charleston church shooting.here s what you need to know.1 .
during one threat , thompson claimed there were bombs in a middle school & there was going to be a jewish newtown in the now-retracted article , thompson had claimed that scott roof had speculated during a phone conversation that dylann roof may been driven to murder nine black churchgoers at a charleston , south carolina church because he kind of went over the edge when a girl he liked starting dating a black guy two years back .
thompson s report was picked up by dozens of other news outlets.thompson was hired by the intercept s founding editor-in-chief , john cook , in november 2014 .
reed replaced cook , a former editor of gawker.com and the current executive editor of gawker media , in december 2014 .
prior to the intercept , thompson had reported in chicago for dnainfo and interned at the local npr affiliate , wbez .
* on twitter , thompson claimed that the threats were made by his ex-girlfriend , the fbi said in court documents.the fbi has been investigating more than 100 bomb threats made to jewish community centers , schools and the anti-defamation league , along with other jewish organizations , since early january .
there have been at least five waves of attacks , with multiple threats coming on the same day.police do not believe thompson is the main suspect behind the majority of the threats , abc news reports .
police sources told abc news that thompson appears to have taken advantage of national news coverage of the threats to continue his ongoing harassment against his ex-girlfriend in revenge for her breaking up with him .
heavyhere are a few sampling of tweets ( language warning ) from the racist liberal reporter juan thompson : wow .

# ebt https : //t.co/xfvvwrq7or juan m. thompson ( @ juanmthompson ) february 22 , 2017daily caller the criminal complaint states that threats made to the jewish establishments across the country by thompson were under his name and the name of his ex-girlfriend , and occurred after the relationship ended .
the threats were made by both email and phone calls.dozens of jewish community center bomb threats have occurred throughout the country since president donald trump s election , and liberal groups and politicians have attacked trump for them .
the president condemned the threats during his address to congress , but he reportedly said earlier that day , sometimes it s the reverse , to make people or to make others look bad .
