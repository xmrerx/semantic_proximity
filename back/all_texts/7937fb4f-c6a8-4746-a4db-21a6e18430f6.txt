On Thursday, the U.K. voted to leave the European Union, and, of course, conservatives here in the U.S. rejoiced because they see it as a move for freedom and sovereignty, and against big government (they don t get it, in other words).
Trump is one of those people who panders to xenophobic, anti-globalists despite profiting from the global economy, and he got it way wrong when he got to Scotland and gave a speech at his new golf course there.Here s what he tweeted upon his arrival in Scotland:Just arrived in Scotland.
Place is going wild over the vote.
They took their country back, just like we will take America back.
No games!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 24, 2016 Place is going wild, and, They took their country back.
Really?
Scotland voted to remain in the E.U.
by well over 60 percent.
Once again, we have to ask, Bro, do you even news?
Those in the Twitterverse, who know what s what, decided to answer that question by taking him task for this in a way that only Twitter can (warning: explicit language).
@realDonaldTrump They voted to STAY, dear.
If Mrs. Doubtfire were real & back in Scotland she would would smack you on the head.

BobSmithWalker 45% (@BobSmithWalker) June 24, 2016Is there anything better than seeing pissed-off citizens of the U.K. hurling insults at King Donald the Trump?The result of Brexit will be another independence referendum in Scotland.
Scotland feels that they were dragged out of the E.U.
against their will, and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said they will get legislation underway immediately for that referendum.
Scotland tried an independence referendum about two years ago, and it failed by a not-insignificant margin, but Brexit might be what Scotland needs to push that referendum through.None of that matters to Trump, though, because the truth doesn t matter to him.
He ll twist the truth to suit his agenda, and his agenda is highly nutty.
In fact, it s so nutty that this is what he was apparently greeted with at Turnberry:Donald Trump surrounded with red golf balls with swastikas on them in Scotland pic.twitter.com/QPHfFoEcpd [email protected] (@ToonArmyMIA) June 24, 2016It s amusing that he tried to paint Scotland, of all countries, as supportive of Brexit.
They are anything but, and he needs to learn to read news that doesn t come from InfoWars.Featured image by Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images and Twitter
