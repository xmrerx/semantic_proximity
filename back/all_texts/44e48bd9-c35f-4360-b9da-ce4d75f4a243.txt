The son of Sonny and Cher successfully caused Fox host Sean Hannity to blow a gasket.On Thursday, Hannity literally asked Wikileaks to discredit the CIA and help Russia in support of Donald Trump.Is it possible, likely or can you confirm instances where the CIA used Malware to Attribute cyberattacks to other nations?
Possibly Russia https://t.co/Ay1Ms84TPT Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 9, 2017Trump s Russia scandal has been raging since before he took office and has only grown in recent weeks, especially after Trump tried to distract from the scandal by falsely accusing President Obama of wiretapping him.So Hannity wants hackers to break into the CIA because he thinks our top intelligence agency is hiding information that proves the Russia scandal is being manufactured to hurt Trump.Hannity soon began calling for Trump to purge the government to stop leaks.It s time for the Trump administration to purge the deep state saboteurs from the government hear more at 10pm #Hannity Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 10, 2017Hannity s paranoid un-American tweets caught the attention of Chaz Bono, who proceeded to call Hannity what he is: a fascist traitor.So is the new Right, all Putin loving, reality denying, traitors to the principals our country was founded on, Fascists, Just Like #Trump?
https://t.co/lfpfxIEpr2 Chaz Bono (@ChazBono) March 10, 2017After Hannity noticed Bono s tweet, he had a meltdown, complete with typical conservative attacks on liberals and Hollywood and inviting Bono on his pathetic program for the purpose of exposing him.Chaz clearly you are just ignorant.

https://t.co/ALfTFWrlIy Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) March 11, 2017Sean Hannity is a poisonous media personality and college dropout who wouldn t know what facts are if they hit him square in the face.
He is part of Trump s propaganda machine who is desperate to help Trump kill the continuing investigation into his Russia scandal.
By asking an outside entity to attack the CIA, Hannity is inviting hackers to gain access to classified information that could be used against us by our enemies.
That makes Hannity a true traitor to the United States.Featured image via creenshot
