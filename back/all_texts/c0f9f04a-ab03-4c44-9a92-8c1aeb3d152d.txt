WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley said on Wednesday he intends to call former Paul Manafort, former campaign manager for President Donald Trump’s 2016 presidential bid, to testify before the panel, an Iowa newspaper reported.
Grassley, an Iowa Republican, said Manafort would be subpoenaed if necessary and could be questioned on anything including his presence in a June 2016 meeting in New York involving the president’s son, Donald Trump Jr., and a Russian lawyer, the Des Moines Register said.
“We’re working very close on this and we’ve already agreed that we’re going to bring Manafort before our committee,” the paper quoted Grassley as saying in a call with reporters, describing his cooperation with Senator Dianne Feinstein, the ranking Democrat on the committee.
