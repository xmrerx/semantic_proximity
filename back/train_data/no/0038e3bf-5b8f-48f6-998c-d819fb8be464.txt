bangkok ( reuters ) - thai authorities have arrested a local tour guide for indecent behavior at a temple after she posted a photograph online that showed her standing on a pagoda , police said on saturday .
the arrest came as photographs of naranon narakamin 44 circulated on social media earlier in the week , including one that showed her standing behind a tourist with one of her foot placed on a pagoda at bangkok s iconic temple of dawn .
it is unclear when the photograph of naranon was taken but it has outraged many conservatives who say her behavior was disrespectful to buddhism .
tourist police deputy commissioner police major general surachet hakpal told a press conference on saturday that the tour guide has exhibited inappropriate behavior at a buddhist temple , and set a bad example for thais and foreign tourists .
naranon , who has publicly apologized for her action , will be charged with breaching the national archaeological site act and could face up to one month jail term and a fine of up to 10,000 baht ( $ 307.50 ) , the police said .
in thailand , using feet to point at people or objects , particularly sacred objects is considered very rude .
revealing clothing and inappropriate action at places of worship is also considered offensive in the predominantly buddhist country .
last month two american tourists were arrested and fined for public indecency after posing for a butt selfie at a temple in bangkok .
