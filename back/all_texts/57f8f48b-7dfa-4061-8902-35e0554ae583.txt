CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt s Coptic Church has rejected a meeting requested by U.S. Vice President Mike Pence during his visit later this month in protest against Washington s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, MENA state news agency reported on Saturday.
The Church excused itself from hosting Mike Pence when he visits Egypt, citing President Donald Trump s decision at an unsuitable time and without consideration for the feelings of millions of people , MENA said.
