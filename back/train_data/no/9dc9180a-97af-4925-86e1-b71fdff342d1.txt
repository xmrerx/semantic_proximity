warsaw ( reuters ) - poland has asked the european commission to withdraw its legal proceedings against warsaw over its migrant relocation quotas and said it was ready to fight its case in court , the foreign ministry said on wednesday .
in july the commission sent so-called reasoned opinions to poland , czech republic and hungary urging them to apply eu migration rules .
poland has sent a motion to the european commission requesting it to discontinue its ongoing infringement procedure .
should it be continued , poland is prepared to argue its case before the court of justice of the european union , the ministry said in a statement .
poland s ruling law and justice party ( pis ) has repeatedly criticized the eu s relocation scheme for each member state to host a given number of migrants to help ease pressure on greece and italy , struggling with mass arrivals of migrants across the mediterranean .
earlier on wednesday , interior minister mariusz blaszczak said in a statement that the eu s relocation policy was dangerous .
paris , stockholm , brussels , berlin , manchester , barcelona , blaszczak said , referring to recent attacks by islamist militants which have killed scores of people .
how many more european cities have to be hit by terrorists so the european union wakes up ?
so the european commission acknowledges that accepting blindly all those who come to the european shores is akin to putting a noose around europe s neck ?
