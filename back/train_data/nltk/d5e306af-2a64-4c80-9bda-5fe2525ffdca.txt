conservative busy mourn death antonin scalia come way make sure one president obama pick make court
well angry scheme right next prediction right positively fumingaccording nbc news tom goldstein supreme court expert mastermind behind scotusblog predict president obama nominate current attorney general loretta lynch replace recently decease scalia
call lynch serious possibility goldstein go say fact lynch vet recently attorney general also make practical president nominate relatively short order
goldstein prediction sharp contrast robert reich believe pick would judge sri srinivasan nominate lower court appeal president obama
however seem goldstein prediction make much sense practically politicallythis nomination could political windfall left disaster right
many republican vow refuse allow obama nominee onto court image problem come race help refuse confirm lynch
would first black woman make supreme court would look like bunch racist misogynist
accord goldstein lynch history career prosecutor make difficult paint excessively liberal
essentially loretta lynch nomination everything left need completely paint gop obstructionists corner
already serious problem racial minority way treat loretta lynch confirmation position attorney general afford treat badly
people already call racism misogyny want maintain kind semblance respect come race issue minority community block lynch second time
goldstein point issue lynch nomination pose gop nothing short perfect think administration would relish prospect republican either refuse give lynch vote seem treat unfairly confirmation process
either eventuality would motivate black woman voter
oh surely hope true
