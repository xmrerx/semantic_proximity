julian assange met with john pilger of dartmouth films to discuss what he thinks is the most significant revelation of all in his wikileaks email dumps related to the clinton s.here is a stunning portion of their exchange : assange : isil and isis are funded by saudi arabia and qatar , the governments of saudi arabia and qatar .
i think this is the most significant email in the whole collection .
pilger : isil or isis is created largely with money from the very people who are giving money to the clinton foundation .
assange : yes .
pilger : that s extraordinary !
rt reporter : there it is in startling new simple terms .
julian assange is saying he has proof that the world s most brutal terrorists and the clinton foundation have been bankrolled by the same people
