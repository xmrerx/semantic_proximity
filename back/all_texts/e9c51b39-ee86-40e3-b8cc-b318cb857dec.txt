After Roy Moore s ugly loss in the Alabama Senate race last night, President Trump took the high road and congratulated Democrat candidate Doug Jones who won by less than 1% of the vote.
President Trump tweeted: Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory.
The write-in votes played a very big factor, but a win is a win.
The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time.
It never ends!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 13, 2017Trump then tweeted an explanation as to why he didn t get behind Roy Moore in the primary, and chose instead, to support his Republican opponent Luther Strange.President Trump tweeted: The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election.
I was right!
Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 13, 2017The verified Anderson Cooper account responded to President Trump s tweet by saying, Oh Really?
You endorsed him you tool!
Twitter user Blackish Jimmy Kimmel took a screen shot of Cooper s tweet before it was deleted:This is CNN #FactsFirst That awkward moment when You're @AndersonCooper trying to convince people that #FakeTweets are being made from your Verified twitter account.

CNN Communications (@CNNPR) December 13, 2017Normally, we d give the Twitter user the benefit of doubt, but in the case of #VeryFakeNewsCNN, they haven t proven that they re ethical or fair in their treatment of President Donald Trump in the past, so there s really no reason for most of America to believe that Anderson s tweet to President Trump wasn t sent by him.What are you thoughts?
Do you believe CNN, or do you think Cooper Anderson simply sent a response to Donald Trump that he deleted after he realized he exposed his hate for our President?
