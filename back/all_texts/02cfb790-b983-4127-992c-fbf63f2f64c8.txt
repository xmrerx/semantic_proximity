Rapper Killer Mike, will appear in front of a SOLD OUT audience at the prestigious MIT University today.
Here s a clip from an interview with Jew hater and racist Louis Farrakhan:He s a follower and admirer of this racist Jew hater.
He s clearly one of the most angry black men in the entertainment business.
After watching this interview, you will better understand the mentality of the protestors on the streets who are getting in the faces of cops (of whom the majority are good men and women protecting and defending the citizens within their jurisdiction).
It should be noted, that Killer Mike s dad was a police officer or dirty pig as he likes to call them.Killer Mike views rap as social activism, and never shies away from sharing his opinions on race and abuses of power.
Whether he s condemning institutionalized corruption in Reagan or speaking out against police brutality with Run The Jewels Close Your Eyes, if Killer Mike thinks it s messed up, he s going to let you know.This Friday, April 24, MIT students will have the chance to hear how messed up race relations are, when Killer Mike delivers a lecture titled Race Relations in the U.S. at the school.
According to the press release, he ll be talking about how current and advancing technology are shaping race relations.
(We re guessing that he doesn t regard drone surveillance as a democratizing agent.)
Chances are pretty good that Killer Mike will also be addressing the spate of well-publicized police shootings of young unarmed black men and their systemic social consequences.Here is an example of the most recent music video by Killer Mike.
****WARNING****Violence and strong language***Killer Mike s lecture is the second in MIT s new Hip-Hop Speaker Series, which opened with Young Guru.
The series is the result of a collaboration between the Arts at MIT and TapTape, an MIT-based music startup.
The series stated goal is to bring together leaders in hip-hop with leading faculty and students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
That s a perfect opportunity for a mathematics seminar featuring Dr. Octagon and Dr. Roman Bezrukavnikov, Professor of Algebraic Geometry.While Killer Mike s lecture certainly sounds intriguing, Friday s lecture is exclusively available to MIT students and is already sold out.
But if you re jonesing to hear Killer Mike drop some heated words, there s always the extremely-NSFW Big Beast video, featuring Bun B and T.I.We were going to include the Big Beast video, but after viewing this disturbing video, which includes nudity, horrific acts of violence and an attempted rape scene, we decided against it.
The driver in the video is wearing a Ronald Reagan mask because Killer Mike believes that all of the problems plaguing the black community are as a result of Ronald Reagan s presidency.
