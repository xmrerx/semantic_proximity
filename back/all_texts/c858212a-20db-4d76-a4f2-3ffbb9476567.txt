MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia and Saudi Arabia have signed a roadmap for cooperation in the atomic energy sector, Russian state nuclear company Rosatom said on Thursday.
The roadmap comprises a number of steps needed to implement a cooperation program that was signed by the two nations during Saudi King Salman s visit to Russia in October.
Saudi Arabia, which wants to reduce oil consumption at home, is considering building 17.6 gigawatts of nuclear-powered electricity generating capacity by 2032 and has sent a request for information to international suppliers to build two reactors in the kingdom.
Last month Rosatom said it hoped to win the Saudi tender.
