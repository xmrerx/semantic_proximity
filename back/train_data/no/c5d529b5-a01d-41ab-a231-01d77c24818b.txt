gaza ( reuters ) - the palestinian islamist group hamas named as its new deputy chief on thursday a formerly turkey-based commander whom israel has accused of orchestrating a lethal triple kidnapping that helped trigger the 2014 gaza war .
saleh al-arouri s promotion comes as hamas seeks to close ranks with u.s.-backed palestinian president mahmoud abbas after a decade-old schism , in an entente israel says will not revive peace talks unless hamas recognizes its right to exist and disarms .
the palestinian information center , a hamas-linked news site , said arouri , who was born in the occupied west bank and was exiled by israel in 2010 after long stints in its prisons , had been elected as deputy to the group s leader ismail haniyeh .
he ( arouri ) is now the hamas movement s no .
2 man , the site said .
twenty-three years of detention and expulsion have not weakened the resolve of the leader saleh al-arouri , 51 .
after three israeli teens were abducted and killed in the west bank in june 2014 , arouri - then in istanbul - claimed responsibility in the name of hamas .
israel responded with a west bank security sweep which , along with the revenge killing of a palestinian youth from jerusalem by a group of israelis , spiraled into a 50-day war in the gaza strip , hamas fiefdom .
gaza health officials say 2,100 palestinians were killed in the conflict , while israel put the number of its dead at 67 soldiers and six civilians .
israel also pressed ankara s islamist-rooted government to crack down on arouri , describing him as the mastermind of the kidnappings and other hamas militant attacks .
hamas sources said arouri left turkey in late 2015 for qatar and later lebanon .
they declined to give his current location .
