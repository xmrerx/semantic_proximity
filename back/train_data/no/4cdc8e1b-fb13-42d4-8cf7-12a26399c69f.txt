reuters reports : the united states expelled 35 russian diplomats and closed two russian compounds in new york and maryland in response to a campaign of harassment against american diplomats in moscow , a senior u.s. official said on thursday.the move against the diplomats from the russian embassy in washington and consulate in san francisco is part of a series of actions announced on thursday to punish russia for a campaign of intimidation of american diplomats in moscow and interference in the u.s. election.in fact , this morning the hill wrote that the obama administration is under intense pressure to release evidence confirming russian interference in the presidential election before leaving office .
the administration has provided exactly zero documentation , but that has not stopped the media machine from parroting the claims and repeating it ad nauseam , in hopes the emotional appeals through repetition will make it factual.just as bad , the hill also writes that nor has obama corroborated subsequent leaks from anonymous officials contending that the cia believes the campaign was an attempt by russian president vladimir putin to ensure donald trump s victory .
