london ( reuters ) - britain s queen elizabeth formally opened scotland s biggest infrastructure project in a generation - the third bridge across the river forth - on monday , exactly 53 years after she opened the second .
the 91-year-old monarch met with workers and school children who had gathered on the bridge before cutting a blue ribbon to mark its opening , as a flotilla passed underneath and the royal air force s red arrows display jets flew overhead .
the 1.35 billion-pound ( $ 1.7 billion ) queensferry crossing , the longest bridge of its type in the world at 1.7 miles ( 2.7 km ) , connects the capital edinburgh to scotland s north .
the queen described all three magnificent structures crossing the river forth , built in three separate centuries , as feats of modern engineering .
the queensferry crossing joins its iconic and historic neighbors to create not only a breathtaking sight across the firth of forth , but to provide an important link for so many in this community and the surrounding areas , she said in a statement .
built with 35,000 tonnes of steel and 150,000 tonnes of concrete , the crossing reaches 210 meters ( 690 ft ) above high tide , standing as tall as about 48 london buses stacked on top of each other .
barriers deflect the wind and shield vehicles from the huge gusts common on the forth .
