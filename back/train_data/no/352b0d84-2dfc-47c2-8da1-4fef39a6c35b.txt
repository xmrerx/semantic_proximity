veterans are the backbone of the biker community , cox continued .
we are patriots and unlike black lives matter and the other leftist idiots , we love our cops .

i went to that first trump rally with my bikers for trump sign and the next day the picture was all over the internet , big jim told breitbart news .
donald trump will say the things that need to be said and do the things that most politicians are too afraid to do .
big jim will be making the long ride from phoenix to cleveland to be in cleveland during the convention and he sent a letter to his fellow bikers telling them why they should join him .
in a copy of the letter provided to breitbart news he says : none of the bikers breitbart news spoke with wanted to say how many would attend .
the city of cleveland gave us a hard time with our permits and so we haven t really counted how many people are coming , cox said .
it s probably better because i want to work with all the other people who are drawn to be there .
i ll be meeting with the secret service and the state and local police to let them know what we re all about .
