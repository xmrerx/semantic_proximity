austria s president really said this !
during a talk with students , the president said if rampant islamophobia continues , there will come a day when we must ask all women to wear a headscarf all of them !
out of solidarity towards those who do it for religious reasons .while the president in austria has little influence over austrian policy , this is a very symbolic move by the president .
it could be in response to the banning of the headscarf in austria just last month .
legislation was put in place to ban the burqa causing protests from muslim women who called the government islamophobic .here s a take on what the president said from an austrian language alert !
