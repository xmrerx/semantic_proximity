in the course of hosting thursday s breitbart news daily , breitbart london editor-in-chief raheem kassam stood up for departed breitbart news executive chairman steve bannon , who has been under sustained attack from the left since becoming first donald trump s campaign chairman and now chief white house strategist.kassam recalled how he was a 27-year-old with his own website when he met bannon in late 2013 .
he came to me and he said , you know , i hear great things about you .
can you do what you do from inside breitbart ?
at the time breitbart was not a very well known name in the u.k .
i admit to being skeptical what was the commitment going to be ?
would i be taken care of ?
would i have editorial freedom ?
why do they want me , or trust me ?
he said .
but i knew of breitbart from my trips to cpac there s only ever been about 12 brits at cpac , in any one year , but i was always one of them , he continued .
in 2013 i took bannon at his word , and my life has just become a remarkable journey since .
and that s why they re calling him one .
they re projecting .
the liberal media , who has decided amongst themselves what the world should look like through their ideology sees people who stand athwart history yelling stop as the biggest threat to their androgynous , zombie civilization .
stephen k. bannon is the man who flew to london to hire me , this brown guy called raheem kassam from a muslim family to run his london operation , and he s now put him in the seat on his radio show .
swallow that , liberals .
swallow that , cnn .
swallow that , new york times .
