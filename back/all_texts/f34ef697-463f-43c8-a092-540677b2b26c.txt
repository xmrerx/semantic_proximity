A Texas lawmaker just defended Donald Trump s remark toward Hillary Clinton during the third and final presidential debate.
Clinton was discussing Social Security and Medicare when Donald interrupted her to say the Democratic presidential nominee is such a nasty woman.
Apparently Rep. Brian Babin (R-TX) agrees with Donald.
You know what, she s saying some nasty things, Babin told Alan Colmes on this show.
You think it s appropriate to call her a nasty woman?
Colmes asked.
Well, I m a genteel Southerner, Alan, Babin replied.
So that means no?
Colmes asked.
The radio host had to repeatedly press Babin to answer the question.
You re ducking me, Congressman, Colmes said when Babit tried to pivot the topic to immigration.
No, I think sometimes a lady needs to be told when she s being nasty.
Oh, really?
Colmes asked.Babin replied, I do.
My assessment is that Mrs. Clinton has got so much baggage, Babin continued.
I think she s done some nasty things.
Colmes asked Babin about Trump s rigged election rhetoric.
We re going to have to agree to disagree, Babin said.The Texas lawmaker went on to blame the media for Trump s negative coverage.Colmes asked who he thought would win in November.
Im sure hoping that Mr. Trump wins, Babin said.Audio courtesy of CNN:Babin initially backed Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) but later threw his support behind the GOP presidential nominee.We re glad that Babin brought up nasty things.
Trump was recently outed in a video bragging about sexually assaulting women in 1995.
Since then, he s gone on to call women fat, slobs, pigs and dogs.
He s attacked his sexual assault accusers looks.
The man-baby candidate is whipping his supporters into a frenzy by telling crowds that the election is rigged.
Trump is a Nasty Man.
But thank you, Babin, for mansplaining that women need to be put in their place.The word genteel doesn t mean what the Texas lawmaker thinks it means.Image: Gage Skidmore via Flickr
