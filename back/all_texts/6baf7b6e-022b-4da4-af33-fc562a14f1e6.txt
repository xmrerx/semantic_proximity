Michelle Obama showed off her amazing singing voice in Wednesday night s edition of Carpool Karaoke on James Corden s Late, Late Show.
The segment, hyped all this month, featured the First Lady rocking out to Stevie Wonder s Signed, Sealed, Delivered, Beyonce s Single Ladies, and a number of other hit songs.Midway through, rapper Missy Elliot joined Obama and Corden, helping them sing This is For My Girls and Elliot s own Get Your Freak On.
Obama told Corden that rocking out in the passenger seat was a treat for her because she spends so much time being driven around.
Asked what she will miss the most when she leaves the White House, Obama told Corden that the people will be the biggest hole that forms in her life.
These are people you see every single day.
They help you.
They love you, Obama said.
To walk away from people you see every day, that s going to be hard.
However, she says that the freedom they gain once they leave will be a worthy trade-off for the luxuries they will lose when they move out though she refused to say if there was anything she might accidentally slip in her bag on the way out the door.Obama also took the opportunity to promote her Let Girls Learn initiative, which focuses on educating the more than 62 million girls worldwide who are not in school.Michelle Obama has previously appeared on Disney show iCarly, Parks and Recreation, Nickelodeon s Kids Choice Awards, Sesame Street, and a number of other shows.
All through her husband s presidency, Michelle has shown herself to be an intelligent, talented, classy woman who knows how to have fun while still bringing focus to important issues (like educating girls across the world).
In fact, one must wonder if there s anything she can t do.Watch the segment below:Featured image via screengrab
