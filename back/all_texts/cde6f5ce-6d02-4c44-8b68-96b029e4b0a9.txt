At this point, we have to wonder if the pressure of finding himself outside his bubble and confronted with the overwhelming realization that everyone hates him has gotten to Donald Trump.
On Wednesday, The Donald woke up, ironed his Klan robes, gave Ivanka a deep, creepy good morning kiss, and sat down on his couch in yellow-stained underwear to whine about Obama on Twitter (at least, this seems how a typical Trump morning would go), and tweeted his latest, dumbest attack on the President.Trump s new daily ritual of childishly attacking President Obama on Twitter hasn t gone well for him, with his delusion rapidly progressing from I could have beaten Obama to I did beat Obama while the world mocked him at levels no normal human being could withstand.
But this is Trump.
He s special.
Somehow he remains not immune but oblivious to the fact that outside his little fan club, he s just an orange-faced bigot with tiny hands who got absolutely trounced in the popular vote.
Somehow, he is able to find the strength to keep his little thumbs moving faster than his brain to produce award-winningly ignorant, misinformed, and utterly idiotic tweets at an astounding rate.
Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks, The Donald tweeted.
Thought it was going to be a smooth transition NOT!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016President Obama has done nothing to impede the transition.
In fact, he has been downright helpful, even giving The Donald advice the many times Trump came crawling and begging for it.
I must tell you, you know, I never met him before this.
I never spoke to him before this.
I really I do like him, Trump said after finally meeting the man he had been attacking for years, even questioning his citizenship.
I love getting his ideas.
And I may differ in many cases.
I differ very greatly.
But apparently, The Donald is done playing nice with the man who had been devoting overtime to ensuring that the President-elect doesn t f*ck things up too badly.
As is becoming almost a daily ritual, the Internet came down hard on Trump for his latest nonsensical attack on the guy who has been going out of his way to ensure a smooth transition.
@realDonaldTrump fixed that Consumer Sentiment thing for you.

Thx!

@realDonaldTrump Oh honey, he's really going to be a valuable resource for you.
And this whole "not" business isn't very Presidenty!

@realDonaldTrump No one says "NOT" anymore.
Also avoid "Just sayin", "My bad," and "Where's the beef."

Horus Gilgamesh (@AwkwardBible) December 28, 2016President Obama has been nothing but helpful, offering only reasonable criticisms for little things like teaming up with Putin to hack and pervert out electoral process.
But the ease with which President Obama takes up space in Trump s head is impressive.
Obama doesn t need to attack.
He just needs to exist and Trump goes insane.Featured image via Getty Images (Matthew Cavanaugh)/screengrab
