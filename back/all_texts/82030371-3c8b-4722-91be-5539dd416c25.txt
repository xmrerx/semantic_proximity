Conservative Christian leaders who still support Donald Trump despite his sexism and remarks about sexual assault are feeling the wrath of Christian women right now.When Donald Trump was caught bragging about groping women, hitting on teen girls, and accused of sexual assault, conservative Christians like Tony Perkins, Ralph Reed, and Pat Robertson all said that they continue to support the Republican nominee, thus proving that they care more about power than they do about morals.Indeed, the hypocrisy of conservative Christian leaders, when it comes to Trump, has been stunning to watch unfold because these men are literally giving Trump a pass.
If Trump had sexually assaulted men instead of women, you can be sure Perkins and the rest of his ilk would not only be calling for Trump to be removed from the ballot, they d be calling for his execution.But because Trump assaulted and insulted women, these so-called men of God don t give a damn.And they pissed women off in the process, which is why 700 Christian women from across the country signed a letter to these male leaders calling them out for continuing to support Trump.
As Christian women we are appalled by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump s recorded remarks that disparage women and condone sexual assault, the women wrote.
Such language cannot be dismissed as locker room talk.
Mr. Trump must offer public contrition that fully acknowledges the seriousness and depravity of his actions.The sin of misogyny has caused many of us to experience sexual assault or sexually abusive language that threatened our safety, dignity and well-being.Christian leaders cannot condone such violent speech about women as a minor mistake or an innocent attempt to be macho.
These excuses teach our young people that such language is acceptable and do further harm to those who have been abused.We urge all religious leaders to preach, teach and help their communities heal from the twin sins of sexual violence and misogyny.
While we are disheartened by Mr. Trump s toxic words, we believe this moment presents an opportunity to teach our daughters and sons that they are loved, and to teach all Americans how to speak out against sexually violent language.Unlike the charlatans who still support Trump and dare to call themselves Christians, these 700 women are demonstrating true Christian values.Donald Trump s words and behavior is unacceptable and should be condemned by religious leaders, not ignored or excused.
Ignoring and excusing his behavior and words only sends a message to men within and outside of the congregation that it is okay to treat women like shit.
But it s not okay and Donald Trump should not be allowed to be President of the United States.Any conservative Christian who still supports Trump after these latest revelations even after whining for years about how America supposedly needs a president with strong moral values in the White House, should be ashamed of themselves because they not only revealed themselves as hypocrites, they disgraced their church and their God.Featured Image: Dashboard Jesus via Amazon
