mike ditkaoutspoken hall of famer mike ditka became the latest high-profile name to weigh in on san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick s national anthem protest friday when he ripped the signal-caller s actions.in an interview on shan & rj on 105.3 the fan in dallas ( h/t cbs dfw ) , the espn analyst said of kaepernick s actions : i think it s a problem anybody who disrespects this country and the flag .
if they don t like the country they don t like our flag get the hell out.i have no respect for colin kaepernick he probably has no respect for me , that s his choice .
my choice is , i like this country , i respect our flag , and i don t see all the atrocities going on in this country that people say are going on.additionally , ditka painted an optimistic picture regarding the united states during his radio appearance : i see opportunities if people want to look for opportunity .
now if they don t want to look for them , then you can find problems with anything , but this is the land of opportunity because you can be anything you want to be if you work .
if you don t work that s a different problem .
