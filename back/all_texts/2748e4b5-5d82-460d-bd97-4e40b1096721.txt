Uncle Pat is off his meds again.
The crazy host of the Christian Broadcasting Network s decades-long hit show The 700 Club has endorsed Donald Trump.
Even though Trump never showed any indication of being a devout Christian prior to his running for the GOP presidential nomination, Robertson has decided that Trump is the man if you want to vote Christian.
In a recent event at Regent University, Robertson gave Trump glowing praise, saying that he inspires us all.
He also said that Trump is the most amazing people in the whole country.
Here is the video, via Right Wing Watch:Christian Broadcasting Network reporter David Brody also heaped praise upon Trump, and afterwards, Trump continued his now-familiar anti-immigrant rhetoric to his crowd of rabidly racist supporters.
He went went so far as to insist that any policy but his would result in, and I quote, the idea that every illegal gets an air conditioner.
Nevermind the fact that this has never been proposed by anyone who likes the idea of legalized paths to citizenship it s just plain stupid.
The only plan for Trump right now is to promote pure, unabashed hatred toward anyone not straight, white, male, and Christian.
Thanks to the GOP creating this hateful base, it should be no surprise that these are Trump s supporters.Thusly, it is also no surprise that one of those said supporters is hateful television preacher Pat Robertson.Watch another video of this nonsense below:Featured image via video screen capture
