PRETORIA (Reuters) - South Africa s revenue service will ask parliament to investigate global auditor KPMG for its immoral conduct in releasing details of a confidential report it produced for the tax agency, commissioner Tom Moyane said on Monday.
KPMG cleared out its South African leadership en masse on Friday after damning findings from an internal investigation into work done for businessmen friends of President Jacob Zuma.
Moyane said SARS had cut all ties with KPMG.
