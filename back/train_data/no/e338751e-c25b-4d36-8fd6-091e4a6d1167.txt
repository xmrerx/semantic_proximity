milan ( reuters ) - italian interior minister marco minniti met libyan mayors on saturday to renew a commitment to fight people trafficking as part of an agreement signed earlier this year between rome and tripoli .
the meeting , which libya s interior minister also attended , focused on fostering alternatives to human smuggling and trade in contraband in libyan towns heavily affected by illegal immigration .
youngsters in those areas and the whole of libya deserve a future of hope , free from the threats of criminal organisations ... both sides said in a statement issued by italy s interior ministry .
in february , italy pledged money , training and equipment to help the u.n.-backed libyan government curb the flow of migrants to europe .
more than 600,000 migrants have reached italy by sea from north africa since 2014 , most of them from libya where people smugglers have operated with impunity in the turmoil that followed the fall of muammar gaddafi in 2011 .
the subject of immigration is dominating italy s political agenda ahead of general elections due before may next year , with public opinion increasingly hostile to migrants .
after a surge in migrant arrivals from libya at the start of the year , numbers have recently slowed and minniti said earlier this month those trends would continue in august .
saturday s meeting also included , among others , italy s ambassador to tripoli and representatives of the european commission .
