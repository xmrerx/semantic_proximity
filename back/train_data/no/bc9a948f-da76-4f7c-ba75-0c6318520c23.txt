amsterdam ( reuters ) - the international criminal court ( icc ) said on monday it would refer jordan to the u.n. security council for failing to arrest sudanese president omar al-bashir when he visited amman in march .
the court issued arrest warrants for bashir in 2009 and 2010 over his alleged role in war crimes including genocide in sudan s darfur province .
jordan , as a member of the icc , is obliged to carry out its arrest warrants .
sudan is not a member of the hague-based permanent international war crimes court , and the icc therefore does not have automatic jurisdiction to investigate alleged war crimes there .
however , the u.n. security council referred the case to the international court in march 2005 .
the security council has the power to impose sanctions for a failure to cooperate with the icc , but has so far not acted on court referrals .
a diplomatic row broke out when bashir visited south africa in 2015 and pretoria failed to arrest him .
south africa s government argued that doing so would have been a violation of the immunity bashir enjoys as a head of state .
that argument was rejected by south african courts as well as the icc .
the icc ultimately did not refer south africa to the security council , however , saying it was not clear that doing so would have any effect .
kenya and south africa have threatened to withdraw from the icc over perceived bias against african countries .
burundi , which is under icc investigation , has actually withdrawn .
bashir is accused by icc prosecutors of five counts of crimes against humanity including murder , extermination , forcible transfer , torture and rape , as well as two counts of war crimes for attacking civilians and pillaging .
he faces three counts of genocide allegedly committed against the fur , masalit and zaghawa ethnic groups in darfur , sudan , from 2003 to 2008 .
