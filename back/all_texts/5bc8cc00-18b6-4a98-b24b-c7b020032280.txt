Someone finally asked Kellyanne Conway how she can look herself in the mirror every morning and work for Donald Trump.During an event sponsored by the University of Virginia s Center for Politics, high school student Maaike Laanstra-Corn asked Conway how she can rationalize working for Trump even after he bragged about grabbing women by the p*ssy and has been hit with multiple accusations of sexual assault.Rather than just own up that she s a disgrace to the female gender and a terrible human being who sold her soul to Satan, Conway whined about the question and scolded the student instead.
Women are tired of the same argument and the same thing you are presenting to me right now, Conway claimed according to The Hill.
I m glad that people looked at [those attacks] and said, You know what?
That s an argument that will not create a single job in my community, not bring back a single of the 70,000 factories that have been closed, will not deter one member of ISIS from doing their bloodletting here or anywhere else in the world.
In other words, Conway completely ignored that fact that her boss is a creep who sexually assaults women and gets away with it.
And then Conway scolded her for asking a legitimate question.
For you to use sexual assault to try to make news here I think is unfortunate, but it also doesn t matter because Donald Trump promised he ll be a president of all Americans.
Yeah, all Americans who aren t black, Latino, Muslim, or female.Conway had a chance to give a serious answer to a serious question.
Donald Trump s treatment of women should be taken seriously, not brushed off as irrelevant.But once again, Conway defended her boss by attacking a woman, something she constantly did during the campaign whether it was Hillary Clinton or all the women who came forward with their stories of how Trump violated them.She should have trouble sleeping at night.Featured image via screenshot
