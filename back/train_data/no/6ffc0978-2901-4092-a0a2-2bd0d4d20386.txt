the president doesn t believe that he s secretly strategizing to benefit one candidate or one political party , earnest said .
he s in a tough spot , and he s the one who will be in a position to defend his actions in the face of significant criticism from a variety of legal experts , including individuals who served in senior department of justice positions in administrations led by presidents in both parties .
