new delhi ( reuters ) - india is disappointed by china s decision to again block its request at the united nations to blacklist the head of a pakistan-based militant group , the country s foreign ministry said in a statement on thursday .
india , backed by the united states , has been trying to get maulana masood azhar on a u.n. list of groups with ties to al qaeda , blaming his group for a series of attacks in india , including one on its parliament in 2002 and another last year on an airbase .
but china , a member of the u.n. security council , has repeatedly put a technical hold on the indian request citing a lack of consensus , a claim india rejects .
we are deeply disappointed that once again , a single country has blocked international consensus on the designation of an acknowledged terrorist and leader of u.n.-designated terrorist organization , masood azhar , india s foreign ministry said .
china s foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said last month there were clear rules for listing a person or group as a terrorist , and that china has always believed the relevant u.n. committee should operate on the principles of objectivity .
the wrangling over masood azhar , a longtime indian foe , has become a thorny issue in ties between china and india .
india worries that china will stick by its all-weather friend , india s arch-foe pakistan .
india strongly believes that double standards and selective approaches will only undermine the international community s resolve to combat terrorism , india s foreign ministry said .
