This is not how Ted Cruz must have envisioned his campaign would end up heading into the nation s very first caucus in Iowa on Monday.
His Cruzin to Victory tour bus wasn t exactly the epitome of its name, either.
While he visited the Johnson County Fairgrounds earlier, it needed to be towed after getting stuck in the mud.This is very ironic, indeed.
Just a bit over a week ago Ted Cruz was quoted as saying, I m not going into the mud with personal insults and attacks (on Donald Trump).
Well, Senator, you just went into the mud, quite literally.Pic via InstagramAccording to a report by Phillip Elliott from Time magazine, Cruz had to hitch a ride with aides to his next tour stop while his bus was towed.
That s not the kind of image you want to project just before the voters of Iowa nominate the next future President of The United States.
It certainly can t be good public relations; draw as many analogies as you must.Pic via Twitter.Cruz needs every bit of good press he can get right now.
Virtually every poll shows Donald Trump having a huge lead on him.
And Cruz can t afford that.
Whoever wins Iowa would get a must needed head start in the race.
With Trump up in practically every state, Iowa is the momentum Cruz has been desperately seeking.
Unfortunately, the only momentum Cruz is getting right now is coming from the back of tow truck.You d think the Cruz campaign would, at least, try to play damage control and be the first to report it, instead of being outed by the media.
It s possible they could have made a joke out of it but they didn t. They didn t even mention it.
That s no way to run a campaign.
