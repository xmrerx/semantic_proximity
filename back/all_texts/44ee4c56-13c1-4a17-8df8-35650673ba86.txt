The numbers are in, and Megyn Kelly Today is dragging down the Today show franchise, an insider explained to Page Six.
Not only are ratings plummeting since Megyn Kelly joined the Today franchise, but the numbers show Kelly s lead-in has also affected Kathie Lee [Gifford] and Hoda Kotb s show, which follows straight afterwards, a source said.
They ve taken a huge hit with Megyn as their lead-in, the insider added.Kelly s hour of Today is down 32 percent compared to a year ago.
And Kathie Lee & Hoda is down 26 percent.
Too many people are tuning out NBC.
Hoda and Kathie Lee had been a bright spot in the mornings.
People are alarmed, the source said of the slide.
