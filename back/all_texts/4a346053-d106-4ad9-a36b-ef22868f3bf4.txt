Anyone with a heart knows that Donald Trump s public humiliation of former Miss Universe Alicia Machado is simply beyond the pale.
Trump called the poor girl Miss Piggy, and referred to her post-pageant weight gain as, quote, a real problem.
Well, The Donald isn t that slim and trim himself, so those in glass houses and all that.
He is getting a lot of richly deserved backlash to how he is treating this beautiful, intelligent woman, and we all know how Trump responds to criticism he can t take it all, and he lashes out.Well, we can soon look for him to be taking nasty shots at Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill on Twitter, because she had an absolutely brilliant response to the Miss Universe flap.
Sen. McCaskill tweeted out that maybe Trump should have daily weigh-ins, and also snuck in a sly shot that referenced his health, seeing as how he keeps taking cheap shots at Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton s health.
Without further ado, here is the tweet:The D women Senators have talked & we're concerned about Donald's weight.
Campaign stress?
We think a public daily weigh-in is called for.
Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) September 28, 2016This is sure to get under The Donald s notoriously thin skin.
No way is he going to be able to let this go, and that will keep this unseemly story in the news cycle for days to come.
Personal feuds are what Donald Trump trades in whether it s attacking a Gold Star family who dares to criticize him, a judge whose rulings he doesn t like, or a minister who refused to let him use her pulpit to attack a political opponent and they ve never done him any good in this election cycle.This particular personality trait is one of the more glaring demonstrations of what makes Donald Trump so manifestly unfit for the presidency.
The more it s on display between now and election day, the better.Good going, Senator McCaskill!
He ll definitely take the bait.
