Donald Trump s wife Melania has made some shocking comments in regards to a barrage of anti-Semitic remarks that Trump supporters directed towards a reporter.
After Julia Ioffe did a profile of Mrs. Trump for GQ magazine, her life was threatened and numerous hateful comments were sent her way on social media.Now in an interview, Ms. Trump alleges that Ioffe brought the hate barrage on herself.
I don t control my fans, Melania said in an interview with DuJour.
But I don t agree with what they re doing.
I understand what you mean, but there are people out there who maybe went too far.
She provoked them.
Ioffe, who is Jewish, received calls from people playing Hitler speeches, told that she should be burned in an oven, be shot in the head, and was sent photoshopped images of her in a concentration camp uniform.The Trump campaign has received overt public support from anti-Semites and white power groups who believe that the candidate will further their goals of racial purity.
One white nationalist paid for robocalls for Trump s campaign and was recently selected as a Trump delegate for the Republican Convention in Cleveland, only stepping down when national media began reporting the story.In the same interview, Melania Trump claims that Donald Trump is not Hitler, but he has pushed rhetoric about tracking and barring Muslims that come right out of the same playbook that Hitler utilized against Jewish people.Trump s rhetoric on Mexicans comes from the same place, calling them criminals and rapists, rhetoric which inspired supporters to beat up and urinate on a Latino man in Massachusetts.
Those assailants are now headed to prison.Despite the hate from his campaign, Republicans are now stuck with Trump.
He turns off many of the voters the party said it needed to be viable nationally, but did enough to blow out all the other nominees.
