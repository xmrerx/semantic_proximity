washington ( reuters ) - democratic national committee vice chair tulsi gabbard resigned from her post on sunday to endorse democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders , following months of rising tensions within the group .
“ i think it ’ s most important for us , as we look at our choices as to who our next commander in chief will be , is to recognize the necessity to have a commander in chief who has foresight , who exercises good judgment , ” gabbard , a u.s. representative for hawaii , said on nbc ’ s “ meet the press. ” gabbard , one of five vice chairs , and her committee colleagues have butted heads over a thin debate schedule in the months leading to democratic voting contests for the party ’ s nomination , with gabbard calling for the group to add more debates to the calendar .
sanders , a u.s. senator from vermont , is competing with former secretary of state hillary clinton for the democratic nomination to run for president on nov. 8 .
critics have said the scheduling of the debates has favored clinton , who is better known than sanders and is favored to win the nominating contest .
committee chair debbie wasserman schultz issued a statement accepting gabbard ’ s resignation , calling her a friend and praising the active-duty veteran for her service in the armed forces .
“ congresswoman gabbard is a role model who embodies the american ideal that anyone can dream big and make a difference , ” wasserman said in the statement .
“ she is also a colleague in congress and a friend , and i look forward to continuing to work alongside her when our party unites behind whoever emerges as our nominee. ” ( reporting by alana wise ; editing by david goodman and jonathan oatis ) this article was funded in part by sap .
