Most political campaigns prefer to spend the bulk of their money on ad buys, internal polling and other research, voting lists, campaign field offices, staff you know, the stuff a campaign actually needs if it wants to succeed.
However, it seems that Trump s campaign doesn t care about any of that.
Not only do they not have a ground game to speak of, but they don t spend their money on anything substantial.They re spending their money on hats.And t-shirts and signs but lots and lots of hats promotional merchandise that doesn t really do anything to further Trump s campaign beyond his very tired slogan, Make America great again.
The Washington Post conducted an analysis of Trump s final campaign finance filing with the Federal Election Commission.
They found the campaign has spent $1.8 million on polling over the last sixteen months, but they spent $3.2 million on hats.
Because clearly, those hats are the most important part of the campaign and nobody else gets that.Or so you d think with how Trump loves to look like a tool wearing those hats at his rallies.Trump keeps touting his business prowess as what makes him so eminently qualified to run this country, because reasons.
His campaign is running more like a business that thinks spending its money on endless advertising and promotional materials is better than, well, spending money actually running the company (or in this case, a presidential campaign).All told, Trump s campaign has spent more on hats than it has on payroll.
In fact, there are allegations going around that Trump is refusing to pay a lot of his campaign staff.
The Post s analysis found that the amount of money Trump has spent on hats is nearly three times what they ve spent on payroll.
That could be why they act like they can t afford to pay their staff which is just sickening.Add to that the fact that his hats (and other merchandise) are made in China, presumably to cut down on costs, and you have to wonder just how many hats they ve bought and how much they ve earned back.Featured image by Mark Wallheiser via Getty Images
