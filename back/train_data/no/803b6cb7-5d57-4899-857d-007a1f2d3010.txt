washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. state department said on monday the united states took north korean threats to use nuclear weapons seriously and urged pyongyang to halt its provocations , including testing nuclear devices and long-range rockets .
north korean leader kim jong un ordered his country last week to be prepared to use nuclear weapons at any time and to be ready to carry out a pre-emptive attack , state media reported .
his comments came as u.s. and south korean forces conducted annual military exercises amid heightened tensions on the peninsula following the north ’ s recent nuclear and missile tests , which prompted the united nations to impose new sanctions on pyongyang .
“ we certainly do take those kinds of threats seriously ... and again call on pyongyang to cease with the provocative rhetoric , cease with the threats and quite frankly , more critically , cease with the provocative behavior , the actual conduct , that has led to yet another round of international sanctions , ” state department spokesman john kirby said .
