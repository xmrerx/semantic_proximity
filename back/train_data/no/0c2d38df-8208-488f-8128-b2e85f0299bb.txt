tripoli ( reuters ) - libya s u.n.-backed government agreed with italy on saturday to establish a joint operations room for tackling migrant smugglers and traffickers as part of efforts to curb migrant flows toward europe , according to a statement .
libya is the main gateway for migrants trying to cross to europe by sea , though numbers have dropped sharply since july as libyan factions and authorities have begun to block departures under italian pressure .
more than 600,000 have made the journey over the past four years .
the agreement to set up the operations room was announced after a meeting in tripoli between the head of the u.n.-backed government of national accord ( gna ) , fayez seraj , libyan interior minister aref khodja , and his italian counterpart marco minniti .
a statement from seraj s office said the center would consist of representatives from the coastguard , the illegal migration department , the libyan attorney general and the intelligence services , along with their italian counterparts .
no details were given on the location of the center and how it would operate .
in the past , migrant smugglers have worked with impunity in western libya , where the gna has little authority over armed groups that have real power on the ground .
the italian navy already has a presence in tripoli port , providing technical assistance to libya s coastguard , according to italian and libyan officials .
the coastguard , which is receiving funding and training from the european union , has become more assertive in recent months in intercepting migrants and bringing them back to libya .
activists have criticized the policy , since migrants often face extreme hardship and abuse in libya , including forced labor .
migrants who are caught trying to cross to italy are put in severely overcrowded detention centers authorized by the interior ministry .
the gna has said it is investigating reports of migrants being auctioned as slaves in libya , after cnn broadcast footage appearing to show such auctions .
according to saturday s statement , seraj told minniti that despite the successes achieved in the migration file , the number of illegal immigrants outside shelters remains large and we need more cooperation , especially in securing the borders of southern libya through which these migrants flow .
