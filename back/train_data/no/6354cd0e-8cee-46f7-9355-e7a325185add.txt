( reuters ) - australia said on sunday it is stopping undesirables such as terrorists , pedophiles , organized criminals and drug smugglers from boarding flights to the country , defending its hardline immigration policy that has drawn criticism from rights groups .
immigration minister peter dutton said that australian border force airline liaison officers were operating in major transit airports to push those threats beyond our borders .
where other countries allow people to arrive and then assess the threat then , the australian model was to bar those considered a threat .
( liaison officers ) try to identify the threats particularly given that we ve got foreign fighters coming back through southeast asia and all over the idea is to stop them getting on planes , the minister told the nine network .
according to media , immigration officials prevented 1,043 passengers from boarding flights to australia since 2013 .
australia has seen the rise of nationalist , anti-immigration politics with far-right wing parties such as one nation garnering strong public support , while the popularity of the ruling center-right government has been languishing .
under its policy on asylum seekers arriving by boat , australia turns back unauthorized vessels at sea to their port of origin when it can and sends those it can not to controversial camps in the south pacific for long-term detention .
earlier this year , the government announced it would raise the bar for handing out citizenships by lengthening the waiting period , adding a new australian values test and raising the standard for english language as part of a shake up of its immigration program .
