When dealing with a candidate who has the maturity level of an elementary school student, you re going to have to expect name-calling, and now Donald Trump is now using this tactic against Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren.
Two very powerful women, but two very powerful women that aren t about to put up with his horseshit tactics.
They may have worked against his ridiculous Republican competition, but no, not now.
He ll be called out and taken to task.Which is exactly has what just happened when Trump decided to hit back at Warren s viral Facebook post calling him out.Trump took to twitter, several days after Warren called him out, and decided to try to pull his same old song and dance.
He tweeted:I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate.
I will defeat them both.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 6, 2016And then continues this name-calling for a few more tweets:Let s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren s records to see if she is Native American.
I say she s a fraud!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 6, 2016Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie.
She is not Native American.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 6, 2016Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders.
Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 7, 2016So, Elizabeth Warren comes right back at him and calls him what he absolutely is lame.
She wrote: I called out Donald Trump on Tuesday.
45 million saw it.
He s so confident about his counter punch he waited until Friday night.
Lame.
I called out @realDonaldTrump on Tuesday.

He's so confident about his "counter punch" he waited until Friday night.
Lame.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016Oh, but she didn t stop there.
She went after him HARD.
Goofy, @realDonaldTrump?
For a guy with "the best words" that s a pretty lame nickname.
Weak!
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016We saw what happened when birthers like @realDonaldTrump attacked @BarackObama.
They lost big.
American voters knew better.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016We saw when Scott Brown attacked my family & his staff made tomahawk chops & war whoops.
They lost big.
MA voters knew better.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016.
@realdonaldtrump is a bully who has a single play in his playbook offensive lies thrown at anyone who calls him out.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016.
@realDonaldTrump spews insults and lies because he can t have an honest conversation about his dangerous vision for America.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016But here's the thing.
You can beat a bully not by tucking tail and running, but by holding your ground.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016If you think recycling Scott Brown's hate-filled attacks on my family is going to shut me up, @realDonaldTrump, think again buddy.
Weak.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016The @GOP's hate-filled lies didn t scare me before, @realDonaldTrump.
And they don't scare me now.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016The @GOP's hate-filled lies didn t scare me before, @realDonaldTrump.
And they don't scare me now.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016.
@realDonaldTrump lied his way through the primaries without being held accountable.
That s over.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016Whatever @realDonaldTrump says, we won't shut up.
We won't back down.
This election is too important, & he won t step foot in White House.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) May 7, 2016The lesson to be learned here?
Don t fuck with Elizabeth Warren.
She s smarter than you, she s wittier than you, and she ll call you on your shit faster than you can say your own name.Good on you, Senator Warren.
Never stop being you.
Keep holding him to task and we will be standing right there with you.Featured Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images
