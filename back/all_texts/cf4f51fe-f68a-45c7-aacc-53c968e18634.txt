(Reuters) - Former New York Governor George Pataki endorsed Republican presidential candidate John Kasich on Thursday, less than a week before the state holds its primary election.
“John Kasich is the candidate who doesn’t just beat Hillary Clinton - he trounces her and will help us to regain Washington,” Pataki, who in December dropped out of the Republican race, told Fox News.
