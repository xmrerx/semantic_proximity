A San Antonio, Texas school is under fire for an outrageous skit portraying the assassination of President-elect Donald Trump by two 10th grade students.
The skit provoked outrage from the parents of a student who watched it unfold last week.
Harold and Melinda Bean said that in the skit, entitled The Assassination of Donald Trump, one of the boys made a gunfire sound effect with his cell phone as the other boy, portraying Trump, fell to the ground in mock death.Melina Bean made a great point when she explained her concern that the boys weren t punish enough: Younger children using their hands to simulate guns on the playground have been suspended, she said, and this was far worse.

Appropriate action was taken to reprimand both boys and their teacher, said Northside ISD spokesman Barry Perez.
The parents, however, believe more should have been done, including suspending the two students.
Honestly I have run out of words to describe how angry I am and how shocked I am that they re still in school today, Melinda Bean said.Younger children using their hands to simulate guns on the playground have been suspended, she said, and this was far worse.
The teacher apologized Monday, Harold Bean said, but that wasn t enough.
I don t understand how the teacher can repeat an apology and be right there back at work on Monday morning, he said.
Though we understand she is apologetic, it does not make the situation right.
Perez said campus officials investigated the incident and found that the teacher didn t condone it and stopped the skit.
But Harold Bean questioned why she allowed it to start once she heard the title.
Pardon my language but I think that it s a bunch of B.S.
if they re going to tell you the kids were stopped, Harold Bean.Via: mySA
