PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron condemned on Tuesday what appeared to be an intercontinental ballistic missile test conducted by North Korea and called for greater pressure on Pyongyang.
I condemn the new ballistic irresponsible trial of North Korea.
It reinforces our determination to increase the pressure on Pyongyang and our solidarity to our partners, Macron said on Twitter.
