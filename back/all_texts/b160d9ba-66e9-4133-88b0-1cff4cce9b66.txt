The Hill released controversial comments sore loser and RINO Senator John McCain made about Trump s leadership:Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) said American leadership was stronger under President Trump s predecessor, President Barack Obama, according to a Guardian report published Sunday.Asked if the country stood on sturdier ground under Obama s leadership, McCain said yes, according to the report.
As far as American leadership is concerned, yes, said McCain, who also vocally criticized many of the Obama administration s foreign policy decisions.For months, President Donald Trump has been trying to convince Cindy McCain a respected voice on refugees and other humanitarian issues and wife of Sen. John McCain, a Trump critic to join his administration.
Now, it s a done deal for both parties, according to two senior administration officials.After months of being offered and rejecting several potential posts in the Trump administration, Cindy McCain and the president came to the agreement of a Washington, D.C.-based ambassador-at-large position, which would focus on anti human trafficking efforts, refugees, and humanitarian-aid matters.
The title being kicked around internally is U.S. ambassador-at-large for human rights, though that title is subject to change, and it is unclear if a new office within the State Department would be created for her.
[Trump personally], aggressively courted her for this, one White House official told The Daily Beast.
It s a done deal now The president had floated several positions before this is the one that stuck.
A formal announcement of that new role is expected within a matter of weeks.
