if anyone wonders how the reverend al sharpton got started in the shake down business look no further than this loud mouth who blames everyone but his own community for their situation .
we live in a free market society .
the black man in this video is free to apply for a business loan and open a business in his community .
the thing is , no one stopping any black member in any urban community from opening a local business.to blame someone else for the state of his community is only deflecting from the real problems crime-ridden neighborhoods across america are facing .
perhaps his anger should be directed at our first black president who has been at the helm while black unemployment numbers and crime have skyrocketed to an all time high .
