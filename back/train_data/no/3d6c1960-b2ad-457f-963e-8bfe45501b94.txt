( reuters ) - double olympic champion mo farah continued his build-up to the rio games by breaking david moorcroft ’ s 34-year-old british record in the 3,000 meters at a diamond league meeting in birmingham on sunday .
farah , the 5,000 and 10,000m gold medalist at the 2012 london olympics , won in seven minutes 32.62 seconds after striding out at the front in a determined effort to beat moorcroft ’ s 1982 time of 7:32.79 .
“ did i get it ? , ” the 33-year-old , who pulled out of the meet last year after being angered by allegations surrounding his coach alberto salazar , who denied violating anti-doping rules , asked a bbc interviewer .
“ that ’ s incredible ...
i thought i ’ d just missed it .
it was a bit tight on the last lap , i had to dig in , ” added farah , who paid tribute to his boyhood hero muhammad ali before the race by striking a boxing stance .
former olympic and world heavyweight champion ali died on friday aged 74 and sunday ’ s meeting held a minute ’ s applause for the man known as ‘ the greatest ’ .
“ he was a big hero of mine and i send all my condolences to his family and friends , ” said somali-born farah , who will defend his titles in rio in august .
kenya ’ s mathew kiptanui was second in 7:44.16 with compatriot hillary maiyo third .
kenyan david rudisha , the olympic 800m champion and world record holder , ran the second fastest 600m ever with his time of 1:13.10 , not far off the world best of 1:12.81 in the little-run distance .
he felt he could have gone faster .
“ i think i lost it in the last 100 meters , ” he said .
apart from farah and rudisha , there were four other world leading times at the meet including for conseslus kipruto of kenya in winning the men ’ s steeplechase in 8:00.12 and for his compatriot asbel kiprop who took the 1,500 in 3:29.33 .
qatar ’ s mutaz barshim won the men ’ s high jump with a world leading leap of 2.37 meters , while cuba ’ s yarisley silva produced a year ’ s best of 4.84 in the women ’ s pole vault .
britain ’ s greg rutherford , another 2012 olympic champion , was beaten in the long jump for the first time since last july .
he said after his jump of 8.17 left him fifth , with american marquise goodwin winning comfortably with a mark of 8.42 , that he was struggling with a “ mild neck injury ” from the previous round in rome last week .
“ we have tried to get it 100 percent ready in time .
sadly i have made it worse on the first landing and i am currently unable to move my neck , ” he said .
“ the doctor thinks it is a bad whiplash but it won ’ t affect my olympic bid .
i am positive the british athletics medical staff will be able to fix it over the next week. ” australia ’ s sally pearson , the olympic 100 meters hurdles champion , made her competitive return a year after shattering her wrist in a fall in rome but finished seventh in a race won by american kendra harrison in 12.46 seconds .
