donald trump doesn t seem the forgiving type , so it s no surprise he hasn t let barack obama s comments yesterday stand .
obama said trump was unfit to be president so what did the republican candidate have to say in response ?
he answered in the only way he knows how , by flinging mud back at the person who called him out .
here s what he said : what s also interesting about trump s reply is his use of obama s criticism about trump s knowledge of foreign policy against him .
yesterday , obama said trump didn t appear to have basic knowledge around critical issues , in europe , in the middle east .
instead , trump says , obama should look at his own record before lashing out .
that seems a particularly pertinent point the day after obama s infamous red line was once again crossed in syria .
the middle east is in turmoil , and whilst it s not entirely obama s fault , his refusal to intervene has not helped.in his reply to obama , trump leaves the best bit to last though .
after hitting out at obama s record , he says : i think it just means he s concerned i m going to win it s difficult not to agree with trump ; after all , if he was such a no-hoper , why would obama bother to speak out in the first place ? via : spectator
