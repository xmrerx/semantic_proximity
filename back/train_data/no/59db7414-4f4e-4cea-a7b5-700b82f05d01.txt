geneva ( reuters ) - a 30-year prison sentence for a woman in el salvador who said her child was stillborn is appalling , u.n. human rights spokeswoman liz throssell said on friday .
the second court of appeal of san salvador on wednesday upheld the sentence for teodora vasquez , who was convicted in 2008 of aggravated homicide in the death of her child the previous year .
prosecutors said vasquez strangled the baby after birth .
her lawyers said she suffered health complications and the baby was stillborn .
since 1997 , el salvador has had one of the world s most severe laws against women who have abortions or are suspected of assisting them .
it is absolutely astounding , astonishing , appalling that these women are in essence being convicted of having a miscarriage , having a child stillborn , throssell said .
they are basically being convicted for being women , for losing a child and for being poor , she said , adding that at least 41 other women have been similarly convicted over the past decade or so .
the u.n. was not aware of el salvador jailing any women from wealthier backgrounds under the same law , throssell said .
