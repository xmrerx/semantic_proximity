PARIS (Reuters) - Hundreds of pro-Palestinian activists on Saturday staged a protest in Paris against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s planned visit to France on Sunday.
Protestors carried Palestinian flags and photos of French President Emmanuel Macron marked accomplice for hosting Netanyahu following the U.S. President Donald Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel.
Netanyahu, who has welcomed Trump s move, will meet with Macron on Sunday ahead of a meeting with European Union foreign ministers in Brussels on Monday.
France said on Friday the United States had sidelined itself in the Middle East by recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital.
Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on French TV that the U.S. move went against international law .
Trump says he has a project.
Let him present it, so that this intervention can be wiped out by the restart of the peace process, he said.
Macron and Turkey s President Tayyip Erdogan will work together to try to persuade the United States to reconsider the decision, a Turkish presidential source said on Saturday.
France has been a supporter of the Palestinian cause.
In 2014, the French National Assembly passed a non-binding motion calling on the government to recognize Palestine, but the government has not officially done so.
