moscow ( reuters ) - russian president vladimir putin , who is running for re-election in march , has proposed writing off some of the tax debts accumulated by russian individuals and small businesses .
a total of about 80 billion roubles ( $ 1.4 billion ) would be written off under putin s proposal , a high-ranking official told reuters .
speaking at his annual news conference , putin said that some of the debt accumulated because of flaws in russia s tax system .
i think that people should be freed from these payments , and it should be done in the most de-bureaucratic way , without the need to apply to a tax inspection , he added .
he estimated that debts of 42 million people worth 41 billion roubles should be written off .
the high-ranking official told reuters that putin was speaking about debts for property tax and penalties accrued before 2015 that the tax service recognizes as uncollectible .
the debts of 2.9 million self-employed entrepreneurs worth more than 15 billion roubles should also be written off , putin said .
he also proposed writing off profit tax , accumulated by some russian citizens on their so-called waived debts .
according to the high-ranking official , the latter would mean writing off 22 billion roubles .
