warsaw ( reuters ) - poland will remain reliant on coal for power generation for now but in future should consider turning to nuclear energy and renewable sources , the new prime minister said on tuesday in his first policy speech .
mateusz morawiecki , a western-educated former banker fluent in german and english , was sworn in on monday , replacing beata szydlo , a coalminer s daughter , who had promised to keep mining jobs when the industry struggled to survive in 2015 .
morawiecki s did not signal a major departure for now from the pro-coal policies of his ruling law and justice party ( pis ) , but his comments did suggest the government could give a push to a much-delayed plan to build poland s first nuclear power plant .
today coal is the basis of our energy industry and we can not and do not want to give it up , morawiecki said .
for our future generations , i would also like alternative energy sources to develop freely in poland .
our task is to guarantee poland the energy independence at low carbon emissions and this is why we look favorably at nuclear energy , he said .
he also said the nation should consider renewable power sources .
a project to build a nuclear power plant was announced in 2009 , but has been hit by several delays , with financing posing one of the main obstacles .
energy minister krzysztof tchorzewski has been pushing to build the nuclear plant but needs cabinet approval for a renewed push .
morawiecki may have given those plans a boost .
pis has long championed poland s use of coal , a fuel that is falling out of favor in a global push to cut greenhouse gases .
but global pressures to shift away from coal and poland s shrinking deposits are encouraging the country to consider its future plans for power generation , analysts say .
