MOSCOW (Reuters) - Stronger ties between Russia and China are good for everyone, Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Thursday, adding that Moscow and Beijing would remain long-term strategic partners regardless of the result of Russia s 2018 presidential polls.
Putin also told his annual news conference that China was looking with great interest at Russia s northern sea route in the Arctic which could significantly cut the time for shipments of goods between Asia and Europe.
Putin said Russia would support China s further involvement in Russian projects, including in the energy sector.
