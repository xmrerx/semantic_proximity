johannesburg ( reuters ) - south africa s nb publishers said on friday it had received a letter from the state security agency ( ssa ) ordering it to pull a new book on president jacob zuma off the shelves as it contravened the intelligence service act .
the publishers said they stood by the president s keepers - those keeping zuma in power and out of prison , and its lawyers would respond to the letter sent by the ssa .
the book by journalist jacques pauw alleges millions of dollars in taxpayers money flowed into the bank accounts of spies and zuma s government and details the actions of law-enforcement agencies .
it alleges zuma failed to submit tax returns for the first five years of his presidency .
the president s office has issued a statement rejecting the accusations contained in the book , adding that zuma had declared all income received to tax authorities .
the ssa warns nb publishers in a letter seen by reuters that it will launch criminal charges if the book is not withdrawn .
noting your admission that you did not seek the views of the people apparently implicated , it is not surprising that this book is replete with inaccuracies , the ssa said in the letter sent to nb publishers by its lawyers kgoroeadira mudau inc .
the letter said the book contained elements in contravention of the country s intelligence service act .
no ssa spokesperson was available for further comment .
a spokeswoman for nb publishers said its lawyers were handling the matter .
we have received the letter but have not pulled the book yet because our attorneys have been given time to respond , jean pieters , nb publisher s spokeswoman said .
