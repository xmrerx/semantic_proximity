paris ( reuters ) - france said on wednesday turkey s decision to buy a missile defense system from russia was not cause for comment by nato allies , remarks that were in contrast to other members that have raised concerns over the deal .
turkey , whose relations with its allies have frayed in recent months , said it opted for the s-400 because western companies had offered no financially effective alternative .
but nato officials have voiced disquiet over the purchase of missiles incompatible with alliance systems .
the purchase of military equipment by turkey is a sovereign choice which does not need to be commented ( upon ) by members of the atlantic alliance , foreign ministry spokeswoman agnes romatet-espagne said in response to a question on whether this was a blow to the alliance .
the french comments come a day before the country s foreign minister begins a two-day visit to turkey , where he will discuss regional issues , promoting support for a new peace initiative on syria .
he will also broach the subject of the arrest of french journalist loup bureau , who was seized by turkish border guards on the frontier with iraq in early august .
