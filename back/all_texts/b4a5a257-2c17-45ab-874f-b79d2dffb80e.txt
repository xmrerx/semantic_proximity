Stephen Colbert got an exclusive interview on CBS The Late Show when Donald Trump s publicist called in.
The publicist has been in the news lately since it was revealed that Trump pretended to be his own representative while dealing with the media in the 1980s and 1990s.The Washington Post reported that Trump often called up reporters who were covering him and pretended to be John Miller and John Barron.
Trump then would use the fake identity to push stories about how he was purportedly dating models and celebrities like Madonna.Trump denied that he behaved this way in an interview with the Today show, but had previously admitted to it in court.The presumptive Republican presidential nominee also seemed to panic when reporters asked about it in a scheduled interview on Friday.Then, Friday afternoon, Washington Post reporters who were 44 minutes into a phone interview with Trump about his finances asked him a question about Miller: Did you ever employ someone named John Miller as a spokesperson?
The phone went silent, then dead.
When the reporters called back and reached Trump s secretary, she said, I heard you got disconnected.
He can t take the call now.
I don t know what happened.
Trump s behavior is so odd and out of the ordinary that mainstream media reporters are often completely confused as to how to cover him.
How do you address a narcisstic millionaire pushing xenophobia and racism who is woefully unprepared for the presidency?
Perhaps more mocking from comedians like Colbert is the only rational way to deal with it.Certainly the late night comedy writers are getting almost as much raw material maybe more as they did when George W. Bush was president.
What s bad for the country and national political conversation is most definitely great news for the world of comedy, and they re not stopping any time soon.Featured image via YouTube
