lima ( reuters ) - six farmers were shot dead in the peruvian amazon by a group of masked men in an apparent dispute over land rights , a police officer and a tribal leader said on thursday .
five bodies , one with hands and feet bound , had been thrown in a river and a sixth was found by the side of an unpaved road in the jungle region ucayali , police officer raul huari said .
the victims were part of a community of peasant farmers that had refused to leave the lands they work on when pressured by oil palm growers , said robert guimaraes , the head of an indigenous federation in ucayali .
witnesses testified that a group of between 30 and 40 men carrying shotguns tried to kill some 20 farmers altogether , huari said .
they said they showed up , surrounded them and just started shooting .
fortunately , some managed to escape , he said .
in my 24 years of working i ve never seen anything like this .
huari said the murders appeared to be linked to a land dispute , and a special police unit and prosecutors were carrying out investigations .
the murders occurred on sept. 1 , marking the three-year anniversary of the killing of four indigenous activists who had faced threats from loggers in a different part of ucayali .
after the 2014 murders , which came as peru was hosting a global environmental summit , the government promised to do more to protect remote amazonian villages that often lack land titles from violent clashes with squatters .
guimaraes said native communities continue to face violent threats in ucayali and that no one has been convicted for the 2014 murders .
peru s culture and interior ministries did not respond to requests for comment .
the native shipibo community of santa clara de uchunya , which lives near where the farmers killed , has tried to repel oil palm growers from their lands for years , said guimaraes .
