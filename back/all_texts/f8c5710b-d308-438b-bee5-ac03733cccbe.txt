It s infuriating that there are still men who act like total pigs.Ellie Parker only wanted to have a wonderful first Valentine s Day with her girlfriend.
So she took her to Asahi Japanese Steakhouse in Lafayette, Indiana.
They had expected good service and good food to make their evening special and memorable.
But it only became memorable for all the wrong reasons.She explained on Facebook that she and her girlfriend attended dinner with a group and the chef came out to their table to to cook the food right there in front of them, which is pretty cool.
Not cool is what the chef did next.
He proceeded to ask the women at the table if they were with their boyfriend or husband, and then acted completely rude when Parker said she was with her girlfriend.That s when the chef crossed the line from professional to creepy asshole.
He not only told both women that they needed a man, he inquired as to whether he could be that man as if he could turn the lesbian couple straight.But Parker describes the incident much better.
I m not normally one to complain on social media, but the service I had at dinner tonight warrants a little complaining.
I took my girlfriend out to Asahi for our first Valentine s Day together.
Our chef came to grill our food for us and was asking everyone if the person with them was their boyfriend or husband.
He got to my girlfriend and I and asked where our valentines were.
We told him we were each other s valentines.
We were holding hands mind you.
Clearly a couple.
He proceeds to say well it is legal, but it s such a waste to not have a man.
Later he continues to insult our relationship by saying he could come home with us to heat things up.
I am appalled that I would receive this kind of treatment.
I cannot believe I paid over $50 to have my relationship insulted and sexualized.
At the end of dinner, Parker wrote on the receipt Don t tell lesbians they need a man on Valentine s Day.
Apparently, the restaurant was so embarrassed that they gave them their money back.Here s an image of the receipt via Parker s Facebook page.// < !
