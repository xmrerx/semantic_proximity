part 1an excellent easy understand piece truth surround phony climate cool warm changethe pollution result rapid uncontrolled postwar industrial expansion spawn two environmentalist movement
one group primarily compose physical scientist engineer set directly address pollution problem develop facility legislative control date virtually eliminate industrial contamination soil water aira second group primarily compose activist little physical science background nothing protest industry without ever address single environmental problem create solutionwhile physical scientist engineer work quietly industry solve environmental problem ideology drive environmentalist activist use dramatic alarmist rhetoric gain medium control become dominant political force capable force selfserving ideology general public impunitythe earth enter cooling phase 1942 1970 environmentalist find way blame cooling industrial expansion
concept particulate matter fossil fuel usage block energy sun give cooling effect
concept incorporate parameter crude climate model time prediction model run james hansen 1971 projected fifty year cooling increase use fossil fuelsonly four year later spite continued increase fossil fuel usage global cooling come end proving model proper physical basis relate fossil fuel usage global coolingby 1988 13 year global warm ideological environmentalist develop new tact blame fossil fuel
british government embark political campaign promote nuclear industry attack powerful coal union create alarmist scenario runaway global warm result co2 produce coal fossil fuel
entirely political nature absolutely scientific backing make perfect weapon environmentalist promote anti energy anti humanity ideology
need scientific justificationas 1971 climate model far sophisticated provide science backing
instead blame fossil fuel block incoming solar radiation model remove parameter replace newly contrive parameter relate global warming effect fossil fuel source co2 outgo thermal radiation earththis model also produce james hansen project warm next century fossil fuel co2 emission increase continue accelerated rate
1971 model 1988 model prove false global warming end 1998 even co2 emission continue rise unprecedented rate
make matter worse since 2002 earth cool make projection clearly wrong directionby even basic standard ethical science model first predict cool fossil fuel usage discredit four year later warm occurs increase usage predict warm fossil fuel usage discredit ten year later cool reoccurs increased usage would declare absolutely invalid ideology involve science protocol totally abandonedimpact 2009as result alarmist prediction 1988 climate model hansen intergovernmental panel climate change ipcc form auspex united nation
body give science mandate investigate possibility human effect climate determine projection hansen validthe true nature ipcc science base body political body give scientific legitimacy false alarmist prediction order meet political self serve environmentalist agenda
since inception ipcc use position authority promote agenda detriment science even importantly detriment global populationfrom 1997 1998 average global temperature increase half degree c 1998 1999 average global temperature fell half degree c due extraordinary el ni nothing either greenhouse effect co2 emission co2 emission increase 240gty 1997 242gty 1998 244gty 1999an honest scientific body would make sort statement effect ipcc 2001 third assessment report particularly summary policy maker report make mention fact 1998 1999 earth cool ever cool entire global temperature record emphatically state 1997 1998 earth warm ever hadthis absolute violation science ethic policy maker purposely misinform alarmist rhetoric
2001 report also state observed global warming past century state attributable co2 emission measure 060 c 020 c 0006 c per year make el ni temperature spike eighty time greater ipcc state attributable co2 emission clear state purpose politically motivated alarmism properly convey information scientifically justify mannerthe 2001 ipcc report also include infamous mbh98 hockey stick temperature proxy use physical temperature measurement data include 1998 give alarmist impression twice 20th century warming 1999 includedthe hockey stick graph become pivotal evidence convince government around world ratify kyoto protocol result detrimental effect global population global economyin regard el ni temperature spike 1998 may consider significant climate event recent history one consider hundred million world poorest people starve kyoto biofuel initiative literally take food away make kyoto friendly fuel el ni might also consider tragic climate event wellthrough diligence hard work physical scientist able correct environmental problem create industrialization scientific effort capable undo damage cause global population ideological environmentalist
