teflon don the media just can t make anything stick to trump , because he just doesn t care donald trump endorsed waterboarding at a rally at a convention center in ohio on monday night , saying it is nothing compared to what isis does .
they chop off our young people s heads and put them on a stick , trump said .
they build these iron cages , and they ll put 20 people in them and they drop them in the ocean for 15 minutes and pull them up 15 minutes later .
would i approve waterboarding ?
you bet your ass i would , trump said .
and i would approve more than that .
don t kid yourself , folks .
it works , okay ?
it works .
only a stupid person would say it doesn t work .
it works , trump said .
only a stupid person would say it doesn t work .

and you know what ?
if it doesn t work , they deserve it anyway , for what they re doing .
it works .
