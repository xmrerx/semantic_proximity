caracas ( reuters ) - venezuela s government and opposition leaders will hold a new round of talks in january after failing on friday to reach an agreement to ease a deep political and economic crisis in the troubled opec country .
expectations have been low for the talks being held in the dominican republic .
some critics have described them as a stalling tactic by the ruling socialist party which is struggling to control a worsening economic crisis .
we will meet again on january 11 for a meeting with the venezuelan opposition , said information minister jorge rodriguez , leader of the government delegation , in a brief statement released by state television .
opposition leaders are demanding that president nicolas maduro accept humanitarian assistance from abroad to ease the crisis , which has left millions of people unable to eat properly due to triple-digit inflation and chronic product shortages .
they also want the release of several hundred jailed opposition activists .
government leaders want the opposition to help seek the elimination of sanctions by washington , which have been levied this year by the administration of u.s. president donald trump on accusations that maduro is undermining democracy .
an initial round of talks two weeks ago in the dominican republic also ended without a agreement .
we want an agreement that can be fulfilled , said opposition legislator luis florido .
because we have not concluded discussion of all the issues , we need another meeting so that there can be a permanent agreement .
