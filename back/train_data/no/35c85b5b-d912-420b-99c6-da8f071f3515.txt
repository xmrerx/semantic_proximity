oslo ( reuters ) - an 85-year-old survivor of the atomic bombing of hiroshima will jointly accept the 2017 nobel peace prize together with this year s laureate , the international campaign to abolish nuclear weapons , ican said on thursday .
setsuko thurlow , who was 13 at the time of the bombing on aug. 6 , 1945 , will be on stage in oslo on dec. 10 together with beatrice fihn , ican s executive director , to receive the nobel peace prize award .
thurlow has been a leading figure in ican since its launch in 2007 , ican said in a statement on thursday .
she played a pivotal role in the united nations negotiations that led to the adoption of the landmark treaty outlawing nuclear weapons in july .
thurlow has for seven decades campaigned against nuclear weapons .
born in japan , she now lives in canada .
at hiroshima , she was rescued from the rubble of a collapsed building about 1.8 kilometres ( 1.1 mile ) from ground zero .
most of her classmates , who were in the same room , were burned alive , she said in an account of her experiences .
in her speech announcing the prize in october , the leader of the norwegian nobel committee said the risk that nuclear weapons might be used was now greater than it has been for a long time .
