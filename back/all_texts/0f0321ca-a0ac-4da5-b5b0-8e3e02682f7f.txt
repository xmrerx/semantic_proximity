Donald Trump s join address to Congress last night left much to be desired, and many Democratic leaders are absolutely disgusted by what they heard and witnessed from the undeserving POTUS.In response to Trump s pathetic speech, Minority Leader of the House of Representatives Nancy Pelosi has received the following statement, which blatantly calls Trump out for being untrustworthy and fake.
Pelosi wrote: The President s speech was utterly disconnected from the cruel reality of his conduct.
And she s absolutely right.
Trump s speech was completely disconnected from what he has done so far, and Pelosi accurately assessed Trump s address as a bait-and-switch assault on America.
She also brilliantly pointed out that Trump has yet to actually back up any of his campaign promises and proposals.Pelosi also called Trump out for selling working people down the river to Wall Street and for jeopardizing the security of our country and weakening our fight against terror with his Administration s dangerous, incompetent and unconstitutional actions.
Those are harsh words, but they re absolutely true and reflect how the majority of Americans feel about Trump s first few weeks in the White House.
At the end of her statement, Pelosi warned Trump that Democrats will continue to lead the fight against his disgusting rhetoric and harmful policies.Echoing Pelosi s statement, colleague Chuck Schumer also held a similar opinion of Trump s address to Congress:Unlike Trump, who is infamous for walking back and flip-flopping on his stances to please the masses, Pelosi only doubled down on her comments earlier this morning in an appearance on MSNBC s Morning Joe .
Commenting on Trump s lack of concrete policies, she said, We re legislators.
Show us your proposal.
