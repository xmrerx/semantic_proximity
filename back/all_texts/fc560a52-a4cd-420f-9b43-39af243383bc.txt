WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will sign two executive orders on Wednesday including one on border security and the intent to build a wall along the U.S. southern border, and another strengthening the enforcement of immigration laws, the White House said.
“Building this barrier is more than just a campaign promise.
It’s a common sense first step to really securing our porous border,” said White House spokesman Sean Spicer.
“This will stem the flow of drugs, crime, illegal immigration into the United States.” He said the orders will strip federal money from so-called sanctuary cities and end a “catch and release” policy of previous administrations.
