greg gutfeld is so passionate and so on target with his commentary about the comey memo disclosure .
this is truly epic !
gutfeld said all of this comes down to the non-political way trump communicates .
when you say you hope for something , it s not a command .
it s not saying you d better do this .
gutfeld then compared the use of hope to desiring a bicycle for christmas , wanting people to show up for your birthday , and asking neighbors to be quiet while you re sleeping .
in my mind it seems like it s not a big deal , which is maybe why comey didn t think it was obstructionist , so he didn t have to comply to reporting it , because he knew what trump was doing is what trump does .
everything to him is like visiting a construction site .
it s not what a politician says or does .
he doesn t understand how internal stuff works .
so he shows up and says i wish we could do this for cheaper wish we could have done a better job on lights on bathrooms .
