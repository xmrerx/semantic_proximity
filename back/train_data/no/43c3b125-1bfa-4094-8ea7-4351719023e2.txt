ted nugent isn t having it !
he s being compared to kathy griffin by the left and he s had enough of it ! we will never forget the night before the election at the very last rally for candidate trump ted nugent was there and played his heart out ! conservative rocker ted nugent , who once told a concert crowd that barack obama should suck on [ his ] machine gun , says its unfair to compare him to embattled comedian kathy griffin .

ms. griffin is facing a wave of backlash for doing a graphic photo shoot holding a realistic mock severed head of president trump .
she has since apologized for the photos and had them removed , but lost her long-running new year s eve gig at cnn as a result .

nugent , who serves on the nra s board of directors , reportedly told a concert crowd in 2007 : obama , he s a piece of s .
