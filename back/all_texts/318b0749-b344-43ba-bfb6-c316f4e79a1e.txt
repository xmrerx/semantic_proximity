While at a rally in Wilmington, North Carolina, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump made a clear insinuation that Second Amendment people should take out Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton to keep her from becoming president and appointing Supreme Court Justices.Since his remarks, the internet has been set on fire with anger against the Republican candidate, and speaking her mind beautifully, yet again, was none other than the brilliant Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).She quickly tweeted out after Trump s remarks: Donald Trump makes death threats because he s a pathetic coward who can t handle the fact that he s losing to a girl.
Adding: Your reckless comments sound like a two-bit dictator, Donald Trump.
Not a man who wants to lead the greatest democracy on the planet.

Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) August 9, 2016Warren is exactly right.
Trump was already a loose cannon, but since he s been losing dramatically against Clinton in the polls, he s been saying and doing even more horrendous things to try to get people to hate her.
Now, even going so far to incite violence against a former FLOTUS, Senator, Secretary of State and fellow candidate.Trump should not only be called out for this horrendous behavior, but held accountable and investigated by the Secret Service for such atrocious remarks.Enough is enough, Trump is dangerous.Featured Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images
