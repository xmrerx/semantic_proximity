the first shot against pc tyranny in virginia has been fired ! earlier this year , after racist terrorist dylann storm roof was charged with shooting nine black people in a charleston , south carolina , church , the media and democrats across the nation embarked on a crusade to wipe the confederate flag from society.one of the crusaders , virginia governor terry mcauliffe , decided to get rid of license plates containing the confederate flag altogether and informed those with such license plates that they had until october to hand the license plates over to the department of motor vehicles.those found driving with the plates will be charged with a misdemeanor.on friday , local station wavy reported that the vast majority of citizens with such license plates have refused to comply with the government s flag-recall notice .
the dmv stated that just 187 virginians had returned their license plates out of 1,600 who had received a recall notice.one of those who has refused to heed the call is kevin collier , commander of the stonewall camp of the sons of confederate veterans , whose great-great-great-grandfather fought with the confederacy .
next thing you know , they re going to say you can t wear blue on monday or you can t wear yellow on thursday , he told wavy .
where s it going to end ?
the answer : it isn t. in forwarding the regulation , mcauliffe said the confederate flag was unnecessarily divisive and hurtful .
he added , even its display on state-issued license tags is , in my view , unnecessarily divisive and hurtful to too many of our people .
apparently , mcauliffe missed the fact that the victims in charleston did not suffer from hurt feelings thanks to license plates , but from murder at the hands of a racist renegade criminal .
but government s job is now to protect feelings rather than lives .
