democrats staging a sit-in on the floor of congress won t go hungry we spotted their food order on its way into the capitol and it s pretty damn ironic .
a couple carts full of chick-fil-a food were toted in by congressional interns .
we get it protesters got ta eat , but consider this : the push for gun control legislation was prompted by omar mateen s heinous attack on a gay nightclub and chick-fil-a s ownership has a long history of opposing lgbtq rights .
to be fair , the company s undergoing an image makeover , and has contributed tons of food and money to relief efforts in orlando .
still odd choice .
dc s a big city .
via : tmzwe thought a sit in was supposed to just that a sit in !
this looks more like a eat in or feast in !
