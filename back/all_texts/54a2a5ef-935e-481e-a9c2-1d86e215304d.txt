Donald Trump has just announced that his daughter Ivanka (you know, the one he wants to date) will be taking on yet another role within his disastrous excuse for an administration.
Via Twitter, Trump proclaimed that his oldest daughter will lead the U.S. delegation to India this fall.

@IvankaTrump will lead the U.S. delegation to India this fall, supporting women s entrepreneurship globally.#GES2017 @narendramodi Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2017Go figure, Americans are not the least bit impressed that a handbag designer with zero qualifications who was neither elected nor appointed will be serving in this role.
Twitter users wasted no time telling Trump all about it.Yeah, just send your Daughter, who has no experience in such to do this.
I mean what could possibly go wrong, right?
Impeach Donald Trump (@Impeach_D_Trump) August 10, 2017Here you go again, once more giving your job to someone who has no clue what she's doing!
Why can't you be presidential?
Jail Donald Trump (@DTrumpExposed) August 10, 2017I'm glad you feel your family are more qualified than millions of actual diplomats, but there's this crazy thing called nepotism.

This is an affront to our democracy.
Eugene Gu, MD (@eugenegu) August 10, 2017It was bad enough when Ivanka said she was working 'alongside' General Kelly.
Trump should fill positions w/ qualified people, not relatives Dani Bostick (@danibostick) August 10, 2017Isn't she just going out there to scout more sweatshop sites?
