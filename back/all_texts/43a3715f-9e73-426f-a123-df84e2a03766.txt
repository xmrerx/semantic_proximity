Donald Trump has chosen to ignore Pride month, but the same can not be said of all politicians.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren set the internet on fire this weekend when she was caught on video literally dancing through the streets at the Boston Pride parade.The Massachusetts Democrat celebrated LGBT Pride along with tens of thousands of others at the 47th annual Boston Pride parade and the scene could not have been any more perfect.
And this is a prime example of exactly why she has become a liberal icon.
I love pride, Warren says in the short video she posted.
It may be my single most favorite day of the year because it s the day that we all come together and celebrate.
Go pride.
It is worth noting that not only has Trump chosen to ignore Pride month, but he has decided it isn t even worth a passing mention after the Supreme Court ruled in favor of marriage equality and after the deadly massacre at Pulse.
That pretty much says it all right there, doesn t it?He claims to be an inclusive leader and has said that he stands by the LGBT community, but clearly, that is not the case.
Actions speak louder than words, and so far, he has offered neither this month.Warren, on the other hand, is the polar opposite of Trump and that couldn t make us any happier.
Her joy at this weekend s event was absolutely infectious and the internet just can t get enough of her.
(Or her rainbow feather boa!)
This is exactly why we liberals love her so much!You can see the video of Sen. Warren dancing along the route of the parade, here:I LOVE the Boston Pride Parade.
It shows our Commonwealth and our country at its best.
