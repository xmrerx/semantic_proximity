dubai ( reuters ) - yemen s houthi forces denied detaining a u.s. citizen and said he had been kidnapped by unknown gunmen in the capital sanaa , a statement from the movement said .
colleagues of danny lavon burch , an engineer who had been working in yemen since the late 1980s , said on monday that houthi forces had detained him in sanaa .
the iran-aligned houthis and their ally former president ali abdullah saleh control much of northern yemen , including sanaa , and are battling a saudi-led coalition that is trying to restore the internationally recognized government .
an armed gang was behind the criminal and cowardly act of kidnapping burch , a statement carried by the houthi-controlled state news agency saba said late on wednesday .
the security services are tracking the perpetrators of the kidnapping and they will be brought to justice , it said .
his wife , nadia burch , told reuters earlier this week that her husband had been seized on saturday after taking their children to school .
he has worked in yemen since the late 1980s , currently with the oil company safer , said burch , a yemeni .
he has no problems or disputes with anyone , which is why he didn t leave as others did , she said .
i ask for the release of my husband and his safe return to me .
she said the kidnappers had not contacted her and she was unsure of their identity .
a u.s. state department official said they were aware and concerned about the report of burch s disappearance .
more than 10,000 people have been killed in yemen s civil war .
it began in march 2015 when the houthis advanced on the interim headquarters of president abd-rabbu mansour hadi in the southern port city of aden , forcing him to flee the country and seek saudi help .
