washington ( reuters ) - the world bank on tuesday approved $ 400 million in additional funding to help rebuild services to iraqi areas recaptured from islamic state militants after a three-year military campaign , the global development bank said .
the world bank also said it would fund studies on how to involve the private sector in the reconstruction of mosul s airport and restoring public transport terminals as well as parts of the railway network .
the package represents an additional financing to the iraq emergency operation for development project ( $ 350 million ) approved back in july 2015 and already underway in seven cities in diyala and salah ad-din governorates , the world bank said in a statement .
it said the new funding would focus on rebuilding in five sectors - water and sanitation , electricity , health , transport and municipal services .
the funds will also help with the restoration and preservation of cultural heritage sites in mosul s old city , which was heavily damaged by fighting .
iraqi government forces , backed by a u.s.-led coalition , retook mosul in may - by far the largest city to fall under militants control - after nearly nine months of urban warfare .
iraqi government officials have estimated it will take at least five years and billions of dollars to rebuild mosul .
