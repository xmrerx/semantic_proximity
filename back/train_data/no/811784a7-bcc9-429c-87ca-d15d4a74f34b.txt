ankara ( reuters ) - turkish authorities issued detention warrants for 133 people working in the finance and labor ministries , the state-run anadolu news agency said on thursday , as part of a widening crackdown following last year s failed coup attempt .
the suspects were detained for allegedly using bylock , an encrypted messaging app which the government says was used by the network of u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen , blamed by ankara of orchestrating last july s abortive putsch .
gulen , who has lived in self-imposed exile in pennsylvania since 1999 , denies involvement .
anadolu said 101 of the suspects were from the finance ministry and 32 from the labor ministry .
it said two of the suspects from each ministry were active workers .
since then more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over links to gulen , while 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the public and private sectors .
rights groups and some of turkey s western allies have voiced concern about the crackdown , fearing the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent .
the government says only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by gulen s network , which it says deeply infiltrated institutions such as the army , schools and courts .
