caracas ( reuters ) - a power outage hit parts of the venezuelan capital caracas as well as the nearby states of miranda and vargas for around five hours on monday , in what critics said was another sign of the oil-rich nation s economic meltdown .
authorities blamed the outage , which began around noon ( 1600 gmt ) , on the collapse of an important cable linking a power plant and a transmission tower .
the fault affected some phone lines , parts of the caracas metro , and the main maiquetia airport just outside the capital .
many workers had no choice but to walk home , shops and restaurants closed , and venezuelans grumbled that another day was disrupted by tumult .
the country is already grappling with the world s fastest inflation , rising malnutrition , and disease as the state-led economic system grinds to a halt .
venezuela has fallen apart , said david garcia , 38 , as he queued for a hotdog at a stand in the wealthier chacao neighborhood .
he had spent two hours looking for an open restaurant because he could not cook at home .
venezuela has in recent years suffered frequent blackouts that critics attribute to insufficient investment following the 2007 nationalization of the electricity sector .
this is a symptom of a country collapsing due to the negligence of those in power , tweeted opposition lawmaker tom s guanipa .
the government has in some cases attributed the blackouts to sabotage or accused critics of exaggerating problems .
energy minister luis motta on monday tweeted articles on a recent power outage at atlanta airport in the u.s. state of georgia , adding : it happens there too .
he did not provide details on the magnitude and effects of monday s blackout .
shopkeepers complained that the outage had hurt business .
it s a lost day , said armindo gomes , 24 , whose portuguese family runs two bakeries , as he pointed at dough , cheese and meat that should have been refrigerated .
