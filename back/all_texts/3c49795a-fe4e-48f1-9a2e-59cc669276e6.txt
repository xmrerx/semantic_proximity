While the New York primary election has unleashed harsh sentiments from both the Sanders and Clinton campaigns, it appears that the two are putting their differences aside to join forces in suing Arizona over its suppressive tactics with regards to voting in March.According to the Washington Post, the suit will focus exclusively on Maricopa County, where citizens had to wait as long as seven hours to vote due to a drastic cut in polling locations from 200 in 2012 down to 60 this election.The suit accuses Arizona officials of launching a massive effort to suppress the vote, saying the alarmingly inadequate number of voting centers resulted in severe, inexcusable burdens on voters countywide, as well as the ultimate disenfranchisement of untold numbers of voters who were unable or unwilling to wait in intolerably long lines.
The suit also singled out the fact that black, Hispanic and Native American voters were especially burdened, and will ask the Court to review the polling location plan for the November election to ensure that mass disenfranchisement doesn t happen again.The suit is being filed in the US District Court in Phoenix by Marc Elis on behalf of the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, the Arizona Democratic Party and individual Democratic leaders in the state.

both the Sanders and Clinton campaign will sign on.Elias is a member of Clinton s general counsel and is a prominent DC elections lawyer, who formally worked a general counsel position with John Kerry and Al Franken.
Elias also was a litigator on voting rights and redistricting lawsuits in Virginia, Ohio, Nevada, Minnesota, New York, Wisconsin, Texas, Florida and North Carolina.A Department of Justice investigation is currently underway, a move lobbied by the Democratic mayor of Phoenix Greg Stanton.When Democrats join forces, this what happens they tackle the issues that effect average Americans who want to get ahead and be a part of the process.
While Republicans openly celebrate suppressing the vote, Democrats want to expand it.Perhaps Democrats should do a little less fighting and a little more unifying like we re seeing in Arizona.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images
