pristina ( reuters ) - kosovo s prime minister ramush haradinaj was removed from an international arrest warrant issued by serbia , lifting an obstacle to him travelling outside the country , the justice minister said on friday .
early this year ramush haradinaj , a former kosovar guerilla leader who in september took over as prime minister , was arrested in france on an arrest warrant issued by serbia .
he was released after a french court rejected belgrade s extradition request .
despite many attempts by pristina , belgrade refused to remove his name from the interpol red notice .
today i was informed that interpol has removed 18 people from kosovo that are wanted by serbia and this list includes also the prime minister , abelard tahiri , kosovo s justice minister told reuters .
after today s decision all these individuals are free to travel outside the country without any problem .
haradinaj and others are wanted by serbia for allegedly committing war crimes .
serbia has charged haradinaj with murdering serbs in the late 1990s war .
the 1998-99 conflict ended after nato bombed the now-defunct yugoslavia , then comprising serbia and montenegro , for 78 days to force a withdrawal of its troops from kosovo and end a counter-insurgency campaign against ethnic albanians .
haradinaj , who has twice been tried and acquitted by the united nations war crimes tribunal in the hague , denies any wrongdoing .
kosovo declared independence in 2008 but serbia refused to recognize its former breakaway province .
