Jeb Bush is desperate for people to support him and his fledgling campaign for the presidency, but he probably wishes the latest supporter of his campaign had kept his endorsement to himself.As you may recall, Jeb s brother George nearly destroyed the economy back in 2008 all while giving ridiculous tax breaks to the wealthy pricks who helped him crash it.Jeb Bush hasn t exactly been touting W s economic record, but one hedge-funder who has since become one of the most hated corporate tools in America is touting his support for Jeb s campaign.Last year, Jeb s biggest fan hiked the price of a crucial AIDS medication known as Daraprim to $750 a pill, a 5,000 percent increase from its original price, thereby guaranteeing that only rich patients would be able to afford the drug without fearing bankruptcy.Ferret face then went on television to defend the price hike in the most dickish way possible as if he s helping people by raising the price.And most recently, the greedy douchebag has been arrested by federal authorities for securities fraud and repeatedly dodged questions by lawmakers after being subpoenaed by Congress.As you have probably figured out, the Jeb endorser described is none other than professional asshole Martin Shkreli.Shkreli took to Twitter on Friday and posted a brief message announcing his support of the former Florida Governor who had to beg people to clap during a recent rally.
@JebBush i m an avid supporter Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) February 6, 2016Perhaps even more embarrassing if the fact that Shkreli rescinded his endorsement less than 24 hours later by blaming his alleged date for posting the tweet as a joke.
My date made the tweet about Jeb Bush as a joke.
I don t follow politics except for having a profound hatred for all politicians.
Martin Shkreli (@MartinShkreli) February 7, 2016This creates a couple questions.
First, who in this world would date a total asshole who screws around with people s healthcare?
And second, how pathetic must Jeb Bush be if the only endorsement he can get is a fake one by the most hated man in America?
