mumbai ( reuters ) - an indian court on thursday sentenced to death two men convicted of involvement in india s most deadly bombings , a series of blasts in the city of mumbai that killed 257 people in 1993 , while two others were jailed for life .
investigators said the bombs were ordered by india s most wanted man , gangster dawood ibrahim , to avenge the demolition of the historic babri mosque in north india by hindu hardliners in 1992 , during a period of religious conflict .
ibrahim is believed to be hiding in pakistan .
pakistan denies that .
the court sentenced feroz abdul rashid khan and taher merchant to death , while abu salem and karimullah khan were jailed for life , a lawyer for the federal police , deepak salvi , told reporters .
a fifth man , riyaz siddiqui , was sentenced to 10 years in prison , salvi said .
lawyers for the convicted men did not answer their telephones , and it was not immediately known if they would appeal against the sentences .
legal proceedings against those accused of being involved in the bombings have resulted in more than 100 convictions , most of which are still winding their way through the legal system because of appeals and commutations of sentences .
one suspect in the case , yakub memon , was hanged in 2015 .
in june , a court had ruled the five guilty of involvement in the blasts that shook india s financial hub more than two decades ago .
a six man also found guilty at that time died in prison before sentencing .
