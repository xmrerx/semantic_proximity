in what has to be considered an historic about face , german chancellor angela merkel announced that 100,000 migrants who recently arrived in germany would be deported.for more than a year following the massive tide of humanity that flooded into germany from africa and the middle east , merkel stoutly defended her open border policy as being consistent with western values .
a million migrants later , and a huge voter backlash due to overburdened local governments and a sky rocketing crime rate , merkel has changed her tune.on november 9 , 2016 , germany s angela merkel offered donald j. trump a public admonishment following his historic win against pro-amensty hillary clinton : sunday express : ordinarily , a politician who tried to pull this off would be toast .
but merkel finds herself in a strong position because the alternatives to her are even worse.recent polls show her coalition of the cdu/csu comfortably ahead by 11 points over the social democratic party the leading left wing party in germany by 33-22 % .
the next strongest party are the greens who poll at 12 % and then the nationalist party afd at almost 9 % .
put simply , the german voter has nowhere else to go now that merkel has flip flopped on immigration.there is a chance that the left wing parties will poll enough votes to fashion a majority , but given that the social democrats are determined to continue with a liberal immigration policy , it isn t likely.merkel will probably pull off her switcheroo on open borders and win re-election .
but she has already accelerated the timetable for a takeover of her country by people with no interest in promoting german or western values and ideas .
