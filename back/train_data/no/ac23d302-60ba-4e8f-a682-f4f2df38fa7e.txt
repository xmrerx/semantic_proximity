watching bernie sanders .
he s hectoring and yelling at me while he s saying he s going to raise our taxes .

he would say : modulate , senator , mr. lowewrote , linking to a clip from the show , where his character took issue with some people on his own side pushing for increased taxes on the country s highest earners , cnn reported .
i m not talking about policy .
