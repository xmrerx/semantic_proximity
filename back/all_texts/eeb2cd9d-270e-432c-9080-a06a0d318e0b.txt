Donald Trump s candidacy would not have happened if Fox & Friends hadn t encouraged it all these years.
And Newt Gingrich reminded the hosts of the show of that fact on Monday.During the appearance, Fox hosts Steve Doocey and Brian Kilmeade mentioned to the former House Speaker that Donald Trump is the GOP Establishment s worst nightmare because he s a billionaire who is spending the least amount of money and running away with this thing.
In response, Gingrich pointed out that it was Fox News that created the Trump candidacy in the first place.
That s because of you guys.
Donald Trump gets up in the morning, tweets to the entire planet at no cost, picks up the phone, calls you, has a great conversation for about eight minutes which would have cost him a ton in commercial money.
And meanwhile, his opponents are all out there trying to raise the money to run an ad.
Indeed, former Republican candidate Jeb Bush raised and spent millions of dollars but never could take down Trump, eventually dropping out after the South Carolina primary because of that failure.Trump, on the other hand, has been all over the media getting free coverage.
Look, you can say that Trump is the candidate Fox & Friends invented, Gingrich continued.
He was on your show more than any other show.

Ever since that first GOP debate, Trump has taken repeated shots at the conservative network for being unfair.
He has even said that Fox is so biased it is disgusting.
In short, while some at Fox are bragging that they helped shake up the GOP by helping Trump rise as a GOP contender, some are probably regretting that because Trump is destroying Fox News is the process.Featured Image: Flickr
