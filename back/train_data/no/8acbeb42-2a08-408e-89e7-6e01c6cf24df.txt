no need to file rules don t apply to obama s amnestied illegals illegal immigrants granted executive amnesty can claim back tax credits for work they performed illegally , even if they never filed a tax return during those years , irs commissioner john koskinen has confirmed to sen. chuck grassley ( r-ia ) .in a written response to questions grassley , chairman of the senate judiciary committee , asked koskinen following a february hearing on the irs budget , the irs commissioner clarified his earlier assertions that illegal immigrants granted executive amnesty and social security numbers can access earned income tax credits ( eitc ) for years they were working in the country illegally.back in february , koskinen said that in order to claim the tax credits the amnestied illegal immigrant would have had to have filed returns in the past.in his written statement to grassley , released wednesday , koskinen went another step , saying an illegal immigrant granted amnesty could claim back tax credits regardless if they had filed returns in the past .
to clarify my earlier comments on eitc , not only can an individual amend a prior year return to claim eitc , but an individual who did not file a prior year return may file a return and claim eitc ( subject to refund limitations under section 6511 of the internal revenue code ) .
i would note that filing new returns for prior years would likely be difficult , since filers would have to reconstruct earnings and other records for years when they were not able to work on the books , koskinen said in his written response.according to the irs , illegal immigrants granted amnesty , and with it social security numbers , can claim up to three years prior in back tax credits .
section 32 of the internal revenue code requires an ssn on the return , but a taxpayer claiming the eitc is not required to have an ssn before the close of the year for which the eitc is claimed .
at your request , the irs has reviewed the relevant statutes and legislative history , and we believe that the 2000 chief counsel advice ( cca ) on this issue is correct , koskinen added.with this benefit illegal immigrants granted amnesty could receive tens of thousands of dollars in back tax refunds.via : breitbart news
