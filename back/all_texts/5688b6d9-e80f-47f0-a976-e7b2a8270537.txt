On Saturday, Michelle Obama graced Jackson State University with her presence as she gave the commencement speech to this year s graduating class.
Though she normally stays out of the fray with regard to the right s horrible attacks on her husband, the First Lady took a moment to share her thoughts on the insane, racist attacks coming from conservatives in America.
As I ve walked this journey with Barack, I ve gotten a pretty good look at what it means to rise above the fray, what it means to set your eyes on the horizon, to devote your life to making things better for those who will come after you, Obama said, praising the President s ability to stay the course no matter what kind of ugliness is going on at any particular moment.
Then she dropped the hammer, condemning the right s use of hateful and divisive language directed at her husband: Charges that he doesn t love our country.
The time he was called a liar in front of a Joint Session of Congress.
The nonstop questions about his birth certificate and his belief in God.
She urged the graduating class to follow her husband s example and address such unabashed hatred with dignity: Are you going to get angry or lash out?
Or are you going to take a deep breath, straighten your shoulders, lift up your head, and do what Barack Obama has always done as he says, When they go low, I go high.'
That s the choice Barack and I have made.
That s what has kept us sane over the years.
We simply do not allow space in our hearts, minds, or souls for darkness, she said.Barack Obama has encountered an unprecedented amount of mindless vitriol from the stupid part of America, and has always met it with class.
But despite that hate, he will be remembered as the best POTUS in this century and last, perhaps ever, because of his dedication to doing the right thing and his refusal to let the haters weigh him down.Featured image via Getty Images/Feng Li
