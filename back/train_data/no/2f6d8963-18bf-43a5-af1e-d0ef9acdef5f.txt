well first of all , politicians , especially those elected president of the united states , are very adept at creating straw men ; taking something that they feel rhetorically works to their advantage and using it .
that s exactly what the president did .
my question did not suggest he was content with the captivity of those four americans .
my question was about the contentment or the satisfaction or the realization that it was necessary within the context of this deal to leave them unaccounted for .
that was the essence of the question .
clearly it struck a nerve .
that was my intention .
