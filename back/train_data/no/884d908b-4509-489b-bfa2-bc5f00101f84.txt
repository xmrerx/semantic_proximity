beirut ( reuters ) - a booby-trapped motorbike exploded in the northeastern syrian city of qamishli on monday , killing a child and wounding six other people , the monitoring group syrian observatory for human rights reported .
syrian state tv said a motorbike had exploded and reported that four people were wounded but did not immediately mention deaths .
qamishli is in an area mostly under the control of kurdish security forces .
bomb blasts , often claimed by islamic state , have occurred in qamishli and nearby hasaka city , both under kurdish control , but have been rare in the last year .
islamic state also reported the bombing via its online amaq news agency , saying it had targeted a vehicle belonging to kurdish security forces .
it did not explicitly claim the attack .
kurdish internal security force the asayish , in a statement , blamed a syrian government-allied paramilitary group for carrying out the attack .
the kurdish ypg militia is spearheading a u.s.-backed offensive to drive islamic state out of the jihadist group s remaining strongholds in eastern syria , including its former de facto syrian capital , raqqa .
the ypg and syrian government forces have mostly stayed out of each other s way in the six-year-old syrian conflict .
