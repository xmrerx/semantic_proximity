MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin has started a meeting in the Kremlin with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, a spokeswoman for the U.S. embassy in Moscow said on Wednesday, citing Kremlin officials.
The Kremlin had previously declined to confirm that such a meeting would take place during Tillersonâ€™s visit, reflecting tensions over a U.S. missile strike on Syria, a staunch Russian ally, last week.
