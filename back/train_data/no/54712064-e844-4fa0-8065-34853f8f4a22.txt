( reuters ) - democrat doug jones won alabama ’ s election for the u.s. senate on tuesday , scoring an upset victory in a deeply conservative state against a republican candidate who was backed by president donald trump , u.s. media said .
jones , 63 , a former federal prosecutor , prevailed over roy moore , whose campaign was dogged by allegations of sexual misconduct toward teenagers .
while republicans maintain control of both houses of congress , jones ’ victory will reduce their majority in the u.s. senate to 51-49 , possibly making it harder for trump to advance his policy agenda .
