Hillary Clinton enjoyed a performance by Jay-Z and Beyonce at a rally in Ohio on Friday night and Donald Trump complained like a hypocrite.During the rally, Jay-Z performed uncensored versions of songs, which included the N-word and other expletives.
Of course, that means the Republican nominee had to make remarks about it during a rally on Saturday.
I actually like Jay Z, Trump said in Florida.
But, you know, the language last night.
He used every word in the book.
I won t even use the initials, because I ll get in trouble.
They ll get me in trouble.
The they Trump is referring to is the media.But the problem is that Hillary Clinton did not use any of those words herself, while Donald Trump has used words such as c*nt and p*ssy and has used curse words on the campaign trail.And Joy Reid reminded Trump of his own language during her show on Saturday.Now, Donald Trump has a problem with Jay Z s language, okay?
a flabbergasted Reid began.
Because Jay Z is a hip hop guy.
I want to remind America, the guy who has a problem with Jay Z s language?
This is his language.
What followed was Trump s infamous grab them by the p*ssy remark that has plagued him since the audio was released early last month.Reid then went for the jugular.
Jay Z has said a lot of things in his songs, but he s never said that, Donald Trump.
We should perhaps talk to Melania, who wants to have this campaign against cyber-bullying which she can begin at home at the dinner table.
Here s the video via VidMe.Once again, a hypocritical Donald Trump shoots himself in the foot by failing to keep his big mouth shut.The bottom line is that Hillary Clinton did not say those words during her rally, Jay-Z did.
Trump, on the other hand, has no one to blame for his own words but himself.Featured Image: Screenshot
