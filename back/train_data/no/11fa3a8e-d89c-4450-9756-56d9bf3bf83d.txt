juba ( reuters ) - south sudan needs $ 1.7 billion in aid next year to help 6 million people half of its population cope with the effects of war , hunger and economic decline , the government and the united nations announced on wednesday .
south sudan slid into civil war in late 2013 , two years after gaining independence from sudan and a third of its 12 million population has fled their homes .
the conflict was sparked by a feud between president salva kiir and his former deputy riek machar , who is being held in south africa , and eventually led to a fight along ethnic lines .
we are calling for $ 1.72 billion to continue providing life-saving assistance and protection for 6 million people most in need in south sudan , alain noudehou , the u.n. humanitarian coordinator for south sudan , told a news conference .
humanitarian assistance was needed for people suffering the effects of displacement , food insecurity , malnutrition , violence and economic decline , noudehou said .
since the conflict began , about 4 million people have been forced to flee their homes , with nearly 1.9 million people who have internally displaced and about 2.1 million who have fled to neighboring countries , he said .
the conflict has also led to a cut in crude oil production , which is a key foreign exchange earner , and the ensuing insecurity has hampered cultivation of food .
also at the news conference was south sudan s humanitarian affairs minister hussein mar nyuot .
i believe if we don t get the amount ( $ 1.72 billion ) and the donors don t respond to this more crisis in south sudan will happen .
that means 2018 might be worse than 2017 , he said .
