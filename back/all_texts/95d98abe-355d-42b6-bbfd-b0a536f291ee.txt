Most of us know that Donald Trump s fanbase is made up of some of the most privileged members of American society.
A good majority of Trump supporters are straight white men (and some women) who have never been faced with a true obstacle or discrimination a day in their life.
But if you ask them, they d likely only complain about how oppressed they are and this recent incident between a bakery and a Trump supporter is a perfect example.This week, 17-year-old Trump supporter McKenzie Gill went to get a birthday cake made up at her local Albertsons.
To prove just how much of a die-hard fan she was of the business mogul, she wanted her cake to read Trump 2016 a celebration of both her 18th birthday and the mark of her first vote in America s election process.However, things didn t exactly go according to plan.
When Gill went to order the cake, the woman behind the counter refused to put Trump 2016 on it.
She said she could put an American flag design on the cake, but definitely not the words Trump 2016.
In response, Gill took after her yellow-haired role model and threw a temper tantrum on social media.
In a Facebook post, she wrote: The woman behind the cake counter just refused to make me a birthday cake because I wanted Trump 2016 on it.
Did that really just happen?
FacebookGill got her cake made up elsewhere and made a formal complaint to Albertsons about being refused.
Albertsons apologized and said that the women who d refused to write Trump 2016 on the cake had misunderstood the store s policy to not use copyrighted phrases in its designs.
In an interview, Gill said: It s your job, we re not really going for your opinion on what you think of the candidates we were just wanting Trump 2016 on the cake.
