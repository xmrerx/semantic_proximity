It s clear Ted Cruz isn t even trying anymore.
The Republican presidential candidate wasn t even able to use his own verbiage when defending his wife from an attack by Donald Trump.On Tuesday, Trump tweeted out, then deleted, then tweeted out again a bizarre threat aimed at Ted Cruz s wife Heidi.Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q.
shoot in his ad.
Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2016Then, in what could have just ended the weird battle between the two GOP frontrunners, Cruz tweets back:Pic of your wife not from us.
Donald, if you try to attack Heidi, you're more of a coward than I thought.

Just leave it there, right?While appearing on CNN, Cruz was asked about this little Twitter run-in with Trump regarding their wives, and the bizarre threat Trump placed on Heidi.
Cruz, apparently unable to think on his feet or come up with a response on his own and clearly thinking no one would notice, decided to literally use a line from the legendary movie American President.
There s a scene in the movie when fictional president Andrew Shepard played by Michael Douglas, says: You want a character debate, Bob?
You better stick with me, cause Sydney Ellen Wade is way out of your league.
And what does Cruz say regarding Trump?
And if Donald wants to get in a character fight, he s better off sticking with me, because Heidi is way out of his league.

Or did you think you were funny?
Or did you think the moment to be funny would be in the defense of your wife from a misogynistic monster?Even the defense of his own wife is disingenuous.Featured image via video screen capture
