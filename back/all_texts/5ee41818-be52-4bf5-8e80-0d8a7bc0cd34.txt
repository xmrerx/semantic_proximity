If there is one thing that is certain, it s that at no point in a presidency riddled with white supremacists, xenophobes, Christofascists, assorted racists, and a big orange buffoon as Grand Wizard of it all, will intelligence come into play in any fashion but Donald Trump s unpresidented attacks on our intelligence agencies have caused many to question how much he knew about Vladimir Putin s hack of our election.In Trumpland, however, it is perfectly fine that a man The Donald once publicly wished would become his new best friend (the tweet is still up), Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, personally spearheaded not just a hack of Trump s political opponents but an aggressive propaganda and fake news campaign aimed at installing someone they can clearly control in the Oval Office.
Even when presented with evidence of the hack, Trump has gone the route of repeatedly assaulting those who uncovered the information rather than the foreign leader who directly meddled in our election all while praising the guy who masterminded the attacks on our nation.On Sunday, Trump tweeted out a quote from his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, that pretty much sums up his entire administration.
We certainly don t want intelligence interfering with politics and we don t want politics interfering with intelligence, Conway said in what will surely be a heavily-quoted interview for at least the next four years.If there s one thing Trump who loves the poorly educated very much has never allowed to come close to his politics it s intelligence, be it a measurement of intellect or evidence that his nice Russian friend personally orchestrated an attack on the United States.
The Twitter community, of course, was there to let him know it:@realDonaldTrump oh we are all painfully aware that you re not bringing any intelligence into politics, donald Zach Holman (@holman) January 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I must say: You have done a bang-up job of keeping intelligence out of all of your political decisions thus far.
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) January 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews This is another one of those tweets you should probably delete.
It makes it way too easy to mock you.
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) January 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump do you prefer to receive foreign intelligence instead via Wikileaks and Russia?
Americans have elected a traitor.

(@VeeVee) January 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump With you in charge, I'm pretty sure there's little danger of intelligence interfering in *any* way with politics.
Tom Coates (@tomcoates) January 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump we wouldn't want intelligence, would we?

Zack Kopplin (@ZackKopplin) January 8, 2017Dear @realDonaldTrump: Worry not.
"Intelligence interfering with politics" is the LAST thing any of us will ever worry about with you, hun.
Mrs. Betty Bowers (@BettyBowers) January 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I think it's pretty safe to say there won't be any intelligence in American politics for the next four years.

(@___Q__) January 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews Very little danger of intelligence interfering with anything you or Fox do in politics.
Chris Fyvie (@ckfyvie) January 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews We are all painfully aware that intelligence will play no part in this presidency.
Casanis Plays (@CasanisPlays) January 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews you don't let intelligence get in the way of anything you do or say.
You've proven that time and again.
mcon (@twinlet133) January 8, 2017Donald Trump seems willing to attack anyone who threatens to uncover information related to Russia s hack of our election the multiple intelligence agencies that have all come to the conclusion that Putin personally led the effort, the American people (most of whom are fools and stupid people according to Trump), the media who dares mention anything he does that is unethical (which is a lot), and pretty much everyone but the former KGB Lieutennant Colonel who helped plant him in a position where he can (and has said he intends to) be very friendly to Russia.Apparently, attacking the intelligence agencies that uncovered uncomfortable information about your new bestie is how you make America great again.
