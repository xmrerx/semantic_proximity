nicosia ( reuters ) - around 175 migrants , including many women and children , were rescued off cyprus on friday after their boat ran aground , police said .
the vessel was tracked sailing off cyprus s north-west coast .
authorities said those on board were being escorted to a nearby harbor .
the nationality of the migrants and their port of departure were not immediately clear .
in september , more than 300 syrian refugees arrived in the same area , a patchwork of jurisdictions that borders on the ceasefire line splitting cyprus between greek and turkish cypriots , with a united nations buffer zone in the middle .
the waves of migrants fleeing neighboring syria have largely skirted the island , but there has been an increase in landings in recent months .
earlier on friday , the international organisation for migration ( iom ) said 850 people had made illicit landings in cyprus so far this year , compared with 345 in 2016 .
