budapest ( reuters ) - hungarian prime minister viktor orban on friday said that hungary sees a strong poland as a vital component of a central european caucus within the european union , and so will block any action to suspend poland s voting rights in the eu .
orban said poland , under fire from brussels for its transformation of the judiciary , was being criticized unfairly and unjustly .
he spelled out that hungary would not subscribe to an attempt to invoke the eu s article 7 sanction process .
we need to make it clear to the eu that it is pointless even to start proceedings against poland as there is no chance of seeing it through - because hungary will be there and form an insurmountable road block , orban said .
