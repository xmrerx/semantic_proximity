What do you think?
Has Americans reached their breaking point?
The Fox News and Fox Business networks have suspended on-air host Stacey Dash and commentator Lt. Col. Ralph Peters for cursing on the air about President Obama s handling of the Islamic State terrorist group.https://youtu.be/9RYsIAkyNlIPeters called Obama a pussy after his primetime televised speech on terrorism, while Dash said that he couldn t give a shit about the terrorist group.
Both commentators immediately acknowledged that they were wrong for using the epithets, but the suspension still stands.Via: Breitbart News
