washington/manchester , n.h. ( reuters ) - u.s. democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton ’ s campaign chair denied a monday report that she is considering staff changes after the new hampshire nominating contest on tuesday .
“ there is zero truth to what you may be reading .
it ’ s wrong .
hillary stands behind her team , period , ” chairman john podesta tweeted .
podesta was responding to a politico report that clinton and her husband , former president bill clinton , had planned to reassess staffing and strategy after the first four primaries but are becoming increasingly critical of their aides and demanded the evaluation sooner .
the former secretary of state would be more inclined to add new staff rather than fire current employees , according to the politico story , which cited six unnamed sources .
clinton , once the clear front-runner for the democratic nomination , has lost ground to challenger bernie sanders , a u.s. senator from vermont who is expected to win the new hampshire primary .
last week she narrowly beat sanders in the iowa caucuses , the first nominating contest for the nov. 8 election .
asked by msnbc about the politico story , clinton said : “ i have no idea what they ’ re talking about or who they are talking to. ” “ we ’ re going to take stock , but it ’ s going to be the campaign that i ’ ve got , ” clinton said in the interview with msnbc .
“ i ’ m very confident in the people that i have .
i ’ m very committed to them .
they ’ re committed to doing the best we can , ” she said .
