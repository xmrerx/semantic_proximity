the shocker about this is that students on both sides of the political spectrum want the 9/11 flags to be displayed where they ve always been displayed .
the inability of college campuses to stand up to people who are perpetually offended is a sad statement on where we are in american tolerance these days .
it s so ironic that the left wants you to march to their drum beat or else they will destroy you .
note to smu : you had a good thing going with your student body coming together to memorialize 9/11 so let it continue ! dallas , tex .
in a time of extreme political divide , students both republican and democrat at one texas college have found something they can agree on.for the past two years at southern methodist university , a campus group has planted thousands of american flags in front of dallas hall as a memorial to the victims of the 9/11 attacks .
that s simply contradictory to the very definition of free speech , said grant wolf , the young americans for freedom chairman.but in july , smu changed its policy , saying student groups can no longer have displays there.the lawn has historically hosted tributes and protests from students of all political affiliations .
the leaders of two prominent student groups say the policy violates their right to free speech .
they re basically cornering us into a segment of campus and saying you re not allowed to have a display here because it s triggering , harmful or offensive to students over there , said drew wicker , the president of smu college republicans.smu released a statement saying nearby momac park , where displays will be allowed , is larger than the lawn and is along one of the most prominent drives on campus.the university said it respects the rights of all campus community members to express their opinions , as well as their right to be free from coercion or harassment .
