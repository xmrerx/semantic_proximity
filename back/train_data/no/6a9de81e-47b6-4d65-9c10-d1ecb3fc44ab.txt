beijing ( reuters ) - a skyscraper fire in the northern chinese port city of tianjin killed 10 and injured five early on friday , state media reported .
the fire broke out around 4 a.m. on the 38th floor of a serviced apartment building near the city centre , the official xinhua news agency said .
xinhua said the fire had been extinguished and that early indications were that the blaze was caused by interior decorating materials used in a renovation catching fire .
state broadcaster cctv said renovation workers working on site were among the casualties .
fire safety has come under scrutiny in china after a deadly blaze last month killed 19 in the far southern fringe of beijing , which has led to citywide evictions seen by some people as unfairly targeting the vulnerable underclass .
tianjin party secretary li hongzhong said authorities would carry out citywide fire safety inspections in response to friday s blaze , the official tianjin daily reported .
