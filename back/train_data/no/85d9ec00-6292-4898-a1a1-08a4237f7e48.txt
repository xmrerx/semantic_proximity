dubai ( reuters ) - yemen s houthi group has buried the body of former yemeni president ali abdullah saleh in sanaa , allowing only a handful of relatives to attend , sources from his general people s congress ( gpc ) party said on sunday .
saleh , 75 , was killed by the iran-aligned houthis on monday , after he had called for a new page in ties with a saudi-led coalition that his supporters together with the houthis had fought for nearly three years .
a gpc source , who has asked not to be identified , said the houthis allowed less than 10 people from saleh s relatives to attend the night-time burial in the capital sanaa , but gave no details on the exact location .
gpc secretary-general aref al-zouka , who was killed with saleh , was buried on saturday in his native al-saeed district of shabwa province in southern yemen after the houthis handed over his body to tribal leaders , media and gpc officials said .
relatives said on thursday that saleh s family had refused conditions demanded by the houthis for handing over the body .
some said they wanted to bury the body in the courtyard of a mosque he had built near the presidential compound in southern sanaa .
saleh ruled yemen for 33 years before being forced to step down in 2012 in a gulf-brokered transition plan following months of arab spring protests demanding democracy .
he remained in politics as the head of the gpc , yemen s largest political party , and in 2015 he joined forces with the iran-aligned houthis after they captured the capital sanaa in a move that precipitated saudi-led military intervention on the side of president abd-rabbu mansour hadi .
