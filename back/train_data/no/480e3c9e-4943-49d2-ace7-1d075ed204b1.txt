deputy attorney general rod rosenstein appeared before the u.s. house of representatives judiciary committee on wednesday , amid new questions about anti-trump text messages sent by fbi employees assigned to special counsel robert mueller s russia investigation .
rosenstein testified that mueller is running his office appropriately and without bias.in a colorful exchange between congressman steve chabot ( r-oh ) and rosenstein , chabot asked the deputy ag : how with a straight face , can you say that this group of democrat partisans are unbiased , and will give president trump a fair shake ?
after a brief stammer , rosenstein replied that political affiliation and the issue of bias are different things , and that we should trust the experience mueller and the justice department have in managing investigation teams , adding : we recognize that we have employees with political opinions , and it s our responsibility to make sure those opinions do not influence their actions .
to which chabot argued how can anyone possibly reach that conclusion : i was at first encouraged .
it seemed like a serious matter and deserved a serious investigation .
and i assumed , as many of us did , that mr. mueller would pull together an unbiased team .
but , rather than wearing stripes as umpires and referees might wear , i would submit that the mueller team overwhelmingly , uh , oughta be attired with democratic donkeys on their jerseys or i m with hillary t-shirts , certainly not with let s make america great again and i think that s a shame .
because i think the american people deserve a lot better than the very biased team they re getting under robert mueller .
and i think it s really sad .
