beirut ( reuters ) - shelling killed around ten people , including five children at a school gate , in a besieged rebel enclave near syria s capital damascus on tuesday , a day after a u.n. aid delivery to the area , a war monitor said .
the shelling also injured 30 other people in the eastern ghouta area , the syrian observatory for human rights said .
the britain-based monitor said the ongoing shelling which began tuesday morning hit the towns of jisreen , douma , saqba , mesraba , harasta , ain terma , hazza and kafr batna .
on monday a united nations and syrian arab red crescent ( sarc ) convoy delivered aid to the towns of kafr batna and saqba .
a tightening siege by government forces has pushed people to the verge of famine in the eastern suburbs , residents and aid workers said last week , bringing desperation to the only major rebel enclave near the syrian capital .
syrian state television on tuesday said shells had also hit parts of government-held damascus , injuring at least five people .
in july , moscow and rebels in eastern ghouta signed a deal to make the area a de-escalation zone .
the agreement raised hopes of open crossings and aid flows .
the aid organisation international rescue committee said on monday the de-escalation zone agreements with rebel areas across syria were failing to protect civilians .
the safety of civilians has not improved with the establishment of these so-called de-escalation areas .
with so many armed groups not covered by ceasefire agreements , we have even seen periods of increased aerial bombardment , irc s middle east director of public affairs tom garofalo said .
