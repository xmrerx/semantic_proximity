wouldn t it have been great to see mitt fight as hard to reveal the truth about barack hussein obama , aka barry soetoro in 2012 , as he is trying to find some bombshell revelation about trump ? sorry mitt , but you forfeited your opportunity to save america when you cowered to political correctness .
cue the trump train wednesday in a facebook post , 2012 republican presidential nominee and vocal donald trump critic mitt romney said , it is disqualifying for a modern day presidential nominee to refuse to release tax returns to the voters .
romney added , there is only one logical explanation for mr. trump s refusal to release his returns : there is a bombshell in them .
given mr. trump s equanimity with other flaws in his history , we can only assume it s a bombshell of unusual size .
in an interview on tuesday with the associated press , trump said , there s nothing to learn from them .
on wednesday , trump clarified by tweeting : in interview i told @ ap that my taxes are under routine audit and i would release my tax returns when audit is complete , not after election !
