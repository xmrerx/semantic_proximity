Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 29, 2017ewfwefewf@realDonaldTrump But they did mention your failed Muslim Ban, failed Trumpcare, your failed sanctuary city ban.
But keep doing those rallies!

Molly Knight (@molly_knight) April 29, 2017@realDonaldTrump No major legislation signed.
You failed to repeal Obamacare, as offered during elections.
You re a #FAKEPRESIDENT with lowest approval!!

Jose Andrade (@jandrade) April 29, 2017@realDonaldTrump Your only achievement has been setting the record for vacation days.
Nobody intelligent respects you!
Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) April 29, 2017@realDonaldTrump So Present them.
You can t say they are hiding your achievements if you don t have any.

BG Red (@BG_Red_22) April 29, 2017@realDonaldTrump And most important, lets not forget, all of those Russian investigations.
Now thats impressive RobWagner (@wagner_rob) April 29, 2017@realDonaldTrump Do you even know what those 28 signings are?
They amount to nothing, seriously.
Most are jokes.
You shouldn t be so proud of them.
Michael Brandvold (@michaelsb) April 29, 2017What has Donald Trump accomplished?
He s managed to have three executive orders shut down by the courts and play a lot of golf.
Not exactly something to be proud of, is it?Featured image via Getty Images (Scott Olson)/screengrab
