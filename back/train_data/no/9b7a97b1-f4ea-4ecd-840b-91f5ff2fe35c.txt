cairo ( reuters ) - bahrain said on tuesday it would impose entry visas on qatar nationals and residents in what it called a security measure .
bahrain , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and egypt cut diplomatic , transport and trade ties with qatar in june , accusing it of financing terrorism .
doha denies that and says the boycott is an attempt to rein in its support for reform .
the new measures aim at preventing harming the security and stability of the kingdom of bahrain particularly in light of the latest repercussions of the crisis with qatar , said a statement from the official bahraini news agency bna .
citizens from the six-nation gulf cooperation council countries are supposed to be able to travel within the gcc carrying only an identity card .
bahrain s visa requirements will apply from nov. 10 .
ambassador ali khalfan al mansouri , qatar s permanent representative to the united nations office in geneva , said the visas constitute a flagrant violation of the agreements and resolutions of the gulf cooperation council .
these measures are completely contrary to the statements of officials of the siege countries not to harm the qatari citizen when taking any steps in the context of this crisis , mansouri told the qatari state news agency .
bahrain believes qatar is fomenting unrest in the island kingdom by supporting protests and even sporadic shooting and bombing attacks against security forces .
bahrain s foreign minister said on sunday his country would not attend december s gcc summit if qatar does not change its policies , and that qatar should have its gcc membership suspended .
