donald trump has called himself a patriot many times , yet according to recent investigations he didn t donate a penny to 9/11 charities , despite claiming otherwise .
that definitely doesn t seem very patriotic.mr .
billionaire trump promised to donate $ 10,000 to a major 9/11 charity , yet the money was never received .
to a billionaire , $ 10,000 is pocket change , so why didn t he actually give it to the charities ?
is he really that greedy ?
leave it to trump to make a scene , order more fame and attention , only to have made the whole thing up.ny daily news says : city controller scott stringer conducted a review of hundreds of pages of previously sealed records of the two main 9/11 charities at the request of the daily news , and found that trump and his charity hadn t donated a dime in the months after 9/11.it s not unlike trump to want more public attention and create whatever lie necessary for that attention ; however , even for a pig like him , this is a bit too far.not until april of 2016 while running for president did donald trump actually donate money to a 9/11 related cause .
during his first visit to the september 11th museum memorial he made another grand scene while donating $ 100,000 dollars to the museum .
this time the money was actually received , but we can safely bet it s only because of how much attention is on him.this goes to show donald trump is only charitable when it suits him .
and it s not even really charity he s buying publicity , not donating money , in his view .
he s always been a lying , scandalous pig , yet now could quite possibly the next president of our country .
let s make sure that doesn t happen come november.photo by drew angerer/getty images
