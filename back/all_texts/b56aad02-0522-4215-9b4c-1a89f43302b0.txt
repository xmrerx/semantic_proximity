LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May could have more to say on the Brexit financial settlement at next week s European Union summit, her spokeswoman said on Friday.
Brexit talks are deadlocked over money, the EU s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said on Thursday.
He ruled out discussions on future trade being launched by EU leaders next week but spoke of possible progress by December.
On financial settlement in general, the prime minister has been clear all along that we need to reach a settlement and we will honor our commitments, May s spokeswoman told reporters.
The prime minister will be in Brussels next week where she will be talking to European leaders at the European Council so I am sure that there will be more to say there.
May s spokeswoman said that the detail of the financial settlement was for the negotiation and that the issue could only be resolved as part of the settlement of all of the issues that she spoke about in Florence .
