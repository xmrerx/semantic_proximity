Bullies come in all different shapes, sizes and professions.
It s too bad that this bully is protected by the teacher s union.
San Francisco, CA The war on Christmas continues as a simple well-wishing of Merry Christmas has led to big trouble for one third-grade San Francisco girl this week.Samantha Dawson, an 8-year-old student at Westview Elementary School in San Francisco, CA., was in the school cafeteria Tuesday eating with friends when she was taken to the principal s office and given a week-long suspension.
Her punishment was consequence for saying Merry Christmas to her homeroom teacher earlier that day.Dawson s teacher, 37-year-old Paul Horner who is an outspoken Atheist, was offended at the students display of Christmas spirit and had staff suspend the young girl for the rest of the week.
I say Merry Christmas to everyone, the young girl told CBS News.
I didn t think it would cause so much trouble just for saying a couple little words.
The girl s mother, Laura Dawson, 41, was fuming over the issue.
You don t traumatize a child who loves to go to school, who wanted to be early every day to school, you don t make her cry, just for wishing someone Merry Christmas, she told reporters, holding back tears.
You just don t do it.
Reporters spoke with Mr. Horner as he was leaving from school yesterday.
I warned the children not to bring religion into my classroom, Horner said.
Maybe Samantha will listen to adults next time.
At the time of this press release, Westview Elementary School officials declined to comment, though this was posted on the school s website: Once again we had to suspend a student, 3rd grader Samantha Dawson, because she said Merry Christmas to her homeroom teacher, who is a proud atheist.
