luanda ( reuters ) - angola s first new president in almost four decades vowed to rebuild an economy devastated by falling oil prices and fight corruption at his inauguration on tuesday .
jo o louren o told thousands of supporters in luanda he would also tackle gaping inequality in africa s second largest oil producer - though analysts have already raised doubts about his ability to make far-reaching change .
no one is so rich and powerful that they can not be punished and no one is so poor that they can not be protected , he said to loud applause .
in a 45-minute speech , louren o said he would strive to bring in reforms covering gender equality , the freedom of the press , private enterprise and public health .
former president jose eduardo dos santos remains head of the ruling mpla party , giving the veteran leader influence over key policy decisions .
any serious attempt to transform the country could put louren o on a collision course with senior party figures and powerful interest groups .
angola s economy fell into recession last year , while unemployment is officially over 20 percent and a shortage of foreign currency has forced firms to pull back operations .
louren o said he would work to reduce state intervention in the economy and give free enterprise the space and support to thrive .
he has previously said he does not rule out negotiating a deal with the international monetary fund or world bank to help rebuild an economy heavily reliant on oil .
there are enormous challenges before us ... we call on the help of everyone on this difficult journey , he said .
