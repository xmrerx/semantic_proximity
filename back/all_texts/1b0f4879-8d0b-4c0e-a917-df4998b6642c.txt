During a panel segment on Real Time with Bill Maher on Friday night, former Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele tried to make a half-hearted case for a Donald Trump administration.
The case was shut down instantly by Maher, who had initially asked Steele, What is the bridge too far?
What is the point at which you say my country before my nominee?
Steele responded by stating clearly that he is a Party man by any measure.
He has served as not only the RNC chairman but also as the chairman of Republican committees at every level of politics.
Maher jumps in asking Steele if that s the case, then is there really a bridge too far for him.
Steele insists that there is and offers this argument: There is a bridge too far.
I want to see and I ve been very clear about this since the beginning, I want to see Donald Trump make the kinds of steps I know he is a 70-year-old-man I know he isn t going to change.
It s just not in the cards.
Here s the rub.
I philosophically cannot sit there and go Oh well, because I m so pissed off and cannot stand Donald Trump that I am going to fall in love with Hillary Clinton.
That s just not where I am.
Maher counters, saying, It s not about Donald Trump, it s about the policies he supports.
Maher then goes on to say that he views this election as a referendum on decency, and calls Trump an indecent man.
