21st century wire says unless you have been living under a rock for the last 20 years , you would have heard about the cultural meme known as the six degrees of kevin bacon , hollywood s own lowbrow revision derived from john guare s famous 1990 play about the six degrees of separation .so popular was bacon s cultural quirk , that the gods of google even launched a web tool called the baconator where users can plug in the name of anyone in order to measure how many degrees of separation there are between you and them .
if i m about to go to work with someone , i ll check their name on the call sheet , and then i ll go to google , and you can put in their name plus bacon number , and that will tell you how many degrees of separation there are .
it ll tell [ me ] if i worked with them , said bacon to tv host james corden recently.just as the baconator was getting going , kevin was usurped , like everyone and everything else , by the ever-engulfing digital vortex known as facebook and its hoodie-wearing billionaire co-founder mark zuckerberg.poor kevin .
according to new data published by the social networking behemoth , facebook people are separated by only 3.57 degrees of separation .
casey williams from the huff post explains , one caveat about this research , though : it applies only to the 1.59 billion people who are active on facebook .
given that there are more than 7 billion people on the planet , and that over four billion still lack regular access to the internet , it s unlikely that the new theory holds for humans at large .
the down side of course ( although facebook will never publish its trolling data ) , is that you are also more closely connected with thousands , if not millions of trolls and their phony , malicious sock-puppet accounts too.even worse , as 21wire discovered late last week facebook can and will , without any warning whatsoever and with zero human feedback on their end block and disable your ability to share information with your peers through its user groups .
when asked , the reason given by facebook was simply , you re going too fast .
no , we re not kidding once again , thank you mr. zuckerberg for allowing your robots to kill people s ability to share news and information.when they say degrees of separation they really mean separation.read more sci-tech news at : 21st century wire sci-tech files
