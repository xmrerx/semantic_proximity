as donald trump continues to sink his political party due to his inability to be presidential ( or seemingly human ) , it s been reported that the democratic congressional campaign committee has released internal polling from their campaign headquarters which shows one scary thing for republicans : hillary clinton is beating donald trump ( by double digits ) in seven republican congressional districts across the country.the districts are : because trump s unstable , asinine , and outrageous campaign , districts that have gone republican for 30+ years ( and weren t affected by the obama wave in 2008 ) may turn blue this november , and it s all thanks to donald j. trump.it s still a steep climb for democrats , who need to take back 30 seats to have a majority in the house and six in the senate ( which way more probable ) .
but democrats took 30 seats in 2006 , so the idea isn t entirely far fetched.but there s only one sure way it will happen : democrats come out and vote in presidential elections , and should they vote down-ticket , not only could the senate be taken back , significant gains could be made in the house , allowing a clinton presidency to have a congress that works with her to get progressive policies pushed through.featured image via joe readle/getty images
