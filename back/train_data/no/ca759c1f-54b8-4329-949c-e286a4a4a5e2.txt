istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish police began an operation to detain 121 former foreign ministry staff across the country on thursday over their alleged links to the u.s.-based cleric who ankara says orchestrated last year s attempted coup , state-run anadolu agency said .
it said the ministry personnel were previously dismissed over suspected ties to islamic preacher fethullah gulen , who lives in self-imposed exile in pennsylvania .
he has denied involvement in the failed putsch in july 2016 .
counter-terrorism police squads began simultaneous raids in 30 provinces to capture the suspects , some of whom were believed to be users of bylock , an encrypted messaging app which the government says was used by gulen s network , anadolu reported .
under a crackdown since the coup , more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over alleged links to gulen , while 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the military , public and private sectors .
the government dismisses rights groups concerns about the crackdown , saying only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by gulen s network , which it says infiltrated institutions such as the judiciary , army and schools .
