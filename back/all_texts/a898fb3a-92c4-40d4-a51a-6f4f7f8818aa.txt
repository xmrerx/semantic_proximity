Khizr Khan, whose son died while serving as an American Army captain in Iraq, spoke at the Democratic National Convention where he called out Donald Trump for his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States.
Khan said during his speech that Trump has sacrificed nothing and no one in his life.
Trump fired back at the man and his family, creating a political firestorm.During an interview on MSNBC s The Last Word, Khan pleaded with GOP House Speaker Paul Ryan and GOP Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell to disavow Trump.
During his plea, Khan alleges that the only reason the two have not dropped Trump is due to fear of the political consequences of the move.
If your candidate wins and he governs the way he has campaigned, my country this country will have a Constitutional crisis like never before in the history of this country.
And my conscience compels me under these really difficult circumstances.
[I have] very raw emotions.
I am a very composed person.
I don t become that emotional but there is so much at stake and I appeal to both of these leaders.
There comes a time in the history of a nation where a moral stand must be taken regardless of the political cost.
The only reason they are not repudiating his behavior, his threat to our democracy, our decency, our foundation, is just because of political consequences.
Both Ryan and McConnell have tacitly spoken out against the comments Trump made about the Khan family.
Both Republicans are less than thrilled that Trump is the Republican Party s presidential candidate, though the two have said that they will support him over Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.If and how long Trump will continue to have their support is anyone s guess.You can watch the interview below, in full.Featured image via video screen capture
