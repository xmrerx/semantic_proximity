On Thursday, Donald Trump did a huge favor for defense contractors when he tweeted that The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes.
While this is obviously good news for companies involved in making a nuclear cold war (or a nuclear apocalypse) happen, it s bad news for everyone else.While some assumed that The Donald wasn t serious when he said that we need to build more nukes, he clarified to MSNBC s Morning Joe on Friday that he was very, very serious about his decision to provoke other nuclear-capable nations into building up a world-ending arsenal.
Hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski spoke to the President-elect, and he informed them:Asked to respond to Trump s terrifying statement, Washington Post columnist David Ignatius explained that a nuclear arms race might be too much for even Trump s supporters: You can create space, but the space is then there to be able to negotiate, not to throw more wood on the fire.
If you say, What I really do want is an arms race, you re going to lose the country.
The country doesn t want another arms race.
The country definitely doesn t want a nuclear arms race, but if Trump has his way our children will be learning to duck underneath their desks to shield themselves from a nuclear blast, or whatever ridiculous drill we will be forced to come up with thanks to our President s decision to enter us unto a new cold war.If you didn t consider Trump a serious threat to our nation before, you really should consider reassessing your views since on January 20 he will be the guy who can kick off exactly the scenario he tells us he wants.Watch the Morning Joe segment below:BREAKING: Trump to #morningjoe on the nukes tweet: 'Let it be an arms race' https://t.co/X9FMNtgKPK Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) December 23, 2016
