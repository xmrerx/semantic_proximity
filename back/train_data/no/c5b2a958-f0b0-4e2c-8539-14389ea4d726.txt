( reuters ) - bill clinton faced down protesters for 10 minutes at a presidential campaign rally in philadelphia for his wife , hillary clinton , over their criticisms that a 1994 crime bill he approved while president led to a surge in black people being imprisoned .
several protesters heckled him and held signs , including one that read “ clinton crime bill destroyed our communities. ” video footage of hillary clinton defending the bill in 1994 by calling young people in gangs “ super predators ” who need to “ be brought to heel ” have been widely circulated during the campaign by activists in the black lives matter protest movement .
bill clinton defended her 1994 remarks , which protesters say were racially insensitive .
“ i don ’ t know how you would characterize the gang leaders who got 13-year-old kids hopped on crack and sent them out on the street to murder other african-american children , ” he said , shaking his finger at a heckler as clinton supporters cheered , according to video of the event .
“ maybe you thought they were good citizens .
she didn ’ t. ” hillary clinton , who also has faced protesters upset by her remarks , has said she regrets using the term .
bill clinton said last year that he regrets signing the violent crime control and law enforcement act into law because it contributed to the country ’ s high incarceration rate of black people for nonviolent crimes .
