sao paulo ( reuters ) - brazil s prosecutor general officially presented money laundering and criminal association charges against six people , including a former federal minister and a congressman , brazilian media reported on monday evening .
according to newspapers estad o and o globo , the prosecutor general sent the formal accusations to brazil s supreme court , which will now decide on further actions .
the prosecutor officially accused geddel vieira lima , the papers said , who was in charge of president michel temer s relations with congress until november 2016 .
the charges related to a previously disclosed corruption probe , in which his fingerprints were found in bags hiding more than 51 million reais ( $ 15.7 million ) in cash .
the prosecutor also accused geddel s brother and a federal congressman , l cio vieira lima , their mother , marluce vieira lima , a former advisor to l cio , job ribeiro , the ex-director of the civil defense force for the city of salvador , gustavo ferraz , and a partner at construction company cosbat , luiz fernando costa filho , o globo reported .
among the possible sources of the 51 million reais of cash , the prosecutor said according to the paper , were bribes from embattled construction firm odebrecht [ odbes.ul ] and kickbacks related to president temer s brazilian democratic movement party ( pmbd ) .
the prosecutor general s office , a lawyer for vieira lima and representatives of odebrecht did not immediately respond to requests for comment outside normal business hours .
lawyers for the other defendants could not immediately be reached for comment .
brazil has been wracked by corruption cases that have reached all levels of business and government in recent years , shattering the public s faith in the political class .
just weeks ago , police arrested the head of the rio state assembly and two other state assemblymen on corruption charges , all of whom were also members of temer s pmdb .
