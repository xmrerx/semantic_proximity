wait , didn t nikki haley just say getting assad out is not the only priority , we don t see a peaceful syria with assad in there .
our strategy in syria , our priority is first to defeat isis , says tillerson .
again haley outlines multiple priorities and there s not any sort of option where a political solution is going to happen with assad at the head of the regime .

once a ceasefire becomes a reality in syria , we will have the conditions to begin a useful political process , he said .
it is through that political process that we believe the syrian people will ultimately be able to decide the fate of bashar assad , he told abc.tillerson reiterated the same on cbs , saying that washington hoped to work with its coalition members and with the un , in particular through the geneva process , to be able to navigate a political outcome in which the syrian people will in fact determine bashar assad s fate and his legitimacy .
