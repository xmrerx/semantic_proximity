twenty years ago when , uh , we won the first republican majority in 40 years , there was one radio talk show host that nobody d ever heard of .
uh , there was one cable news channel that just did news .
and you look at t-today , you ve got hundreds of radio talk show hosts all trying to outdo themselves , right going further right and further right and further right .
uh , you ve got all these cable news channels , and all they do are politics , and it s tending to either push or pull people into one of two camps .
if i go down to see president obama , the right begins to wonder what i m up to ; the left begins to wonder what the president s up to .
the president s suggested , hey , you think it s too much trouble if we play golf again ?
( snickers ) and i have to look at him and say , yes !
rush : so boehner can t play golf with obama cause of us .
he can t play golf because he s afraid talk radio and fox news are gon na wonder what he s up to and maybe well , i don t know , reading his mind think that we re gon na say he s selling out or that obama s doing whatever.some people were pushing me to run for the senate .
i decided i didn t want to do that , and i made a decision that the rest of my career was gon na be in the us house .
so the team said to me , all right , well , the rest of your career s gon na be in the house .
what s your goal ?
i didn t know !
so i said , well , if you don t shoot for the top ( snickers ) , why shoot for anything ?
so i set my goal to be speaker .
