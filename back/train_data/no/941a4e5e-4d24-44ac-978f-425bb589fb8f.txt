just look around the world and throughout recent history , and you will find a number of compelling cases where western-backed ngos have frequently acted as enablers for the military interventions , sanctions and economic blockades that followed .
look at iraq , libya , syria , afghanistan , yugoslavia , iran and sudan all were given the human rights treatment prior to aggressive western actions .
in most cases , claims of human rights violations and exaggerated atrocity reports preceded western action .
in his 2016 position paper entitled , an introduction : smart power & the human rights industrial complex , 21wire s patrick henningsen raised the alarm about the use of high-profile human rights charities and ngos like human rights watch and amnesty international who have allowed their organisations to be used as pro-interventionist propaganda outlets : though many human rights charities still market themselves as neutral and nonpartisan , but reality is something very different .
with public skepticism of the charity sector already at an all-time high , the danger is clear : if conflicts of interest are not addressed in a serious way , it could eventually undermine the overall credibility of the non-governmental organization ( ngo ) sector internationally .
below is a video presentation from leading independent military affairs website southfront which skillfully unravels the west s sophisticated international third sector web of ngo s and charities , and how they are used to promote the foreign policy and military objectives of the us and its nato allies worldwide .
