Donald Trump has been having a meltdown like nothing we ve ever seen in politics.
Ever since top Republicans have distanced themselves from him over his lewd remarks about grabbing women by their p*ssy , Trump can barely control his outbursts.
He s not only going after Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, he s even attacking his own party now!At the top of Trump s sh*t list is House Speaker Paul Ryan, who finally found his conscience and was so disgusted with Trump s misogynistic comments that he has stopped campaigning for Trump altogether, opting to focus down-ballot instead.Unable to admit that sexually assaulting women is wrong, Trump is taking out all his anger on Ryan and trashing him every chance he gets.
At his rally in Florida on Wednesday, Trump threw Ryan under the bus and accused him of being part of a sinister deal to help Clinton get into the White House.Shouting until he got red in the face, Trump shared his latest insane conspiracy theory with his supporters, who soaked up every word of it.
Trump yelled: You think that they would say, Great going, Don, let s go.
Let s beat this crook.
She s a crook.
Let s beat her.
We got to stop her.
He doesn t do that.
A little later in the rally, Trump continued to say There s a whole sinister deal going on between Ryan and Clinton.
You can watch this ridiculous footage below:[ad3media campaign= 1123 ]This recent attack on Ryan comes after an epic tweetstorm that Trump launched against the GOP, slamming his own party and Ryan for being appalled about his disrespectful comments about women.
While it s about time that Ryan stopped helping and defending Trump, the House Speaker still hasn t pulled his endorsement.
Perhaps after Trump attacks him a few more times, Ryan will be done with Trump for good.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images
