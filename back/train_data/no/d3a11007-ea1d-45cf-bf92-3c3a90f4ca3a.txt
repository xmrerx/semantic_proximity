rome ( reuters ) - pope francis lamented the decay and degradation of rome on friday , using a traditional prayer on a national feast day to highlight problems such as environmental blight and corruption in the italian capital .
francis made his comments at the base of rome s famed spanish steps , where each year popes pay homage to a statue of the madonna on the feast of the immaculate conception .
rome has fallen into disrepair and degradation in recent years , with streets full of pot holes , piles of garbage and neglected public gardens where weeds grow as tall as a person .
francis , who is also bishop of rome , prayed that the residents of the city develop antibodies against some viruses of our times .
those he listed included resignation to environmental and ethical degradation , civic incivility , contempt for the common good , and fear of immigrants .
in july , two leaders of a crime ring that plundered rome city coffers were convicted along with some 40 politicians , officials and businessmen , at the end of one of the biggest corruption trials in the italian capital .
gang members were accused of infiltrating rome city hall and using bribery and intimidation to get their hands on lucrative public contracts , including those for the running of centers housing immigrants who have flooded into italy from africa .
on friday , the pope spoke of the need to help so many people who have emigrated here from places of war and hunger .
the investigation of the crime ring laid bare systemic corruption in the city as politicians , bureaucrats and businessmen hooked up with lowlife criminals to rig public tenders .
the corruption was seen as the one of the causes of the recent disrepair and degradation , which has received widespread cover in the foreign media , blemishing the city s appeal as a tourist destination .
