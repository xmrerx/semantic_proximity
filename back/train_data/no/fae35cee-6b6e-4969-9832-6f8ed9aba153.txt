tokyo ( reuters ) - philippine president rodrigo duterte will visit japan for talks with prime minister shinzo abe this month , ahead of key regional meetings beginning with the asia-pacific economic cooperation ( apec ) gathering in vietnam in november .
japan and the philippines have close ties and our strategic partnership can promote stability in the region , japanese chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said on wednesday during a regular press briefing .
duterte will arrive on oct 29 for a three day visit , suga said .
japan is concerned about china s growing power in the south china sea and sees cooperation with the philippines , which lies on the waterway s eastern side , as key to helping prevent the spread of beijing s influence into the western pacific .
duterte , unlike his predecessor , benigno aquino , has courted china and has been less critical of its island building in the region .
following the two-day apec meeting from nov 11 , which u.s. president donald trump and chinese president xi jinping will attend , asia pacific leaders will travel to the philippines for the east asia summit , including representatives from the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) and other asia pacific nations .
duterte s visit will mark his second trip to japan and his third meeting with abe .
