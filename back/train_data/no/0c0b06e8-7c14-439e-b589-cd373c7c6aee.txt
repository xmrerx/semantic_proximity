the double standard here is unbelievable !
we just reported on a high school student in big trouble for saying build the wall in her yearbook quote .
that s pretty harmless but the school took back the yearbooks .fast forward and a high school student wrote out their thoughts on president trump in the yearbook i would like to behead him .
i do not like him .
see the huge difference here ? minneapolis ( wcco ) just under a month after a big lake trap team s photo was banned from the high school yearbook , another high school yearbook photo is making news.for its 2017 yearbook , brainerd high school dedicated a page to president donald trump .
editors asked students their thoughts on the president , and shared the quotes next to their picture.one sophomore said , i would like to behead him .
i do not like him .
the photo went viral , sparking controversy on twitter .
now , that student is telling her side of the story .
i was so confused , because at first , i didn t ever remember saying that , 15-year-old camryn said.camryn who asked wcco not to reveal her last name says she had no idea a conversation with a classmate last september would lead to nationwide attention .
she says the classmate never said she was working for the yearbook when she asked about then-candidate donald trump .
i did not say , i want to behead him .
i did not say , i am going to behead him .
i just said , well i m sure we all wouldn t mind him being beheaded , something along those lines , camryn said .
but there was never the direct quote , i do not like him .
i would like to behead him .
that conversation exploded on social media 8 months later , with the help of at least one celebrity .
former joanie loves chachi actor scott baio shared the photo , tagging the president , the fbi , sean hannity and kellyanne conway.read more : cbs
