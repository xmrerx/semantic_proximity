dubai ( reuters ) - etihad airways is advising some passengers to check with u.s. diplomatic missions before traveling after u.s. president donald trump signed a revised executive order banning visits by nationals of six muslim-majority nations .
monday ’ s order , which takes effect on march 16 , keeps a 90-day ban on travel to the u.s. by citizens of iran , libya , syria , somalia , sudan and yemen .
it applies only to new visa applicants , meaning about 60,000 people whose visas were revoked by the previous order will now be permitted to enter .
etihad , based in the united arab emirates , said it was strongly encouraging nationals of the listed countries “ to consult with their nearest united states embassy or consulate to ensure they are legally entitled to enter the united states. ” fellow uae carrier emirates said it was aware of the new order and would adhere to it. ” emirates will comply with the guidance provided to us by the u.s. customs and border protection , ” an airline spokeswoman said by email .
the carrier was forced to reschedule flight crew on some u.s. flights to comply with the original ban .
trump ’ s original jan. 27 executive order , suspended on feb. 3 , caused chaos and confusion at airports worldwide , with the airline industry complaining about a lack of clear and direct communication from u.s. officials .
hours before monday ’ s order was signed , a qatar airways spokeswoman told reuters it had not received guidance from the u.s. government about the new ban .
