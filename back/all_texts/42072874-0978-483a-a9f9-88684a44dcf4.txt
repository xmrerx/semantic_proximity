Long story short: a Republican member of the House has filed an amendment to block the United States Treasury, which is responsible for monetary transactions in this country, from putting Harriet Tubman on the $20 bill.But it has nothing to do with race whatsoever, the Republican says.
Of course not.Rep.
Steve King is the one behind the amendment.
You know, the guy who says Mexican immigrants have calves the size of cantaloupes because they smuggle so many drugs into the country.
He s totally not racist, and wants you know why.
Pulling a $20 out of his pocket, the Congressman from Iowa declares: It s not about Harriet Tubman, it s about keeping the picture on the $20.
Y know?
Why would you want to change that?
I am a conservative, I like to keep what we have.
But the Congressman didn t stop while he was ahead.
Naturally, he went on to say something incredibly stupid, adding that putting women or people of color to our currency was actually in of itself sexist and racist, and of course blamed liberals for political correctness: Here s what s really happening: This is liberal activism on the part of the president that s trying to identify people by categories, and he s divided us on the lines of groups.
This is a divisive proposal on the part of the president, and mine s unifying.
It says just don t change anything.
Dear Congressman: putting a black woman, an abolitionist, on our currency isn t divisive.
Trying to block a federal agency by withholding money, because you oppose a black woman being on currency, is divisive.King then accused President Obama of disrupting civilization over the decision.So not only is he a flaming racist, he s a total drama queen.Luckily the Rules Committee refused floor consideration of the overtly racist amendment.
With Trump in his back pocket, House Speaker Paul Ryan can t afford to indulge another racist.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images
