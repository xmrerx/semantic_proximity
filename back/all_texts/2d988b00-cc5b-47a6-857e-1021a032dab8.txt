Nice job Adam Baldwin.
We commend you for standing up to the highly successful, black multi-millionaires Jada Pinkett-Smith, her husband Will Smith and Director Spike Lee who, much like Al Sharpton never lets the opportunity to start a good race war go to waste Ever since the Motion Picture Academy announced the nominees for the 2016 Oscars, there have been some heated discussions on social media regarding the diversity or lack thereof displayed by the Academy s choices.Nowhere has this been more apparent than Twitter, where #OscarsSoWhite has become an ongoing trend.
It recently led to a dustup between Full Metal Jacket alum Adam Baldwin and Ironman actor Don Cheadle.
Via: IJRHere is the first joke dig at the Academy Award show by Cheadle:@chrisrock Yo, Chris.
Come check me out at #TheOscars this year.
They got me parking cars on G level.
Don Cheadle (@DonCheadle) January 17, 2016Baldwin responded:https://twitter.com/AdamBaldwin/status/688841370853740544Then Cheadle responded to Baldwin:@AdamBaldwin @chrisrock Nope.
Don Cheadle (@DonCheadle) January 18, 2016Then Baldwin asks Cheadle a legitimate question:https://twitter.com/AdamBaldwin/status/688898296006352896To which Cheadle responds with an incoherent answer:@AdamBaldwin @chrisrock Only the legitimacy of the phrase and complete and obvious truth of it.
Don Cheadle (@DonCheadle) January 18, 2016But when Baldwin challenged the one-time Oscar nominee https://twitter.com/AdamBaldwin/status/688916800579354624Cheadle then decided to twist the conversation around@AdamBaldwin @chrisrock The PHRASE OscarSoWhite, dumb dumb.
Not the show.
You're a lazy reader.
Don Cheadle (@DonCheadle) January 20, 2016At which time Baldwin slays Cheadle with FACTS:https://twitter.com/AdamBaldwin/status/689889591940100099And in typical liberal fashion, Academy Award winner Don Cheadle ran away with his tail between his legs.
Like a garlic to a vampire, the Left is always ready to defend victimhood until the facts come out and then they head for the hills.
