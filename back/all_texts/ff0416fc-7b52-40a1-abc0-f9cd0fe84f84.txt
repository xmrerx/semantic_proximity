The Women s Convention in Detroit brings to mind the stereotypical liberal female who s angry and bitter:The Detroit Free Press published photo after photo of women with raised fists and a look of anger See what we re getting at?
The tired and failing Democrats are grasping at the notion that President Trump is the enemy .
They re behaving like sheeple and following blindly So it s no surprise that they followed the tired chant from California Rep. Maxine Waters.
She shouted Impeach 45 during her speech at the Women s Convention Saturday.HEADLINING SPEAKER:Waters was the headlining speaker for the Women s March event, devoted part of her speech to leading the female attendees into a chant calling for the impeachment of President Donald Trump.
Video footage shows women on their feet with their fists in the air shouting Impeach 45!
Impeach 45!
Waters s speech focused on the recent allegations of sexual harassment against figures like Harvey Weinstein.
She also mentioned Trump s past behavior towards women, declaring This president has no respect for women.
Chanting "Impeach 45" led by @RepMaxineWaters alongside hundreds of strong, like-minded women is my happy place.

At $295 a ticket, women gathered in Detroit, Mich. to learn how to fundraise, how to be an ally and the issue of the most misogynistic administration in recent history.Women seemed to appreciate Waters s chant, telling the Detroit Free Press it was a powerful moment.
I loved how she called Trump out and I loved how she encouraged women to speak out and led us in an impeach chant, attendee Laura Chapman said.
It was so powerful to hear thousands of women chant impeach.
I m still shaking.
