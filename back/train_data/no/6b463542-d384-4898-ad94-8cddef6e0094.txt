people are freaking out all over the internet over a winged intruder at a bernie sanders rally in portland .
in the middle of sander s speech , a small and beautiful bird floated down and joined him on the podium.this is not some matthew bay-level cgi effect it actually happened .
sanders broke off mid-speech as the bird hovered around above him , and the packed stadium laughed and applauded .
but then , to everyone s surprise , the bird actually flew down and settled on the lectern .
i think there s some symbolism here , sanders said .
that little bird is really a dove asking us for world peace .
this sent the crowd into uproar , and the meme-makers went into overdrive.there was some speculation about what would have happened to the poor bird if it had innocently flapped its way into a trump rally .
@ politico if this was a trump rally .. his goons would beat it up or one of the cult members would shoot it greg king ( @ megreg916 ) march 25 , 2016and the whole affair is certainly not going to help portland rid itself of the portlandia gag # putabirdonit.a little bird told me that @ berniesanders is really a disney princess.also portland you 're taking that # putabirdonit thing way too serious kelly kapowski ( @ colo_kelly ) march 25 , 2016for those who missed that joke .
sketch show portlandia , which satirizes the uber-liberal oregon city , made it famous with this skit.it didn t take long for the sparrow to become the patron saint of the # feelthebern movement , who even honored it with a name .
they continued to praise it at the puntastic hashtag # birdiesanders.my cynicism for all things political dims in response to # birdiesanders j. wolff hughes ( @ jwolffh ) march 25 , 2016even birds love him make this man the president of the united states already .

amid all the hullaballoo sanders himself remained entertained and humble about the whole thing .
the candidate hinted at further partnership with birdie sanders , perhaps a potential running mate should he defeat hillary in the primaries ? # birdiesanders and i are on our way to our rally in seattle at safeco field .
meet us there : https : //t.co/ejgkfgsa5m pic.twitter.com/05lhbpmrne bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) march 25 , 2016and with that bernie sanders heads to seattle , home of the $ 15 minimum wage , to continue his battle to overcome hillary clinton for the democratic nomination.featured image via screengrab
