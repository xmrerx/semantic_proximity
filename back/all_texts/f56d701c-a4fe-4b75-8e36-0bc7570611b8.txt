Austria s President really said this!
During a talk with students, the president said if rampant Islamophobia continues, there will come a day when we must ask all women to wear a headscarf all of them!
out of solidarity towards those who do it for religious reasons .While the president in Austria has little influence over Austrian policy, this is a very symbolic move by the president.
It could be in response to the banning of the headscarf in Austria just last month.
Legislation was put in place to ban the burqa causing protests from Muslim women who called the government Islamophobic .Here s a take on what the president said from an Austrian Language alert!
