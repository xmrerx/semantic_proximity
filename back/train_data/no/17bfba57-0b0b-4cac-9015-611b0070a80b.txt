brasilia ( reuters ) - brazil s supreme court has suspended a decree issued by president michel temer s government changing the definition of slavery that was widely condemned as a reversal in the fight against forced labor .
in her decision taken on monday and made public on tuesday , justice rosa weber said the decree s reduction of the scope of what is considered slave labor violated the constitution .
weber also argued that the measure could hurt brazil s trade relations since other countries could complain that slave labor was a form of unfair competition .
faced with an outpouring of criticism , the government said on friday that it would pull the decree and issue a new one .
in brazil , forced labor has been defined as a form of modern-day slavery .
this includes debt bondage , degrading work conditions , and long work hours that pose a risk to a worker s health or life , and violate their dignity .
human rights campaigners said the decree issued by the labor ministry on monday changed the way slavery was defined , limiting it to a victim s freedom of movement but disregarding other abuses .
the decree , supported by brazil s powerful farm lobby , would derail enforcement efforts that have freed 50,000 workers from slavery-like conditions since 1995 , federal prosecutors and labor inspectors said .
temer opponents said he bowed to pressure from the farm lobby to modify the decree at a time when he is relying on the group s votes in congress on wednesday to block corruption charges against him .
in exchange for support to escape a criminal trial , temer promised the farm lobby goods he can not deliver , said lawmaker alessandro molon of the leftist sustainability network , the party that asked the court to stop the decree .
molon called the slave labor decree one the most abject bargains in the country s history .
