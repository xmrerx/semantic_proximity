sometimes , he s seen hundreds a day .
we re very vigilant and we realize that a lot of the people coming through are gang members , criminals , and with that we ve got dogs to alert us here on the ranch .
my wife in particular depends on the dogs , especially when i m not here , he said.vickers said he s seen a number of those who didn t make it all the way .
we ve had dead bodies show up from time to time , it s pretty disturbing .
but it s something we ve learned to live with , he said.vickers regularly patrols his own ranch for illegal activity .
when he sees it , he reports it to border patrol .
the thought of possibly not have to do that anymore makes him feel at ease.fox news one texas farmer , who asked not to be identified , said it s common for him to see undocumented immigrants walking through his property .
i see something , i just drive away , he said .
it is a problem , i ve learned to live with it and pretty much , i ve become numb to it .
another farmer , joe aguilar , said enough is enough .
after walking up on armed gunmen sneaking undocumented immigrants into the united states through his land , aguilar decided to sell his farm .
it s really sad to say , you either have to beat em or join em and i decided not to do either , aguilar said.aguilar s family farmed 6,000 acres of land along the texas-mexico border for nearly 100 years .
our farmers and ranchers can t afford their own security detail , staples said .
we re going to become more dependent on food from foreign sources .
