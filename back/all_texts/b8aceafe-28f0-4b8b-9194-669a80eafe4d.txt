WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The ongoing U.S.-Canadian trade “irritant” over softwood lumber is expected to be resolved soon, both countries leaders said on Thursday regarding the years-long fight over pine and other such soft wood.
U.S. President Barack Obama and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, speaking at a joint press conference, said the issue came up at their meeting at the White House but that negotiations were ongoing.
“I’m confident that we are on a track towards resolving this irritant in the coming weeks and month,” Trudeau said of the trade dispute, which stems from an expired 2006 softwood lumber export agreement.
Obama added: “This issue of softwood lumber will get resolved in some fashion ... It’s been a longstanding, bipartisan irritant,” although neither side is likely to get everything they are seeking in the final deal.
