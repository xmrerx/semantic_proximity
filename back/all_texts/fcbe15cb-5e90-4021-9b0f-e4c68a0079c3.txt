On Tuesday President Obama visited wounded and ill soldiers receiving treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.Obama spent about an hour making the rounds Tuesday at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.The White House says Obama met with eight Army members, two Marines and one member each from the Navy and Air Force.
He also met with veterans and family members.CBS reporter Mark Knoller pointed out the visit was President Obama s 27th to a military hospital since becoming commander-in-chief in 2009.There aren t any photos of the President inside the facility because he considers these trips private.
During the presidential campaign in 2008, Republicans tried to use the lack of photos as evidence then-Senator Obama had snubbed the troops.
It was a lie.Obama s reverence for the troops stands in strong contrast to the recent episode with presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.While feuding with Fox News during the Republican primaries, Trump threw a temper tantrum about debate moderator Megyn Kelly and skipped a debate on Fox News.
Instead, Trump threw what he claimed was a fundraiser for military charities and announced at the event that he had raised several million dollars for those groups.Trump proceeded to congratulate himself at several campaign events in the following days.But the Washington Post looked into it, and could find no evidence that Trump had made the donations, despite using them to promote himself.Trump was eventually pressured into donating to the groups, months after he claimed he had done so in the first place, and held a defensive, petty press conference claiming that nothing had gone wrong, despite the ample evidence to the contrary.While President Obama, who is tasked with the decision of whether to put the military in harm s way, quietly honors military service and sacrifice, Trump used them as human shields and as a cheap and tawdry campaign gimmick.Featured image via Flickr
