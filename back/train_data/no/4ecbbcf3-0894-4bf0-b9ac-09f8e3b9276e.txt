but clinton s lead press secretary , brian fallon , vowed that if elected , hillary clinton will hold press conferences .
but the frequency of them is something that would just play out as time went on , he added.on this week s powerhouse politics podcast , fallon promised greater interaction between clinton and the press on the campaign trail and said he expects the democratic nominee to hold a press conference soon .
the amount of interaction can only go up , he said , noting that the traveling press will soon be flying with clinton on her new campaign plane .
i m sure that will bring with it a lot of opportunities for additional access to the candidate and interactions between her and the traveling press corps that covers her every day , fallon told abc news chief white house correspondent jonathan karl , and political director rick klein on the podcast .
we are very respectful of the press and the job that they have to do , fallon continued .
we have done a lot of interviews , but i know that no matter how many questions we answer in a variety of formats , it is the press s job to always demand more access .
we respect that , and so we re going to seek further ways to accommodate that in the remaining months of the campaign .
