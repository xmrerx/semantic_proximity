In case you missed it Sen. Harry Reid (R-NV), who announced last week that he will retire after his current term expires in early 2017, said he does not regret taking to the Senate floor in 2012 to accuse then-GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney of not paying his taxes.
No, I don t regret that at all, he told CNN s Dana Bash.
The Koch brothers no one would help me.
They were afraid the Koch brothers would go after them, so I did it on my own.
Bash said some viewed the charge as McCarthy-ite, but Reid didn t buy that explanation.
He shrugged, saying, they can call it whatever they want.
Romney didn t win, did he?
Reid said somewhat amusingly.
