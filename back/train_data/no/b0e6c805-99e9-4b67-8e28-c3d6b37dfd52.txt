belfast ( reuters ) - talks between democratic unionist party and the british government to secure a deal on the post-brexit future of the region s border continued on thursday , a spokesman for the northern ireland party said .
the british government needs to agree a text with both the dup and irish government before the european union will agree to move onto the next phase of brexit talks .
we have been talking to the government over the last couple of days and that is continuing today , the dup spokesman said , saying deputy party leader nigel dodds and party chief whip jeffrey donaldson were involved but that party leader arlene foster remained in northern ireland .
ultimately if there is an agreement she will go over , he said .
flights can be booked reasonably quickly but there is not an expectation of her going today .
