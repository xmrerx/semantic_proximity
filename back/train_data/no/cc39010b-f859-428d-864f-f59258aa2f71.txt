donald trump has claimed since he launched his presidential campaign to be worth at least $ 10 billion .
he has not offered any proof of this , and has not given any evidence that the $ 10 billion figure is anything but a completely made up figment of his imagination.now , a smoking gun document has been found that shows trump to be far less wealthy than $ 10 billion , and it comes from trump himself.in the document , which concerned the securitization of commercial mortgages on properties including trump tower in new york city , trump was described as being worth more than $ 4.2bn , with liquid assets of more than $ 250m.a passage in the 132-page filing says : the sponsor is donald j trump .
mr trump has significant commercial real estate holdings worldwide including interests in office , retail , residential , golf-clubs and hospitality properties in markets including new york , san francisco , florida , washington dc , and scotland .
as of 30 june 2011 , mr trump reports a net worth in excess of $ 4.2bn and liquidity in excess of $ 250m .
the document was filed with the securities and exchange commission in 2012 by wells fargo securities on trump s behalf.the claim of $ 250 million in liquid assets is far less than the $ 400 million trump told sean hannity of fox news he had in a 2015 interview.the guardian newspaper points out that that is not enough to finance a modern presidential campaign , which runs into the hundreds of millions of dollars .
trump has already loaned his campaign between $ 43 to $ 50 million dollars , which means he may already be completely tapped out despite his extravagant claim that he can self-finance a battle against hillary clinton to win the presidency.trump has so far refused to disclose his tax returns to prove his net worth , the first candidate in nearly 40 years to hide his returns in this fashion .
clinton has exposed 10 years of her own returns , making her financial situation transparent.meanwhile , trump has been completely outgunned on fundraising .
his recent filing with the federal elections commission showed his campaign with less than $ 2 million on hand , while clinton had over $ 40 million.even worse , clinton recently revealed that in june she had raised an additional $ 40 million for a war chest of over $ 80 million , which does not include perhaps even $ 100 million or more that has been raised by super pacs supporting her campaign.trump has not revealed his june fundraising but an email appeal from his campaign to email addresses they appear to have purchased in bulk to send spam to ( several foreign government officials say they have been getting trump emails ) boasted a relatively puny $ 10 million figure raised in the last few weeks.the disparity is showing up in early advertising , as clinton is spending about $ 500,000 a day in critical swing states florida , pennsylvania , colorado , new mexico , and others while trump hasn t spent anything at all .
by comparison , mitt romney s 2012 campaign was spending about 80 % of what president obama s re-election campaign was , keeping that candidate viable.featured image via flickr
