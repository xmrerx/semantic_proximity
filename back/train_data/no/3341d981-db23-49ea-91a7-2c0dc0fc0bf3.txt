john lester : as a naval flight officer i held the top secret sensitive compartmentalized information clearance .
and that provided me access with materials and information highly sensitive to our war fighting capabilities .
had i communicated this information not following the prescribed protocols i would have been prosecuted and imprisoned .
secretary clinton , how can you expect those such as myself who are and were trusted with america s most sensitive information to have any confidence in your leadership as president when you clearly corrupted our national security .
