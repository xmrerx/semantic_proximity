Tonight the Boiler Gang brings the internet show with more more left hooks, right jabs and ear biting than a 90 s Tyson prize fight.
We ll be discussing the Panama Papers, the utter nonsense of Poverty Pimp Bob Geldof charging upwards of $100,000 to speak about ending poverty, Rand Paul introducing a bill that would limit the sale of arms to the Saudi Government in the wake of their atrocities in Yemen, destruction of culture by design, the potential rise of an European Union military force, Basil takes the Pope to task for his ridiculous publicity stunt in which he picked 12 migrants to come on the Pope-jet back to Vatican City and Branko Mali schools us on Orwellian terms and what they actually mean in using Pre-Dystopic English.
Listen in as we discuss a plethora of media and current events in a VERY un-PC fashion .
