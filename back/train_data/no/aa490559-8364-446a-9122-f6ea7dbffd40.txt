it s a ban on journalists who represent american media , all american media , visiting the state duma , ria quoted savastyanova as saying .
she represents the ruling united russia party , which holds a majority of the seats in the chamber .
u.s. authorities have designated kremlin-funded broadcaster rt as a foreign agent , after intelligence officials alleged it tried to meddle in the u.s. presidential election last year .
rt denies that .
the kremlin has pledged to retaliate in kind .
at the weekend , russian president vladimir putin signed a law allowing the russian authorities to designate some foreign media as foreign agents .
the move to deny u.s. journalists access to the state duma was a response to a similar move in washington , ria quoted savastyanova as saying .
rt on wednesday night published a letter from the executive committee of the congressional radio and television correspondents gallery saying the channel s congressional press credentials had been withdrawn due to its registration as a foreign agent in the united states .
that means rt s reporters will not be able to have as much access to congress as other foreign media .
