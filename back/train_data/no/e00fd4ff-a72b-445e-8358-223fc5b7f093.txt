baghdad ( reuters ) - iraq s prime minister insisted on thursday that the kurdish independence referendum be declared void , an apparent rejection of the kurdistan region s offer to freeze its independence push as part of efforts to resolve the crisis through talks .
we won t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution , haider al-abadi said in a statement .
the kurdistan regional government ( krg ) proposed on wednesday an immediate ceasefire , a suspension of the referendum result and starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the iraqi constitution .
baghdad has always considered the kurdish secession referendum illegal .
it responded last week by seizing back the city of kirkuk , the oil-producing areas around it and other territory that the kurds had captured from militant group islamic state .
abadi has ordered his army to recapture all disputed territory and has demanded central control of iraq s border crossings with turkey , at fish-khabur , located inside the kurdish autonomous region .
fish-khabur is strategically vital because oil from both kurdish and government-held parts of northern iraq crosses via a pipeline there into turkey , the main route out of the area for the exports that are crucial to any kurdish independence bid .
the fighting between the central government and the kurds is particularly tricky for the united states which is a close ally of both sides , arming and training both the kurds and the central government s army to fight islamic state .
