Hillary Clinton just made the claim that she beat President Trump in the 2016 election.
The bitter and delusional Clinton is a woman who can t let the loss go In a lengthy interview in New York Magazine, Clinton made the claim that she beat both Sanders and Trump in the 2016 election: I beat both of them, she said, evidently referencing her popular vote win over Trump.British politician Nigel Evans has message for anyone, including Hillary, who is in denial.
He defends Donald Trump and his supporters in this must-watch video!
The fact is, there were 61 million people who voted for Donald Trump, and when we stand up in this country and attack him, we are actually attacking the American people.
Bravo!
Thank you Mr. Evans!
