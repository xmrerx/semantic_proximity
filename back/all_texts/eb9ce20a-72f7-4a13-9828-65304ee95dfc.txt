WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House spokesman said on Thursday it was “appropriate” for a Pentagon agency to investigate former national security adviser Michael Flynn for possible wrongdoing in connection with a trip he took to Russia in 2016.
Spokesman Sean Spicer, asked what he thought of the news that the Defense Department’s Inspector General was conducting an investigation into the actions of Flynn, a retired Lieutenant General, said: “That’s appropriate.
If they think that there’s wrongdoing, the department’s inspector general should look into it.
We welcome that.”
