last year , we reported about women who attended an anti-racism music festival in sweden that were raped and molested by migrant men .
this report is yet another shocking example of how the west is actually importing a real rape culture.according to police spokesman stefan dangardt , numerous foreign men sexually assaulted the women during borl nge s peace and love festival , although three suspects who were arrested were later released because they claimed they were minors.it appears that nothing has changed since last year .
yesterday , swedish police received several reports of rape after music festivals at various locations on friday evening.a 15-year-old girl was raped during a concert at the br valla festival in norrk ping on friday night.according to the police , the girl was held and raped by a man in the midst of the crowd in front of the concert goers , without anyone intervening .
it s terrible that one has to experience such a thing with a lot of people around , says police spokesman , thomas agnevik , to aftonbladet.we have little information about the perpetrator and about what has happened , he said , while encouraging those present during the concert to contact the police if they saw anything suspicious.the girl was taken care of and underwent a medical examination.during the city festival in v ster s , two rapes were reported , one of a 16 year old girl .
we have talked to her and obtained information , but we currently have no suspects , said spokesperson for the police in v stmanland , thomas gustafsson.a 26-year-old woman has also reported rape after the festival .
she has been sent to hospital and we have been unable to talk to her .
therefore , i do not have any more details , says gustafsson.rapes at swedish festivals are not really news anymore .
it is merely about announcements .
we are actually there now .
