Anyone with a brain knows that Donald Trump is an embarrassment to the United States on the world stage at best, and dangerously unqualified to hold the office of the presidency at worst.
Despite these facts, many in the GOP establishment have lined up behind the billionaire who unexpectedly became their presumptive nominee.
However, there is a problem.
There are GOP delegates who are doing all they can to deny Trump the nomination at the GOP convention in Cleveland, which is just days away.Because of the apparently inevitable convention floor fight, the Rules Committee meeting that began at 8:00 AM as scheduled was suddenly halted once a delegate put forth the idea of a rule that would disallow lobbyists from joining the Republican National Committee (RNC).
After that, RNC Chairman Reince Priebus scuttled away into a private meeting with Senator Mike Lee (R-Utah) and some of the #NeverTrump delegates.
Also present was Colorado delegate and Free the Delegates leader Kendal Unruh, who wants the RNC Rules Committee to unbind the delegates and allow them to vote against Trump, no matter what the voters in their state decided.There were surely clashes in this meeting, as fierce #NeverTrump types like Unruh were in that impromptu secret meeting with people such as Platform Committee member Jim Bopp, who vehemently opposes any and all efforts to stop Trump.
There was also former Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, who seems to wish to dismantle the amount of power the RNC has altogether.In other words, just days before the GOP Convention, the event that is supposed to be the party s big coming out, there is utter chaos, and it is all because of Donald Trump.
The illustration of just how chaotic it all has become is all in the excuse that was given to the press for the abrupt disruption of the Rules Committee session: a printer had jammed and they were making sure that got fixed first.
Absolutely hilarious, to Democrats, at least.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images
