moscow ( reuters ) - a proposal to convene a congress of all syria s ethnic groups is a joint initiative which is being promoted by russia and others and is now being actively discussed , the kremlin said on friday .
it is premature , however , to discuss the time and venue for the congress , which is seen as a mechanism to assist syria s post-war development , putin s spokesman dmitry peskov told a conference call with reporters .
putin mentioned the idea of holding such a congress at a forum with foreign scholars on thursday .
