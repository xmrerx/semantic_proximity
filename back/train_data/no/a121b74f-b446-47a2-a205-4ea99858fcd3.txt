dublin ( reuters ) - ireland plans to hold a referendum next may or june on whether it should loosen some of the strictest abortion laws in the world , prime minister leo varadkar said on tuesday .
abortion has long been a divisive issue in once stridently catholic ireland where , after a debate elicited large street protests from both sides , a complete ban was lifted in 2013 .
terminations were allowed if a mother s life was in danger .
the ... proposal is to have a standalone referendum in may or june next year and will very much follow on from the recommendations of the all-party committee which is considering the matter , varadkar told parliament .
a panel of citizens called together to advise government on the issue voted overwhelmingly that the eighth amendment of the constitution , which enshrines an equal right to life of the mother and her unborn child , should be changed .
the all-party committee is considering those recommendations and is due to report to parliament by the end of the year on the referendum and potential shape of future legislation .
opinion polls show a large majority of voters want some change .
ireland became the first country to adopt gay marriage by popular vote in 2015 and campaigners seeking a repeal of the eighth amendment want that social change extended to abortion , citing the thousands of irish women who travel abroad , mostly to england , for terminations each year .
anti-abortion supporters demand no further changes to the law .
the human rights arms of the united nations and council of europe have pressed the government to , at a very minimum , decriminalize abortion and widen the law to allow for abortion in cases of fatal foetal abnormality , rape or incest .
the referendum on abortion will be among seven the government plans to call within the next two years , it said on tuesday , including a vote to remove the crime of blasphemy from the constitution .
