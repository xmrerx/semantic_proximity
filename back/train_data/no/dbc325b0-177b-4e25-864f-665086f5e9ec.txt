berlin ( reuters ) - former german finance minister wolfgang schaeuble was elected president of germany s bundestag or lower house of parliament , on tuesday at its first session after sept. 24 elections .
schaeuble , a member of chancellor angela merkel s conservatives , agreed last month to step aside as finance minister , clearing the way for another party to take the job as part of tricky negotiations to forge a new coalition government .
schaeuble , 75 , is known for his hardline insistence on a balanced budget and his leadership during the euro zone crisis , but he faces new challenges in leading the bundestag , which will include a far-right party - the alternative for germany ( afd ) - for the first time in decades .
