George W. Bush was famously attacked with flying shoes.
So was Hillary Clinton.
William Kristol was hit in the face with a cream pie.
Last month, Donald Trump barely escaped being hit with tomatoes.The takeaway?
American projectiles are lame.In order to see how it s really done, we have to travel by video to New Zealand where Minister Steven Joyce was hit in the face this week with a flying rubber dildo hurled by a protester.
Joyce is a conservative member of the island nation s House of Representatives who supports the infamous trade agreement known as TPP the Trans-Pacific Partnership.The unknown dildo-tossing protester was arrested by law enforcement.Joyce was holding a press conference in Waitingi on the North Island during which he was discussing the benefits of the TPP.
That s when the dildo smacked point-blank in Joyce s face.After being hit, Joyce said astutely, It would be unfortunate for being known for this incident.
As the New York Post quipped: too late.Of course, I stand by my position that assaulting public officials with projectiles or blood-red paint or, for that matter, sex toys is bad form and only serves to underscore how the respective protesters are clearly incapable of verbally expressing their dissatisfaction.
Which case, they probably should seek out other hobbies because activism isn t their bag.
But, I will admit, seeing a stuffy conservative politician get hit in the face with a flying penis is never not funny.Now that I m really thinking about it, part of me wishes this had been Ted Cruz?
If there s one man in the United States who s in desperate need of being hit in the face with a giant rubber dick, it s Ted Cruz.
Best case: Cruz getting hit in the face with a penis while he s doing his awful misquoted JFK impression.
(I m joking of course.
Hitting Ted Cruz in the face with a penis is wrong and illegal.
