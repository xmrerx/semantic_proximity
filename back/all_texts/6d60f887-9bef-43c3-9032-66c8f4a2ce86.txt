Voting rights expert, Ari Berman, sat down with Joy Reid during Saturday s broadcast of The Reid Report where he and Reid discussed a court ruling that found that the GOP worked to prevent black voters from voting in North Carolina.The segment begins with a reading of part of the Fourth Circuit Court s decision, which reads: The only clear factor linking these various reforms is their impact on African American voters.
The record thus makes obvious that the problem the majority in the general assembly sought to remedy was emerging support for the minority party.
This decision in North Carolina was the biggest victory for voting rights since the Supreme Court gutted the Voting Rights Act because the fourth circuit court was so clear about what happened.
North Carolina, as you mentioned, passed the country s strongest and most sweeping voting restrictions, Berman assesses.
They did so just a month after the Supreme Court gutting the Voting Rights Act, Berman continued.
John Roberts said it was a thing of the past.
What the Fourth Circuit said all of these things they did were meant to target black voters, with almost surgical precision.
The Republican Party have tried to position themselves as the champions of free and fair elections since the Voting Rights Act was struck down.
In reality, the reforms that they have put in place have been nothing except an attempt to disenfranchise minority voters.The left has fought against these reforms since they began cropping up.
Now, with this landmark decision, the left has much more more legislative muscle to fight back against these racist laws.You can watch the segment below, in full.Featured image from video screenshot
