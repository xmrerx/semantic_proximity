liberal hack mika brzezinski made a ridiculous claim today that there are no real men in the white house who can stand up to president donald trump .
yes , this is the same woman who said it s the media s job to tell people what to think.scarborough began by playing a clip from fox news sunday in which one of president donald trump s new lawyers , jay sekulow , said that trump is not under investigation by special counsel robert mueller.scarborough had the nerve to mock trump lawyer jay sekulow s by waving a stack of papers and shouting loudly.joe scarborough started it off by saying , i have all of this evidence right here , and it is right here that i ve got all of this evidence .
i m holding this paper .
that means what i am saying is official and i got it from a certified letter .
brzezinski then emasculated men in the white house : think about it .
there are no men in the white house .
literally , no real men .
i ve said it before .
nobody can get him to stop tweeting .
maybe bring in a woman .
maybe just one who can get this guy to stop tweeting and shooting himself in the foot .
