Trump s acceptance of a Purple Heart, and his saying that he d always wanted one of those, really pissed off a lot of people considering that the way one actually earns a Purple Heart is to be wounded in action.
Cameron Kerr, a (true) Purple Heart recipient, decided to start a satirical GoFundMe page in response to Trump s sheer gall.The page, called Help Trump Get a Purple Heart, explains that the money raised doesn t actually help Trump do anything.
Instead, Kerr has every penny going to help Syrian refugees a group of people that Trump says we can t vet and is a huge Trojan Horse of terrorists.Kerr said: As with seemingly everything else in his life, Mr. Trump got one handed to him instead of earning it.
That being said, as a Purple Heart recipient [proof ] who earned one the old-fashioned way by returning from Afghanistan one leg lighter, I fully endorse his desire to earn one and would happily oblige his interest in doing so, by being one of the first to chip in to fly him to the conflict zone of his choosing.
After all, you re never too old to follow your dreams.
[emphasis in source]Since Kerr can t actually accomplish that, he is, instead, turning one of Trump s biggest insults to those who serve and sacrifice into something positive.
Let s face it, if Trump hates it, helping it is probably positive.
The groups to which the money goes are all vetted, so donors know that their money actually is going towards its intended cause.
If Trump knew, he d probably have a conniption because his name is tied to this.The money is going to three different groups:In short, Kerr found a way to turn Trump s insults, dullness and hatred into something good.
It s such a crying shame Trump won t be able to earn a Purple Heart the right way, is it not?
However, he can help Syrians escape their war-torn land, even if he doesn t realize he s doing it.
