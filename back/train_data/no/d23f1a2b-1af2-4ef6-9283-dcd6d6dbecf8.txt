tokyo ( reuters ) - diplomacy backed by military power is needed to deal with north korea s missile and nuclear development , the head of the u.s. military s pacific command said on thursday .
north korea has launched dozens of missile tests under the leadership of kim jong un as it accelerates a weapons program designed to give it the ability to target the united states with a nuclear-tipped missile .
in recent months , it has fired two missiles over japan and conducted its sixth and largest nuclear bomb test , stoking regional tension .
clearly , while diplomacy must be the main effort with north korea , it has to be diplomacy backed by credible military power , admiral harry harris said in japan at the beginning of a meeting with defence minister itsunori onodera .
u.s. president donald trump visited china this month seeking its help to rein in north korea and a senior chinese diplomat will visit the north from friday .
china is sending an envoy and delegation to north korea - a big move , we ll see what happens !
trump wrote on twitter on thursday .
china has repeatedly pushed for a diplomatic solution to the crisis , but in recent months it has had only limited high-level exchanges with north korea .
the last time china s special envoy for north korea visited the country was in february last year .
on thursday , china said a dual suspension proposal under which the united states and south korea would stop major military exercises in exchange for north korea halting its weapons programs was the best way forward .
japan s onodera told harris that he believed a recent joint military exercise involving japanese forces and three u.s. aircraft carriers had sent a very strong message to north korea .
harris separately told prime minister shinzo abe that the joint exercise in the sea of japan during trump s visit to the region was an example of how our militaries work together .
two indian warships also took part .
