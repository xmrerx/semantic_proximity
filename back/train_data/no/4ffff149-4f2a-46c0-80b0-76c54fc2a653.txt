while immature , snowflake college students freak out over the pronouns their fellow students and teachers use to address them , people in so many countries around the world are facing real human rights violations that most of us can t even imagine.the floor looks clean in this high-rise apartment , seven stories above kuwait city traffic .
not a smudge in sight on the picture window .
on the other side of the glass , the maid is hanging on by one knuckle , screaming .
oh crazy , come here , a woman says casually in arabic , holding a camera up to the maid .
hold on to me !
hold on to me !
the maid yells.instead , the woman steps back .
the maid s grip finally slips , and she lands in a cloud of dust , many stories below.the maid an ethiopian who had been working in the country for several years , according to the kuwait times survived the fall .
the videographer , her employer , was arrested last week on a charge of failing to help the worker.it s still unclear what led to the fall .
but it was not the first time a domestic servant had fallen off of a building in kuwait , an oil-rich country where foreign workers are cheap , plentiful and live largely at the mercy of their employers .
