paris ( reuters ) - president emmanuel macron invited cameras into his elysee palace office on friday as he signed into law new legislation , making him the first french president to wield his constitutional power in public view .
social media users were quick to draw parallels between the images on friday of macron sat at his ornate desk to sign the documents and u.s. president donald trump s love for the media spotlight .
our pdt macron in a very trumpian mood , wrote one twitter user .
another said : macron pretending to be donald trump .
who is that bad news for ?
him or us ?
said a second user mocking macron s image-conscious style .
the president , who defeated the established parties to enter the elysee , has already challenged french political conventions , donning a fighter pilot s suit at an air base and seeking a formal role for his wife as first lady .
on friday he was enacting legislation to tighten up ethical standards in french politics - one of his main election promises after a campaign race marred by financial scandal .
the law prohibits ministers , national lawmakers and locally elected officials from employing family members , prevents individuals with criminal records from seeking elected office , and refuses parliamentarians the right to hold advisory roles during their mandates .
government spokesman christophe castaner said macron wanted a ceremony befitting of a historic moment in the relationship between the french and their political class .
