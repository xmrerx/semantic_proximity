It s a new year.
For many of us, that means that we probably made a few resolutions.
You know quit smoking, eat better, drink less, get more sleep all good things that could improve life.
There s just one problem, though: most people don t keep those resolutions.
They go right out the window before the first month of the new year is even over for most people.
Well, John Oliver, host of HBO s Last Week Tonight has some advice in that arena: You re going to break these resolutions anyway, so quit being so hard on yourself.Oliver said: Every December, for some reason, we decide that next year will be the one that everything turns around and we ll finally quit drinking, or learn how to pronounce the name of these berries.
He then continued: But let s be honest, we re a few days into the new year now, and if you haven t broken your New Year s resolutions yet, statistically you are about to.
That can be depressing.
But don t panic, all hope is not lost.
Because the key thing with resolutions is not how to keep them it s how to revise them once you ve failed.
The main problem with New Year s resolutions is that we set our expectations way too high.
For instance, lots of people say they want to exercise more but that s hard.
Exercise is like reading for your muscles.
Except you can t watch a movie of someone else exercising and basically get the gist of it.
He s right.
Humans are set in our ways.
Small changes are better than big ones, because they are easier to stick to.
You re not going to change your whole life just because a new year rolls in, and that really is okay.Watch Oliver s hilarious yet completely accurate thoughts on New Year s resolutions below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story
