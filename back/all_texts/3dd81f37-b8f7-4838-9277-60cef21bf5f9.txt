21st Century WireYesterday, violence broke out in Charlottesville, Virginia, when far-left direct action group Antifa organized a flash mob to disrupt another demonstration organized by Unite the Right.
At least one person was killed and many others injured after a car hit a crowd of anti-fascist protesters in an alley way off a the high street.Controversial right-wing coalition Unite the Right gathered on Saturday to protest to the planned removal of a statue of the Civil War Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a local park.
They were met by hundreds of counter-protesters from extremist left-wing Antifa antifascist group who descended on the event.
State riot police reinforcements and the Virginia National Guard were called into to quell any unrest, although it s clear they had no control over crowds and numerous reports indicate that police actually stood down and allowed violence to take place.
As police began to disperse protesters, hundreds of Antifa agitators were then funneled into the surrounding streets.
This led to a three car, rear end pile-up in which the third and last car apparently struck a number of pedestrians, said to be Antifa protesters, leaving at least 1 dead and many more injured.Police have arrested the alleged driver of the third vehicle, 20 yr-old James Alex Fields Jr. of Maumee, Ohio.
He is charged with second-degree murder for the alleged intentional running-over of street demonstrators and also failure to stop after being involved in a collision.
It is not yet exactly clear whether or not the driver s actions were politically motivated.21WIRE editor Patrick Henningsen spoke with RT International giving live commentary as the story broke SUPPORT 21WIRE SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @ 21WIRE.TV
