Former Attorney General Eric Holder, who served under former President Barack Obama, unleashed a tweet at 3:00 a.m. to the Department of Justice and the FBI in which he warned officials to be prepared.
To the career men & women at DOJ/FBI: your actions and integrity will be unfairly questioned.
Be prepared, be strong.
Duty.
Honor.
Country, he wrote.To the career men & women at DOJ/FBI: your actions and integrity will be unfairly questioned.

Be strong and unafraid.

A 3am tweet from Eric Holder?
Yeah, something's coming.
Jack A Roe (@JackARoe12) June 30, 2017I don't think that's it.
A storm is a brewin', treason is in the air, and it's gonna dump a holy incriminating load on Team Trump very soon U.S.O.U.S.

pic.twitter.com/bt13IshQqp heidi siegmund cuda (@foxycuda) June 30, 2017Holder isn t a frequent Twitter user so that makes his tweet seem peculiar.
The Trump administration is plagued with scandals and alleged president Donald Trump seems to incriminate himself with his own tweets.
The former reality show star s Twitter timeline is a goldmine for prosecutors and investigators.
The amateur president launched a war on every U.S. Intelligence agency and that won t fare well for him.
Trump s war against the free press is backfiring big time, too.
Perhaps Trump should stop tweeting for a moment and read Holder s warning.
Nah, Trump would just tweet about Holder s wife, saying she once had blood coming out of her whatever.We re not trying to go all Alex Jones on you but for a man who typically tweets about his objections to repealing Obamacare, this does seem a bit odd.
Look out, Trump.
You re about to lose this war.
A former Attorney General doesn t just tweet out a be prepared message all willy nilly unless something is coming.
The Trump administration fired Preet Bharara, Sally Yates and James Comey and all three were investigating Donald Trump.
That s rather suspicious, don t you think?As of now, Holder s tweet has been liked over 30,000 times and it s garnered 13,00o retweets.
I suspect the Twitter-addicted alleged president has already taken notice.Featured image via Chris Graythen/Getty Images
