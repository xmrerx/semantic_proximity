Stephen Sondheim s Send in the Clowns just became all about Donald Trump thanks to legendary singer-songwriter Barbra Streisand.During a fundraiser in New York on Friday night for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Streisand unveiled a new parody version of the classic, which was originally written for the 1973 musical A Little Night Music.Here s the original version as performed by Streisand via YouTube:The new version, however, is a complete mockery of the Republican nominee and was very appreciated by the audience in attendance as Babs sang the entire version so that Trump will never forget it.Here s the lyrics via Raw Story:VERSE 1 IS HE THAT RICH?

During a concert in Los Angeles last month she burned him hard on stage by claiming that a famous mentalist couldn t read Trump s mind because he doesn t have one.
And then she said this: No matter what the color of your skin or where you were born Cuba, China, Malaysia, Madagascar our genetic make up is 99.9% identical to every person on the face of the earth.
The other 0.1% is Donald Trump.
This song, however, is so perfect it should be Hillary Clinton s campaign theme song at every rally she attends until Election Day.
