A strange answer offered by Governor Chris Christie during the Republican presidential debate showed how deeply hostile the conservative base is towards women.Asked to name one thing that the federal government does now that it should not do at all in order to cut spending so that the budget can be balanced, Christie made a strange reach and called for cutting off funding to Planned Parenthood.Christie was then pressed on whether he d cut anything bigger than that, since Planned Parenthood receives just $528 million annually; a miniscule sum compared with the kind of cuts needed to balance the budget.
When you see thousands upon thousands upon thousands of children being murdered in the womb, I can t think of anything bigger than that, he said in response.The current budget deficit is a projected $474 billion.
The funding for Planned Parenthood accounts for 0.11% of the deficit and an even smaller 0.01% of the $3.9 trillion budget for the country.
Considering the women the organization helps, and their families, Christie should be praising the value taxpayers get for their spending on the organization.His follow-up response, designed to elicit sympathy from conservative Christian voters in Iowa, is even more ridiculous when you realize that Planned Parenthood is banned from spending any of its federal money on abortion services in the first place.Thanks to rules put in place by the right and kept there by Democrats, none of the abortion services can be funded with federal money, and Christie definitely knows this, he was just too busy pandering.But the answer and the positive reaction to it by voters at the debate, shows how deep-seated GOP animosity towards women s reproductive health is.
They would cheer for a candidate vowing to eliminate a group supporting women s health, whose federal receipts are less than a rounding error on the balance sheet, all to satisfy their ongoing desire to control a woman s body.Featured image via YouTube
