SALON WENT NUTS:Half Windsor, all fiasco: Trump s necktie-gate may undermine his statesmanlike gravitasAs you might have already seen, Donald Trump was recently photographed emerging from his airplane as a gust of wind caught his necktie and revealed a dirty secret.
The president-elect, who is a man of substantial means, holds his necktie together with Scotch tape a discombobulating mishmash of Armani aesthetics and hobo fashion sense.As upsetting as this is, I really can t make head or tail of it.
Clearly Trump is concerned about how terribly embarrassing it would be to have the two ends of his tie flopping about willy-nilly.
And yet the solution he has landed upon or someone else in his inner circle has is to make a third-grade arts-and-crafts project out of his wardrobe.What the hell is going on here?
