geneva ( reuters ) - north korea on tuesday rejected a u.n. security council resolution imposing tougher sanctions and said the united states would soon face the greatest pain it had ever experienced .
the security council unanimously stepped up sanctions against north korea on monday over the country s sixth and most powerful nuclear test , imposing a ban on its textile exports and capping imports of crude oil .
my delegation condemns in the strongest terms and categorically rejects the latest illegal and unlawful u.n. security council resolution , pyongyang s ambassador , han tae song , told the u.n.-sponsored conference on disarmament in geneva .
han accused the u.s. administration of being fired up for political , economic , and military confrontation , and of being obsessed with the wild game of reversing the dprk s development of nuclear force which has already reached the completion phase .
north korea was condemned globally for its latest nuclear test on sept. 3 , which it said was of an advanced hydrogen bomb .
the democratic people s republic of korea ( dprk ) is ready to use a form of ultimate means , han said without elaborating .
the forthcoming measures by dprk will make the u.s. suffer the greatest pain it ever experienced in its history , he said .
u.s. disarmament ambassador robert wood took the floor to say that the security council resolution frankly sent a very clear and unambiguous message to the regime that the international community is tired , is no longer willing to put up provocative behavior from this regime .
my hope is the regime will hear the message loud and clear and it will choose a different path , wood said .
we call on all countries to vigorously implement these new sanctions and all other existing sanctions , he added .
