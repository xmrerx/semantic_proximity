addis ababa ( reuters ) - somali authorities have handed over to ethiopia a senior official of the onlf rebel group , which is fighting for the secession of ogaden from ethiopia , the group said .
abdikarin sheikh muse , an executive committee member who lived in the somali capital mogadishu , was detained by security in galkayo in somalia s semi-autonomous galmudug state on august 23 , the onlf said in a statement .
quoting sources close to the somali cabinet , it said the somali government had forcefully handed over abdikarin sheikh muse to ethiopia without his consent in violation of u.n. convention relating to the status of refugees .
ethiopian officials were not available for comment .
the ogaden national liberation front ( onlf ) launched its bid for secession of the somali region , also known as ogaden , in eastern ethiopia in 1984 .
in 2007 , ethiopian forces waged a large-scale offensive against them after the group attacked a chinese-run oil facility , killing 74 people .
analysts say the rebels have since been severely weakened but are still able to launch hit-and-run attacks .
the region they operate may contain 4 trillion cubic feet of gas and major oil deposits , mining experts say .
china s gcl-poly petroleum investments signed a production sharing deal with the government in late 2013 to develop two gas fields .
