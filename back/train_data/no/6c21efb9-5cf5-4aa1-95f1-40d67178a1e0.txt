berlin ( reuters ) - a top member of chancellor angela merkel s conservatives on thursday dismissed russian president vladimir putin s push to host a new syrian peace process with the backing of iran and turkey , calling it the height of cynicism .
the leaders of russia , iran and turkey on wednesday called on the syrian government and moderate opposition to participate constructively in the planned congress , to be held in the black sea resort of sochi .
juergen hardt , foreign policy speaker for merkel s conservatives in parliament , said russia had repeatedly blocked efforts by the u.n. security council to find a constructive solution to end the syrian civil war , now in its seventh year .
it is the height of cynicism that , of all countries , russia and iran , which fuelled the civil war in syria in their own interests , causing the deaths of thousands of people , now want to develop a political vision for syria s future , hardt said .
hardt said germany s conservatives hoped that the announcement of a ceasefire was serious , and would lead to a permanent halt in fighting in syria and an end to mass death , flight and expulsion .
russia , iran and the dictatorial regime in syria could have achieved this long ago if they had wanted to , hardt said , noting that a solution could not be achieved under conditions set by syrian president bashar al-assad .
hardt said a lasting peace could only be achieved if all parties were involved , and that , in turn , was only possible under a peace process led by the united nations .
the german foreign ministry had no immediate comment on putin s new initiative .
