paris ( reuters ) - the head of france s parliament on tuesday admonished newcomers from president emmanuel macron s party for noisy partying in the assembly s bar after late-night sessions .
in one such case , lawmakers from the centrist president s republic on the move ( lrem ) party improvised a party with music at the national assembly s bar after a debate on the social security budget .
the bar staff were obliged to work late until the lawmakers had left , parliamentary sources said .
macron s 313 lawmakers , many of whom are new to politics , were initially criticized after the june election for their inexperience , though this has not stopped the swift adoption of wide-ranging reforms , including security and labor laws .
but the partying after late-night votes has to stop , the assembly s president francois de rugy told them on tuesday , saying it was not fair on the staff who work there .
de rugy also said lawmakers must stop brandishing objects in parliament , something its rules and regulations forbid .
that remark appeared aimed at lawmakers from the far-left france insoumise ( france unbowed ) , who in july piled up pasta and a pot of tomato sauce on their bench in parliament to show how much students would lose out on with a 5 euro cut in housing subsidies .
it is crucial that the presidents of ( parliamentary ) groups remind each and every member about the proper conduct of parliamentary proceedings and the necessary dignity of lawmakers , de rugy said in a statement .
