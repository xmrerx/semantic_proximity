baghdad ( reuters ) - the iraqi parliament on wednesday asked prime minister haider al-abadi to send troops to the kurdish-held region of kirkuk and take control of its oilfields .
kurdish pehsmerga fighters took control of kirkuk , a multi-ethnic region , in 2014 when the iraqi army fled in the face of islamic state militants who overran about a third of iraq .
the kurdish move prevented the oilfields from falling into the militants hands .
the area , historically claimed by the kurds , is also home to turkmen and arab communities .
the kurdistan regional government included it in the independence referendum held on monday .
the government has to bring back the oilfields of kirkuk under the control of the oil ministry , said the resolution voted by parliament in baghdad , seen by reuters .
it called on abadi to issue orders for the security forces to deploy in the disputed areas , including kirkuk .
