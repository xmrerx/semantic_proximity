britain s national cyber security centre had assessed it was highly likely that north korea s lazarus hacking group was behind the one of the most significant cyber attacks to hit the uk in terms of scale of disruption , the foreign office said .
we condemn these actions and commit ourselves to working with all responsible states to combat destructive criminal use of cyber space , foreign office minister tariq ahmad said .
the indiscriminate use of the wannacry ransomware demonstrates north korean actors using their cyber program to circumvent sanctions , ahmad said .
