Donald Trump is a complete hypocrite.Just a day after curtsying to the Saudi Arabian king after repeatedly whining about President Obama bowing, Trump delivered a speech about terrorism in which he failed to say the words radical Islamic terrorism, something else he bitched about every time President Obama talked about terrorism.As you ll recall, Trump even went so far as to claim that President Obama was in league with ISIS just because he refused to say those three words.
And he also said Obama should resign from office if he can t say it.
For that reason alone, he should step down.
If Hillary Clinton, after this attack, still cannot say the two words Radical Islam she should get out of this race for the Presidency.
Well, Trump should take his own criticism seriously and resign from office.During his speech on Sunday, Trump omitted the words entirely and used President Obama s careful approach as his own.After Trump s criticism, Obama made it clear why he won t use those words.
We are not at war with Islam, Obama said.
We are at war with people who have perverted Islam.
And that s basically what Trump said after months of accusing President Obama of being weak.Now Trump gets to experience how he treated Obama, but it s even worse because Trump is being blasted for being a coward and a hypocrite.
@realDonaldTrump I read and heard it where did you say Radical Islamic Terrorists ?
I was sure you would since you said Obama is weak for not saying it.

Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) May 21, 2017@realDonaldTrump You didn t write it.
Tell us why you didn t include your words Radical Islam.
You confuse your low level followers.
Nice curtsey BTW#resist ArmchairWarrior (@CrumbyVh) May 21, 2017Trump is not only not saying radical Islamic terrorism, he s rejecting the *premise* of the phrase he mocked Obama/Clinton for not using.
Daniel Dale (@ddale8) May 21, 2017To recap, Trump went to Saudi Arabia and curtsied to the king, gave them the weapons deal they wanted, and then proceeded to cowardly refuse to say the words he criticized President Obama for not saying.
Donald Trump s supporters should all be pissed off, but they re too busy kissing his ass to notice they got played for suckers.Featured Image: Olivier Douliery Pool/Getty Images
