If you haven t yet heard that Fox News came out on top in ratings during Donald Trump s inauguration, all you need to do is check President Asterisk s Twitter timeline.
After a rousing first few days of working toward dismantling Obamacare, endangering the health of women and girls worldwide, and signing our environment away for a few short-term construction jobs, The Donald hopped on Twitter to get right back to what appears to be his real job: attacking news agencies that report unflattering details about him.
Congratulations to @FoxNews for being number one in inauguration ratings, Trump tweeted.
They were many times higher than FAKE NEWS @CNN public is smart!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017Neilson estimates that 30.6 million people tuned in to watch the trainwreck that was Trump s sparsely-attended inauguration millions fewer than Barack Obama s first swearing-in (maybe that s why he just threatened to send the feds to march on Chicago).
Trump is correct that more people watched Fox News than any other individual news station, but he is also correct that the public is smart.
What he fails to realize is that the majority of the smart public didn t watch Fox.Mediaite reported Monday that during the peak coverage block of 11 a.m. to 4 p.m. EST, Fox News drew 8.77 million viewers.
This may seem like a lot, but NBC brought in 5.90 million people, ABC attracted 4.90 million, CBS had about 4.65 million viewers, 2.61 million watched CNN, and 1.38 million tuned in to MSNBC.
In other words, the smart people watched different networks than the vapid, meth-addled freaks who enjoyed Trump s victory with the whitest news team on television.Naturally, the Internet wasn t about to tolerate the President* attacking legitimate news agencies:@realDonaldTrump This is beyond sad.
Turn off the TV and start running the country.

Back to insulting people again.

Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) January 25, 2017@pourmecoffee a very reliable source tells me Fox News' US ratings are fake and they're actually Kenyan ratings.
Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) January 25, 2017Just a reminder of something he wants to forget: the Women s March in D.C. alone drew 750,000 (three million nationwide), many times The Donald s sh*tty inauguration numbers.
