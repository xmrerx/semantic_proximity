Khizr Khan, the father of a slain purple-heart winning Muslim soldier absolutely laid into Donald Trump in his speech on the final night of the 2016 Democratic Convention in Philadelphia.Khan s son, Captain Humayun S. M. Khan, was one of 14 American Muslims who have died while serving the United States military since 9/11.Standing next to his wife, Mr. Khan laid into Trump for arguing for a wall between America and Mexico, pointing out, We cannot solve our problems by building walls We are stronger together.
Pointing out Trump s incendiary anti-Muslim rhetoric, the father asked, Let me ask [Trump], have you even read the United States Constitution?
I will gladly lend you my copy!
He then dramatically reached into his jacket and pulled out his Constitution.Concluding his speech, Khan gave a full-throated endorsement of Hillary Clinton: Vote for the healer not the divider.
Their son was killed when a suicide bomber attacked his unit, serving in Iraq in 2004.Captain Khan was killed just north of Baghdad on June 8, 2004.
A car approached the gates of the base he was tasked with protecting.
As soldiers under Khan s command prepared to inspect the vehicle, his father told us, Captain Khan screamed for his men to hit the dirt and walked towards it himself and demanded the driver stop.
Inside the car were two suicide bombers and a large amount of explosives.
As the car reached the gate, the bomb was detonated, killing Khan and wounding 10 U.S. soldiers.
His father believes many more men might have died without Khan s warning.
Khan was posthumously awarded the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, two of the military s highest honors.The divisive nature of Trump s repeated attacks on Muslims has prompted the Khans to speak out against his candidacy for the presidency, and it resulted in an epic moment at the convention.Featured image via YouTube
