Yesterday, Fox News announced that they were suspending Eric Bolling after accusations that the popular host sent lewd photos to at least three female coworkers two at Fox Business and one at Fox News.Many believe the accusations against Eric Bolling are just more lies in a series of false sexual misconduct allegations levied against Fox News top personalities, like Bill O Reilly and the now deceased Roger Ailes.
The woman who attempted to smear Fox News host Sean Hannity quickly dropped her accusations when Hannity took off the gloves announced he would fight accuser Debbie Schulssel with some of the finest and toughest lawyers in the country after she accused the Fox News host of sexually propositioning her as allegations of sexual harassment continue to roil the network.Philly.com Suspended Fox News host Eric Bolling s first public accuser is a major left-wing activist who held a protest sign at President Trump s inauguration accusing the president of being a rapist.Caroline Heldman, an Occidental College professor who appeared on Fox News, reportedly filed a sexual harassment complaint just hours before Fox News announced O Reilly s departure, according to People magazine.Now, she is back to accuse Eric Bolling, a major Trump supporter at the network.
Here is Philly.com s report:Hours after Fox News announced it was suspending Bolling, Caroline Heldman, a politics professor at Occidental College and frequent guest on the network from 2008 to 2011, claimed the Fox News host made an unspecified number of unsolicited sexual advances to her.
[Bolling] said he wanted to fly me out to New York for in-studio hits and to have fun.
He asked me to have meals with him on several occasions, but I found excuses not to go, Heldman wrote in a lengthy Facebook post.
Once, he took me up to his office in New York, showed me his baseball jerseys, and in the brief time I was there, let me know that his office was his favorite place to have sex.
Bolling s team is denying the accusations.
Heldman s social media profiles show her to be a staunch left-wing feminist activist.
