During a debate in New Hampshire, Republican Senator Kelly Ayotte was asked if she would tell her kids to be like Donald Trump, who is a sexist bigot who says and does outrageous things every day: I think that certainly there are many role models that we have and I believe he can serve as president, and so absolutely I would do that, she responded.Well, that didn t make New Hampshire voters very happy at all.So, Ayotte, who is in a tight race against Democratic opponent Governor Maggie Hassan, was forced to back away from the remark entirely, apparently hoping voters are stupid enough to believe that she misspoke.
I misspoke tonight, Ayotte wrote on Twitter.
While I would hope all of our children would aspire to be president, neither Donald Trump nor Hillary Clinton have set a good example and I wouldn t hold up either of them as role models for my kids.

@KellyAyotte @KatCapps nope.

Soulless, spineless, and thoughtless.

@KellyAyotte Nope.
You went on TV and said Trump was absolutely a role model.
You get to live with that now.
