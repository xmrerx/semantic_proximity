the nfl is toast they just caved to demands made by players to dump millions into a social justice boondoggle aimed at the black community .
the problem is that the entire black lives matter scam is a lie and players know it .
there is now discord between players who feel differently about the kneeling protest .
a lack of leadership by goodell to put an end to the protests , has harmed the nfl irreparably .
the nfl is just another social justice program boycott ! what exactly is social justice ? the nfl met with a group of players and reached an agreement in principle late wednesday night to partner on a plan to address social justice issues considered important to african-american communities , sources told espn.the unprecedented agreement calls for the league to contribute $ 89 million over seven years to projects dealing with criminal justice reform , law enforcement/community relations and education.during a conference call wednesday night , malcolm jenkins and anquan boldin , who lead roughly 40 players who have negotiated with the league office about demonstrations during the national anthem , guided the group through the highlights of the package , which represents the nfl s largest contribution to a social issue , surpassing that of salute to service or breast cancer awareness/crucial catch.the partnership came a day after some players broke away from the players coalition because of their dissatisfaction with how jenkins and boldin have handled negotiations .
commissioner roger goodell , believing that an agreement was at hand , was furious when espn reported that players were breaking off , according to one source .
but during an afternoon call , jenkins asked that the commissioner and the owners continue to stand with the players and allow them to do important work in the community.no end in sight for protests : the agreement does not include language calling for players to end protests during the national anthem in exchange for funds ; there s no implicit quid pro quo .
but the nfl hopes this effort will effectively end the peaceful yet controversial movement that former san francisco 49ers quarterback colin kaepernick started in 2016 , when he refused to stand for the anthem.via : espn
