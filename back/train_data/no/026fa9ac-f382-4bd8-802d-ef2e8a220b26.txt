cape town ( reuters ) - greenpeace africa and other ngos intend to appeal against south africa s decision to grant an environmental permit for a new 4,000 megawatt nuclear plant close to cape town , the activists said on monday .
last month south africa s department of environmental affairs granted authorization to state-owned power utility eskom to build the new plant at duynefontein , close to the continent s only existing nuclear site koeberg .
south africa s nuclear regulator said in october that an installation site license for the plant would likely be granted in june , despite the finance minister saying construction of a new plant was unaffordable in a stagnant economy facing further credit downgrades .
if this project goes ahead , it will infringe the environmental rights of both present and future generations .
this authorization can and must be challenged , penny-jane cooke , climate and energy campaigner for greenpeace africa , said in a statement .
south africa s nuclear plans are shrouded in controversy and uncertainty , with local activists and the media raising concerns about transparency and costs as well as safety and environmental risks at a time when pretoria is trying to reduce the economy s heavy reliance on coal power .
nuclear reactor makers including rosatom , south korea s kepco , france s edf and areva , toshiba-owned westinghouse and china s cgn are eyeing the south african project , which could be worth tens of billions of dollars .
