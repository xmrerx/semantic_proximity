colombo ( reuters ) - european lawmakers said on thursday they were disappointed about sri lanka s slow roll-out of human rights reforms that the island nation had promised in exchange for trade concessions .
the european union reinstated concessions on a series of products in may - after sri lanka said it would ratify 27 international conventions on rights , labor conditions , the environment and governance .
the island s key garments industry benefited the most from the duty reductions and other allowances offered by the eu s generalised scheme of preferences plus scheme .
but a european parliament delegation said they had seen little progress more than five months after the agreement .
there was no immediate comment from the government .
it was noted that a number of important issues remain pending , in particular the revision of the prevention of terrorism act on which the prime minister and other senior figures had given their personal assurances , the eu delegation said in a statement .
the united nations has said sri lanka s current terrorism legislation allows the torture of detainees .
sri lanka originally lost the eu concession in 2010 after then-president mahinda rajapaksa rejected demands from the international community to address human rights abuses allegedly committed during a 2009 offensive to crush a tamil insurgency .
rajapaksa was ousted in january last year , and the eu agreed to reinstate the concessions after a new administration , led by president maithripala sirisena , promised to make changes .
the garments industry is sri lanka s second biggest hard currency earner after remittances .
it boasts annual exports of around $ 5 billion and produces goods for victoria s secret , tommy hilfiger , nike , marks & spencer and other well known brands .
