San Fransisco 49er s quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand during the national anthem during a recent NFL football game.
He claimed he would no longer stand for a flag that represents a country who oppresses blacks.
Does he even know what oppression is?1).
Kaepernick coincidentally converted to Islam only two months ago.2).
He is engaged to Nessa Diab, a Black Lives Matter activist who promotes what she calls authentic Islam.
The Kaepernick s will also have a traditional Muslim wedding.3).
Kaepernick was abandoned by his black family as a child and was adopted by a white family.
Did he suffer like he claims or was he taken care of when no one else wanted him?
You only hear him talking tough now because something else is driving his anti-American anger.4).To date, Kaepernick has donated $0 (ZERO) to Black Lives Matter or any other group affiliated with helping minorities.
His net worth is estimated to be over $100 million, yet he has donated zero dollars to the issues he claims to be so passionate about.
When the National Anthem is played, I salute because I am a black man born and raised in the inner city afforded the opportunity for greatness in my own right.
May you seek God s forgiveness and find humility, because we, the people are not going to forget what you did and said.
Conservative Daily PostFormer US Rep., Allen West had these tough words for anti-American pro-BLM Colin Kaepernick: BLM activists are thugs that vandalize cities and collect welfare checks while our veterans are sleeping under a bridge overpass because they fought for Kaepernick to have the freedom to utter ignorant remarks like he did.
