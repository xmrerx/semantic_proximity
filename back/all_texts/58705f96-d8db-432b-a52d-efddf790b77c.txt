While speaking about illegal immigration at a campaign rally in Bloomington, IL, today, Trump noticed a man wearing what appears to be a homemade t-shirt that said Legal Immigrant for Trump .
Only one day after being grabbed by an audience member with ties to ISIS the fearless Trump then did what no other candidates in this race have done.
He spontaneously called one of his supporters up to the stage.This isn t the first time that Trump has asked a member of the audience to come up to the stage and give a spontaneous speech.
Being able to genuinely connect with everyday Americans is a YUGE part of Trump s appeal.
It s a characteristic that can t be faked, and so far no other candidate has been able to replicate his sincere desire to Make America Great Again for every age, race, social class and gender.
We believe it s why he s winning.https://youtu.be/Lm6LGITkiz4
