We should do NOTHING for these terrorists!
They got money and a house from the government of Uruguay but want even more from the U.S. and Uruguay.
Unreal!Four former Guantanamo Bay prisoners protested for a second day Saturday demanding more help from both the Uruguayan and the U.S. governments for adapting to life in their new home in this South American country.The men began their protest in front of the U.S. Embassy in Montevideo on Friday and said they slept there through the night.
They insisted would stay until they met with the U.S. ambassador.
We ll be here until Monday.
We are not leaving until with speak with the ambassador, former detainee Adel bin Muhammad El Ouerghi said.The men began their protest after the embassy closed for the weekend, and U.S. officials had not responded to messages requesting comment.As a humanitarian gesture, Uruguay s government took in the four and two other men in December after U.S. authorities freed them from Guantanamo.
They had spent 12 years at the U.S. military prison for suspected al-Qaida ties, but U.S. officials decided they were no longer a threat and let them go.The four Syrians, one Tunisian and one Palestinian have repeatedly said the United States should help them financially so they can afford to bring their families to Uruguay.The men get $600 (15,000 pesos) a month from Uruguay s government, which they must use to pay for food, clothes, cellphones and other personal items.
Officials have also provided a house for the six men to share.
