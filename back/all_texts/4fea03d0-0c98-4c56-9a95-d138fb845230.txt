This is great because Hillary Clinton is never asked questions like this one: Um, you said earlier that you wanted to end corruption, but how can you do that after the Whitewater scandals, Benghazi and the deleted emails?
Hillary s response: Well, I wish you d go back and read the history of 1990s, because clearly uh, there, there were unfortunately a lot of partisans who uh, thought that the best way to work uh, with my husband s administration was through attacks of all kinds all of which washed out.
Soooo it was the vast right-wing conspiracy ?
That s a pretty pitiful answer
