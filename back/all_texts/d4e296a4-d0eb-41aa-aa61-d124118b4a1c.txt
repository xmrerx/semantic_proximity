With the primaries getting closer and the choice for Democratic nominee for president becoming a choice between Vermont Independent Senator Bernie Sanders and Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, more and more people are letting their opinions be known when it comes to who they want to lead the nation.And while Sanders is definitely getting his fair share of endorsements, Clinton has been receiving quite a few lately.
Between Planned Parenthood and former Congresswoman Gabby Giffords giving her the nod back to back, now another person has told Hillary to her face that she has every aspect that they d like to see in a president.While appearing on the The Ellen Show, Clinton sat down with host Ellen DeGeneres, who then let her feelings be known directly to the candidate: I mean, I ve said it before, that you ve been held to a completely different standard than everyone else seems to be, you know, held to.
You know what a supporter I am.
I think that you re as smart as can be, I think you are qualified, I think you stand for everything that I want in a president.
And while this isn t a direct endorsement, this should really come as no surprise.
Last October, while interviewing Pharrell, the producer/singer let DeGeneres know that he would be supporting Hillary, and she responded with: We have become a society where it is all about personality and celebrity and charm, instead of it being about the person who s gonna get the job done.
And while we still don t know who is going to win the Democratic primary, let alone who will win the White House, Hillary definitely has the experience, know how, and wherewithal to get the job.
She s seen and dealt with it all throughout her tenure in Washington DC.
That being said, Bernie Sanders would still make a very formidable candidate, and honestly either candidate would be heads above any Republican candidate.Here s DeGeneres speaking with Clinton: // < !
