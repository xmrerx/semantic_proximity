FLORENCE, Italy (Reuters) - A stone fragment, probably a piece of marble from the top of a column, fell on a tourist visiting Florence s Basilica of the Holy Cross, killing him, officials said on Thursday.
The church where Renaissance master Michelangelo Buonarotti is buried has been closed by police, a spokesman for the national fire rescue service said.
The fire service identified the victim as a male Spaniard in his 50s.
