NAYPYITAW (Reuters) - Pope Francis said on Tuesday that Myanmar is suffering from civil conflict and hostilities that have lasted all too long and created deep divisions , but in a speech in the country s capital he did not refer to the minority Rohingya Muslims.
The arduous process of peacebuilding and national reconciliation can only advance through a commitment to justice and respect for human rights, he said, speaking after Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi had made an address.
Religious differences need not be a source of division and distrust, but rather a force for unity, forgiveness, tolerance and wise nationbuilding, the pope added.
The pope s visit to Myanmar comes after an exodus of more than 620,000 Rohingya from Rakhine state to the southern tip of Bangladesh following a military crackdown that the United States last week branded ethnic cleansing .
His trip is so delicate that some papal advisers warned him against even saying the word Rohingya , lest he set off a diplomatic incident that could turn the country s military and government against minority Christians.
Myanmar does not recognize the Rohingya as citizens nor as members of a distinct ethnic group with their own identity, and it rejects the term Rohingya and its use.
Pope Francis did not use the word in his speech.
