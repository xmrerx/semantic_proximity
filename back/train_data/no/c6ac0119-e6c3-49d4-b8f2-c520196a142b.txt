berlin ( reuters ) - germany plans to reduce the combined pension contributions it takes from employers and employees by a total of 1.3 billion euros in 2018 due to record-high employment and a rising level of reserves , government sources said on friday .
the contributions for 2018 that both employers and employees pay into the public pension system will be lowered by 0.1 percentage points to 18.6 percent of the total wage package , government officials told reuters on condition of anonymity .
that means employers and employees , who roughly share the contribution , will have about 1.3 billion euros more next year , the government officials said .
the exact figures will be agreed after the government has published its updated tax revenue estimates due on nov. 9 , the officials said .
the cabinet could then formally agree the reduction on nov. 22 .
according to calculations thus far , pension contributions were meant to remain stable at 18.7 percent until 2021 and then rise to 18.9 percent in 2022 due to germany s rapidly ageing society .
despite a recent rise in the birth rate and the arrival of more than a million migrants , experts estimate the working age population , whose pension contributions support the growing number of retirees , will shrink massively in the next decade .
employers in europe s biggest economy often complain about the high level of pension contributions and regularly urge the government to lower the level .
a survey of germany s dihk chambers of industry and commerce showed on thursday that companies view rising labor costs as one of the principle risks for future growth .
