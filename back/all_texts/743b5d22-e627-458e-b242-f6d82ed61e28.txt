The Trump administration is in a tailspin after fired FBI Director James Comey revealed that Donald Trump had pressured him to drop the investigation into his campaign s collusion with Russia and he has the paper trail to prove it.
Not surprisingly, even Republican lawmakers want to see Comey s memos.
Now.GOP senator Jason Chaffetz told NBC on Tuesday that if the memo exists, I need to see it and I need to see it right away.
He added that he is already drafting the necessary paperwork to get the memo.
When asked if he would consider issuing a subpoena to get the memos, Chaffetz said that if this memo exists, he will use every tool we have to get it.The Republican senator then took to Twitter to erase any doubt about his seriousness regarding this matter, writing that he has his subpoena pen ready.

@GOPoversight is going to get the Comey memo, if it exists.
I need to see it sooner rather than later.
I have my subpoena pen ready.
Jason Chaffetz (@jasoninthehouse) May 16, 2017Chaffetz, who is the chairman of the House Oversight Committee, followed up by sending a letter to Andrew McCabe, acting Director of the FBI, on Tuesday night.
He requested that all memoranda, notes, summaries, and recordings referring or relating to any communications between Comey and the President be turned over to the committee by May 24.Shit is getting deep for Trump.
Not a single Republican congressman or senator has been willing to publicly defend Trump since he was busted blabbing top-secret info to Russia and he is quickly losing what little support he had in Washington.
At this point, I know not to hold my breath, but maybe, just maybe, Trump s time in the White House is finally coming to an end.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
