tokyo ( reuters ) - japan will impose additional sanctions on north korea in response to the continuing threat posed by its missile and nuclear programs , japan s top government spokesman said on tuesday .
the sanctions , mentioned by prime minister shinzo abe in a joint news conference with u.s. president donald trump on monday , will freeze the assets of nine organizations and 26 individuals , chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga told a news conference .
the north korean missile and nuclear issue is a pressing threat unseen before .
its provocative actions , in which it has ignored the severe warnings of international society , are totally unacceptable , he said .
the organizations are north korean banks , several of them based in china , while the individuals are based in a number of nations , including china , russia and libya .
suga said the move was taken in the wake of trump s visit as a way of demonstrating the determination of the two nations to stand together and increase pressure on pyongyang .
speaking in beijing , chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying reiterated that china opposed unilateral sanctions imposed outside of the framework of the u.n. security council .
trump said on monday that the united states stood in solidarity with japan on north korea and called north korea s ballistic missile launches over japan a threat to the civilized world and to international peace and stability .
