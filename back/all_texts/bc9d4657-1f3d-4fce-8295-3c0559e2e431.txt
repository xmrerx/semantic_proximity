This lack of oversight proves that Donald Trump is totally unfit to be president.Earlier this week, the Republican nominee winked at birthers by inviting President Obama s estranged Kenyan Muslim half-brother as his honored guest for Wednesday night s debate between himself and Hillary Clinton.It s Trump s way of trolling President Obama and giving a not so subtle shout-out to all the conservatives out there who believe the sitting President of the United States is a secret Muslim who was not born here in America.But Trump and his campaign team clearly did not do their homework on Malik Obama, because despite Trump s claims that he will be tough on terrorism, Trump s guest is allegedly a supporter of Hamas, an anti-Israel group that denies the Holocaust and commits acts of terrorism to achieve their ultimate goal of wiping Israel off the map.The Times of Israel reports,In January 2014 the Daily Mail uncovered a photograph showing Malik Obama with a traditional Arab headscarf decorated with slogans of the Palestinian terror group Hamas.The scarf, called a keffiyeh, was draped around Obama s neck and carried the Arabic phrases for Jerusalem is ours we are coming and From the river to the sea, both popular Hamas chants.The photograph was taken at a 2010 conference in Yemen.Here s the image via Twitter.Trump fan & estranged Obama bro wears Hamas scarf blaring Jerusalem is ours-we are coming & From the river to the sea (@Green_Footballs) pic.twitter.com/npZh1AvcsZ Noga Tarnopolsky (@NTarnopolsky) October 19, 2016On inviting Malik Obama to the debate, Trump has said I look very much forward to meeting and being with Malik.
He gets it far better than his brother.
Trump apparently doesn t get it at all.After spending all of that time accusing President Obama of supporting terrorists and hating Israel, Trump literally is welcoming a man who actually does as a supporter of his campaign.Wow.
How can Trump and his supporters actually look themselves in the mirror without seeing the word hypocrite tattooed on their foreheads?Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images
