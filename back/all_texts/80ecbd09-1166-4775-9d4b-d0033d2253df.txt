LONDON (Reuters) - The British government is planning to pass a separate piece of legislation through parliament to approve the terms of the transitional period it wants to smooth its exit from the European Union, a junior Brexit minister said on Thursday.
Asked by a parliamentary committee if the government would require separate legislation to enact the so-called implementation period, he said: That is our position, yes.
