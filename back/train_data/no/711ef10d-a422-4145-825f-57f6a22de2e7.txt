ankara ( reuters ) - turkish authorities issued detention warrants on friday for 79 former teachers , the state-run anadolu news agency said , as part of a widening crackdown since last year s failed coup attempt .
the teachers were formerly employed at schools allegedly linked to the u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen , accused by ankara of orchestrating last july s abortive putsch , anadolu said .
the schools were shut down after the coup attempt .
gulen , who has lived in self-imposed exile in pennsylvania since 1999 , denies involvement .
anadolu said security forces were carrying out operations to capture the suspects in ankara , where thousands of teachers from across the country arrived to visit the mausoleum of mustafa kemal ataturk , founder of modern turkey , to celebrate the national teachers day .
since the abortive coup , more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over alleged links to gulen , while some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the military , public and private sectors .
rights groups and some of turkey s western allies have voiced concern about the crackdown , fearing the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent .
the government says only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by gulen s network , which it says deeply infiltrated institutions such as the army , schools and courts .
