Will get done!
[0715 EDT] - I strongly pressed President Putin twice about Russian meddling in our election.
He vehemently denied it.
I’ve already given my opinion..... [0731 EDT] - ...We negotiated a ceasefire in parts of Syria which will save lives.
Now it is time to move forward in working constructively with Russia!
[0737 EDT] - Putin & I discussed forming an impenetrable Cyber Security unit so that election hacking, & many other negative things, will be guarded.. [0750 EDT] - ...and safe.
Questions were asked about why the CIA & FBI had to ask the DNC 13 times for their SERVER, and were rejected, still don’t.... [0757 EDT] - ...have it.
Fake News said 17 intel agencies when actually 4 (had to apologize).
Why did Obama do NOTHING when he had info before election?
[0806 EDT] - Sanctions were not discussed at my meeting with President Putin.
Nothing will be done until the Ukrainian & Syrian problems are solved!
[0831 EDT] - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
[0857 EDT] - For years, even as a “civilian,” I listened as Republicans pushed the Repeal and Replace of ObamaCare.
Now they finally have their chance!
[1607 EDT] - Syrian ceasefire seems to be holding.
Many lives can be saved.
Came out of meeting.
Good!
[1609 EDT] - The fact that President Putin and I discussed a Cyber Security unit doesn’t mean I think it can happen.
It can’t-but a ceasefire can,& did!
