Mark Dice nails it!
Van Jones on CNN cries over President Trump blaming both sides, and Anderson Cooper, Don Lemon and others looked like they were holding back tears.
The liberal media freakout hasn t been this bad since Hillary lost the election.Van Jones takes his orders from Obama and ValJar He s a student of Alinsky and plays like he really cares about the black community.
He s dangerous.
He wants a revolution in America so bad he ll fake cry on TV to get it.
What is it with the Democrats?
A bunch of babies!
First, we had Obama fake crying and then Schumer!
