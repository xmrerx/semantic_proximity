An email released by WikiLeaks on Sunday appears to show a former top aide to Bill Clinton arguing that an investigation into Clinton Foundation spending would show that Chelsea Clinton used foundation resources for her own wedding.The email, stolen from Clinton campaign Chairman John Podesta and published by WikiLeaks, shows a back-and-forth between Podesta and Doug Band, a former aide to Bill Clinton.Band said he heard that Chelsea Clinton was conducting an internal investigation of money within the foundation from cgi [Clinton Global Initiative] to the foundation.
He said he was hearing more chatter about how Chelsea was talking about internal issues like that, and said it was not smart.
In a later follow-up to Podesta, Band wrote, The investigation into her getting paid for campaigning, using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade, taxes on money from her parents I hope that you will speak to her and end this, Band added.
Once we go down this road Other emails showed Band feuding with Chelsea Clinton.
For instance, Clinton had warned that Band was using Bill Clinton s name without his consent to win clients to his firm, and Band replied by saying Chelsea was a spoiled brat kid.
