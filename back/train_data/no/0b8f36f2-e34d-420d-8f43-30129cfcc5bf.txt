john kerry gave a long-winded speech today claiming the obama administration had been a friend to israel .
he went on and on describing the support to the israeli military .
he was clearly on the defensive after the debacle of the us abstaining in a vote by the un security council to punish israel .
it s been no secret that the obama administration has been anti-israel from the beginning , so kerry s speech was wasted air time .
no one believes anything john kerry says his credibility had been lost long ago .
all you need to know about him was revealed when he flew singer james taylor to paris to sing you ve got a friend after the horrific terror attack by islamic terrorists .
obama and kerry are clearly of the pacifist school of thought that will clear a path for the destruction of the west and israel.during his speech today he asked that israel move its borders back to the 1967 location something obama had previously stated he d like to see israel do what are these two smoking ?
