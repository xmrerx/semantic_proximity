We all know the feeling of dread that takes over when you see someone in public that you would really rather avoid.
That frantic moment when you look around for somewhere, anywhere, to hide.
Well, apparently former FBI Director James Comey felt that way about Donald Trump, not that you can blame him.The New York Times reports that Comey was once so desperate to avoid dealing with Trump that he tried to blend in with the curtains to avoid him.
Make no mistake, Comey is not a little guy.
He stands 6 8 tall.
So he tends to stand out.
But Brookings Institution fellow Benjamin Wittes said that Comey was hoping that if he stood close enough to the dark blue curtains of the White House Blue Room in his suit (that was an almost perfect match), maybe he could go unnoticed.
He thought he had gotten through and not been noticed or singled out and that he was going to get away without an individual interaction, Wittes told the Times.But no such luck.
Trump spotted Comey and made a big production out of it.
He called Comey out of the curtains, noting that he had become more famous that himself and then proceeded to hug Comey against his will.Comey said that as he was walking across the room he was determined that there wasn t going to be a hug, Wittes said.
It was bad enough there was going to be a handshake.
And Comey has long arms so Comey said he pre-emptively reached out for a handshake and grabbed the president s hand.
But Trump pulled him into an embrace and Comey didn t reciprocate.
If you look at the video, it s one person shaking hands and another hugging.
