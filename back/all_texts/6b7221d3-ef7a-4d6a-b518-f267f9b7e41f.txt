WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz released four years of his and wife Heidi’s tax returns on Saturday, ranging from 2011-2014, showing $389,124 taxes paid on $1.2 million in 2014.
Cruz’s filings follow a similar release of returns on Saturday by rival Marco Rubio, a U.S. senator from Florida.
Both campaigns called on billionaire businessman and Republican front-runner Donald Trump to make his returns public, too.
