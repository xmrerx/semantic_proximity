manila ( reuters ) - the philippines top police chief who oversaw a bloody war on drugs that has killed thousands of filipinos hinted on monday at a possible run for the presidency .
ronald dela rosa , a stocky , celebrity-like general nicknamed bato ( rock ) , who retires in 2018 , has flagged his political ambitions , saying he was open to running for the senate .
but in a speech after a flag raising ceremony at police headquarters , dela rosa for the first time publicly suggested he may have his sights set on higher political goals .
wait for bato to become president and i will quadruple your salaries , dela rosa told his men as he denied rumors he would leave retirees out of planned salary increases .
dela rosa is among those touted by the national media as duterte s possible successor in 2022 , along with world boxing champion and senator manny pacquiao , and the son and namesake of late philippine dictator ferdinand marcos .
dela rosa has acted as the enforcer for the firebrand leader s war on drugs which had led to more than 3,900 people killed in 16 months .
the campaign has sparked outrage abroad , but domestic polls have shown crime-weary filipinos are largely supportive of the measure .
duterte ordered the police this month to halt activities in the war on drugs and leave all operations to drug enforcement agency , amid unprecedented scrutiny of police conduct .
police reject allegations by activists they are executing suspected drug users and dealers , saying victims in their anti-narcotics operations were killed because they were armed and had violently resisted arrest .
