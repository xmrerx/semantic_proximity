It s like a day doesn t go by without some backwoods, right-wing jackass threatening the life of the President.Donald Baker of the Anchorage Fire Department was suspended after issuing threats to the President on social media.
The controversy began when a reader sent a screenshot of the remark to WHAS11.
Under an article titled Obama Hijacks Memorial With Sick Message (apparently from right-wing garbage pile America s Freedom Fighters), Baker wrote that someone should please put a bullet in this f*cker s head, referring to worthless piece of sh*t Obama:When the station contacted Baker s employer, an investigation was launched.
Chief William Rockwood confirmed on Thursday that the post was being investigated, and that he had suspended Baker while he determines if the department s social media policy was violated by this direct threat to the President: The Anchorage Fire Protection District finds this post extremely troubling and inappropriate.
The District does not condone or allow the use of inappropriate conduct or language by its employees in person or through instant technology.
Sadly, Baker is finding a lot of support on WHAS11 s Facebook page: Some of his more vocal supporters have their own thoughts on the President: Perhaps it s time for the Secret Service to pay Mr. Baker a visit.
All too often we see threats against the President go completely unanswered a dangerous thing when right-wing terrorism is on the rise.At minimum, Baker should definitely lose his job.
After all, can he really be trusted to do his job to the best of his ability if he pulls up to a fire at a house with Democratic political signs in the yard?
How deep does his bigotry go?
Does it extend to all African-Americans?
We are still awaiting the results of the investigation, but hopefully the Department does the right thing.
