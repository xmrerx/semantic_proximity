Donald Trump s inauguration was one of the most disappointing in American history, but he keeps desperately trying to sell it as one of the best.Actual attendance at Trump s inauguration didn t even get close to a million people as aerial photos show that much of the National Mall was empty by the time Trump delivered his divisive and negative inaugural address.Neilson television ratings for Trump s inauguration were not much better as 31 million tuned in to watch a national tragedy unfold before their eyes.But Trump is bragging about this number on Twitter and comparing it to President Obama s second inauguration ratings as if he thinks he deserves some sort of prize for cherry-picking an inauguration that got lower ratings.Wow, television ratings just out: 31 million people watched the Inauguration, 11 million more than the very good ratings from 4 years ago!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 22, 2017The problem is that Trump deliberately chose to compare his inauguration to President Obama s second inauguration because his numbers were far lower than Obama s first inauguration.
And Twitter once again brutally flattened Trump s fragile ego with a reality check..@realDonaldTrump Donald, I m worried you re treating the United States Presidency like a television show, dear.

@realDonaldTrump Except that you should compare your ratings to Obama s in 2009, not 2013.
And in 2009, Obama had 38 million viewers.
Oops Simon Hedlin (@simonhedlin) January 22, 2017Donald Trump is supposed to be president now, but he is acting far from presidential and is only demonstrating that he will be just as petty, vain, and thin-skinned as ever before and those traits will only amplify because he has a bigger platform now.Featured image via Pete Souza
