The day after a federal judge in San Francisco blocked part of alleged president Donald Trump s executive order threatening sanctuary cities with losing federal funds if they do not comply with requests from immigration enforcement agents, the former reality show star began attacking the decision on Twitter in an early morning tweetstorm.
You knew this was coming.Once again, the man-baby POTUS called his Muslim ban a ban, thus proving why the ninth circuit court previously ruled against his executive order.
First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings.
See you in the Supreme Court!, it tweeted.First the Ninth Circuit rules against the ban & now it hits again on sanctuary cities-both ridiculous rulings.

They used to call this judge shopping!
Messy system.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 26, 2017Trump s Executive Order on Tuesday was halted by Judge William Orrick who granted a preliminary injunction against section 9(a) of Executive Order 13768, which sought to ensure, in part, that jurisdictions that fail to comply with applicable federal law do not receive Federal funds, except as mandated by law.
Orrick noted that the order threatened hundreds of millions of federal dollars at the local level, writing that, The Constitution vests the spending powers in Congress, not the President, so the Order cannot constitutionally place new conditions on federal funds.
The internet was quick to respond to Trump s latest Twitter-tantrum.
@realDonaldTrump This is a lie.The Supreme Court only takes 0.1% of Ninth Circuit cases for review.
Of THAT, 80% get overturned.TINY percentage.

This must've been on your mind all night to wake up and vent your inarticulate jibberish on Twitter.

Nick Jack Pappas (@Pappiness) April 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump Wow, you REALLY are an abject failure, aren't ya?!
Jules Suzdaltsev (@jules_su) April 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump You are literally trying to create crime with this lie you tell about sanctuary cities.
Mikel Jollett (@Mikel_Jollett) April 26, 2017@tonyposnanski @realDonaldTrump Trump doesn't have a whole lot of wins in the court, yet he's always wanting to go there.
I don't get it.
Erin DeCaprio (@ErinDeCaprio) April 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump Why does it always take so long for the second half of your tweet?
You lose all the momentum.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) April 26, 2017@realDonaldTrump You said there would be so much winning, but we ended up getting more whining instead.

Sad!

He cannot ban Muslims from entering the country.
He couldn t get support behind the shit sandwich healthcare plan he endorsed to replace Obamacare.
Trump is holding the highest office in the land and cannot legislate.
He s an abject failure who has duped his supporters into believing that he will build a wall across our Southern border, lock Hillary Clinton up, defeat ISIS and repeal Obamacare on day one.
None of that is happening and yet, his supporters stick by him.
However, on social media, there appears to be less enthusiasm for the amateur president.He can t defeat ISIS while banning refugees who are fleeing from terror at the hands of ISIS.
It plays right into the terrorist group s agenda.
