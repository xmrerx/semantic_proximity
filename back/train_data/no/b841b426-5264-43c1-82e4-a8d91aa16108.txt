just call him bring it ben ben carson says he would have led a charge against the oregon shooter if he were in the community college classroom when the gunfire erupted .
not only would i probably not cooperate with him , i would not just stand there and let him shoot me .
i would say , hey , guys , everybody attack him !
he may shoot me but he can t get us all , the soft-spoken carson said tuesday on fox and friends .
the gunman , chris harper-mercer , asked his victims at umpqua community college their religions before opening fire last thursday , killing nine and injuring nine others .
