22-yr old American Otto Warmbier was arrested and imprisoned during Barack Obama s last term in office.
He was released at the direction of President Trump.
Although former President Barack Obama was unable to secure her release, after being in office for less than 4 months, President Trump was also able to secure the release of Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who spent three years in an Egyptian jail over what human rights groups say were bogus charges.Otto Warmbier, the college student arrested, tried and imprisoned in North Korea for more than a year for trying to swipe a souvenir from his hotel during a guided tour of the communist nation, has been released, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson announced Tuesday.The 22-year-old Warmbier has served just over a year of his 15-year sentence allegedly for taking down a sign of the late dictator Kim Jong Il while Warmbier was in the country with a tour group.
As of Tuesday morning, Warmbier was on his way home to Cincinnati, although other details surrounding the dramatic events were not released.
At the direction of the President, the Department of State has secured the release of Otto Warmbier from North Korea, Tillerson said.
Mr. Warmbier is en route to the United States, where he will be reunited with his family.
The Department of State continues to have discussions with the DPRK regarding three other U.S. citizens reported detained.
Out of respect for the privacy of Mr. Warmbier and his family, we have no further comment on Mr. Warmbier.
Warmbier s parents, who have appeared on Fox News Channel in the past to plead for their son s release, expressed gratitude.
