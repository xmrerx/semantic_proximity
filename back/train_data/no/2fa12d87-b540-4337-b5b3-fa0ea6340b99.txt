authorities including the national disaster management authority ( ndma ) , india s coast guard and navy have rescued about 223 fishermen and evacuated thousands of people from cyclone hit areas , officials said , as they continued their operations on saturday .
prime minister narendra modi has spoken to the chief minister of tamil nadu , assuring him of support operations including necessary funds , according to local media .
ockhi is expected to travel north towards mumbai and gujarat in the next 48 hours , according to indian meteorological department ( imd ) director s. sudevan in trivandrum , though it is likely to lose intensity .
the intensity of the wind may come down and the cyclone could change into depression , sudevan said adding fishermen have been warned not go to the sea for the next few days as waves are likely to be 3-5 meters ( 12-15 feet ) high .
