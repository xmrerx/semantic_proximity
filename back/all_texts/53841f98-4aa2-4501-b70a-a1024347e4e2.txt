Following James Comey s testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee, Trump claimed that he d never asked Comey for a loyalty pledge, claimed that he barely knew Comey, and claimed he never told Comey that he hoped the Flynn investigation would be dropped.
Comey, for his part, testified that not only did Trump say he hoped he d drop the Flynn investigation, but also said he took it as a directive.
Now Trump s son has confirmed Comey s version of events, making his own father out to be the liar we all know he is.That may well have been inadvertent, but it s what he did.
It s amusing, really the junior Trump first said, We were vindicated!
and then launched into Comey: I think it s clear that everything that went on in the Comey testimony was basically ridiculous.
They re saying, Hey, he never asked me to stop a Russia investigation.
Then he goes on to blasting Comey s report that Trump said: I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go.
He is a good guy.
I hope you can let this go.
Junior Trump uses that to paint Comey as both weak and insubordinate as loudly as possible.
Watch him do it below (you can watch the whole video here):Oops.
@realDonaldTrump said he never told Comey he hoped he d drop Flynn.
@DonaldJTrumpJr just said Daddy did too!

Well, I didn t say that.
I mean, I will tell you I didn t say that.
And there d be nothing wrong if I did say it, according to everybody that I ve read today, but I did not say that.
Sorry Donald.
Your son, Donnie Jr., just threw you under the bus.Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
