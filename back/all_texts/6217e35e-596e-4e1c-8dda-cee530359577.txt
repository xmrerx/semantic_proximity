Throughout his campaign, Donald Trump repeatedly attacked the press and went as far as to point to MSNBC/NBC reporter Katy Tur at a rally in which she later had to be escorted out by the Secret Service.
Trump is playing a dangerous game by villainizing journalists.
Trump supporters agree with everything he says and when he attacks reporters, they are happy to attack them, too.
They are literally attacking the Constitution because Freedom of the Press is protected by the First Amendment.
To dumb it down for Trump supporters, it s the amendment before the Second Amendment.Former Vice President Dick Cheney is apparently a fan of Donald Trump s. He suggested recently that the President-elect s social media usage means that American citizens no longer needed the news media.With Dick Cheney in his corner, that should be a wake up call to his supporters.At the Reagan National Defense Forum, CNN s Barbara Starr asked the former vice president if Trump s casual tone on Twitter was dangerous.
I do think you need to be careful, Cheney said.
But he ll learn as he goes along.
I think he is putting some brains and good people with him.
I am a big fan of [Vice President-elect] Mike Pence.
I think one of the reasons people get so concerned about the tweets is it s sort of a way around the press, Dick said.
It s modern era, modern technology.
He s at the point where we don t need you guys anymore.
I apologize, Cheney added.Watch at around the 18 minute mark:Apology not accepted, Dick.Oh sure, just what we need.
A president who has to learn as he goes along.
Trump supporters wanted a man in the White House with zero political experience.
It s like giving the keys to your Bentley to a guy who doesn t have a driver s license.The establishment sure is backing the supposed anti-establishment president-elect.Photo by Mark Wilson via Getty.
