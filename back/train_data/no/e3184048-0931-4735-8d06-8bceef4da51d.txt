beijing ( reuters ) - the retired former head of a chinese state-run news agency has been expelled from the ruling communist party for graft , an anti-corruption watchdog said on monday .
liu beixian , editor-in-chief of the china news service until retiring in february 2015 , accepted bribes and expensive gifts while abusing his power to obtain financial gain for private enterprises , the watchdog , the central commission for discipline inspection , said in a statement .
the commission said liu , 62 , also violated regulations by flying first class multiple times and he was uncooperative when being investigated .
as a leading cadre , liu beixian lost his ideals and convictions and had serious thoughts of privilege , the commission said , adding that the evidence would be transferred to relevant judicial authorities for prosecution .
it was not possible to reach liu or a legal or family representative for comment .
liu was put under investigation in august for serious disciplinary violations , a euphemism for graft .
the china news service is run under the auspices of the cabinet s overseas chinese affairs office , and is designed to serve as a news source for chinese communities in places like hong kong and self-ruled taiwan .
it is separate from xinhua , china s official news agency .
liu began working at the china news service in 1983 and was its hong kong bureau chief from 1997 to 2000 , according to his official resume .
the former british territory was handed back to china in 1997 .
president xi jinping has mounted a sweeping campaign against deep-rooted corruption since taking office five years ago , jailing or meting out lesser punishments to hundreds of thousands of officials .
