This is gonna be a tough pill for the left to swallow after working so hard to stack the courts In a victory for the Trump administration, the Supreme Court on Monday lifted key components of an injunction against President Trump s proposed ban on travel from six majority-Muslim nations, reinstating much of the policy and promising to hear full arguments as early as this fall.The court s decision means the justices will now wade into the biggest legal controversy of the Trump administration the president s order temporarily restricting travel, which even Trump has termed a travel ban.
Today s unanimous Supreme Court decision is a clear victory for our national security, Trump said in a statement.
As President, I cannot allow people into our country who want to do us harm.
I want people who can love the United States and all of its citizens, and who will be hardworking and productive.
He added: My number one responsibility as Commander in Chief is to keep the American people safe.
Today s ruling allows me to use an important tool for protecting our Nation s homeland.
The court made clear that a limited version of the policy can be enforced immediately with a full hearing to come in the Fall.
An American individual or entity that has a bona fide relationship with a particular person seeking to enter the country as a refugee can legitimately claim concrete hardship if that person is excluded, the court wrote.
As to these individuals and entities, we do not disturb the injunction.
But when it comes to refugees who lack any such connection to the United States, for the reasons we have set out, the balance tips in favor of the Government s compelling need to provide for the Nation s security.
The justices decided to review the broader constitutional issues over executive authority on immigration with oral arguments to be held in the fall.
