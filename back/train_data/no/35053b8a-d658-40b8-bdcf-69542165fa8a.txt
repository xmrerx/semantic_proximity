washington ( reuters ) - the white house said on thursday that it was pleased that a u.s. appellate court had denied a bid by 27 states to block the obama administration ’ s clean power plan while litigation challenging the regulation continues .
“ we are confident that the plan will reduce carbon pollution and deliver better air quality , improved public health , and jobs across the country , ” white house spokesman josh earnest said in a statement .
the clean power plan is the centerpiece of the obama administration ’ s strategy to combat climate change .
the rule aims to lower carbon emissions from the country ’ s power plants to 32 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 .
