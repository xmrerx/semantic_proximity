london ( reuters ) - protecting britain from cyber crime is as important as defending it against terrorism , the head of britain s gchq spy agency said on monday .
britain has suffered a number of high-profile cyber attacks this year , including one in may on the state-run national health service which crippled some computer systems and caused huge disruption , and another on parliament in june .
writing in the daily telegraph newspaper , jeremy fleming , said the speed of technological advances , whilst providing great opportunities for businesses , individuals and countries , was also giving enemies new means to threaten the nation s security .
if gchq is to continue to help keep the country safe , then protecting the digital homeland keeping our citizens safe and free online must become and remain as much part of our mission as our global intelligence reach and our round-the-clock efforts against terrorism .
the national cyber security centre , which is part of gchq , said last week it had dealt with almost 600 significant incidents which required a nationwide , coordinated response .
in july , fleming s predecessor at gchq , robert hannigan , said russia was causing cyberspace mayhem and should face retaliation if it continued to undermine democratic institutions in the west .
fleming said that britons benefited greatly from the ease and speed of connections and from the security provided by default encryption .
hostile states , terrorists and criminals use those same features ... to undermine our national security , attack our interests and , increasingly , commit crime , he said .
traditionally britain s security chiefs rarely spoke in public but increasingly the head of the three intelligence agencies gchq , mi5 and mi6 have become more open in explaining their work and countering criticism .
