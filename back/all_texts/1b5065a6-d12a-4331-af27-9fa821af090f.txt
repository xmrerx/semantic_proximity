Donald Trump is whining about the media doing their job, so can someone please get out the world s smallest violin and play it just for him?Rather than blame his campaign woes on himself and the pathetic staff he has assembled, the Republican nominee has chosen to target the media as the sole reason why his run for president is imploding.Trump has created a hostile atmosphere for members of the media during his rallies, especially during a December rally when the Secret Service literally had to step in to protect NBC reporter Katy Tur after Trump targeted her specifically.
The crowd booed and hissed at the media on Saturday as well as Trump complained that the media is somehow treating him unfairly because they report on what he says.As usual, Trump to his temper tantrums in real world to Twitter, where he fired off several tweets on Sunday morning and afternoon all about how the dishonest media is in the bag for Hillary Clinton.The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened.
Their reporting is fiction.
The media protects Hillary!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2016 The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change.
False, I am who I am-never said Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2016If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn t put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20% Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2016 My rallies are not covered properly by the media.
They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2016Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media.
She is not a talented person or politician.
The dishonest media refuses to expose!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2016 I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process.
People get it!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2016It is not freedom of the press when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 14, 2016It s really funny about that last one, especially when you consider that Trump is far from being the next Honest Abe.
In fact, Polifact has a long file on Donald Trump and so far they have ruled him to be the pants on fire candidate because of how many lies he has spewed on the campaign trail.And on Saturday night during his rally in Connecticut, Trump literally told his supporters that he lies to them and they were all too stupid to notice.Donald Trump refuses to accept any responsibility for his own failure, which is definitely NOT presidential.
This is the same man whom Newt Gingrich outrageously compared to Harry Truman, the president who famously declared that the buck stops here, which means the ultimate burden of responsibility is on the guy in charge.
Trump is no Truman.
And he should never be allowed to be president.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images
