oslo ( reuters ) - norway s liberal party will launch formal negotiations to join the right-wing cabinet of prime minister erna solberg , it said on saturday , although the government would still be ruling in a minority even if the small centrist group is included .
informal talks have taken place since the government won re-election in september , and bringing in the liberals could give a boost to policies favoring small businesses , the environment and education .
we are going to give ourselves a chance ... to find a common platform we can agree on , liberal party leader trine skei grande told a meeting of her party in parliament on saturday , adding it would be a challenging and difficult process .
adding the liberals to the coalition of the conservatives and the anti-immigration progress party could make day-to-day governing easier for solberg , although she would still require backing from another small party , the christian democrats .
the prime minister has sought to include both of the small centrist groups , but the christian democrats , which back solberg on fiscal matters , have rejected the offer .
