dubai ( reuters ) - seven suspected al qaeda militants were killed by a drone strike in central yemen on wednesday , residents and local officials said .
the strikes hit two cars carrying armed individuals in al-bayda province , the sources said .
u.s. forces have repeatedly launched drone and air strikes against yemen s al qaeda branch , known as al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) .
the group has taken advantage of a more than two-year-old civil war between the iran-aligned houthi group and president abd-rabbu mansour hadi s saudi-backed government to strengthen its position in the impoverished country .
aqap operates in several provinces in southern and eastern yemen , including in abyan , shabwa and al-bayda .
