this is a shocking story that shines a bright light on obama and his regime s willingness to give terrorists who kill americans special treatment sgt .
1st class christopher speer was killed by a grenade tossed by 15-year-old omar khadr in 2002.khadr was sentenced to 40 years , but because we have a traitorous administration running the country , the radical jihadist was released after only serving eight.omar khadr is now free.from john s. roberts at young cons : a terrorist is now free after serving only eight years of a 40-year sentence for killing a u.s. delta force medic in afghanistan in 2002 , thanks to a deal the obama administration made with canadian authorities.sgt .
lane morris , who served alongside speer and who lost an eye in the attack , told fox news host greta van susteren that the terrorist s release all started with the obama administration in a deal made behind the prosecutor s back .
khadr served one [ year ] in guantanamo , and one in canada , he added.khadr and six of his companions wanted to go out in a blaze of glory , morris said , and started lobbing grenades at the americans .
in addition to speer , the terrorists also killed two afghan interpreters.the times reported : the canadian government asserted that the terms of khadr s release from guantanamo bay detention facility barred the court from granting him bail , that he is a risk to the public and that doing so could be diplomatically damaging , npr reported.terrorism expert max abrahms of northeastern university told fox that officials should not be surprised if khadr ultimately turns towards terrorism again.eight years for killing a delta force medic ! his fellow platoon-mate reacted on greta : the way the obama white house treats our military men and women is beyond reprehensible.khadr deserves to serve life , and whoever sentenced him to 40 years in the first place was out of their mind.what do they think khadr will become now that he s a free man ?
will he join back up with his radical buddies , or will he transform into a stay at home father who shuttles his kid to soccer practice ? this is wrong , and the gop candidate who wins in 2016 needs to make sure our service members are treated with the utmost respect.what this says to the world more importantly , to americans is that sensitivity towards islam is valued above the lives of those who serve our country.again , obama makes us look weak to our enemies.via : washington times
