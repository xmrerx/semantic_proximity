dublin ( reuters ) - it is not yet clear if britain and the european union can agree on written assurances to avoid a hard northern ireland border by a monday deadline , irish foreign minister simon coveney said on sunday .
but he said he was hopeful a meeting between british prime minister theresa may and european council president donald tusk on monday would lead to a deal in time for a dec. 14-15 eu summit .
that would allow britain to move on to talks on its future trading relations with the bloc .
avoiding a so-called hard border on the island of ireland is the last major hurdle before talks begin on the future trade relationship and a two-year brexit transition .
tusk said he had asked may to put a final offer on the table by monday , but coveney suggested agreement on the wording of written reassurances may come later .
the hope is that those [ monday ] meetings will result in a momentum that can be carried into the leaders summit the week after ... and can allow this brexit negotiation process to open up to phase two of discussions , coveney told rte radio .
asked if he expected an agreed text of written british assurances on the issue monday morning , coveney said : let s not run before we can walk here .
obviously , we would like that to be the case .
the irish cabinet is to meet at 0900 gmt on monday and give prime minister leo varadkar a mandate to make a decision on the border issue .
that may or may not be on the back of an agreed wording .
that remains to be seen over the next number of hours , coveney said .
ireland is not asking the british government to do the impossible and provide a detailed plan border will work , but rather for clear principles for the second phase of talks to eliminate the possibility of a hard border .
what we have to make sure here is that we don t have an unintended consequence of the re-emergence of a [ hard ] border , he said .
we can t allow that and we won t allow that .
