paris ( reuters ) - french president emmanuel macron is hosting dozens of world leaders along with global companies and movie superstars at a summit in paris to accelerate efforts to combat climate change .
the one planet summit will not announce internationally binding commitments , but is counting on mobilizing money from public and private financial institutions and from corporations .
below are some key pledges made around the summit .
* more than 200 institutional investors with $ 26 trillion in assets under management said they would step up pressure on the world s biggest corporate greenhouse gas emitters to fight climate change .
they said that would be more effective than threatening to pull the plug on their investments in such firms .
divestment would only be a last resort .
if big emitters refuse to cooperate , shareholders could ratchet up pressure with public statements , resolutions and votes .
* the european commission is looking positively at plans to lower capital requirements for environmentally friendly investments by banks in a bid to boost the green economy and counter climate change .
the move could be part of a broader set of measures the european union plans to present in march to meet the target of cutting carbon emissions by 40 percent by 2030 , for which it estimates around 180 billion euros ( $ 212.2 billion ) in additional low-carbon investments are needed per year .
* the world bank said it will no longer finance upstream oil and gas projects after 2019 , apart from certain gas projects in the poorest countries in exceptional circumstances .
as a global multilateral development institution , the world bank said it is continuing to transform its own operations in recognition of a rapidly changing world .
* belgium will issue its first bond for use in financing projects to reduce the country s carbon emissions , following a number of countries that have sold or plan to sell green bonds .
poland became the first a year ago , followed by france with a 7 billion euro issue in january .
belgium plans to sell 3 to 5 billion euros ( $ 3.5-6 billion ) in the first quarter of 2018 .
* dutch bank ing ( inga.as ) said that by end 2025 it will stop funding any utility that relies on coal for more than 5 percent of its energy .
it will support new clients whose reliance on coal is less than 10 percent as long as they have a strategy in place to cut that to close to zero by 2025 .
ing also will phase out lending to individual coal-fired power plants by then .
* french insurer axa ( axaf.pa ) will quadruple investments in environmentally friendly projects , adding 9 billion euros ( $ 10.6 billion ) by 2020 , and divest further from the coal industry .
axa will target firms deriving more than 30 percent of their revenue from coal .
it also will not insure any new coal mines or oil sands projects , including associated pipeline businesses .
* french state-owned power utility edf ( edf.pa ) plans a big push into solar energy in france that is likely to cost around 25 billion euros .
edf aims to build 30 gigawatt of solar capacity by 2035 in response to a government drive for a massive deployment of renewables .
* french gas and power utility engie ( engie.pa ) is prepared to invest 1 billion euros ( $ 1.2 billion ) to improve energy efficiency in france over the next five years , its ceo said ahead of the paris summit .
engie says energy efficiency contracts already make up 700 million euros of its operating income and that this is likely to increase fourfold by 2026 .
