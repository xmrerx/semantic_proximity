athens ( reuters ) - cyprus on wednesday said it would try to help defuse a crisis in neighboring lebanon after prime minister saad al-hariri made an unexpected stopover on the island on tuesday night .
cyprus announced the move shortly after hariri shelved a decision to resign at the request of lebanon s president michel aoun , easing an impasse that had stirred tensions around the middle east .
hariri met cypriot president nicos anastasiades at larnaca airport for about 45 minutes late on tuesday on his way back to lebanon , his first visit home since he unexpectedly announced on nov. 4 he would resign in a broadcast from saudi arabia .
our common objective is stability in lebanon , stability in our area .
within this context ... the president of the republic will undertake some initiatives precisely to promote this objective ; stability in lebanon , cypriot government spokesman nikos christodoulides said .
christodoulides said anastasiades s initiatives would be directed toward european union and neighboring states , but was not more specific .
cyprus is uniquely placed , as a member state of the european union which also maintains excellent relations with all its neighbors .
that ( position ) is broadly recognized and would allow us to work to achieve stability in lebanon , he said .
the island , perched on the edge of the middle east , is broadly considered a neutral safe haven in an otherwise volatile region .
it took in thousands of lebanese fleeing civil war in the 1970s and successfully mediated an end to a 39-day siege of the church of the nativity in bethlehem between israeli forces and suspected palestinian militants .
on tuesday anastasiades received an invitation to visit saudi arabia , christodoulides said .
it was not immediately clear if it was connected to the crisis , though cypriot government officials told reuters the visit had been planned for some time .
