ramallah , west bank ( reuters ) - palestinians switched off christmas lights at jesus traditional birthplace in bethlehem on wednesday night in protest at u.s. president donald trump s decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital .
a christmas tree adorned with lights outside bethlehem s church of the nativity , where christians believe jesus was born , and another in ramallah , next to the burial site of former palestinian leader yasser arafat , were plunged into darkness .
the christmas tree was switched off on the order of the mayor today in protest at trump s decision , said fady ghattas , bethlehem s municipal media officer .
he said it was unclear whether the illuminations would be turned on again before the main christmas festivities .
in a speech in washington , trump said he had decided to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital and move the u.s. embassy to the city .
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said trump s move marked the beginning of a new approach to the israeli-palestinian conflict and said it was an historic landmark .
arabs and muslims across the middle east condemned the u.s. decision , calling it an incendiary move in a volatile region and the european union and united nations also voiced alarm at the possible repercussions for any chances of reviving israeli-palestinian peacemaking .
