The most corrupt Attorney General in the history of the United States is allegedly thinking of throwing his hat into the ring as a Democrat contender in the 2020 Presidential race.
What better way to invigorate crooked Democrats than to call on the very people who had his back at the DOJ to keep attacking President Trump?Former Attorney General Eric Holder spoke in Los Angeles last week to promote a bill that some observers say would make California a sanctuary state, an appearance that he says is the start of a new phase of his career in which he plans to reenter the world of politics.
Up to now, I have been more behind-the-scenes, Holder told Yahoo News in a new interview published Tuesday, describing his plans.
But that s about to change.
Holder, who served as former President Barack Obama s first attorney general, indicated that his goal is to head the legal resistance to President Donald Trump s agenda.
But that may just be the tip of the iceberg.Three sources who have spoken to Holder and are familiar with his thinking told Yahoo that he may consider challenging Trump in 2020 for the White House.
Now is the time to be more visible, Holder said.
Now is the time to be heard.
Holder made his voice heard on Twitter yesterday, as he called on the DOJ and FBI to keep up their attacks on President Trump:To the career men & women at DOJ/FBI: your actions and integrity will be unfairly questioned.
Be prepared, be strong.
Duty.
Honor.
Country.

Stealing 1,000,000 American Homes Immediately after the housing collapse of 2007 and the economic collapse of 2008, America s largest mortgage lenders began criminally foreclosing on hundreds of thousands of American families without cause and using robo-signing machines .
Most didn t even have mortgages, much less with those banks.
Sheriff s across the country removed a half million American families at gun point for no legitimate reason, only because banks had fraudulently filed foreclosure papers.
The number of victims was so large, the DoJ cut off new claimants in 2012 when the number of properties stolen by six Wall Street banks hit 750,000.
Since then, hundreds of thousands more families have been refused any justice or reimbursement at all by AG Holder.
And for the 750,000 families the Justice Dept sued the banks for and settled with, the banks were ordered to pay each family an average of $2,000 each $2,000 as total reimbursement for a $100,000 home criminally stolen, and all the furniture and possessions inside when the bank and police forced the families into the street.
The settlement negotiated by the Justice Dept also bars the victims from ever suing the banks to get their money back.

The bank s law firm at the time was Covington & Burlington.
Both AG Holder and Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer were recent employees of that firm.

After ABC News broke the story, one outlet described the criminal accusations against Senators Reid and Lee as, a massive crime ring that involves gambling, bribery, kickbacks and influence peddling.
