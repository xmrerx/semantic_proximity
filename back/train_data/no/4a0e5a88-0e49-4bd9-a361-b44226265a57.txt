berlin ( reuters ) - german chancellor angela merkel has urged hungary to quickly implement a ruling by the european union s top court that member states must take in a share of refugees who reach the continent .
in its ruling last week , the court dismissed complaints by slovakia and hungary over the mandatory quotas introduced in 2015 to relocate asylum seekers from greece and italy .
hungarian prime minister viktor orban said on friday his government would not change its anti-immigration stance .
in an interview with berliner zeitung newspaper to be published on tuesday , merkel insisted that hungary had to implement the court ruling .
it s unacceptable that a government says a ruling of the european court of justice does not interest them , merkel said , according to a preview published by the daily late on monday .
asked whether this meant that hungary had to leave the eu , merkel said : this means that a very fundamental question of europe is being touched because for me , europe is an area of the rule of law .
we will have to talk about this at the european council in october .
during the mediterranean migrant crisis of 2015 , hundreds of thousand of refugees arrived in the balkans , italy and greece .
that prompted the eu to impose mandatory quotas on its member countries for relocating asylum seekers .
the flow of migrants has since receded , easing pressure to force compliance on nationalist leaders like orban , who is benefiting domestically from his tough anti-immigrant policies as elections approach in 2018 .
merkel told another newspaper in an interview published over the weekend that she was optimistic that a dispute over how to distribute asylum seekers in the eu would soon be resolved .
the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung ( f.a.s . )
newspaper also reported that in negotiations between member states about redistribution , a compromise was starting to emerge that would link accepting refugees to payments from the eu .
