Republicans clearly just have absolutely no shame anymore.
It s already been discovered that the image tweeted out by Donald Trump featuring Hillary Clinton next to a Star of David on top of a pile of money was originally created by white supremacists, but that s not stopping Trump, nor RNC chair Reince Priebus from lying through their teeth.Appearing on CNN with Wolf Blitzer, Priebus is parroting Trump s effort of claiming that the star was just a random star pulled out of Microsoft Paint by their campaign staff when creating the image.
That it s some sort of sheriff s star even though it doesn t have the globes on the points, and looks exactly like the Star of David.Priebus seems to completely ignore the fact that it s been revealed the original image came from white supremacists, and instead touts the line after claiming the star came from Microsoft: They figured it out, and they fixed it.
Which they did, they turned the star into a circle, but it doesn t negate the fact that the original image is from racists, and both Priebus and Trump are lying to cover their own asses.Republicans need to learn to own their mistakes and apologize.
It s really that simple.
Lying to cover things up just makes them look even worse.Watch Priebus lies through his teeth here:RNC chair on Trump s star tweet: They figured it out, and they fixed it https://t.co/nyY5wUhZ5M https://t.co/Dvl0QOo52m CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) July 5, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
