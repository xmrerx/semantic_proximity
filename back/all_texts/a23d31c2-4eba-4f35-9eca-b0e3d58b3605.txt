The Trump administration has finally, definitively, admitted that President Obama personally warned Donald Trump about hiring Michael Flynn within 48 hours of the election .The conversation occurred during the 90-minute sitdown the former President and the guy who was kinda-sorta elected by a minority of the population (and Russia) and against the wishes of most Americans.A senior Obama official tells NBC that the President, who actually fired the disgraced Trump foreign policy advisor in 2014, made it very clear that he is not a fan of Michael Flynn.
NBC reports:According to all three former officials, Obama warned Trump against hiring Flynn.
The Obama administration fired Flynn in 2014 from his position as head of the Defense Intelligence Agency, largely because of mismanagement and temperament issues.Obama s warning pre-dated the concerns inside the government about Flynn s contacts with the Russian ambassador, one of the officials said.
Obama passed along a general caution that he believed Flynn was not suitable for such a high level post, the official added.Two administration officials said Obama also warned Trump to stay vigilant on North Korea.One official says that Trump thought the remark was made in jest, according to NBC.Recently, Trump attempted to blame President Obama for his failure to vet Flynn.
General Flynn was given the highest security clearance by the Obama Administration but the Fake News seldom likes talking about that, The Donald tweeted Monday as Sally Yates was preparing to testify.But in fact, it was his team not Obama s who failed to vet the former General.
When Flynn was fired, for example, he had not even completed a CIA background check.NEW: Flynn never received broader security clearance needed to serve as Natl Security Advisor before his firing.
