ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey s parliament voted on Saturday to extend by a year a mandate authorizing the deployment of Turkish troops in Iraq and Syria, two days before a planned independence referendum in northern Iraq s Kurdish region.
Turkey said earlier it would take security, political and economic steps in response to the referendum, which President Tayyip Erdogan s spokesman said was a terrible mistake that will trigger new crises in the region .
