the us supreme court is set to decide the first major abortion case in nearly 10 years as well as critical decisions on immigration , affirmative action and voting rights .
will the republican party have the spine to stand up to these reprobates and demand that we wait until after the election to appoint a new us supreme court justice ?
senate majority leader mitch mcconnell said saturday that the senate should wait until a new president is elected to confirm a replacement for justice antonin scalia , whose sudden death saturday shook washington and threatened to reshape the 2016 presidential race.democrats said that with 11 months left in mr. obama s tenure , the senate has enough time and indeed an obligation to confirm a replacement .
the american people should have a voice in the selection of their next supreme court justice .
therefore , this vacancy should not be filled until we have a new president , the kentucky republican said in a statement.news of scalia s death was just hours old before the debate heated up.with the court now divided between four republican-appointed justices and four democratic picks , mr. obama would have a chance to tilt the bench decidedly to the left , and liberal lawmakers said he should have that chance.via : washington times
