It s not an exaggeration to say that Donald Trump has Narcissistic Personality Disorder.
He has pretty much every characteristic to classify him as such:Sorry, not pretty much every characteristic absolutely every characteristic.So, when Trump tweeted out that he won the last presidential debate, one where Hillary Clinton clearly wiped the floor with his haystack of hair, this only confirmed his delusional thinking.Trump tweeted out: The results are in on the final debate and it is almost unanimous, I WON!
Thank you, these are very exciting times.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 21, 2016Knowing that this is an utter fallacy, yet still not making a big deal of it, Hillary Clinton opted for responding with humor.Hillary s simple, yet very accurate and hilarious response?
Where was this kind of comedy last night?

However, reality will slap him in the face on November 8th when he loses, and in his own words, loses big league.
