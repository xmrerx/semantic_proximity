washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. senate voted on thursday to bolster travel security in the wake of the brussels attacks with measures that include doubling the number of transportation security teams with bomb-sniffing dogs at domestic airports and other transit hubs .
lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to add security measures to a separate bill that calls for renewing the programs of the federal aviation administration through september 2017 .
the faa bill is expected to come up for a final vote later this month .
after republicans and democrats reached a deal on security measures earlier in the day , lawmakers voted to raise the number of visible intermodal prevention response , or viper , teams within the transportation security administration from 31 to 60 .
viper teams , which are intended as a visible deterrent to attacks , can be deployed at airports and train or bus stations .
other measures would bolster the vetting of airport employees , add security to vulnerable check-in and baggage claim areas and authorize the tsa to donate security equipment to foreign airports with direct flights to the united states .
the approved provisions would also order a new u.s. assessment of foreign cargo security programs and provide grant money to train state , local and foreign authorities in how to respond to mass-casualty and “ active shooter ” incidents .
it is unclear what kind of reception the faa bill , if passed by the senate , might receive in the house of representatives .
house lawmakers have been considering their own faa legislation .
that bill also calls for the privatization of the u.s. air traffic control system , a measure that is not in the senate ’ s legislation .
