This is an epic rant that will enrage Trump supporters, and it needed to be said.Republican strategist Rick Wilson is not a fan of Donald Trump.
He s a real Republican who takes Russian interference in our political process seriously.And on Thursday, he absolutely ripped Trump and his supporters a new one for continuing to defend Russia even as evidence piles up proving that Vladimir Putin helped Trump win.
In fact, the CIA and 17 other intelligence agencies agree that Russia interfered with the 2016 Election.
But Trump and his supporters hate facts, which Wilson hit them with in force.1/ In the course of the 2016 campaign I don t know how many times I was called a traitor to America for not supporting Trump.
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) December 30, 20162/ Of course, these intellectual giants never bothered to understand the specific definition of treason.
All opposition to Trump was treason Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) December 30, 20163/ What s closer to treason?
Political opposition to a candidate, or siding with a hostile foreign power in the Intel war?
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) December 30, 20164/ Make no mistake; Trump and his lackeys, ball-washers and toadies today clearly demonstrated their allegiance is to Putin.
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) December 30, 20165/ This wasn t Obama playing a game.
This was him responding to the IC s rising certainty and fury at the extent of Russia s meddling.
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) December 30, 20166/ Trump is getting sworn in.
He s going to be President.
If you are more concerned that his wittle feels are hurt that the truth of Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) December 30, 20167/ RUS intel services and leadership wanted Trump, hacked to help Trump, and have deep ties to him and his team then you re the ones Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) December 30, 20168/ flirting with disloyalty to the security of this country well beyond a political disagreement.
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) December 30, 20169/ You believe in absurd, baroque conspiracy horseshit like Pizzagate, but can t conceive RUS leaders could seek to disrupt an election?
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) December 30, 201610/ You buy into the wildest, darkest, lunatic theories ( Hillary is a pedophile cannibal! )
but ignore the conclusions of the ENTIRE IC.
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) December 30, 201611/ You re accepting an ongoing, state-sponsored set of attacks on Americans, American institutions and American security because Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) December 30, 201612/ you don t want Trump s presidency to have an asterisk next to it, like a ball player with a home run count fueled by steroids and HGH Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) December 30, 201613/ Tough.
It s already there.
So here s my question for Trump defenders; how much RUS intervention in our elections is ok with you?
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) December 30, 2016Trump supporters just got chewed out for willingly being Putin s puppets.
The only reason they are defending Russia is because their guy benefited from their meddling.
If Hillary Clinton had won with Russia s help, Trump supporters would be singing a completely different tune.
They would calling for endless investigations, urging trials for treason, and threatening Russia with war.Trump and his supporters are total hypocrites and they should shamed for life for surrendering the sovereignty of the United States and the integrity of our elections to a foreign power.Featured Image: Zach Gibson/Getty Images
