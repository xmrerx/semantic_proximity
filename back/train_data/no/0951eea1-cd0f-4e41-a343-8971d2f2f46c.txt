bucharest ( reuters ) - romania s leftist government named a new defense minister in a mini-reshuffle on tuesday , to handle a multi-billion-dollar plan to modernize its military to nato standards .
the staunch washington ally has promised to spend 2 percent of its gross domestic product on defense every year for the next nine years , and boost u.s.-backed defenses that have riled russia .
the ruling social democrats ( psd ) said economy minister mihai fifor , 47 , will replace adrian tutuianu who quit last week after his office said it could not pay defense staff wages in full , only to be contradicted hours later by the finance ministry .
this is a key position .
fifor is a responsible person , he has the advantage of being an economy minister and closely working with the defense ministry on military industry , psd leader liviu dragnea told reporters .
dragnea said the economy portfolio would go to psd lawmaker gheorghe simon .
nato member romania hosts a u.s. ballistic missile defense station and has sent thousands of troops to operations in iraq and afghanistan .
among the first steps in its military expansion is the purchase of $ 1.25 billion of mobile artillery rocket systems , with lockheed martin as prime contractor , a plan endorsed by the u.s. state department last month .
russia has said it sees the u.s.-backed missile defense system in romania and other european countries as a threat and a ploy to neutralize its nuclear arsenal .
