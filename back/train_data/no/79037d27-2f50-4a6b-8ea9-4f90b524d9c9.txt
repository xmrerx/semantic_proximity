chuck holton ( @ rangerholton ) january 22 , 2017you know , because a mochaccino is a brown chocolate color and president obama s skin color is brown.seriously , president obama left the white house two days ago but conservatives are still making racist remarks about him.holton , who pathetically only has 413 followers on twitter , got torched by a couple twitter users .

( @ nativemanley ) january 23 , 2017but holton just doesn t post his racism on twitter .
he posts his sexism there as well.for example , here are some of his attacks on the women s march.women spent more than $ 150 million attending a march and accomplished nothing .
liberalism in a nutshell .
