Hollywood stars took to social media Wednesday to express outrage over President Donald Trump s announcement that transgender people will not be allowed to serve in the U.S. military, reversing former President Obama s decision last year allowing them to do so.
After consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military, President Trump tweeted Wednesday morning.
Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical cost and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.
Thank you.

Who better to speak out on behalf of transgenders than a pedophile, Hillary-loving Hollywood lib?Hey trans teens: this man does not represent the overwhelming love, support and pride waiting for you when you step out into the world.
