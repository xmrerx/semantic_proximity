If you thought Richard Nixon was bad, just wait till Donald Trump gets in office.On a scale of 1-10, prominent Nixon expert Rick Perlstein rated Trump an 11 on just how Nixonian he is during an interview on MSNBC.Trump s obsession with revenge, his pettiness, his constant lying, and his desire to shut down the press paint a picture of a petulant child that goes beyond the personality displayed by the 37th President.In fact, Perlstein sees a lot of Nixon in Trump, but Trump is more outlandish and transparently authoritarian.
Nixon was very shrewd and tactical, sedulous, careful he wouldn t have been tweeting he would have been saying, Let s take away the Washington Post s broadcast licenses that they rely on for their revenue, which, you know, Trump may be doing soon when he is granted the power of the executive office, Perlstein warned.Indeed, Trump is poised to change the relationship between the White House and the press from one of cordiality and mutual benefit to one of antagonism and open hostility.Trump s refusal to accept facts makes him even more of a threat because he will now have the power to punish news outlets who write the truth about him.Host Christ Hayes pointed out that unlike Trump, Nixon had some self-control.
Nixon would not have taken to the podium and said, I don t like this person, this person and Dan Rather; he was self-controlled enough to channel that!
This is different insofar as this is all out there in public.
Perlstein then explained how Trump may attack people who criticize him once he takes control of the full power of the government, including the NSA, which he could use as his personal spying apparatus.
Basically once Trump can find out anything enemies are up to and find out where their vulnerabilities are, maybe find embarrassing things about them leak them to Breitbart and soon it s, you know, on CNN, God forbid MSNBC, then we re talking about a different ballgame.
Hayes noted that such behavior by a president is ultimately what led to Nixon losing the trust of the American people and being forced to resign or face impeachment.Perlstein then warned that Trump could use the IRS to attack people and businesses who have slighted him and seek lists of names in departments so he can cut them off at the knees, which is something his transition team is already doing.Here s the video via YouTube.But even if Trump commits these impeachable offenses, Republicans in Congress don t care about the Constitution enough to actually do something about it.
They see Trump as the puppet to pursue their destructive agenda.
And they ll look the other way as long as he remains a useful idiot.Featured image via screenshot
