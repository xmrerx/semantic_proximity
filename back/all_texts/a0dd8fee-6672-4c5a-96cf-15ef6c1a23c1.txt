SEOUL (Reuters) - The spokesman for the front runner in South Korea’s upcoming presidential election said on Friday that the deployment of the U.S. THAAD anti-missile defense system should be “immediately suspended” and await a decision by the next government.
“As stressed again, the issue of THAAD deployment should be handed over to the next (South Korean) government,” Youn Kwan-suk, a spokesman for Moon Jae-in, said in a statement responding to U.S. President Donald Trump’s remarks during an interview with Reuters that South Korea should pay for the system.
