As if Donald Trump s disastrous press conference on Thursday wasn t enough to mark the closing of his first historically unpopular month in the White House, the moronic man-baby just had to continue his crusade to dismantle the U.S. Constitution into Friday.On Friday afternoon, Trump kicked off the weekend by attacking the FAKE NEWS media (naming a few networks in particular) and stating that America s free press (protected under the Constitution) is the enemy of the American people.
Trump had already gone too far in his insanity-filled press conference, and this tweet definitely solidified any suspicions that he s deranged, batsh*t crazy and not even connected to reality anymore.Trump s tweet deserves all the backlash in the world, and fortunately America is responding.
Trump s disgusting, anti-American Twitter tantrum has been bashed by everyday citizens and journalists alike, with several prominent media members adding their voices to the opposition and resistance to this erratic dictator.On Friday s MTP Daily, host Chuck Todd reacted to Trump s tweet and brilliantly nailed him for it.
He opened the segment by stating: I don t believe any American is the enemy of any other American.
For several minutes, Todd eviscerated Trump for treating his presidency like a circus and for trying to create distrust of the media.
In his rant, Todd stated that many of the uncomfortable issues facing this president are being lost in the distractions he creates.
Todd then listed these issues one by one, passionately stating that the president s problems aren t a media fabrication .Taking a big swipe at Trump s belligerent behavior and his incompetent team (which has recently had some VERY serious issues of its own), Todd opened the discussion to his panel and quipped, Press Secretary Donald Trump did his job, didn t he?
