Donald Trump s recent talk of a rigged election is dangerous, as it undermines the trust of Americans in the electoral process.
There has been bipartisan condemnation of his continuing to poison the minds of his brainwashed supporters.
Elected officials and leadership on both sides of the political aisle have expressed confidence in the election results, and some have even gone on television to explain the process in great detail, to show just how impossible it is to rig a national level election.
There seems to be one Trump supporter, though, who isn t being as forceful with regards to pushing back against this narrative: Republican National Committee Chair Reince Priebus.Priebus seems to be the only member of the GOP leadership who is closely helping the Trump campaign these days, and he seems to be afraid to anger Trump.
On CBS s Face the Nation on Sunday, Priebus said to host John Dickerson with regards to Trump s willingness to concede if he loses: He s saying he wants to reserve all options, and if there is grounds for a recount, I will exercise my options.
He is not willing to not concede if he loses and there s no fraud.
Dickerson reminded Priebus that Trump had told his supporters that fraud is the only way he could possibly lose Pennsylvania.
Instead of taking the usual line that voter fraud is not widespread, Priebus said: That s not where we re at.
Losing by 100 votes is one thing.
Losing by 100,000 is another thing.
Sure, there have been contested elections, but that is not what Trump has been saying to his rabid base of supporters.
He has instead been telling them that there is a vast conspiracy, a huge, sweeping, nationwide effort to make sure he doesn t win.
Party leaders like Priebus, whether they are in Trump s camp or not, have a responsibility to put a lid on this dangerous rhetoric.
Instead, Priebus is giving shameful responses to something that could cause many, many problems indeed.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
