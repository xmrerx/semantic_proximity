She s just like one of you Ha!
Hillary Clinton breaks out the very phony Southern accent during a speech in Memphis.
This always cracks me up because I m from the South and we can spot a phony a mile away.
Pandering to her base is what Clinton does best.
Just like Obama, she plays to the crowd she s speaking to by adopting their accent or acting like she s just one of them.
This folksy style is cringe inducing for anyone with half a brain but she IS speaking to a group of Democrats soooooo
