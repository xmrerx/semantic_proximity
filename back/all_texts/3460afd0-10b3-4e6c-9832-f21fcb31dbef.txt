On Saturday night, Donald Trump once again casually threatened nuclear war against the country of North Korea.
The last time he did that, he came back with an arguably weak package of sanctions, which penalized only individuals doing business with the dictatorship.
This time, Snowflake Trump was triggered by North Korea s Foreign Minister speaking at the UN.Ri Yong Ho told the assembly that the week s exchange of insults between Trump and his apparent arch-nemesis Kim Jong Un made our rocket s visit to the entire US mainland inevitable all the more, apparently threatening to aim North Korean missiles directly at the United States.
