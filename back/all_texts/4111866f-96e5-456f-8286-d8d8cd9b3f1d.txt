Donald Trump just had his narcissistic ass handed to him on Twitter for taking credit for something that he had absolutely nothing to do with.Christmas came and went and the holiday season helped boost the economy as it usually does, especially since President Obama saved it after the recession Republicans caused.
Consumer confidence also rose again.But even though Trump is not even in office yet, he is still patting himself on the back and taking complete credit for the good economic news.
In fact, he is yelling about it.The U.S. Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points to 113.7, THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 15 YEARS!
Thanks Donald!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016That s right.
Trump literally just thanked himself on Twitter for something he didn t have anything to do with.
And Twitter users were there to put his ego in check.
@realDonaldTrump Did you seriously just thank yourself in a tweet from your own Twitter account?

Sad!

@realDonaldTrump You should thank Obama, too: Consumer Confidence Index, January 2009: 37.7 Consumer Confidence Index, October 2016: 100.8 Simon Hedlin (@simonhedlin) December 28, 2016@simonhedlin @realDonaldTrump Dude is talking to himself in the third person.
Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) December 28, 2016@realDonaldTrump did you just thank yourself for something you had nothing to do with?
In the 3rd person?

Taking credit for something that you did not contribute to.

pic.twitter.com/7GMrCRXcDb This Is Not Normal (@NetworkJunkyz) December 28, 2016As the above graph shows, consumer confidence has risen dramatically since Obama took office.
Unemployment fell to 5 percent and he presided over the longest streak of monthly job growth in our nation s history as well as a record Dow Jones performance.Most importantly, President Obama is still the president, therefore, he and his economic policies get the credit, NOT Trump.Donald Trump continues to stoop to new lows.
It won t be long before he tries to take credit for everything President Obama did during his presidency.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images
