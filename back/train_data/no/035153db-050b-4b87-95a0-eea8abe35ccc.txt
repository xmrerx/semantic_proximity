nairobi ( reuters ) - kenya s opposition leader raila odinga said on sunday that his coalition will not share power , two days after the supreme court annulled last month s presidential election and ordered a new poll within 60 days .
the court ruled on friday that the election board had committed irregularities that rendered the aug. 8 vote invalid , and overturned incumbent president uhuru kenyatta s victory .
the ruling set up a new race between kenyatta , 55 , and veteran opponent odinga , 72 , and tension between the two camps has since been rising .
we will not share power , odinga said , speaking in kiswahili outside a church in nairobi .
we will not divide the loaf , he said , a local reference to power .
odinga , who also contested the presidential election in 2007 and 2013 , repeated his statement after friday s court ruling that the opposition would not participate in the re-run of the poll without changes to the election commission .
on friday he had called for the commission to resign and face criminal prosecution .
speaking at a rally in nairobi attended by thousands of his supporters , he said : we have said that you can not force kenyans to go to the polls that ( are ) being supervised by thieves .
we will not accept ( this ) , he said .
we will only go to the elections when we are sure that the ones organizing the elections are people who will not side with one side or the other .
kenyatta insists the poll should be re-run with the current electoral board .
though kenyatta pledged to respect the court s ruling he has , since friday , referred to justices as crooks .
