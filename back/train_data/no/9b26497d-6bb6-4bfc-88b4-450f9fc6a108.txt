after last week s g-20 meeting , where donald trump was more pariah than world leader , he tweeted a video compilation from the meeting .
the amateurish editing isn t even the story , though .
it was all set to the most gawdawful , dictatorial sounding music you ve ever heard.the video shows several brief clips of a sour-faced trump during the g-20 and the soundtrack was a group singing make america great again in a way that would make most high school choir directors cringe .
hell , it should make most americans cringe .
kim jong-un might be taking notes.make america great again !

the creep factor didn t get by twitter.oh , and thanks first baptist dallas for this dreadful song .
