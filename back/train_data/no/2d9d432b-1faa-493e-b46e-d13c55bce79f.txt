this is another twist and turn in the mega scandal that is all hillary s mess .
the interesting thing about this e-mail discovery is that philippe reines had been battling with reporters in march via e-mail regarding guilt or innocence in this e-mail scandal : a key member of democratic presidential front-runner hillary clinton s team sent several angry emails to a group of journalists on tuesday night .
the messages criticized a source for being a lying liar and what the aide described as a reporter s cockamamie theory .
fast forward to this new development : state department officials have uncovered thousands of emails between philippe reines , a top hillary clinton aide , and members of the media , they previously said did not exist.in a court filing last thursday , the state department estimated that a recent search turned up more than 81,000 emails from reines s official account while at the state department .
and 17,855 potentially fall within a freedom of information act ( foia ) lawsuit filed by gawker earlier this year.that is a reversal from 2013 , when the state department said a thorough search turned up no responsive records for gawker s request .
in 2012 , gawker requested all emails between reines and reporters from 34 media outlets.the state department did not explain the reversal in the court document , nor did it return a request for comment.it will begin releasing a tranche of reines s emails by the end of september.after it was revealed earlier this year that clinton , and potentially some of her aides , used personal email accounts for official business , gawker sued the state department over its initial request for communications between reines and reporters.via : the hill
