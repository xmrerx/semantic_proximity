edinburgh ( reuters ) - scotland s first minister nicola sturgeon has sought confirmation from prime minister theresa may that britain is urgently seeking a transition agreement with the european union before the end of the year .
sturgeon , who heads the devolved government , said in a letter to may she was increasingly concerned that brexit talks would end in no deal and see britain crash out , following contradictory indications from uk government officials earlier this week .
the clarity of your intentions , and thus the confidence of business that there will be a sensible transition period agreed quickly , has been seriously undermined , she wrote .
this relates in particular to your comments suggesting no transition can be agreed , or formalized , until there is agreement on the future relationship ( with the eu ) .
the uk government said on wednesday it wants an agreement of the outline of transitional arrangements in early 2018 , and that it expects such an agreement to be quickly and easily reached .
asked about sturgeon s letter , a spokesman for may said : we will respond in due course .
uncertainty around formalizing a transition period ahead of agreement on britain s future relationship with the eu was causing confusion and damaging business confidence , sturgeon argued .
she said she was seeking confirmation that the prime minister was urgently seeking agreement on a transition arrangement of at least two years , with the aim of securing that agreement by the end of this year .
