Being a pro-Trump pundit must be a tough racket right now.
Between his lies, his ignorance and his bungling of nearly everything he touches, it takes a special kind of person to defend #45.Well, former Reaganite Jeffrey Lord has his work cut out for him, but he went completely out on a limb Wednesday when he called Trump the Martin Luther King of healthcare.
One of the panelists on CNN Thursday morning happened to be African-American commentator Symone Sanders.
As you can imagine, things did not go well for Lord.In a segment discussing the president s plans for Obamacare, Lord called Trump the Martin Luther King of health care.
Sanders interjected with an Oh Jeffrey, but Lord went on, When I was a kid, President Kennedy did not want to introduce the Civil Rights bill because he said it wasn t popular, he didn t have the votes for it.
Dr. King kept putting people in the streets in harm s way to put the pressure on.
That s when Sanders stepped in to quash his metaphor:Okay Jeffrey.
You do understand that Dr. King was marching for Civil Rights because people that looked like me were being beaten?
Dogs were being sicced on them?
Basic human rights were being withheld from these people merely because of the color of their skin?
So let s not equate Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. a humanitarian, a Nobel Peace Prize winner to the vagina-grabbing President Donald Trump.Source: NY MagazineHere s the video:Posting without comment.

In fact, they love to say that King was a Republican.
He certainly wasn t then, and now that the Republican party has become the neo-confederate party, there s no way in hell.Featured image via video screen capture
