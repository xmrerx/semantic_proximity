Officials in Wisconsin are preparing to conduct a full statewide recount of the votes from the 2016 election after a request was filed by Jill Stein and she s pledged to file for recounts in Michigan and Pennsylvania, too.
The initial vote totals counted in three precincts in Wisconsin is a problem.
Michigan had to revise its vote totals as well.
The Clinton campaign has decided to get behind Jill Stein s efforts which now focus on three battleground states.Donald Trump said the election would be rigged and suddenly, Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway disagrees.
Conway spoke with Bloomberg and called the Clinton campaign sore loser and part of a ridiculous effort.
What a pack of sore losers, Conway said in a statement.
After asking Mr. Trump and his team a million times on the trail, Will HE accept the election results?
it turns out Team Hillary and their new BFF Jill Stein can t accept reality.
Rather than adhere to the tradition of graciously conceding and wishing the winner well, they ve opted to waste millions of dollars and dismiss the democratic process.
The people have spoken.
Time to listen up.
#YesYourPresident, Conway said.Trump, too, addressed the recount, saying, The people have spoken and the election is over, and as Hillary Clinton herself said on election night, in addition to her conceding by congratulating me, We must accept this result and then look to the future.
He also called it a scam.
This is a scam by the Green Party for an election that has already been conceded, and the results of this election should be respected instead of being challenged and abused, which is exactly what Jill Stein is doing, Trump added.If Trump was elected legitimately, then he should have no problem with a recount.
As for scams, he knows a lot about that subject.
Projection is his forte.Hillary now leads the popular vote by 2.2 million and that number is expected to increase.Photo by Kevin Hagen via Getty.
