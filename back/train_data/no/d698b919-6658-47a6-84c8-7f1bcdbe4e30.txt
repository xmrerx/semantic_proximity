new york ( reuters ) - ted cruz - be careful who you mess with .
never shy in defense of their city , new yorkers came out swinging - via social and traditional media - on friday after the texas republican ’ s comments about “ new york values ” during a presidential debate .
cruz ’ s remarks , aimed as a put-down of campaign rival donald trump during thursday evening ’ s sour-toned republican debate , sparked a backlash from city and upstate dwellers , politicians and ordinary citizens alike .
james smith , husband of moira smith , a new york police officer who was killed on 9/11 , wrote in a facebook post : “ i invite you to come to the national 9-11 memorial and museum and see for yourself , and perhaps learn something about , the values of new yorkers and the heroes who defended american values on september 11th , 2001. ” one theme emerged in particular as new yorkers piled in : the idea that the senator may be less fastidious when it comes to financing his campaign to be his party ’ s nominee for the november presidential election .
“ i ’ m sure ted cruz was very negative about new york money , ” new york governor andrew cuomo told ny1 anchor pat kiernan , calling on cruz to apologize to all new yorkers .
“ i ’ m sure he ’ s not going to accept any money from any new yorker .
i ’ m sure if he has , he ’ s going to return all of those contributions , ” said cuomo , a democrat .
cruz , top challenger to front-runner trump in the republican race , has lately been denouncing “ new york values ” to try to connect the real estate mogul to the city ’ s liberalism and to reinforce his own standing as a conservative .
during thursday evening ’ s debate , cruz said on the values issue , “ and listen , there are many , many wonderful , wonderful working men and women in the state of new york .
but everyone understands that the values in new york city are socially liberal or pro-abortion or pro-gay-marriage , focus around money and the media. ” trump responded with an emotional tribute to the resilience his home city showed in response to the sept. 11 , 2001 , attacks .
according to twitter inc ( twtr.n ) data , that exchange between cruz and trump was the second-most tweeted moment during the debate .
among tweets shared on friday was the cover of the new york daily news , which curtly told cruz : “ drop dead , ted. ” michael bruno ( @ mikejbruno ) tweeted on friday : “ @ tedcruz you , sir , wouldn ’ t last 2 minutes in new york .
we don ’ t take kindly to people like you .
and that ’ s our # newyorkvalues. ” nicholas dyer ( @ nicholasddyer ) , who identifies himself as a comedy central producer on twitter , said : “ @ tedcruz is the kind of guy who takes his family to the times square applebee ’ s for dinner .
# newyorkvalues. ” he was referring scathingly to a chain restaurant that is normally filled with tourists from out of town .
“ my # newyorkvalues : tolerance , eccentricity , sleaze , pizza , bagels , dancing , not making eye contact , ” tweeted lindsay goldwert ( @ lindsaygoldwert ) .
many on twitter perceived cruz as having targeted the city ’ s jewish and gay communities .
zack ford ( @ zackford ) , the lgbt editor at the progressive blog think progress , tweeted , “ so ... # newyorkvalues ... do you just pick a state you know you probably won ’ t win and belittle everyone from it ? ” he added , “ cruz knows trump ’ s not jewish , right ? ” cameron gray ( @ cameron_gray ) said , “ as a jewish conservative born in brooklyn , i proudly have # newyorkvalues .
some local businesses piggybacked the theme to advertise .
drama book shop , a theater book store in midtown manhattan , tweeted : “ the # dramabookshop is proud to have had # newyorkvalues for 99 years. ” others sought to distinguish the politics of the city , which is liberal and overwhelmingly votes democratic in presidential elections , from the rest of the state .
josephine ( @ notmyname02 ) said on twitter , “ unshackle upstate new york .
we have nothing to do with new york city values .
we have mid-west values .
# newyorkvalues. ” to be sure , some thought the backlash against cruz was not warranted .
wesley23 ( @ 50th_president ) tweeted : “ i still think people are overreacting to # tedcruz and his # newyorkvalues line .
he clearly meant it was a blue ( democratic ) state ( and ) not very conservative. ” it appeared that neither cruz nor trump may have benefited from the exchange .
overall , conversations about the republican candidates during the debate were negative on social media , according to analytics firm zoomph .
