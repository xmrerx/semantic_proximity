If you ever wondered what racist conservatives would like to eat for breakfast, Twitter has the answer.White nationalist website Breitbart is throwing a hissy fit because Kellogg s pulled advertising from the site to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren t aligned with our values as set forth in our advertising guidelines.
In other words, the cereal maker does not want their company associated with a racist sexist publication that spews hateful right-wing propaganda.And they can t be blamed for that.
After all, companies like Kellogg s want to sell their products to as diverse a consumer base as possible and giving a racist company like Breitbart adverting dollars only alienates.So Breitbart decided to get revenge by declaring war on Kellogg s and calling for a boycott.
You know, because conservative boycotts always work.Yeah, that was sarcasm.
In reality, conservative boycotts rarely work.
In fact, they are usually mocked relentlessly and humiliated.
Breitbart definitely learned that overnight because Twitter users started a new hashtag and #BreitbartCereals has been trending ever since.The Fascist Monster cereals: Count Trumpula and Boo Bannon #BreitbartCereals Carlos Pecciotto (@EEgreenbunny) December 1, 2016Hooded Bunches of Oafs #BreitbartCereals Adam Stillman (@Stillyman11) December 1, 2016Children of the Corn Flakes#BreitbartCereals pic.twitter.com/i1RYbOOvBB Christian Greco (@Jolly_Esquire) December 1, 2016Chex (and Balances are Gone) #BreitbartCereals Portmanteau Jones (@SadlyCatless) December 1, 2016#BreitbartCereals Frosted Fake News Michael K.

So good, the Nazis will kick your door down for them!#BreitbartCereals pic.twitter.com/0918g8A7Wo Nathan Ralph (@thenateralph) December 1, 2016Breitbart is literally trying to bully Kellogg s out of business simply because the company disagrees with them.
Kellogg s decision to blacklist one of the largest conservative media outlets in America is economic censorship of mainstream conservative political discourse, Breitbart whined.
That is as un-American as it gets.
Except that it s not un-American at all.
Just like Breitbart is exercising their right to be total dicks, Kellogg s is exercising their right to not associate with them.
It s called the free market.Despite being humiliated, conservatives are already crowing because Kellogg s stock price coincidentally dropped after Breitbart called for a boycott.
So those of us who hate racists should go out and support Kellogg s by buying their cereal and other products to make sure Kellogg s is rewarded for rejecting hate.
Because if Breitbart is allowed to successfully bully Kellogg s into supporting them, they ll do it to other companies who also do the right thing.Featured image via Twitter
