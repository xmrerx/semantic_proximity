berlin ( reuters ) - the german government is considering adding turkey to a list of countries that pose high security risks for intelligence agents , police officers and military officials , the sueddeutsche zeitung newspaper and two broadcasters reported late on tuesday .
the reports come amid heightened tensions between the two nato partners and vows by german officials to restrict arms sales to turkey , in a move that ankara said would hurt their joint fight against islamic state .
the newspaper and wdr and ndr broadcasters quoted a spokesman for the interior ministry as saying that the list was currently being reviewed .
as part of this process , the interior ministry is examining whether to add turkey to the list , the spokesman was quoted as saying .
the list now includes china , russia , pakistan , north korea and 26 other countries .
germany s interior ministry , contacted by reuters , was not immediately available to comment .
some german intelligence agencies argued for viewing turkey less as a partner than an enemy and called for expanding intelligence surveillance of turkey s activities in the fight against islamist groups , the media outlets said .
some agencies had also warned employees in recent months about the risks of traveling to turkey and cautioned others not to travel there on vacation , they said .
german officials have been enraged by turkey s arrest of around a dozen german citizens , including the german-turkish journalist deniz yucel , who has been held for over 200 days .
