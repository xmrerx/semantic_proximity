Dr. Harold Bornstein has been practicing medicine for decades, but it wasn t until Donald Trump released a special note written by him that he actually became known around the country.
The note, which raved about Trump s health, was full of typos and unprofessional language, earning criticism from the medical community and the media.To try to clear a few things up, CNN tried to interview Bornstein outside his office, but that interview came to an abrupt spot when the eccentric doctor s wife intervened and went totally nuts.
Before the interview was cut short, CNN s Drew Griffin had been asking Bornstein about his reaction to all the backlash the infamous Trump note has gotten, and tried to get some clarity on whether or not the doctor had actually written the note in five minutes, as previously suggested.
Noting that many in the medical community were saying Bornstein was a lunatic, Griffin grilled Bornstein about the note, which read if elected, Mr. Trump will be the healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.
Really, it sounds like Trump wrote the note himself.
Bornstein responded: Well, a lunatic doesn t have my credentials.
The only thing I wanted to do in my life is practice with my father, which I managed to do for 35 years.
Griffin pressed Bornstein about the unprofessional language when describing Trump s health as astonishingly excellent something that had raised a lot of red flags amongst analysts.
Bornstein began to get uncomfortable and say he was rushed for time and had people to see.
CNN was allowed to continue the interview in the hallway to save Bornstein time (they weren t allowed inside because Bornstein said his wife would be furious if she caught him conducted the interview).
It was only a few moments before Bornstein s wife found out what was happening, flipped out and threatened to call the police on the network.You can watch the scene unfold below:Featured image via screenshot
