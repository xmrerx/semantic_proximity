Donald Trump just played coy and hinted that if he manages to defeat Hillary Clinton and is elected, he might decide not to serve as President of the United States after all.During an interview with The New York Times, the presumptive Republican nominee was asked about a hypothetical scenario in which he wins the election but then decides not to take office.
I ll let you know how I feel about it after it happens, Trump replied.The newspaper was probably correct when they wrote that it is entirely possible that Mr. Trump is playing coy to earn more news coverage.
However, it is interesting to ponder nonetheless.Many wondered if the reality tv star turned presidential hopeful was really a serious competitor for the presidency when he began his campaign.
Somehow, Trump successfully beat out all the other GOP candidates to become the last man standing and the nominee of the Republican party.
I ve actually done very well, Trump said.
We beat 18 people, right?
When told about The Donald s comment on whether he d serve if elected president, Stuart Stevens, a senior adviser to Mitt Romney in 2012, said Trump is a con man who is shocked his con hasn t been called.
He has no sense of how to govern, Stevens said.
He can t even put together a campaign.
Roger Stone, a long-time strong Trump supporter and one of his loudest cheerleaders, said Trump would certainly serve if elected.
I m fairly certain about that.
You think he d resign?
I don t see that happening, he said.
There is only one star in the Donald Trump show, and that s Donald Trump.
Sean Spicer, a spokesman for the Republican National Convention, said the notion that Trump would decide not to serve after winning the election was downright silly.
He s in it to win it, Spicer said.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
