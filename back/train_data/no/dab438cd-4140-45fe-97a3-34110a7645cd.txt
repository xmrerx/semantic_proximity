* * * warning * * * this video is very disturbing ! try to imagine this brave man who voluntarily enlisted in our us military , traveled halfway around the world to afghanistan where he risked his life to defend our nation against some of the most evil people on the planet , only to come home to some of the most evil people in america shouting , f * ck off nazi scum !
in his face .
the saddest part of this video is watching the afghanistan veteran actually attempt to have dialogue with these anti-american jack-asses , who are likely only there to collect a paycheck from george soros.the crime of attending the free-speech rally in and of itself , was enough to anger these anti-americans , but the moment this veteran admitted to supporting president trump , the angry alt-left crowd began to come unhinged .
would this video of an afghanistan veteran , who appears to be all by himself in a large group of violent , soros funded antifa thugs , be splashed all over every network in america if he was verbally assaulted by this group of masked cowards for defending barack obama during his presidency ?
if we didn t know better , we d almost think there was a double standard in america.antifa assembled at the entry point of the free speech rally .

president trump was correct to not defend these antifa thugs , who ve been laying low in their parent s basements after they got pummeled by conservatives who fought back against their attacks in california .
