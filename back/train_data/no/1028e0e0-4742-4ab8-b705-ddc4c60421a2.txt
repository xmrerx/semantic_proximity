joel pollack has been with breitbart news through the years of obama and beyond so he knows this is a war .
it s so much more that statues he gets it and it s great to know steve bannon will be back in the trenches with pollack.interesting @ msnbc segment with @ alivelshi and @ joelpollak https : //t.co/cd011s0wvn ben jacobs ( @ bencjacobs ) august 18 , 2017joel pollack : hashtag war has been our motto since the days of andrew breitbart .
and we use it whenever we go to war against our three main targets which are , in order- hollywood and the mainstream media , number one the democratic party and institutional left , number two and the republican establishment in washington , number three our mission remains the same as it has been before trump , as it was after he was elected and as it will continue to be .
great debate that we wish would happen more often many of the comments from both sides said that this was fantastic because both sides were given a chance to speak .
