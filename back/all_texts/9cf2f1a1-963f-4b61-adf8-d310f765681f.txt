According to Fox News A federal grand jury on Friday indicted 13 Russians and three Russian companies for allegedly interfering in the 2016 presidential election, in a case brought by Special Counsel Robert Mueller that detailed a sophisticated plot to wage information warfare against the U.S.The Russian nationals are accused of setting a strategic goal to sow discord in the U.S. political system, including the 2016 presidential election.
The indictment the first filed against Russian nationals as part of Mueller s probe effectively returns focus to the meddling activities out of Russia in the run-up to the 2016 election, following a string of charges relating to the actions of Trump associates.Further, the DOJ made clear that the indictment does not allege that any of the interference changed the outcome of the presidential race.
There is no allegation in this indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity.
There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election, Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who oversees the special counsel probe, said at a Friday press conference.President Trump reacted to the indictments by seizing on Rosenstein s comment that the election results were not impacted by the Russians activity.
Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President, Trump tweeted.
The results of the election were not impacted.
The Trump campaign did nothing wrong no collusion!
