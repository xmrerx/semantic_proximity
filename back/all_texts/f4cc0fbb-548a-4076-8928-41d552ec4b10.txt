Bernie Sanders is on fire, especially after this weekend s resounding victories in Washington, Alaska, and Hawaii, which have propelled the Democratic presidential hopeful s campaign to unprecedented momentum as the Democratic primary moves forward.
Speaking in front of a crowd of thousands in Wisconsin on Saturday, Sanders said: Let me begin by thanking the people of Alaska for giving us a resounding victory tonight.
We are making significant inroads in Secretary Clinton s lead and we have with your support coming here to Wisconsin, we have a path toward victory.
Alright, are you ready for a news alert?
We just won the state of Washington.
The crowd then erupted.
Now, there s a new ad that celebrates those weekend victories with Bernie dancing to the tune of the song The bird is the word, which plays off of the bird that landed on a podium earlier in the week while Sanders was speaking in Portland, Oregon, hence the new nickname Birdie Sanders.
The ad highlights the landslide victories in Washington and Alaska on Saturday, and Idaho and Utah earlier in the week.The victories are quite impressive because of the sheer number of voters who overwhelmingly supported Sanders.
In Idaho, he won with 78% of the vote.
While in Utah he received 79%, Alaska 81%, Washington 72%, and Hawaii with 70%.The Sanders campaign definitely seems to be gaining momentum towards the possibility getting the Democratic nomination.
It will be interesting to see how this may help him going forward through upcoming primaries.Watch video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOgd3kmaosc]Featured image via video screenshot.
