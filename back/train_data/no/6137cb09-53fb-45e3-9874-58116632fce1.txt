sydney ( reuters ) - australia s prime minister malcolm turnbull on sunday said he would discuss north korea and islamist terrorism as threats to regional stability , ahead of his arrival at an east asia leaders summit in the philippines .
north korea was a criminal regime and the single largest threat to the region , turnbull told a televised news conference in hong kong .
they are very cunning operators , he said , urging a tightening of economic sanctions .
islamist terrorism in the southern philippines is the other key security issue turnbull aims to discuss with philippine president rodrigo duterte in manila .
australia said in september it would send troops to train philippines armed forces engaged in a 154-day battle with islamic state fighters in the southern city of marawi , in the country s biggest security crisis in decades .
turnbull stressed the importance of help by indonesian president joko widodo in defusing islamist extremism as the leader of the world s largest muslim-majority country , which is also a democracy .
he speaks with great authority when he says islam is compatible with democracy and moderation , turnbull added .
he s a powerful voice for moderation in the region .
australia s embattled prime minister will attend the high-powered regional summit at the same time as a citizenship crisis at home has destroyed the parliamentary majority of his ruling center-right coalition .
the constitution bars dual nationals from parliament , and turnbull s government was thrown into disarray last month by a high court ruling that five parliamentarians , including his deputy , barnaby joyce , were ineligible to be lawmakers .
the resignation of another mp on saturday has left turnbull as the head of a minority government , with his position guaranteed only by the votes of two independents .
turnbull said he expects joyce to be returned to parliament following a dec. 2 by-election .
