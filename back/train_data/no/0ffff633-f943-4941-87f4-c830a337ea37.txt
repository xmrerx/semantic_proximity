according to pastor darrell reid , he was cleaning his gun inside the home he shared with his wife of 35 years on monday , when the gun accidentally went off , shooting her in the head.reid s wife , katie , was rushed to apopka hospital , where she was pronounced dead a short time later.according to the christian post , the couple met when they were 12 years old .
they ran a church called happy hill ministries out of their home , located in zellwood , florida.it appears that the couple s outward appearance of happiness wasn t quite the reality.wkmg reports that police were called to the pastor s home on 23 separate occasions over the past three years.reid was arrested multiple times for violent crimes .
according to wkmg , the pastor was most recently charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon , but the charge was never prosecuted .
he was also charged with resisting a police officer with violence in 2012 .
that charge was also never prosecuted.wkmg reports : a close family friend who didn t want to be identified told news 6 the couple had a violent relationship.reid s attorney , on the other hand , told the orlando sentinel that the couple seemed very close , noting that they always came to court together .
a neighbor said that while he couldn t imagine that reid intentionally killed his wife , he also has a hard time understanding how you can accidentally shoot someone while cleaning a gun.judging from his criminal background , reid was someone who should never have been allowed to posses a gun .
police had been called to the couple s home almost two dozen times .
he was charged with multiple violent crimes , yet his status as a white , christian minister no doubt helped him walk away from those crimes unpunished , time and time again.according to the website smartgunlaws.org : florida law does not explicitly authorize or require the removal or surrender of firearms at the scene of a domestic violence incident.police are currently investigating the accidental shooting death of 62-year-old katie reid.in the meantime , darrell reid remains free and likely in possession of a gun.featured image via happy hill ministries
