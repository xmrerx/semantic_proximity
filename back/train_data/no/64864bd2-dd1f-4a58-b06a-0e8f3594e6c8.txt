barack and michelle good riddance ! columbia university president lee bollinger told students at a convocation on monday to get excited , because president barack obama was on his way as was first lady michelle obama .
not immediately , though students would have to wait until after he finished his term in 2017.bollinger didn t explain exactly what the obamas might be doing at columbia , but he definitely set the gossip train in motion ; the columbia spectator jokes that he might be getting ready to be upstaged by amal , [ transfer ] to vastly inferior princeton , or wait in a miles-long line at duane reade ; [ regret ] giving all these people healthcare .
in april , the new york post was already speculating that obama might return to columbia , where he graduated from in 1983 , to teach at the law school .
before becoming president , obama taught law at the university of chicago , where his presidential library will be built .
however , when the location of the presidential library was announced , his foundation said it also intends to maintain a presence at columbia university .
bollinger said at the time , we look forward to hosting the foundation on our campus and take great pride in being part of the post-presidency of our alumnus .
