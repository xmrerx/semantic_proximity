Throughout the course of the election, the mainstream media and major news outlets were remarkably soft on Donald Trump, and gave him as much free air time as he wanted to tout his racism, misogyny and outright fallacies.And while no one who is part of major news networks wants to call out Donald Trump for what he s doing, Teen Vogue actually seems to be the ones stepping up.What did Teen Vogue just write: Donald Trump is gas lighting America and deliberately undermining the very foundation of our freedom.
Donald Trump is gas lighting America and deliberately undermining the very foundation of our freedom https://t.co/M00m2yjuly by @laurenduca pic.twitter.com/TE8Ekr9Vdr Teen Vogue (@TeenVogue) December 10, 2016And if you re unaware was gas lighting is, it s when you are psychologically manipulated to such an extent that it actually makes you question your own sanity.
This is exactly what Trump has been doing since the start of his campaign, or hell sooner, and Teen Vogue is absolutely correct.In their article they write: To gas light is to psychologically manipulate a person to the point where they question their own sanity, and that s precisely what Trump is doing to this country.
He gained traction in the election by swearing off the lies of politicians, while constantly contradicting himself, often without bothering to conceal the conflicts within his own sound bites.
He lied to us over and over again, then took all accusations of his falsehoods and spun them into evidence of bias.
With this perfect next line: At the hands of Trump, facts have become interchangeable with opinions, blinding us into arguing amongst ourselves, as our very reality is called into question.
Meanwhile Trump has been able to manipulate himself into the Oval Office.
So, while all the talking heads on every cable channel are arguing amongst themselves, the safety and security of not only the nation, but the entire world, is very much at stake.Good of Teen Vogue for being so brutally honest and accurate.
Well done.Read the whole article HERE.Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
