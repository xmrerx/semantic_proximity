Donald Trump really should have just apologized or kept his mouth shut.On Tuesday, Trump told a crowd in North Carolina that the only way to stop Hillary Clinton from nominating judges to the Supreme Court is for Second Amendment nuts to gun her down.
Hillary wants to abolish, essentially abolish, the Second Amendment, Trump said.
By the way, and if she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do, folks.
Although the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don t know.
The remark was bad enough that even the Secret Service was forced to respond, which is totally unprecedented.Trump has since been roundly criticized for the remarks but actually took to Twitter to do some serious spinning, going so far as to claim that he said something else entirely.Media desperate to distract from Clinton s anti-2A stance.
I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 10, 2016But that is not what Trump said and Twitter users were not about to let the Republican nominee get away with such bullshit revisionism.

@realDonaldTrump Excuse me, Mr. Trump, I think you dropped this #TrumpWhistle #uspoli #cdnpoli #TrumpPence16 pic.twitter.com/uNNb5U7i4r Fake Ezzie (@fakeezralevant) August 10, 2016The bottom line is that Donald Trump called for shooting Hillary Clinton and that s a felony that should result in his arrest.
Republicans should be ashamed of themselves for making this guy the leader of their party.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
