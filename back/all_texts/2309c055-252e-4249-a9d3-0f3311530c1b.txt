After a voter asked a question at the second presidential debate regarding Obamacare, Anderson Cooper was forced to interrupt Donald Trump to remind him it was Hillary Clinton s turn to respond first.
Of course, the debate was going so well for Clinton by that point that she just wanted to sit back, relax, and let him talk.
If he wants to start, he can start, Clinto said, failing to mask the mirthful tone hiding underneath her normally serious demeanor.
No, go ahead, Trump, who had just finished defending his comments about grabbing women by their wherevers.
No, go ahead Donald, she replied.
No, I m a gentleman, Hillary, go ahead.
The audience, of course, could not contain themselves as the entire room erupted in laughter at Trump s gentleman claim.Trump, of course, habitually insults women with whom he disagrees, making fun of their looks, their faces, and their weight rather than addressing actual issues and, yes, it is completely laughable to think that he could possibly be considered a gentleman.Trump himself said it best when he was asked about whether or not he is a gentleman on Howard Stern: I can t say that.
