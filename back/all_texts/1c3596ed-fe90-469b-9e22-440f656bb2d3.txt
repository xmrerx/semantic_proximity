MADRID (Reuters) - The detention of Catalan activists on Monday, the first imprisonment of senior secessionist figures since the region s Oct. 1 banned referendum on independence, was a judicial, not a political, matter, Spain s justice minister said on Tuesday.
On Monday, the court ordered that the heads of the pro-independence groups Catalan National Assembly (ANC) and Omnium be held without bail pending an investigation for alleged sedition.
These are not political prisoners because yesterday s prison ruling was due to a crime (that was committed), Justice Minister Rafael Catala said at an event in Madrid.
