wake me when it s over !
what the heck people !
we have all out brawls at political rallies for donald trump where the leftists are trying their best to stop free speech and freedom to gather and support their candidate for president.a rally in virginia today got overheated when a time magazine photographer grabbed a secret service agent by the throat .
can you believe this ?
the reporter says , f * ck you , to the secret service agent and that s where it started : here s moments prior .

we even have the candidates talking about the size of one candidate s penis .
