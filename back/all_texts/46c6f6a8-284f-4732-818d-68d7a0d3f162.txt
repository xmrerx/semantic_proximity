Today we were excited to have @FLOTUS visit our girls group home in Lake Worth.Thank you for taking the time to listen & talk with the girls pic.twitter.com/v0OqECxqDa HomeSafe (@HomeSafeFla) April 14, 2017Here is an excerpt from the HomeSafeFL press release:Home Safe s description of their agency on Twitter: HomeSafe is preparing children and families for safer, more productive lives through child abuse and domestic violence prevention and intervention programs.The media s decision to ignore this story only proves they really don t care much about the plight of women or of young girls, what they care about is destroying the enemy.
The media s transparent hate for anything Trump has forced them to show their cards, and as a result the mainstream media will likely never be trusted again by Americans who once bought everything they were being told hook, line and sinker.
