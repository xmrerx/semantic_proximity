WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump plans to finalize a new order limiting travel to the United States in the coming days, his vice president said on Wednesday, after federal courts blocked the administration’s earlier travel ban.
A White House source had previously said the new order was likely to be announced on Wednesday.
More than two dozen lawsuits were filed in U.S. courts against the Jan. 27 travel ban, which temporarily barred entry to the United States for people from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen, as well as halting the U.S. refugee program.
The ban was suspended by the 9th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals, ruling in a case brought by Washington state.
The Trump administration then said it would produce a new order.
“They’re putting out the finishing touches on that executive order.
It should be out in the next few days,” Vice President Mike Pence told CBS program “This Morning.” The original order triggered chaos at airports as people, including legal residents known as green card holders, were temporarily blocked from entering the country and federal agencies tried to interpret the new guidelines.
The administration has said it is likely the new directive will exclude legal permanent residents, making it harder for opponents to challenge the ban.
Pence did not elaborate on the revised directive.
The Associated Press, citing unidentified U.S. officials, reported late on Tuesday that the new order will remove Iraq from the list of countries whose citizens face a temporary travel ban.
