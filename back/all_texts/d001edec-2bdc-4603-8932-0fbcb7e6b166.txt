We are way past any further discussion or debate.
Scientists are as sure that humans are causing climate change as they are that cigarette smoke causes lung cancer.
So unless you want to debate that point, don t debate about climate change any longer because it is our moral responsibility to act.
That responsibility right now is crystal clear and that is why we have taken action.
