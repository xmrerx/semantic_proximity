After a really bad week for Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, where he was destroyed endlessly by speaker after speaker at the Democratic National Convention, including by the Muslim parents of a fallen soldier, it would seem desperate times called for desperate measures.You may have noticed that the New York Post released photos of Melania Trump where she is posing nude, and even with other girls.
Shocking, right?
No, not really, considering this was Melania s former career, and her husband has always embraced it to the point of gloating.Here are the covers:Today's cover: Melania Trump like you've never seen her before https://t.co/wkoDGWTF9g pic.twitter.com/V375rBTUEw New York Post (@nypost) July 31, 2016Today's cover: Melania Trump's girl-on-girl photo shoot revealed https://t.co/QUEjkxZnXg pic.twitter.com/38p82c0MiM New York Post (@nypost) August 1, 2016So, the question can be asked, why now?
And as to not sound like a complete conspiracy theorist, let s look at all the evidence and connect the dots which doesn t take terribly long.Those dots can probably be reduced even more so, because it doesn t take a genius to figure it all out.
So, don t fall for it.
It s clear media manipulation at its finest and it s working gloriously.
Let s not let it.Focus on the fact that Trump is a racist, misogynistic egomaniac who will attack women, Muslims, Latinos, and now Gold Star families all while never admitting he s wrong.
Focus on the fact that he d rather have you looking at his beautiful wife in the nude, and then feign outrage to get you to come back on his side.
Focus on the fact that he has absolutely none of the experience necessary to be President of the United States.
DO NOT focus on distraction tactics.Featured image via Twitter
