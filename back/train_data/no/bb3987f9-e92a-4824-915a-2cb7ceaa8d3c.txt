islamabad ( reuters ) - unidentified kidnappers bundled the deputy governor of afghanistan s northwestern province of kunar into a car in the pakistani city of peshawar and took him away , police sources said on sunday .
mohammad nabi ahmadi had crossed over from afghanistan into pakistan with his brother and was walking down a road in the northwestern city of peshawar when a car with tinted windows pulled up and overpowered the afghan official , according to a peshawar police source .
the police source said ahmadi s brother recounted the episode to pakistani police , but did not disclose that his brother was a high-ranking afghan provincial government official .
it was afterwards we came to know from other sources that he was deputy governor of kunar , said the police official .
abdul ghani musamem , the spokesman for the governor of kunar , confirmed ahmadi had gone missing in peshawar on friday and added that he had been on leave for medical treatment .
wealthy afghans frequently cross the border for medical treatment in pakistan .
many afghans live in peshawar and it is also common for influential figures in afghanistan to have business or family links in the pashtun regions of pakistan .
the pakistani police source said the afghan government had not told them about ahmadi s visit , adding that otherwise we would have provided him with security .
another security official said police in peshawar were working to find out if ahmadi s kidnapping was related to his work or a personal dispute .
the afghan taliban denied involvement in ahmadi s kidnapping .
we heard that a deputy afghan governor went missing in pakistan but let me clarify that we don t operate outside afghanistan , said taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid .
in pakistan , our leadership has strictly forbidden our people from any sort of activities as this is not our policy .
