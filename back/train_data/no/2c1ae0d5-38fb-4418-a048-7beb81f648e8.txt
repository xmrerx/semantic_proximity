manila ( reuters ) - at least 26 people were killed while several residents were missing in an island province in central philippines after tropical storm kai-tak brought heavy rains that triggered landslides , local authorities and media said on sunday .
kai-tak cut power supplies in many areas , forced the cancellation of several flights , stranded more than 15,000 people in various ports in the region and prompted nearly 88,000 people to seek shelter in evacuation centers .
the provincial disaster risk reduction and management office of biliran island said 26 residents had died , but the national disaster risk reduction and management council ( ndrrmc ) has yet to make any official announcement about fatalities .
biliran governor gerardo espina jr confirmed the deaths in an interview with dzmm radio , with 23 people still missing , he said .
we received reports of three deaths coming from the dilg ( department of the interior and local government ) but these are for confirmation , said ndrrmc spokeswoman romina marasigan .
we are still trying to check the others .
many areas were flooded , damaging crops and infrastructure .
kai-tak has weakened to a tropical depression after barrelling through the eastern region of visayas on saturday , hitting islands and coastal towns such as tacloban city where supertyphoon haiyan claimed 8,000 lives in 2013 .
locally known as urduja , kai-tak was packing winds of 55 kilometers ( 31 miles ) per hour with gusts of up to 80 km/h , according to a weather bureau bulletin issued at 2000 gmt .
