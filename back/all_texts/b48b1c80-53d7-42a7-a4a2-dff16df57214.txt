Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright weighed in on Donald Trump s remarks about what a brilliant leader he thinks Kim Jong Un is, including his comment that he would be ever so honored to meet with him.
Her take on the situation is that Trump needs to stay the hell away from the North Korean dictator.
Far, far away.
A president doesn t go to a country without any preparation, and honored would definitely be the wrong way to discuss somebody who is keeping his people in poverty and starving and control, Albright told CNN s Jake Tapper on Tuesday.Trump has repeatedly gushed about how much he loves various autocrats from around the world and recently he has been singing the praises of Kim Jong Un.
On Sunday, he said on CBS Face The Nation that the murderous leader was a smart cookie, you know, for killing off family members to stay in power and other fun stuff like that.
Then, on Monday, Trump told Bloomberg that he would be honored to meet with Kim Jong Un if the circumstances happened to be right.Albright slammed Trump for kissing up to dictators, especially the likes of Kim Jong Un.
I think that part of the issue is that President Trump seems to believe that he can have just one-on-one relationships.
And maybe that s possible in business, but that is not something that is possible as president of the United States, she said.
This is not a matter of charming, by saying you re honored and he s a smart cookie.'
The former secretary of state has spoken out against Trump and his piss poor excuse for foreign policy from the very beginning of his candidacy.
Tuesday s comments come amid rising tensions between the U.S. and North Korea over Pyongyang s weapons program.You can watch Albright s entire interview here:Featured image via video screen capture
