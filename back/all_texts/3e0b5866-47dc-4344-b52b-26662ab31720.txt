When thinking about this election, it s probably about the weirdest and craziest one that s happened in a long, long time.
Maybe ever.
However, just when you think it couldn t get weirder, something even more bizarre happens.While speaking at the Value Voters Summit this past Saturday, reality television personality Phil Robertson of the show Duck Dynasty declared that in order to really get God on their side, presumably that of washed up reality TV stars (himself and Donald Trump), then he s to baptize Trump.
Not only that but to also film it for all to see.
You know, because that s what God would want to make a mockery of a very spiritual and personal moment to try and get votes for a known bigot.Robertson said: Donald, don t miss this.
We need God on our side.
I m just trying to give him some encouraging words If you really want to see something wild, film it, Donald, film me baptizing you.
The left-wingers will literally go crazy and the evangelicals will swarm you like a mighty thrall because then we would know we have God on our side.
If you re one of those folks that needs to see something to believe it, here you go.Watch the video here via Right Wing Watch:Featured image via video screen capture
