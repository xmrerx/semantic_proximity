Kellyanne Conway may still be loyal to Donald Trump, but her husband seems far less impressed with our Tweeter-in-Chief.
On Monday morning, George Conway took to Twitter, Trump s favorite medium, to blast the president for his early morning tweets about his Muslim ban.On Saturday evening, Trump exploited the terrorist attacks in London to push for his Muslim ban.
Because who cares that this won t keep us safe and only adds fuel to the fire.We need to be smart, vigilant and tough.
We need the courts to give us back our rights.
We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 3, 2017Then on Monday, Trump really lost his sh*t over his travel ban that totally isn t a ban.
People, the lawyers and the courts can call it whatever they want, but I am calling it what we need and what it is, a TRAVEL BAN!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017The Justice Dept.
should have stayed with the original Travel Ban, not the watered down, politically correct version they submitted to S.C. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017The Justice Dept.
should ask for an expedited hearing of the watered down Travel Ban before the Supreme Court & seek much tougher version!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017In any event we are EXTREME VETTING people coming into the U.S. in order to help keep our country safe.
The courts are slow and political!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 5, 2017 These tweets may make some ppl feel better, but they certainly won t help [Trump s travel ban executive order] get 5 votes in SCOTUS, which is what actually matters, Conway wrote.
Sad.
