london ( reuters ) - myanmar is facing a defining moment and must stop the violence against its ethnic minority rohingya population , u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson said on thursday .
attacks by rohingya militants on security posts last month triggered an army operation that has killed more than 400 people , destroyed over 6,800 houses and sent nearly 400,000 rohingya muslims fleeing to bangladesh .
on a visit to london where he met british prime minister theresa may and foreign minister , boris johnson , he told a news conference : i think it is a defining moment in many ways for this new , emerging democracy .
he said he understood that myanmar s aung san suu kyi , a nobel prize laureate and de facto head of the government in myanmar , was in a power-sharing agreement with the military and the complex situation in which she found herself .
i think it is important that the global community speak out in support of what we all know the expectation is for the treatment of people regardless of their ethnicity , he added .
this violence must stop , this persecution must stop .
