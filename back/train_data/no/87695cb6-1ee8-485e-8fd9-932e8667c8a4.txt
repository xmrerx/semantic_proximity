berlin ( reuters ) - german prosecutors said on wednesday they were pressing perjury charges against frauke petry , former leader of the far-right alternative for germany ( afd ) , who last week quit the party and will sit in the national parliament as an independent lawmaker .
lorenz haase , senior public prosecutor in the eastern city of dresden , said it was unlikely the case against petry would proceed quickly as dresden s regional court would need to apply to lift her immunity as a member of the national parliament .
petry has been dogged by allegations that she lied under oath to a committee of the saxony parliament about how the party s campaign for the 2014 election in the state was financed .
she has denied the allegations .
in august the regional parliament of the state of saxony lifted petry s immunity from prosecution .
but now that she is due to take up her seat in the bundestag , the lower house of the german federal parliament , she will be granted immunity there .
a majority of lawmakers in the bundestag would have to vote to lift her immunity .
the first session of the lower house is expected to take place by oct. 24 at the latest .
petry , long considered the face of the anti-immigrant afd , had for months been on the losing side of a dispute between the party s warring wings .
she had advocated a more moderate course while others shifted further to the right and wanted the party to focus on a role in opposition rather than trying to govern .
some afd members have followed in petry s footsteps to quit the afd and she now plans to set up a new party .
the afd won 12.6 percent of the vote in the sept. 24 federal election , making it the first far-right party to enter the bundestag in more than half a century and the third largest parliamentary bloc .
