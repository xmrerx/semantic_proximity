beirut ( reuters ) - an air strike carried out by an unidentified warplane killed seven hezbollah fighters in eastern syria , three sources familiar with the incident told reuters on monday .
the identity of the warplane was not confirmed , but the sources did not rule out the possibility that it was russian friendly fire .
the sources did not say when the air strike happened .
the air strike struck a hezbollah position in eastern homs province , where the iran-backed lebanese group is fighting islamic state alongside the syrian and russian militaries .
asked about a report that a u.s. drone carried out the strike , the spokesman of the u.s.-led coalition said the location was outside its area of operations .
the coalition is also conducting air strikes in syria against islamic state in support of the syrian democratic forces , an alliance of arab and kurdish militias .
