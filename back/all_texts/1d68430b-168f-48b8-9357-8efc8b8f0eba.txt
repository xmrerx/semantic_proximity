Matt Forney has an awfully disturbing prediction for what might happen as a result of Republican nominee Donald Trump running for office, and it shows just how devastatingly stupid and delusional conservatives are.Forney is an alt-right radio host who recently predicted that there s going to be what he calls a white baby boom after the election is over, because apparently women are having sex dreams about Trump.
On Monday, Forney sent out a tweet that made fun of something Cosmopolitan writer Laura Beck had said when she explained that Trump s sexual assault allegations and lewd commentry about groping women had been impacting her sex life something that many women in America can relate to at this very moment.
On one hand, the thought of being touched by my husband, a man, after spending day upon never-ending day listening to Donald Trump s sexually assaultive language, is not a pleasant one.
On the other, we are both so obsessed with the election that our combined anxiety is killing our sex drives.
Forney decided to make the pain of American women a complete mockery when he said: I fully endorse shitlibs not having sex due to Trump, it makes them less likely to breed.
TwitterForney then followed that tweet up by saying that women were actually aroused by Trump s misogynistic campaign!
He wrote: [I]n my experience though, the majority of white women are having sex dreams about Trump, expect a white baby boom after he takes office.
TwitterFortunately, Twitter users were more than happy to jump on Forney and set him straight.TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTo suggest that women are actually INTO a disgusting man that has degraded, assaulted and insulted them over his entire lifetime is absolutely repulsive.
This election, every woman needs to get out and vote to shut this moron down!Featured image via Twitter and Scott Olson / Getty Images
