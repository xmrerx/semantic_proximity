Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are in a dead heat right now to win the Democratic presidential nomination.
This, of course, means attacks from both sides and not just from the candidates themselves.
It also means that their respective fans are at war.
However, there is a troubling faction among Sanders supporters: blatant misogynists.
This online phenomenon, with said fans being known as Bernie Bros, is troubling to anyone who abhors sexism of any and all kinds including Bernie Sanders himself.The senator sat down on Sunday with CNN s Jack Tapper on State of the Union, and, of course, Tapper wanted Sanders opinion on this particular part of his rabid fanbase.
When confronted about the misogyny, Sanders didn t hold back, and positively blasted his own fans .Tapper posed the question thusly: Have you heard about this phenomenon Bernie bros ?
People who support you, and sometimes attack in very crude and sexist ways?
Sanders responded swiftly, and with obvious disgust, saying that he s not down with what some of his so-called fans are up to on the interwebs: Yeah, I have heard about it.
It s disgusting.
We don t want that crap.
And we will do everything we can, and I think we have tried.
Look, anybody who is supporting me and is doing sexist things is we don t want them.
I don t want them.
That s not what this campaign is about.
Good on Bernie for calling out his own worst fans.
For someone who is largely seen as the underdog in this race, it was a risky and honorable thing to do.In short, no matter who you support, if you re a Democrat, progressive, liberal or, hell, even just someone with common sense who sees the danger of ushering in one of the GOP Clown Car candidates this November you ll call out the crap that is dividing the party of sense.Thanks, Bernie, for doing your part and keeping these bros in check.Watch the clip below:https://youtu.be/gCcgZjxEskYFeatured image from video screen capture via Raw Story
