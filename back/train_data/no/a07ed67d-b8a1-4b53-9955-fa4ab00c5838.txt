slowly but surely our nation will heal .
it will take some time , and there will those who resist , but america is stronger than the hate of a small group of radicals who under barack obama s direction , have worked to intentionally divide us.a waitress at a washington d.c. restaurant received a very generous tip and a warm message on her receipt from three men who were in town for president donald trump s inauguration.rosalynd harris , who works at busboys and poets in the northwest part of the nation s capital , told the washington post she was beaming with confidence monday after taking part in the women s march over the weekend.a group of men from west texas entered the restaurant and started to chat with harris .
one of the men , who said he was a dentist , complimented her on her smile .
harris , who is black , told the post she was admittedly a bit prejudice when the men , who were white , told her they were in town to support trump.however , harris didn t expect what would come next.after the men had left , harris picked up their check and found that they left a heartwarming message and a generous tip .
they left harris a $ 450 tip on a $ 72.60 bill .
their message read : we rise by lifting others .
a lovely act of kindness pic.twitter.com/s01sv3w8ts busboys and poets ( @ busboysandpoets ) january 24 , 2017 we may come from different cultures and may disagree on certain issues , but if everyone would share their smile and kindness like your beautiful smile , our country will come together as one people .
not race .
not gender .
just american .
god bless !
