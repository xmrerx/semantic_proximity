berlin ( reuters ) - any united nations peacekeepers sent to eastern ukraine must be granted access to the entirety of the region held by moscow-backed separatists , german chancellor angela merkel said .
russian president vladimir putin floated the idea of deploying u.n. troops to eastern ukraine in a monday call with merkel , suggesting that the u.n. mission could protect observers from the international osce monitoring mission .
with growing calls in germany for the lifting of european union sanctions against russia over its activities in ukraine , moscow has been keen to float proposals that would help soften export bans that have hit russians living standards .
i find president putin s proposal to send u.n. troops to protect osce observers interesting , she told the funke newspaper group on friday .
a few days ago i discussed with him that the u.n. troops must have access to everywhere where the osce is stationed , so the entire donetsk/luhansk region .
the conflict between ukrainian forces and russian-backed separatists has claimed more than 10,000 lives since it erupted in 2014 .
russia denies western accusations it fomented the conflict and provided arms and fighters .
the observers are there to monitor implementation of a peace deal agreed in minsk in 2015 , which has been largely unsuccessful in settling the conflict despite german and french urgings .
some german politicians have said sanctions should be lifted if the peace deal is implemented .
christian lindner , leader of the free democrats , a likely coalition partner for merkel after sept. 24 elections , even suggested germany must accept russia s occupation of ukraine s crimean peninsula .
merkel said putin s proposals were tender shoots of progress , which give no cause for softening sanctions so far .
she rejected lindner s proposal .
the annexation is against international law and must not be accepted , she said .
