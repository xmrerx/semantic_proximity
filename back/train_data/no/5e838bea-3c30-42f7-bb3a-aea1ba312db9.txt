ankara ( reuters ) - president tayyip erdogan said on friday that turkey needed to clear the afrin region of northwest syria of kurdish ypg militia fighters , who have been in the forefront of the battle there against islamic state insurgents .
erdogan , speaking in ankara to officials from the ruling ak party , also expressed disappointment with the united states , which backs the ypg .
ankara views the ypg as an extension of the outlawed kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) , which has fought a decades-long insurgency in turkey and is designated a terrorist group by turkey , the united states and european union .
we need to cleanse afrin of the structure there called the ypg terrorist organization , erdogan said .
turkey has long been angered at the united states support for the ypg and erdogan has repeatedly accused washington of violating the alliance between the two countries .
we are greatly disappointed by the united states not keeping its promises .
many issues that we could have resolved easily ... were pushed to a dead-end , he said .
turkey has expressed displeasure at the u.s. stance toward a deal between the ypg and islamic state under which hundreds of militants withdrew from the syrian city of raqqa before it fell to the syrian democratic forces .
erdogan has previously said that afrin would be on ankara s agenda after its current operation in syria s idlib province , where turkey and russia have set up observation points under a de-escalation deal agreed by ankara , moscow and tehran to ease the bloodshed in the six-year-old syrian conflict .
erdogan said considerable progress had been made in turkey s military operation in idlib due to the co-operation of the three powers .
russia and iran back syrian president bashar al-assad and turkey supports rebels opposing him , but all share a common foe in islamic state .
