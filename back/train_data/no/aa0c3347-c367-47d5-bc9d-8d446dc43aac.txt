seven years ago , this story would ve seemed like something from the onion ( a satirical publication ) .
unfortunately where barry sotoero , aka barack hussein obama is concerned , nothing is unbelievable , and truth seems to be stranger than fiction recently , a new foreign intelligence service ( svr ) report was released stating that one of the united states navy s top commanders was released from command after he sent out an email revealing that president barack obama was in the process of purchasing a multi-million dollar seaside villa in dubai.the report indicates that rear admiral rick williams , commander of the us navy s carrier strike group 15 , posted a query on january 8 to the naval institutes readiness kill chain .
it inquired why navy security and intelligence personal had been dispatched from a naval support facility in thurmont to an obama house hunting mission .
the message has since been deleted.as to the obama house hunting mission admiral williams was making his query about before being fired , this report continues , svr intelligence assests in the uae identified it as being a luxury seaside villa located in the palm jumeirah development of dubai being offered for sale at the price of $ 4.9 million ( 18 million united arab emirates dirham ) , and which a deposit on it was made this past week by the washington d.c. based global public affairs company podesta group .
important to note about the podesta group , this report notes , is that its leader is tony podesta , who aside from being one of the most powerful oligarchs in the us , is a close personal friend of president obama too.within 18 hours of posting the query , vice admiral noral tyson fired admiral williams on orders from president obama .
her action was reportedly due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command based on allegations of his misuse of government computer equipment .
to cover their tracks , the pentagon reportedly began releasing anonymous stories that admiral williams had been viewing pornography on his computer .
of course , this is an impossibility due to the us navy/marine corps intranet ( nmci ) , which blocks such sites .
