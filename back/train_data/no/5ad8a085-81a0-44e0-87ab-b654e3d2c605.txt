eric karjaluoto ( @ karj ) march 27 , 2016meanwhile , an assassinate donald trump page has been reposted on facebook .
the page s creator said that they don t personally plan to kill mr. trump , but they believe it should be done : assassinate donald trumpmarch 25 at 3:10pm i find it important to say for my own protection that i have no intention or interest in assassinating a presidential cacandidate .
