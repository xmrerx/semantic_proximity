warsaw ( reuters ) - the united states criticized a decision by poland s media regulator to slap a $ 415,000 fine on tvn , a u.s.-owned private broadcaster , saying the ruling appeared to undermine media freedom .
the broadcaster was fined by regulator krrit on monday over its coverage of protests in parliament last year .
this decision appears to undermine media freedom in poland , a close ally and fellow democracy .
free and independent media are essential to a strong democracy , the u.s. department of state said in a statement on tuesday .
it added that it remained confident in the ability of polish authorities to ensure democratic institutions were fully functioning and respected .
the regulator said it had fined the broadcaster s tvn24 channel for promoting illegal activities and encouraging behavior that threatens security , without giving details .
tvn24 is the most widely watched independent channel in poland , and critics on monday interpreted the fine as an effort to mute its criticism of the ruling law and justice ( pis ) party amid speculation the state may take the broadcaster over .
since taking office in late 2015 , the pis has been at loggerheads with the european union over policy , including placing the country s media under increased state control .
