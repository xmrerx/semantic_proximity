Republican presidential candidate and current Ohio governor John Kasich made strange remarks about sexual assault during a town hall event in New York.
Kasich echoed many conservatives and laid the blame on women for these crimes.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8FqEIgQMW0Asked about the risk of campus sexual assault during a Friday campaign event, Ohio Gov.
John Kasich (R) advised a female student not to go to parties where there s a lot of alcohol.
The Republican presidential candidate was hosting a town hall in Watertown, New York when a freshman student from St. Lawrence University asked how he would help her feel safer and more secure regarding sexual violence, harassment, and rape, according to ABC News.Simply going to a party where there s a lot of alcohol is not any kind of excuse for a woman being assaulted.
Yet conservatives, who repeatedly have denied that there is a rape culture on many college campuses, have regularly cited how women are dressed or what sort of parties they attend when addressing this vital issue.By comparison, the Obama administration launched the It s On Us initiative to highlight the role men have to play in stopping sexual assault on campus.
Vice President Joe Biden, who helped to author the Violence Against Women Act has often served as a spokesperson for the initiative.Despite the conservative pushback, progressive groups spearheaded by women s leadership have placed campus sexual assault on the top tier of issues to be dealt with by college officials as well as elected officials at the local, state, and federal levels.Increasingly views like Governor Kasich s that put the onus of responsibility on female victims are becoming the minority, while fathers, sons, and brothers have come to realize that blame is a weak and ineffective response.Republicans have found out more often than not, that their insensitive remarks about rape, abortion, and other issues affecting women have fed into the larger story of a war on women, and they end up losing elections.
