( reuters ) - after what seemed like a very long silence by his standards , donald trump returned to twitter on tuesday morning , striking an uncharacteristically low-key tone .
“ my experience in iowa was a great one .
i started out with all of the experts saying i couldn ’ t do well there and ended up in 2nd place .
nice , ” tweeted trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) on tuesday .
“ because i was told i could not do well in iowa , i spent very little there - a fraction of cruz & rubio .
came in a strong second .
great honor , ” he later tweeted .
for months , opinion polls have placed the real estate mogul and former reality tv star as front-runner to be the republican candidate in november ’ s u.s. presidential election .
in his first test at the hands of voters - monday ’ s iowa caucuses , which kicked off the parties ’ nominating process - trump was beaten into second place by u.s .
senator ted cruz .
senator marco rubio came in a close third .
trump ’ s twitter account went dark from monday evening for roughly 15 hours , an unusually long period for the white house hopeful , who averages about 17 tweets per day , according to twittercounter.com .
his second-place showing in iowa inspired a derisive hashtag called # ___supportsdonaldtrump .
twitter users used the hashtag to take shots at trump , filling in the blank with universally loathed people .
“ your high school teacher that didn ’ t let you use the bathroom when you needed to go badly # ___supportsdonaldtrump , ” faran ( @ raizand_ ) tweeted tuesday .
trump , who never tires of calling himself a “ winner , ” had his own favorite epithet used against him online .
twitter erupted tuesday over the news that a website called “ loser.com ” directed internet users to trump ’ s wikipedia page .
