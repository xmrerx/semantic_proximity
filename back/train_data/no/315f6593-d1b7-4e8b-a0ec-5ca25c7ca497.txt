says the guy whose legacy will be a war on cops and the division of america president barack obama cautioned americans from drawing easy conclusions from the shooting attacks that killed three law enforcement officials in baton rouge and wounded three others .
as of right now , we don t know the motive of the killer .
we don t know whether the killer set out to target police officers or whether he gunned them down as they responded to a call , the president said at the white house today.he also appeared to caution republicans using the incident for political attacks , after both he and hillary clinton signaled sympathy with anti-police protest groups like black lives matter .
we don t need inflammatory rhetoric .
we don t need careless accusations thrown around to score political points or to advance an agenda , he said .
we need to temper our words and open our hearts , all of us .
obama argued that attacks against police officers were not new , but part of an ongoing struggle .
we have our divisions , and they are not new , he said .
around the clock news cycles and social media sometimes amplify these divisions .
