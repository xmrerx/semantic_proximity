athens ( reuters ) - the athens metro came to a standstill on thursday when workers in the greek capital began a 24-hour strike to oppose the possible privatization of the rail operator .
the strike disrupted the daily commute for thousands of athenians and caused gridlock on streets leading to the city center .
metro workers are protesting the transfer of attiko metro operator and other state-owned enterprises to a sovereign wealth fund set up under the latest international bailout with the eu and the imf .
proceeds from the fund , known as the hellenic corporation of assets and participations , will help greece cut its debt burden and fund investments .
privatizations have been a pillar of greek bailouts since 2010 but have reaped poor revenues so far amid bureaucracy and opposition by politicians and unions .
greece is aiming for 5.5 billion euros from state asset sales by 2018 , when its bailout expires .
big tickets this year include the sale of a 66 percent stake in the natural gas grid desfa and a 67 percent stake in the port of thessaloniki .
