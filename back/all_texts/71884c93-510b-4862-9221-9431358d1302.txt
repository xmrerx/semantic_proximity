BLINDSIDED THE CURIOUS REASON THE NETWORK LET BILA GO OR SO THEY SAYEveryone was caught off guard on Monday when The View co-host Jedediah Bila announced live that she was departing the show and it would be her last day on air.
The 38-year-old political pundit joined the show as a permanent co-host in 2016 after serving as a guest host several times in 2015.
Bila revealed in her exit speech that she was preparing to write a not-yet-titled book that will be released next year, but offered no other plans or explanation for her abrupt departure from the show.
DailyMail.com has now exclusively learned that Bila was blindsided by the shakeup the weekend before her shock announcement, as it is revealed that Meghan McCain is in talks to take her spot.CNN TIP OFFThe former Fox News contributor received a call from a friend at CNN who tipped her off that ABC News had done a deal with conservative host McCain to replace her.
After she heard, Jedediah called the execs at ABC and they were basically like, Oops, you weren t supposed to find out this way.
She went from being initially shocked to furious that they would treat her this way, a source at the network told DailyMail.com.SHE S NOT A REPUBLICAN The network s reasoning for wanting to ditch Bila was because even though she played the role of the conservative on the show, she isn t an actual Republican.
Bila is a registered independent voter who did not support Donald Trump and identifies herself as a Libertarian.HILLARY S FAULT?Bila griped to staffers on Monday that she felt this was all fallout from her Hillary Clinton interview.
