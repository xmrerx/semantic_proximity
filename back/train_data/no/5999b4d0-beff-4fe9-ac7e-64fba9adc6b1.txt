vatican city/washington ( reuters ) - u.s. democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders was invited to speak at an april 15 vatican event by the vatican , a senior papal official said on friday , denying a report that sanders had invited himself .
“ i deny that .
it was not that way , ” monsignor marcelo sanchez sorondo told reuters in a telephone interview while he was traveling in new york .
sorondo , a close aide to pope francis , is chancellor of the pontifical academy of social sciences , which is hosting the event .

i invited him with her consensus , ” said sorondo , who is senior to archer .
