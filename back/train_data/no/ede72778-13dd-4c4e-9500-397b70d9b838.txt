katrina campins gave an excellent explanation of trump s position on immigration and the press : as an american i feel frustrated because people are losing sight of what donald trump is trying to say .
what he s saying is , people should come to this country legally .
and i know about that process very well because my husband is going through it right now and it s extremely expensive .
so there s more incentive for people to come over to this country illegally .
so all he s saying is , let s make the process to come here easier and less expensive so there s more incentive to do that .
when people cross the border who are not supposed to be here , let s make sure they are sent back .
but what the media is doing is twisting and turning everything that he s saying and what s so frustrating as an american is that the point is not getting across .
we re so worried about his fights with megyn kelly and jorge ramos now , let s talk about the real issues i don t think it s his fault .
i think it s the fact that everything he says gets misconstrued .
like this immigration thing i m a hispanic woman and i m not offended for what he s saying .
i understood exactly what he is saying .
no .
and i don t agree that i m in the minority because the last time i was on cnn speaking about this as a hispanic woman , so many hispanic women tweeted me and said , thank you for speaking for the real hispanic woman .
