the left showed its true colors last night with serious violence and anti-american flag burning .
donald trump held a fundraiser at the minneapolis convention center that began and ended with violence and destruction .
these people must not understand that punching people and burning american flags wins you zero support.it s one thing to be on opposite sides of an issue and opposite parties but this is shameful and hateful behavior by hillary s henchmen.protesters blocked the entrance hoping trump couldn t get in : then during the trump fundraiser in minneapolis , the crowd of hillary supporters were banging on doors and windows as the crowd inside the convention center held their event but then the trump supporters had to walk through a gauntlet to leave .
you will be shocked to see the terrified trump supporters being hit and yelled at : some protesters got aggressive at the end of the night as trump supporters left minneapolis fundraiser .
