how very moderate and tolerant of sadiq khan , to make one of his first acts as london s new mayor to threaten the united states .
perhaps someone will explain to london s new muslim mayor that after 8 long years of being kicked around , america s about to elect a new leader who won t be entertaining threats or opinions of local mayor s in foreign countries .
a poll in april found that two-thirds of british muslims would not tell the government if a friend or family member became involved with extremists.the new muslim mayor of london has issued a warning to donald trump : moderate your stance on muslims , or they will launch more attacks against america.trump recently praised sadiq khan for winning london s mayoral race , and said he would be willing to create an exception in his policy restricting muslim entry into the united states in order to allow khan to visit .
but in a statement tuesday , khan dismissed trump s invitation , and also denounced his views on islam as ignorant , suggesting trump s policies would increase the terrorist threat in both the u.s. and u.k. donald trump s ignorant view of islam could make both of our countries less safe it risks alienating mainstream muslims around the world and plays into the hands of extremists , he said .
