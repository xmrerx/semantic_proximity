Reconquista, English Reconquest, in medieval Spain and Portugal, a series of campaigns by Christian states to recapture territory from the Muslims (Moors), who had occupied most of the Iberian Peninsula in the early 8th century.They may be young, but they re taking a clear and decisive stand against a government who clearly has no concern for their faith, their heritage, the rich history of their nation, an unbiased education or the future of the citizens of Germany.This is a powerful message and needs to be share with everyone:Translated from YouTube:A youth is forming to recapture their identity!
#ZukunftEuropaA generation, a fate one last chance!This is not just a motto, but daily incentive of a movement that sees itself as a living covenant and as a community of fate!
We are a movement of young people who resists the left liberal indoctrination!We can no longer remain silent!
We see how the values and cultural decline progresses, as our home and our traditions are increasingly destroyed and how the freedom of political correctness gives way.We are united by fate to be the last generation that can turn things around again!
What unites us is the self-knowledge to be the phalanx, which it needs to take action against the self-destructive, prevailing multicultural ideology that drives the mass immigration and Islamization, and thus the ultimate disappearance of thousands of years old family of nations and cultural tradition called Europe.We stand together in our quest to protect our homeland, the restoration of freedom and sovereignty of our country and fight for the preservation of our ethno cultural identity!But with idealism alone this fight is not to lead!
Courage, dedication and sacrifice will not suffice to stand up as a young person against the predominant players in the debt pride and multicultural madness for a livable Germany.
We need your support!
