harare ( reuters ) - zimbabwe s president robert mugabe defied expectations he would resign on sunday , pledging to preside over a zanu-pf congress next month even though the ruling party had removed him as its leader hours earlier .
zanu-pf had given the 93-year-old less than 24 hours to quit as head of state or face impeachment , an attempt to secure a peaceful end to his tenure after a de facto coup .
mugabe said in a address on state television that he acknowledged criticism against him from zanu-pf , the military and the public , but did not comment on the possibility of standing down .
