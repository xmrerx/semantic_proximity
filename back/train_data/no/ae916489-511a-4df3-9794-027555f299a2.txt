tegucigalpa ( reuters ) - honduran president juan orlando hernandez held a lead over his main opposition rival after a partial recount of a disputed nov. 26 presidential vote that has sparked a political crisis , the website of the electoral tribunal showed monday .
hernandez had 42.98 percent of the vote , while tv star salvador nasralla had 41.39 percent , with 99.96 percent of votes tallied , according to the tribunal s website .
the head of the tribunal , david matamoros , has yet to declare an outright winner , telling reporters that parties could still file legal challenges and that the tribunal could still consider a wider recount .
he said there would be more announcements later on monday .
early last week , nasralla , a former sportscaster and game show host , appeared set for an upset victory over hernandez , gaining a five point lead with over half of the vote tallied .
after the count suddenly halted for more than a day , the sporadic vote count started leaning in favor of the incumbent .
