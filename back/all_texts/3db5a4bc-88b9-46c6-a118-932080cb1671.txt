There s been development with Trump s Muslim ban and it s not good.On Monday, the Supreme Court not only decided to hear the Trump Administration s challenge against the ruling that blocked his Muslim ban executive order but will allow enforcement of parts of the Muslim ban while the case moves forward.According to The Guardian, the court said the ban on visitors from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen could be enforced as long as those people lack a credible claim of a bona fide relationship with a person or entity in the United States.
So refugees that don t already have ties in the U.S. (that will be a majority of the refugees) won t be able to come into the U.S. Because of the few, many are punished.Trump has championed this ban far and wide, instilling Islamphobia left and right.
He believes that by restricting travel from six predominantly Muslim countries, it will protect the U.S. from terrorist attacks.Because, you know, we are perfectly safe and never have any sort of violence going on by our own citizens.
Nope.
Perfectly, 100% safe and serene and we need to keep it that way.CNBC reminds us that critics and some federal court rulings have argued that it targets immigrants based on religion, after Trump called for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the U.S. as a candidate.Yes, that is exactly what it s doing.
It s painting all Muslims are evil and dangerous.
It s awful and disgusting.
For the record, more Americans are killed by their furniture than Islamic terrorists.
To heat things up further, three justices including Trump appointee Neil Gorsuch said they would have let the executive order go into effect in full.With that in mind, who knows what the outcome of the Muslim ban hearing will be.
We will find out soon, however, as the hearing will take place in the fall.Featured image via Creative Touch Imaging Ltd./NurPhoto via Getty Images
