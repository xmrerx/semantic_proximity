wow !
the people of california might lose the right to vote on taxes ?
only in california would this even be a possibility ! last week the california supreme court agreed to hear a case that could determine whether the right to vote on local taxes , which is constitutionally guaranteed by both propositions 13 and 218 , will cease to exist.the case , california cannabis coalition v. city of upland , at first glance seems limited to a narrow technical question : when a local initiative seeks to impose a new tax , does the issue need to be put to the voters at the next general election or can the proponents , relying on other laws , force a special election ?
but in answering that question , the lower court ruled that taxes proposed by initiative are exempt from the taxpayer protections contained in the state constitution , such as the provision dictating the timing of the election.the howard jarvis taxpayers association ( hjta ) , which filed the petition seeking supreme court review , was alarmed because the constitution s taxpayer protections include the right to vote on taxes .
if local initiatives are exempt from those protections , then public agencies could easily deny taxpayers their right to vote on taxes by colluding with outside interests to propose taxes in the form of an initiative , then adopting the initiative without an election.via : iotw
