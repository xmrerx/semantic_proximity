A sign on the door of a Kewaskum Dairy Queen, calling the restaurant politically incorrect is generating business and conversation.The sign reads: This restaurant is politically incorrect.
It warns potential customers that staff may say things like Merry Christmas, Happy Easter, and will also offer free sundaes to veterans on Veterans Day.
It also says In God We Trust.
I felt the sign was appropriate to hang in terms of being transparent about the views of the owner and staff supporting God and country, said owner Kevin Scheunemann.
It just seems that those kinds of values and principles are becoming controversial in society, he said.Watch Dairy Queen franchise owner Kevin Scheunemann explain his decision to post the sign here:The sign was posted close to four years ago after a customer was upset when he heard Christian music inside the restaurant.
Scheunemann decided to post the warning and said he hasn t had many problems since then.One time, a customer was upset at the offer of free ice cream for veterans, but Scheunemann said he is open to talking with anyone who may have concerns about the sign.
He says he ll even make arrangements for a customer to come in without witnessing any expression of God or country.Other business owners in town say they support Scheunemann s right to run his business the way he sees fit.
