Obama and the Leftist Supreme Court activists are working overtime to push white students to the back of the line The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday upheld the University of Texas at Austin s ability to give a slight boost in the admissions process to black and Hispanic applicants, a decision that once again preserved the use of affirmative action at American universities.By a 4-3 vote, the court rejected Sugar Land native Abigail Fisher s claim that she was unfairly discriminated against because she was white.
She was denied admission into UT-Austin in 2008, but argued in a lawsuit that black and Hispanic students who were less qualified got in over her.UT-Austin fought the suit, saying it had a right to take race into consideration in a specific, limited way.The ruling almost certainly brings an end to a years-long legal fight over UT-Austin s use of race in admissions a fight that reached the Supreme Court twice.
It will also likely have national implications that will become clearer in the near future.
Colleges have been allowed to use affirmative action for decades, and the Supreme Court has upheld the practice each time, though it has limited how it can be used.
