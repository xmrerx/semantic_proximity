British comic Peter Serafinowicz has made everybody s day by dubbing over one of Donald Trump s hate-filled speeches with a cockney accent and it s brilliant.Serafinowicz, originally from Liverpool in England (home of The Beatles), is well known for serving up impressions of Al Pacino and other big name celebrities.
But now he has set himself the challenge of punking Donald Trump.It began a short while ago, with the comic dubbing an interview Trump gave to Fox News with an aristocratic English accent, in a video he called Sophisticated Trump.
But now it was time for the sequel, So on Friday morning, Serafinowicz tweeted the new video to his 750,000 Twitter followers, saying: I gave Donald Trump a cockney tough guy accent.

But you ve not been punched until you ve been punked Brit-style.Even members of the UK parliament laid into Trump with typical British humor during a recent debate about banning the trust fund tycoon from entering Britain, under rules designed to prevent hate-speech.As Addicting Info reported at the time:The 3-hour debate was done more out of respect for the process of public petitions, and due to the huge number of signatures, rather than because they were legitimately serious about banning him.
However, it did give Parliament time with which to vent their frustrations and engage in some brilliant Trump bashing, which is something we can all thoroughly appreciate.Using quintessential British putdowns such as pillock , buffoon, and wazzock , lawmakers from all sides of the political spectrum of our closest ally destroyed Donald Trump.It looks like it s not only American liberals that want Trump out of the Presidential race.
Our allies around the world are holding their collective breath in hope too.Featured Image via Flickr/Flickr
