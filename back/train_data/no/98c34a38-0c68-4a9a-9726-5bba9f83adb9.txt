do you think our gun grabber in chief should be next ? virginia state senator bill carrico ( r-dist .
40 ) is responding to governor terry mcauliffe s ( d ) relentless gun control push by introducing a budget amendment to remove funding for mcauliffe s protection detail.carrico said , if he s so afraid of guns , then i m not going to surround him with armed state policemen .
mcauliffe has pushed numerous gun controls as governor and , in august , infamously pushed for expanding background checks after virginia reporter alison parker had been shot on air .
mcauliffe made the push for expanded background checks before the gunman who killed parker had been caught and , therefore , before he had any knowledge of how the gunman acquired his gun .
as it turned out , gunman vester lee flanagan acquired his gun via a background check.moreover , on october 15 , mcauliffe issued an executive order banning the open carry of firearms in state buildings used by the virginia executive branch and calling for enforcement to ensure that the only people in the business of selling guns in virginia are those with a federal firearm license ( ffl ) .senator carrico is responding to these things and more by trying to be sure mcauliffe does not have to be around guns at all if they bother him so much .
according to the bristol herald courier , carrico said he will address this matter when the general assembly convenes in january , saying : a lot of the governor s power is deferred to the general assembly at that point and i ll be getting with my colleagues to circumvent everything this governor has done on this point .
i have a budget amendment that i m looking at to take away his executive protection unit .
if he s so afraid of guns , then i m not going to surround him with armed state policemen .
