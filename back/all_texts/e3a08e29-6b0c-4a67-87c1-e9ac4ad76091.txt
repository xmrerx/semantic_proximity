It is becoming clearer and clearer that Donald Trump and the people around him have serious ties to Vladimir Putin and Russian operatives.
On top of that, the story regarding Trump s Attorney General, Jeff Sessions, meeting with the Russian Ambassador and lying about it under oath completely stepped on what could have been a good news cycle after a surprisingly semi-normal speech delivered to a joint session of Congress.
So, what does Trump do in retaliation?
Why, he takes to Twitter, of course.First, Trump insisted that it was illegal leaks and fake news that was the REAL story, not Sessions s shading dealings with the Russian Ambassador and his lies regarding said dealings.
When that tactic didn t kill the story, Trump tried an even more insane approach, and tweeted a 13-year-old photo of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) with Vladimir Putin.This approach makes no sense at all, considering that Team Trump keeps saying that there s absolutely nothing wrong with people in Congress meeting with foreign diplomats and leaders, be they adversaries or otherwise.
However, Trump plowed on, and tweeted the following:So, let me get this straight.
Trump s people and let s face, it likely Trump himself wants a decade- plus old photo of Chuck Schumer with Vladimir Putin investigated, but wants the investigation into his people s dealings with Russian operatives during a presidential campaign that everyone knows was compromised by Russia dropped?
That s rich.Don t fall for it, folks.
This is nothing but a ridiculous distraction.
Where there s smoke, there s fire.
There s no smoke with Schumer but there sure as hell is plenty of smoke with Trump and Co. Let s keep our eye on the ball here, and root these treasonous squatters out of our White House.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
