frankfurt ( reuters ) - the public should not be forced to pay to walk on germany s beaches or swim in the sea , a federal court ruled , calling into question private beaches along the north and baltic sea coasts .
the coastal town of wangerland , 170 km ( 100 miles ) west of hamburg , was sued by two residents of neighboring towns who demanded it provide free access to its two north sea beaches .
wangerland s tourist office has largely fenced in the beaches , added facilities , playgrounds and lifeguards , and has been charging visitors a 3-euro ( $ 3.57 ) entry fee during the summer season , with the exception of residents and tourists of the town itself .
under german law , anyone is allowed to enter unused tracts of land , a provision meant to give the public access to the country s natural beauty and create opportunities for fresh-air recreation free of charge .
but a court in the state of lower saxony last year ruled in favor of wangerland , saying the beaches in question were not unused but had been leased by the town for commercial purposes .
the federal administrative court said in its ruling published on thursday the town could not charge visitors to go for walks on the beach or to swim in the sea , but could for using the facilities set up there .
claims to nearly the entire beach , and not only the areas needed to operate the business , put excessive limits on general liberty , the court said in a statement , partly overturning the lower court s ruling .
