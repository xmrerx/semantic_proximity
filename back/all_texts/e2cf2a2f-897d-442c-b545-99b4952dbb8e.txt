Because nothing in this world makes sense anymore, while Donald Trump meets with people who may or may not fill his future cabinet roles in his administration, the president-elect also took time to meet with Kanye West.
You know, because why not, right?Here s the dynamic duo in the lobby of Trump Tower in New York City:NEW YORK, NY DECEMBER 13: (L to R) President-elect Donald Trump and Kanye West stand together in the lobby at Trump Tower, December 13, 2016 in New York City.

Apple is even considering making a larger, signature caps lock.

josh groban (@joshgroban) December 13, 2016You see, both Kanye West and Donald Trump are tweet happy and, well, do so not always in the sanest of ways.Now, if you want to be mortified, check out West s tweets following the meeting with Trump:I feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change.
KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) December 13, 2016Scarier yet, the insinuation that he ll be running himself in 2024, you know, to give Trump two terms.
And really, at this point, why not?
It seems we really don t give a damn who runs the nation anymore.#2024 KANYE WEST (@kanyewest) December 13, 2016Now, all of this could be rather hilarious if it wasn t remarkably terrifying making the entirety of the sane world want to curl into a fetal position and cry themselves to sleep.However, thank you, Josh Grobin, for some much needed levity.Featured Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images Twitter
