The Black Lives Matter movement has become a convenient scapegoat for many on the right, who compare the growing social justice movement that is trying to raise awareness about the problem of police violence towards blacks.The newest and possibly strangest instance of this blame game comes from Atlanta, where attorney Claud Tex McIver blames the shooting death of his wife Diane on the movement.McIver was riding in the back seat of his car when his .38 revolver went off, wounding his wife who was seated up front.
She died in surgery several hours later.This is his explanation for what happened:McIver says he and his wife were being driven home by Diane s best friend when their Ford Explorer was approached by several individuals during a week in which there were many Black Lives Matter protests in the area, according to Bill Crane, a McIver family friend, who spoke to the The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Friday.Fearing they were about to be carjacked, McIver pulled out his gun from the center console as a precaution.
McIver was falling asleep with the gun in his lap and has no recollection of pulling the trigger, Crane told the newspaper.The accusation doesn t really meet the smell test.
At the very least the McIver case sounds like so many of the accidental gun deaths that come about from far too many guns floating around the country, especially in states like Georgia in the south.But it s also possible that something more sinister occurred and Black Lives Matter a movement that has not endorsed violence and is in fact trying to curtail it is being used as part of a blame game that we ve heard before.
Violent crimes have in the past often been blamed on a convenient black figurehead in order to obscure what really happened.So far police have listed the death as a homicide.
