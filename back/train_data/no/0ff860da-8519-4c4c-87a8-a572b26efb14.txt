gaborone ( reuters ) - a transgender woman has won a legal battle against botswana s government to be recognized as female in a landmark victory for the rights of the lesbian , gay and transgender community .
a conservative southern african nation of 2 million people , botswana has been reluctant to fully acknowledge the rights of the lgbt community .
tshepo ricki kgositau , the executive director of south african-based gender dynamix , an organization that advocates for the human rights of transgender and gender-variant people , had sued botswana for refusing to change the gender on her identity document from male to female .
on tuesday , justice leatile dambe ordered that kgositau s gender be changed to female in the national registry within seven days .
the director of the national registration is ordered to issue the applicant with a new identity card identifying her as a female within 21 days of this court order , dambe ordered .
in court papers , kgositau argued that she had since an early age identified as a woman and that the different gender on her identity document was causing her emotional distress and increased her vulnerability to abuse and violence .
the application included supporting evidence from her mother , siblings and relatives , as well as psychological and medical evidence to the effect that her innate gender identity is , and has since an early age , always been female and that her family has embraced her and loved her as a woman .
in 2014 , a judge overturned a government ban on a gay rights lobbying group , ruling that lesbians , gays and bisexuals of botswana be allowed to register and campaign for changes to legislation .
however , it reiterated that it was still illegal to engage in homosexual acts .
