The Washington Post [Compost] reports: So far, three major corporate sponsors and the NEA have felt it necessary to distance themselves from the show, Eustis said in an interview Thursday.
And I feel just heartsick for the NEA.
That they re forced to distance themselves from a work of art oh, my God.
Eustis was referring to the statement the National Endowment for the Arts issued Monday, after the Public s production of Shakespeare s storied play came under attack from ultraconservative websites and even from one of the sons of President Trump, who questioned whether it was taxpayer-supported.
They targeted the production because of the obvious references it draws to the current president and the depiction in the play of the assassination of its Caesar-as-Trump figure, played by Gregg Henry.Donald Trump Jr. tweeted a message asking if the assassination of his father should be funded by taxpayers: No NEA funds have been awarded to support this summer s Shakespeare in the Park production of Julius Caesar and there are no NEA funds supporting the New York State Council on the Arts s grant to Public Theater or its performances, the NEA declared, in what struck many in the arts world as an extraordinary act of disavowal.
It came as two high-profile corporate supporters of Shakespeare in the Park, Delta Air Lines and Bank of America, withdrew financial backing, and a third, American Express, said that its contributions go exclusively to the Public s main theater in downtown Manhattan and it did not condone the interpretation staged in Central Park.Instead of recognizing that the theater group had crossed a line that should not have been crossed, Eustis is willing to take a loss at the box office in order to keep the assassination of President Trump on stage in front of thousands of families in Central Park: As for the Public s future in this climate, Eustis said, This is damaging for us and we definitely lost money, and nobody likes losing money.
But we will survive it.
