beijing ( reuters ) - chinese military aircraft have again carried out drills in the western pacific , the xinhua state news agency said on thursday , with bombers and fighters from a south china sea naval air arm exercising with warships .
chinese aircraft , most of them from the air force , have carried out increasing numbers of drills far from chinese shores in the past few years , most recently focused on self-ruled taiwan , claimed by china as its own , and near japan .
xinhua said dozens of aircraft , including bombers , fighters and early warning aircraft , drilled in the western pacific along with warships , but it did not give an exact location .
the exercises were normal drills , part of annual plans , and accorded with international law and norms and were not aimed at any specific country or region , xinhua said , citing the military .
the exercises had no impact on freedom of navigation or overflight in the area , the news agency added .
the participation of aircraft attached to the south china sea fleet implies they could have flown over the disputed south china sea , where china has been building airfields and other military facilities , some on artificial islands , unnerving the region .
china claims most of the south china sea , a strategic waterway through which $ 3 trillion worth of goods passes every year .
vietnam , the philippines , malaysia , taiwan and brunei all have overlapping claims .
china has continued to install high-frequency radar and other facilities that can be used for military purposes on its man-made islands in the south china sea , a u.s. think-tank said last week .
