london ( reuters ) - british prime minister theresa may and other party leaders agreed on monday to introduce new safeguards for those working in parliament to try to contain a growing sexual harassment scandal .
britain s parliament is the latest institution to become embroiled in a sex scandal after abuse allegations against hollywood producer harvey weinstein prompted thousands of women and men to share stories about improper behavior .
allegations have been made against lawmakers in several parties , but the growing scandal is particularly damaging for may who , weakened after losing her conservatives majority in june , can not afford to lose any more parliamentary seats , especially when she is trying to negotiate a brexit deal .
may told reporters on monday the agreement with jeremy corbyn , head of the main opposition labour party , and other leaders to introduce a new grievance procedure and face-to-face human resources support was an important step forward .
the fact that they have taken place here at our seat of democracy should be a matter of shame for us all , she said .
we ve taken an important step forward today .
it s important we get this right and that is what i intend to do .
corbyn said the leaders had agreed that any form of harassment or bullying was completely unacceptable in this workplace or indeed in any other workplace in the country .
we ve agreed we will establish a group of representatives of the parties and of the staff ... in this building and we will work out necessary procedures , he told sky news .
the scandal has led to one resignation - michael fallon quit as defense minister last week , but the number of allegations against lawmakers has increased almost daily .
