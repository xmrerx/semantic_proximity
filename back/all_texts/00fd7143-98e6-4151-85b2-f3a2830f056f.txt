WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Representative Steny Hoyer, the No.
2 House Democrat, on Tuesday said he opposed any temporary spending bill for the federal government that lasted beyond December.
Members of the U.S. Congress, who returned to Washington after a summer recess, must pass a spending bill before the fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 or risk a government shutdown.
Some conservative Republicans have said they want a temporary spending bill that extends into 2017.
