You know how conservatives are constantly screaming FAKE NEWS every time they see something they don t like?
It s interesting that they have no problem sharing news that is demonstrably fake given their professed distaste for it.This is what Trump Nazi Laura Ingraham s website looks like as I type this sentence:Notice anything off?
If you guessed the photo of what she claims is five straight miles of Trump fans banging on the doors to barely halfway fill a venue that is capped at 5,000 people you re correct.
Good job.
You get a cookie.
Go you!The image is from an event that serves as the traditional pick for conservatives when they want to lie about Donald Trump s crowd size.
That s right the 2016 Cleveland Cavaliers victory parade (FUN FACT: Like almost everything else, it attracted more people than Trump s inauguration).This isn t the first time Ingraham has acted like an embarrassment to the human race.
In 2016, she was captured at CPAC giving the Nazi salute to a photo of Trump that appeared to be doing the same back at her:I'd forgotten the one with Laura Ingraham giving the Nazi salute, it's been so long https://t.co/UBDRGOI98z pic.twitter.com/wxC8vCHPDL i, Smiley ????
(@smiley_yearwood) August 18, 2017It s important to remember that this is what passes for reality in the Stupid Part of America.
Recently, the Virginia Republican Party shared a news article claiming that Rosa Parks daughter praised Trump as a civil rights hero, for example.
Rosa Parks had no children, but that didn t stop their idiot followers from sharing it hundreds of times.Conservatives are easy to mock these days for some reason.
It s no wonder they keep telling us that the way to win them over is to stop calling them racists and making fun of their hilarious stupidity.Featured image via screengrab
