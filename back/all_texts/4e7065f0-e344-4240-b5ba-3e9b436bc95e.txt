During a segment of CNN s State of the Union, Arizona s Republican Governor Jan Brewer became very upset over accusations that Trump supporters, including herself, are being labeled as racists and bigots for supporting the GOP s presumptive presidential nominee.Last Friday, President Obama went after Trump in a speech where he referred to Trump as a charlatan going on to say that we don t have time for bigotry or hatred.
Brewer was questioned on how she felt about the president s characterization of Trump.
She responded by saying: Obama just always comes tearing after Republicans constantly, calling names and calling people bigots and racists.
And that s their big comeback, you know.
And it s absolutely ridiculous.
To see a president, speak like that is offensive.
Former Democrat primary candidate and current governor of Maryland told Brewer that the President wasn t referring to all Republicans when President Obama made the remarks under discussion.
O Malley did back up the president s comments, however, saying that: He [President Obama] did say it rightly that Donald Trump is a bigot, Donald Trump is a racist.
Donald Trump is, in fact, making fascist appeals.
That s why many self-respecting Republicans are not supporting Donald Trump.
Brewer claimed that no matter what the topic is, Democrats refuse to talk policy and instead only want to sling accusations of racism and bigotry towards Republicans.
The show s host Jake Tapper asked Brewer if she believed that Trump s proposals and remarks are at least somewhat racially motivated.
Instead of admitting that it is possible, she simply blamed the things that Trump says that make her uncomfortable on his political juvenility.From there, Brewer descends into a full-blown freak out over accusations that Trump and his supporters might just possibly have racist motivations.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot
