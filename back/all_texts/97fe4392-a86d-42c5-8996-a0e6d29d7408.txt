If you watched the second presidential debate last night, you know that there were several cringeworthy moments, most of them created by Republican nominee Donald Trump.
One of the most noteworthy of them was when the business mogul threw his vice president, Mike Pence, under the bus by disagreeing with Pence s stance on how America should respond to the war in Syria:[ad3media campaign= 1103 ]The moment shocked everyone watching, and was the perfect representation of just what a disaster the Trump-Pence ticket is.
To make matters worse, this is just one amongst a long list of things Trump and Pence have disagreed about!
Jerry Springer, the host of The Jerry Springer Show said it better than any of us could have when he weighed in on this awkward debate moment: While I may not be able to moderate a debate, sounds like Mike Pence and Donald Trump might need to come on my show to talk things out.
Seriously and Springer s tweet about Trump-Pence couldn t be any more fitting than at this moment, when Pence basically refused to defend Trump over the lewd misogynistic comments that were discovered in a recently leaked audio tape.Trump s entire campaign has gone on like a reality TV show, so it s not a stretch to say that Trump wouldn t feel right at home on Springer s show.
And according to previous tweets from Springer, the talk show host already knows this:TwitterSpringer, who has fiercely endorsed Hillary Clinton, has been taking Trump and the GOP to task on social media, and it s pretty awesome.
Springer also made sure to bring those who support Trump into the mix of insults:TwitterTwitterTwitterConsidering that Trump is a serial rapist who wants to bang his daughter and can t agree with his most important team member, Springer s show might be the ONLY place Trump and his weird, volatile campaign belongs!Featured image via Stephen Lovekin and Scott Olson / Getty Images
