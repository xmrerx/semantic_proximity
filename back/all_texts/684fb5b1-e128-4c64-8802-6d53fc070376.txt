NAIROBI (Reuters) - The Kenyan parliament passed an amendment on Wednesday to the country s election laws, saying that if one candidate withdraws from a repeat presidential election, the other one would automatically win.
The amendment was heavily criticized by the opposition, whose legislators boycotted the vote.
Opposition leader Raila Odinga withdrew from a repeat presidential vote scheduled for Oct. 26 on Tuesday, citing concerns over fairness and transparency.
The law must now be signed by the president.
