as the subcommittee notes , the number also does not include those migrants who overstayed the terms of their visas.regardless , as the subcommittee explained in its analysis , the u.s. is playing host to immigrants from majority muslim countries at an increasing pace.between fy 2013 and fy 2014 , the number of green cards issued to migrants from muslim-majority countries increased dramatically from 117,423 in fy 2013 , to 148,810 in fy 2014 , a nearly 27 percent increase .
throughout the obama administration s tenure , the united states has issued green cards to an average of 138,669 migrants from muslim-majority countries per year , meaning that it is nearly certain the united states will have issued green cards to at least 1.1 million migrants from muslim-majority countries on the president s watch .
it has also been reported that migration from muslim-majority countries represents the fastest growing class of migrants.green cards , or lawful permanent residency , puts immigrants on the path to citizenship and allows for lifetime residency , federal benefits , and work authorization .
included in the totals are refugees , who are required to apply for a green card after one year of residency in the u.s .
unlike other types of immigrants , refugees are immediately eligible for welfare benefits including temporary assistance to needy families ( tanf ) , food stamps , and medicaid .
