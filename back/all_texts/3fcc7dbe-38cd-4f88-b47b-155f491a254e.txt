It s about time!
The White House has been leaking like a sieve.
New White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci flatly said Sunday that he as going to fire all future leakers on his watch: We re as strong as our weakest leak A smug John Dickerson asked Scaramucci why President Donald Trump had tweeted a day earlier about his ability to grant pardons.
Scaramucci said the leaks of that conversation and other leaks were unprofessional, injurious to the government, and possibly felonious.
He s done absolutely nothing wrong.
There s no need for him to pardon anybody, Scaramucci said.
But he just doesn t like the fact that he has a two-minute conversation in the Oval Office or in his study, and then people are running out and leaking that.
What happens to leakers on your watch?
Dickerson asked.
They re going to get fired, Scaramucci said.Scaramucci said he would hold a staff meeting on Monday and make it clear that anyone who wants to stay on will not leak private conversations to the press.
We re as strong as our weakest leak, he said.
So if you guys want to keep leaking, why don t you guys all get together and make a decision as a team that you re going to stop leaking.
But if you re going to keep leaking, I m going to fire everybody.
