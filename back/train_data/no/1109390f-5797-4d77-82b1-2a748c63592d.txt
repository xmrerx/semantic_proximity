this guy opened his mouth and proved us all right .
he s a total jerk who hates america.this guy is a typical limousine liberal who s so hateful it s beyond belief .
he s on facebook ranting about how much he hates america and americans : jim fergie chambers a trust fund america hater : in the east atlanta village neighborhood , the eav barbell club is known as the one owned by the guy who hates cops.his policy ?
police officers and members of the military are not welcome to work out at eav barbell club .
the self-proclaimed radical said he believes police officers are violent henchmen of the state.so what does he have against military personnel ?
my belief is that the american state , the american empire is the most destructive and sadistic force the world has ever seen , chambers said .
what our army does is evil , so i don t want to make somebody strong so they can go kill yemenis and north koreans , period .
ever since the story began to circulate , chambers said he s gotten a lot of angry phone calls .
he said some people have threatened his life .
i d say during peak hours i ll get a death threat about every 15 seconds , chambers said.on the gym s facebook page , most of the posts are not appropriate for television , but one post sums up general sentiment : i hope your stupid little sign was worth it .
you started something now .
chambers is independently wealthy .
he confirmed to me he s the great-grandson of the founder of communications giant cox enterprises , which owns the atlanta journal-constitution and wsb-tv , among other businesses.we asked chambers if he would consider calling the police to report the death threats he s received .
absolutely not , under no circumstances , he said .
i would feel more unsafe in their presence .
