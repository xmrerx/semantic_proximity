It was all an accident.
It s good to King The Obama administration continues to ignore the law and do pretty much whatever the hell it wants.From The Hill:The government erroneously doled out about 2,000 expanded immigrant work permit authorizations under President Obama s controversial executive actions, even after a federal judge blocked the move, the Justice Department says.
The Government sincerely regrets these circumstances and is taking immediate steps to remedy these erroneous three-year terms, the Department of Justice wrote in a court advisory filed late Thursday in the Southern District of Texas.The advisory comes after District Court Judge Andrew Hanen halted the implementation of the executive actions, which defer deportations for immigrants living in the U.S. illegally and provide them with expanded access to work permits, until the courts could decide whether the policies are constitutional.While the old policies authorize a two-year renewal of work permits under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, the new program would allow for a three-year renewal.The DOJ added in the advisory that the Department of Homeland Security is converting the three-year renewals into two-year terms and that DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson has asked the agency s inspector general to investigate.Oh good they re investigating, I m sure they ll be fair and honest, right?
If we can t trust them to follow a judge s ruling then why should we trust them about any immigration policy they might seek in the future?
This is just pathetic.
And of course it s released on Friday afternoon, knowing that the complicit moron media will barely report it.Via: The Right Scoop
