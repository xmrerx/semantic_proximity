Given how vile Trump s treatment of women is, it s an absolute wonder that any woman at all can tolerate voting for him.
Yet, there are women all over Twitter who not only can vote for him, but will do it enthusiastically.
Do they know something that women on the left don t?
Sadly, it doesn t seem so.
In fact, they seem impossibly ignorant about issues that directly affect them.The hashtag, #WomenWhoVoteTrump, seems to be a bit of a counter to #WhyWomenDontReport, in which women bared the pain of their harassment and assaults to the whole world.
Misogynists worked their asses off shaming those women, too.
#WomenWhoVoteTrump, however, seems to be nothing but attacks on Hillary and shaming victims of sexual assault.
These aren t just impossibly tone-deaf, they re outright cruel.#womenwhovotetrump Know how to say no when it needs to be said.

Rapefugee Watch (@RapefugeeWatch) October 14, 2016#WomenWhoVoteTrump don t need to constantly play the victim and claim that society is against them.
We self empower.
#Trump2016 DEPLORABLE DANI (@NimbleNavgater) October 14, 2016#WomenWhoVoteTrump aren t weak, perpetual victims like those on the left.
andieiam (@andieiamwhoiam) October 14, 2016#WomenWhoVoteTrump are sexier marisa leocadi (@marisaaleocadi) October 15, 2016So all women s experiences are like this woman s, apparently:Because you DON T wait 37yrs to go after a Man who sexually assaulted you.
I know, I am a Victim.#WomenWhoVoteTrump @realDonaldTrump Leslie (@Leslie91780) October 15, 2016#WomenWhoVoteTrump are the most educated on the issues & refuse 2 vote 4 a Woman simply because she s a Woman.
Jobs, Security, Fair Trade.
Susan (@MsSusanFerguson) October 14, 2016The funny thing about it is that most of the women tweeting under that hashtag can only talk about how much they hate Hillary.
Very few have actually given an explanation of what makes Trump so good.
They re sufferers of Hillary Derangement Syndrome, and have no idea what could happen to them under a President Trump:In other words, just going to work and getting through the day could suddenly become much more difficult if Trump is elected, simply because the president sets a major example for the rest of the country.We won t stoop to calling these women stupid.
Rather, they re badly misinformed and unable to see that they re misinformed.
By voting for Trump out of hatred for Hillary, they re trying to open a Pandora s box from which women might take decades to recover.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images
