If there s one thing this election succeeded in doing, it s bringing heartbreak and confusion to many, many people.So many thought the country was better than the racist, sexist vitriol that spewed from Donald Trump on a daily basis.
So many thought that he could never win.
The polls even sided with Hillary Clinton, which confused even more when the election results came out.Yet, according to the electoral college, which is outdated and no longer necessary, Donald Trump seemed to squeak through a victory.However, if we were to be an actual democracy and choose a president through who won the most votes, that person would have been Hillary Clinton.Even Donald Trump of 2012 would agree with that, because even he thought the electoral college was unfair.
That was, of course, until it worked to his advantage.Trump in 2012 tweeted: The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.
The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 7, 2012And that s actually a very good point.
The electoral college, in this day and age, is well past its expiration date.You see, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 200K votes:via Google That would, under an actual democracy, make her the winner.
However, no.
We re stuck with a racist and misogynistic ass who makes fun of POWs and disabled people.I would say we ought to be ashamed of ourselves, but no, Hillary won.
Even Donald Trump thinks so.Featured Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images
