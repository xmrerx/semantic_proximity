CNN and many other news outlets think they re smarter than all of us who are on social media.
A fake news story has been going around the web that makes President Trump look like he committed a faux pas while participating in a traditional Japanese ceremony.
In a video posted early Monday morning, CNN noted that Trump fed fish with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe by emptying the whole box of food into a koi pond during his tour of Asia THAT S NOT WHAT REALLY HAPPENED!Trump joined his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in feeding fish, emptying the whole box of food into a koi pond https://t.co/Aho7J2YUru pic.twitter.com/dPB9xwKNOB CNN (@CNN) November 6, 2017What they didn t show is that the Japanese Prime Minister poured out his food BEFORE President Trump did the same:Yes, the news media has been keeping this fake news story going.
WGN Chicago had a misleading photo and title today that even anti-Trump readers called them out on it.
Well, well, well We looked and the post has been removed from Facebook.
We re glad we got a screenshot of this!Yes, it looks like Trump was the jerk who spoiled the moment by dumping the food BUT it s NOT true!SCREENSHOT OF POST REMOVED FROM FACEBOOK AFTER THE OUTCRY: Even though most people know the story is fake, there are those anti-Trump dumbos who bought it hook, line and sinker:CNN started this fake news ball rolling and news outlets like Chicago s WGN kept it going How many other local news outlets did the same?
And we wonder how Trump s supposed poll numbers could be so low?
How does President Trump fight a media that constantly does this?Please spread the truth on this!Here s the CNN video:Trump joined his Japanese counterpart Shinzo Abe in feeding fish, emptying the whole box of food into a koi pond https://t.co/Aho7J2YUru pic.twitter.com/dPB9xwKNOB CNN (@CNN) November 6, 2017HERE THE TRUTH:
