Trump supporter, anti-Islam activist, and vapid, racist fool James Stachowiak is furious.
Now, Stachowiak is almost perpetually enraged, but this time Shark Tank host Mark Cuban made Johnny Infidel (as the Tea Partier calls himself) furious.
Recently, Cuban predicted that a Trump presidency would create a dire economic downturn.Stachowiak complained that he saw Cuban make the remarks on Fox News.
He says that he has no doubt the market will tank if Trump wins the presidency, the right-wing activist whines.
Well, just like every coin has two sides, I m gonna give the other side of the coin.
I have no doubt that if Hillary wins, Americans will die because Americans died, Hillary lied, and Benghazi still matters, he rambles, adding that a Clinton presidency will lead to more Americans brutally sodomized, murdered, their bodies burned and dragged through the streets of more capitols across the globe like what happened in Benghazi.
Boy, what a persuasive argument!Stachowiak then compares Hillary Clinton to the Soviet spies, the Rosenbergs, who were executed for treason because they actually committed treason unlike Clinton, who has not committed a single prosecutable offense.
What Hillary has done makes the Rosenbergs actions pale in comparison, he explains.
Hillary s actions have actually caused Americans to die.
Benghazi.
Then things get crazy(ier): It is my opinion, and I m probably one of the first to say it, that Hillary Clinton should be put on trial hopefully under a Trump presidency and found guilty of treason for compromising national security.
She should be sentenced to death at a federal court.
Hillary clinton s proper place in our country is in front of a firing squad for committing treason against our country.
What should happen to Mark Cuban?
Stachowiak asks rhetorically before burning a photograph of the Clinton supporter.Yeah, that s what he thinks should happen to Mark Cuban.
Let s hope none of his insane fans act on it.Featured image via screengrab
