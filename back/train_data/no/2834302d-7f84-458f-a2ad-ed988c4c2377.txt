saudi arabia , which stakes its reputation on its guardianship of islam s holiest sites and organizing the haj , has been hit by bombings in recent years and uncovered plots to carry out attacks in mecca .
the limbs of terrorism have sought to harm the holy cities , paying no attention to their sanctity , spa quoted king salman as telling foreign dignitaries at a reception he held in mecca , where more than 2 million pilgrims are performing haj .
but the kingdom , by the grace of god and in cooperation with its sisters and friends , has made big successes in eradicating terrorism and has worked decisively and with determination to dry its sources , he added , without elaborating .
salman also said saudi arabia had devoted all its material and human resources to ensure the safety of pilgrims who come from all over the world to perform the five-day ritual , a religious duty to be undertaken once in a lifetime by every able-bodied muslim who can afford the journey .
we are determined , with god s permission , to continue to provide the highest level of services for the two holy mosques ... to ensure the safety of those who seek the sacred house of god , he said .
the pilgrimage has frequently been hit by stampedes and fires .
in the most recent incident , hundreds of pilgrims were killed in a crush two years ago .
