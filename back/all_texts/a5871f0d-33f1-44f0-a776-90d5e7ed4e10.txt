By now, the entire nation knows that the GOP is operating behind closed doors in order to restructure a sixth of America s economy by dismantling the Affordable Care Act and replacing it with a massive tax cut for the rich disguised as a new healthcare law.
Mitch McConnell, along with just a few other old white guys from the Senate GOP Conference, are going about this in complete secrecy.
They have refused to let any Democrats at all see the bill, and even some of their own Republican colleagues are complaining that they have no idea what is in this piece of legislation.
So, Senators Cory Booker (D-NJ), Chris Murphy (D- CT) and Brian Schatz (D-HI) had a brilliant idea: They d go find the bill themselves.The Senators piled into a cab with an unidentified driver with whom they tried to chat about healthcare, and took a trip down to the Congressional Budget Office, the non-partisan entity in Washington that scores major legislation to see how it will impact the economy and the lives of everyday Americans.
Their quest was to get a copy of the bill, read it themselves, and release it to the public.
They also livestreamed the entire field trip on Facebook Live.
Here are the videos, via Cory Booker s Facebook:This was a very creative way for them to shine a light on exactly what dirty tricks the GOP is up to.
However, the sad thing is that the Republicans don t care how much their fellow Senators shame them, and they certainly don t care how much their constituents shame them.
Hell, they don t even care if the very people who put them in the United States Senate live or die.
But, this is what the resistance is all about.
It s pushing against powerful people trying to do horrible things to the nation, and making sure everyone knows what they are up to.Way to go, Senators!
