(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday declined to hear an appeal by an Alabama black-voter outreach group with close ties to the state’s Democratic Party of a lower court’s ruling that upheld a state ban on cash transfers between political action committees.
The Alabama Democratic Conference had asked the justices to review a September 2016 decision by the Atlanta-based 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals that sided with the state and found that the law did not violate the organization’s rights to free expression and free association under the U.S. Constitution.
