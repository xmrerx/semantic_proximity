A fumbling Nancy Pelosi tried to defend former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick s First Amendment right to kneel during the national anthem.
She couldn t quite get the name out and stuttered to say it.
If you ve been following pelosi, you know this is a common occurrence.
Pelosi is a great example of why we desperately need term limits.
During an appearance on Meet The Press, Pelosi sided with the former 49ers quarterback, and other players refusing to stand for our country It was a hot pink mess SHE JUST DOESN T GET IT OUT -OF-TOUCH LIBERALS HAVE NO CLUE!
Colin Kaep Kaep Kaepernick, uh, doing what he did, says this flag enables me to do this.
This national anthem enables me to do this, she said, initially struggling to speak.
This is about freedom of expression, Pelosi said.NO NANCY, THIS IS ABOUT SHOWING RESPECT FOR WHAT OUR FLAG AND NATIONAL ANTHEM REPRESENT.
THIS IS WHAT PRESIDENT TRUMP SAID: We re proud of our country.
We respect our flag, Wouldn t you love to see one of these NFL owners, when somebody disrespects our flag to say, Get that son of a bitch off the field!
He s fired.
He s fired!
MAGA!
