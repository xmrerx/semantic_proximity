I ll be back is not what Arnold Schwarzenegger is telling the Republican Party this year.
Ever since the action movie icon became a United States citizen in 1983 he has faithfully voted for the GOP presidential candidate but not this year.Donald Trump s vulgar remarks about groping women were too much for the Terminator star, who, like other Republicans, are now jumping from a sinking ship.The Los Angeles Times reports that Arnold not only condemned Trump in a statement, but used the same statement to announce that he will not be voting Republican in November.
For the first time since I became a citizen in 1983, I will not vote for the Republican candidate for president, Schwarzenegger said in a statement posted on Twitter.
Like many Americans, I ve been conflicted by this election I still haven t made up my mind about how exactly I will vote next month.
I have been a proud Republican since I moved to America in 1968 and I heard Nixon s words about getting government off our backs, free trade, and defending our liberty with a strong military.
That day I joined the party of Abraham Lincoln, Teddy Roosevelt, and Ronald Reagan.But as proud as I am to label myself a Republican, there is one label that hold above all else American.
So I want to take a moment today to remind my fellow Republicans that it is not only acceptable to choose your country over your party it is your duty.
As proud as I am to label myself a Republican, there is one label that I hold above all else American.

That s saying something.Featured image via Wikimedia
