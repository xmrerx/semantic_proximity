what a joke !
hillary decides to go on snl and make it one big campaign commercial bashing republicans and promoting herself .
not one mention of the e-mail scandal !
that s pretty interesting and shows she s thin-skinned and snl did everything to put her in the best light .
reminds me of the palin bashing but i doubt americans are buying this unfunny attempt at bashing candidates.the front-runner for the democratic nomination appeared on the season opener of saturday night live as a wise bartender named val who pours a drink or two for , ahem , hillary clinton ( played by snl regular kate mckinnon ) .most political candidates play themselves on snl , often for just a cameo in a sketch or to declare the show s famous tag line , live from new york it s saturday night !
seldom do they go all-out thespian and play a character in a sketch .
so , hillary , clinton asks mckinnon , what brings you here tonight ?
well , i needed to blow off some steam , mckinnon says .
i ve had a hard couple of 22 years .
asked what she does for a living , mckinnon says in imitation of clinton s earnest monotone : first , i am a grandmother .
second , i am a human , entrusted with this one green earth .
oh , clinton says , you re a politician .
and just who is val ?
clinton deadpans , i m just an ordinary citizen who believes the keystone pipeline will destroy our environment .
republicans didn t fare nearly as well as snl began its 41st season .
the opening sketch made fun of trump and his wife , melania , and a faux commercial pitched a pill that cures people of thinking they can be president specifically low-polling gop candidates rick santorum , mike huckabee and jim gilmore .
