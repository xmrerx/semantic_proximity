global warming has been shoved down the throats of every american since the day obama took office .
the only problem is that it s a massive hoax that is being used to transfer money from taxpayers to be redistributed amongst the liberal elite and those who the elites deem worthy .
one of those liberal elites is being called on the carpet by a texas congressman : jagadish shukla , the climate commie who has been making a fortune off the global warming hoax and who demands that skeptics be imprisoned is finally in some hot water.rep .
lamar smith ( r-tx ) , chairman of the house committee on space , science and technology , has written to professor jagadish shukla of george mason university , in virginia , requesting that he release all relevant documents pertaining to his activities as head of a non-profit organization called the institute of global environment and society.smith has two main areas of concern : first , the apparent engagement by the institute in partisan political activity which , as a non-profit , it is forbidden by law from doing.second , what precisely has the iges institute done with the $ 63 million in taxpayer grants which it has received since 2001 and which appears to have resulted in remarkably little published research ? for example , as watts up with that ?
notes , a $ 4.2 million grant from the national science foundation to one of the institute s offshoots appears to have resulted in just one published paper.but the amount which has gone into the pockets of shukla and his cronies runs into the many hundreds of thousands of dollars .
in 2013 and 2014 , for example , shukla and his wife enjoyed a combined income in excess of $ 800,000 a year.there s more : [ f ] or nearly 14 years , he , his family and his friends have been gorging themselves on taxpayers money at iges ; and this money comes on top of the very generous salary he receives for doing much the same work at george mason university ( gmu ) .it s the latter detail which has led former virginia state climatologist pat michaels one of the skeptics who might have been affected by shukla s proposed rico prosecutions to describe this as the largest science scandal in us history .
under federal law , state employees may not be remunerated for doing work which falls under their state employee remit .
as a professor at gmu , shukla is definitely an employee of the state .
and the work for which he has most lavishly been rewarding himself at iges appears to be remarkably similar to the work he does at gmu as professor of climate dynamics.getting paid twice to tell the same pernicious lies is a fine deal for shuknjivela , but it hasn t been working out so well for taxpayers.read more : moonbattery
