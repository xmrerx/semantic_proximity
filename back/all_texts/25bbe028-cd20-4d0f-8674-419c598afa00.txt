When Donald Trump fails, his team sure doesn t help make it any better.On Monday, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer decided to pour salt in the gaping wound that was left when Trump and the GOP suffered a massive failure in gaining approval for their disastrous plan to repeal and replace Obamacare.
The American Health Care Act, also known as Trumpcare, not only failed to get enough votes, but Trump pulled it from the House floor because it was such an obvious, humiliating defeat.In speaking to reporters during his daily briefing, Spicer likened Trumpcare to a bad deal which was a pretty odd thing to say, considering how much Trump has bragged about what a good negotiator and dealmaker he is.
To diss something that Trump supported full-heartedly is definitely not going to make Trump happy.
Spicer said: The president also recognizes that when there s not a deal to be made, when to walk away.
It s not just about making deals.
It s knowing when to walk away from deals and knowing [that] when there s a bad deal, that s the only solution.
I think the president understood that where we were, that while you can get a deal at the time, that sometimes a bad deal is worse than getting a deal.
And I think he smartly recognized that what was on the table was not going to be keeping with the vision that he had, and so he decided that this was not the time and that a deal was not at hand.
Really, who needs critics when you have Spicer?
It should also be noted that even after the bill failed, Trump was still praising the GOP s awful plan, stating that it just needed some improvement.
Yet Spicer pretty much trashed Trumpcare, and said that the GOP s plan to do away with Obamacare (which they ve been bragging about for the last seven years) was a devastating fail.
