ankara ( reuters ) - turkish authorities issued detention warrants on saturday for 100 former police officers and have so far detained 63 of them , the state-run anadolu news agency said , as part of a widening crackdown since last year s failed coup attempt .
the suspects were believed to be users of bylock , an encrypted messaging app which the government says was used by the network of u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen , accused by ankara of orchestrating last july s abortive putsch .
gulen , who has lived in self-imposed exile in pennsylvania since 1999 , denies involvement .
anadolu said security forces were seeking the suspects in 19 provinces across the country .
since the abortive coup , more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over alleged links to gulen , while 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the military , public and private sectors .
rights groups and some of turkey s western allies have voiced concern about the crackdown , fearing the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent .
the government says only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by gulen s network , which it says deeply infiltrated institutions such as the army , schools and courts .
