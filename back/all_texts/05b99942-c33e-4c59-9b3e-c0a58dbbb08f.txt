Trump supporters sure were in for a surprise at the aptly-named Deploraball on Thursday, when protesters projected an unflattering message on the side of the National Press Club just as supporters attempted to sieg heil The Donald without any interruption from those who exist outside their hateful little bubble.As white supremacists, people who love white supremacists, and pro-Trump Sheriff David Clarke joined together in a diverse crowd of white people to celebrate Trump s ascension to Grand Wizard of the U.S. of A., protesters outside had a little bit of fun with technology, projecting the sort of messaging that sends their leader into an uncontrollable Twitter rage.Messages projected on the side of the building where alt-right ball is being held: "Impeach the predatory president" pic.twitter.com/uJiYZGgzey Jack Smith IV (@JackSmithIV) January 20, 2017"Impeach predatory president" projected onto National Press Club as #DeploraBall parties #DisruptJ20 pic.twitter.com/fi5As7UOLp Alexander Rubinstein (@AlexR_DC) January 20, 2017"Impeach the predatory president" pic.twitter.com/reYjg6DCaK Gideon Resnick (@GideonResnick) January 20, 2017On the building: "Impeach the predatory president."

Another urged our leaders to impeach the predatory President.
One of them, which Trump fans would describe as crazy light pictures what has some of them words on them, reminded everyone that Trump routinely brags about grabbing women by their genitals.During these next four years, it is important that we never allow a white supremacist party for a President who got where he by is sowing seeds of fear and spewing hate speech to become normal.
Every time this sort of thing happens, it is our duty to our country to show up and denounce it.
It s going to be rough for us for quite some time, but if we fight hard against the Deplorables and their sick ideology, we can ensure a brighter future for our country some time after 2020.Featured image via Twitter
