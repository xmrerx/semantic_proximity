( reuters ) - kansas governor sam brownback has ordered state officials to cut off funding for planned parenthood and its affiliates through the state medicaid program , a move the organization said on wednesday it would challenge in court .
brownback , a republican , said in his state of the state address on tuesday that he would direct the state health secretary to ensure that no taxpayer money go to planned parenthood , which he said trafficked in baby body parts .
“ no longer will we send the money of hard-working kansans to fund an industry that disrespects life and violates the moral conscience of our people , ” brownback said in a statement .
the governor ’ s statement was an apparent reference to videos secretly recorded by an anti-abortion group that activists said showed that planned parenthood officials in some states had discussed the sale of aborted fetal tissue .
planned parenthood has denied any illegal payments , calling the videos distortions of the issue of fetal-tissue donations .
the organization has said it has received only reimbursements for its costs , which are legal under u.s. law .
the kansas department of health and environment said it would issue a termination letter to planned parenthood of kansas and mid-missouri .
laura mcquade , president and chief executive of the kansas and mid-missouri planned parenthood , said the planned termination would result in a legal battle .
“ kansans and their health care providers are not mr. brownback ’ s punching bag and we will fight back , ” mcquade said .
federal funds can not be used for abortions , but planned parenthood also provides medicaid covered services such as contraception , cancer screening and other care .
several states have sought to cut off funding for planned parenthood following the release of the videos .
courts have blocked some of those attempts at least temporarily in utah , louisiana , alabama and other states .
