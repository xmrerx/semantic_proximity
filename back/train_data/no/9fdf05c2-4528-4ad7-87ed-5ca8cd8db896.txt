kampala ( reuters ) - eight managers and editors of a daily newspaper arrested this week have been charged with treason , ugandan police said on thursday .
police raided the red pepper , uganda s leading tabloid , late on tuesday and detained the journalists , whom they accused of publishing a false story the previous day .
the story , citing unnamed sources , alleged that rwanda believed ugandan president yoweri museveni was plotting to oust its leader , paul kagame .
besides treason , the journalists were charged with offensive communication and publication of information prejudicial to national security , police spokesman emilian kayima told reuters .
kayima couldn t say when the journalists would appear in court .
rights groups and journalists have complained of escalating harassment and intimidation of independent media by security personnel in uganda .
we believe that this is economic sabotage aimed at occasioning the media house financial loss since all its production have been stopped , the human rights network for journalists - uganda ( hrnj-u ) , a local media rights group , said in a statement issued on thursday .
local media , including red pepper , have reported this month on tensions between uganda and neighboring rwanda over a range of economic and security disputes .
uganda s foreign affairs ministry has dismissed the reports as rumors and insisted relations between the two countries were untroubled .
