former secretary of state hillary clinton once requested to fly in a separate plane rather than share one with then-first lady michelle obama , according to newly released emails.the email exchange was part of a new batch of emails that government watchdog judicial watch obtained through a freedom of information act request .
clinton and her top aide , huma abedin , discussed in a july 2011 exchange clinton s plans to attend the funeral of fellow former first lady betty ford in grand rapids , mich. looks like plane won t be an issue , abedin wrote .
also , looks like michelle obama also going .
is it ok [ sic ] that we and mrs. o take two separate planes ?
clinton asked .
i think it s ok [ sic ] .
but let me see what kind of plane she s taking , abedin responded .
i would rather have our own of course , clinton added.the new emails surfaced after other messages , ones released during the 2016 presidential campaign , revealed that clinton and obama s husband , former president barack obama , had an antagonistic relationship .
and she hates that the president ( that man , as the clintons call him ) kicked her ass in 2008 , democratic megadonor jeffrey leeds wrote to former secretary of state colin powell in march 2015 .
she can t believe it or accept it .
leeds also addressed the growing controversy over clinton s use of a private email server at the state department , writing that then-president obama would not care if clinton found herself in legal trouble .
i don t think the president would weep if she found herself in real legal trouble .
she ll pummel his legacy if she gets a chance and he knows it , leeds said.the exchange between clinton and abedin came after another message , one also released during the 2016 election , showed that clinton complained commercial flights were burdensome and asked abedin to get the air force to fly her from westchester , n.y. back to washington , d.c. wfb
