the antifa thugs and anarchists decided to show up today for a rally against hate which we could all be a part of who isn t against hate , right ?
making trump supporters out to be hateful is what they want so desperately but they repeatedly show up to be the ones causing the violence and chaos.antifa in berkeley trying to murder a trump supporter with pipes and sticks .

note the very professional banners they had out today wonder who paid for those ? the problem is that we re on to these rent-a-mob domestic terrorists but why aren t the mayor , cops and those who are in charge in bereley smart enough to put a stop to the violence and bullying by the antifa terrorists ?
can you answer that question ?
if you can , you ve been paying attention to what s happening all across america .
democrat mayors and other leaders see it as an advantage when the cops are told to do nothing when they stand down then the crowd gets more and more violent and then the media finishes the job by lying about who started the violence and who was behind it from the beginning .
see the pattern now ? only a handful of trump supporters and they got beat up for what ? where are the police ?
