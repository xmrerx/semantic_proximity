LONDON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May agreed during a telephone call on Tuesday that China must do more to persuade North Korea to cease its missile tests, a spokesman for May said.
The prime minister and the president agreed on the key role which China has to play, and that it was important they used all the leverage they had to ensure North Korea stopped conducting these illegal acts so that we could ensure the security and safety of nations in the region, he said.
May also said she would also work with EU leaders on further measures the EU could take to pressure the North Korean leadership, the spokesman said.
