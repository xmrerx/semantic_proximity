in the middle of a twitter tantrum directed toward mitch mcconnell , james clapper , democrats and the fake news , donald trump retweeted a bit of light hearted boasting in the form of a meme that shows trump eclipsing president obama.in the meme , trump s beaming color-filled picture eclipses a dour black and white photo of obama.pic.twitter.com/6xjxeg1gss jerry travone ?
( @ jerrytravone ) august 24 , 2017more than a few twitter users saw racist overtones : after all that s happened , this visual is a stark example of white supremacy , literally blotting blackness out .

it must be thursday .
? ? ?
brickhouse ( @ itmfa17 ) august 24 , 2017you forgot to photoshop in trump s white hood and gown .
sarah smith ( @ sarahlsmith677 ) august 24 , 2017how immature & racist is this stupid tweet ?
no jerry trump hasn t done chit but whine & all the twitter memes in the world won t change it mahogany , mba ( @ mahogany1992 ) august 24 , 2017interesting that you would retweet this you should look into who you retweet sir considering you claim to have denounced hate groups ?
pic.twitter.com/bq3umid0on ashleymarie ( @ innocenteyes88 ) august 24 , 2017most , though , saw it as the perfect metaphor for trump s presidency .
in the meme , obama is compared to the sun , which literally sustains all life .
trump is portrayed as a rock that temporarily blocks the light.this is actually correct .
the darkness of trump has overtaken the brightness of obama .
the sun is what gives us life and energy !
ed krassenstein ( @ edkrassen ) august 24 , 2017if so , we are left in the darkness of corruption , collusion , dishonesty , bigotry , and sheer stupidity .
# resist so the sun can shine again !
lorraine devon wilke ( @ lorrainedwilke ) august 24 , 2017the orange sun does not eclipse the moon .
the moon eclipses the sun .
in the case of dt , he will forever be overshadowed by obama !
she speaks ( @ words_echo ) august 24 , 2017eclipses are supposed to go away quickly so can you resign already so we can have the beautiful sun back ?
matthew luis ( @ agtmluis ) august 24 , 2017so you re saying obama is a star like the sun and you re a lifeless rock that s momentarily blotting out his light .
finally a truthful tweet a silver tongue ( @ asilvertongue ) august 24 , 2017other s simply noted trump s pathological obsession with his far superior predecessor.he ll never measure up to obama and he hates it his insecurity/psychopathy renders him beyond unfit for office mouth of sauron ( @ simon_lindsell ) august 24 , 2017dt is eaten up w/envy of @ potus44 .
dt has no hope of being even an inth of the man or president that obama is .
and , learn your science 1/ she speaks ( @ words_echo ) august 24 , 2017 hey , who is that awesome black guy up there whom i want to be just like !
pic.twitter.com/bksbhexdbm sarah smith ( @ sarahlsmith677 ) august 24 , 2017either way , this retweet very nicely sums up everything about trump s reign .
too bad it s lasting so much longer than the eclipse.featured image via screen capture .
