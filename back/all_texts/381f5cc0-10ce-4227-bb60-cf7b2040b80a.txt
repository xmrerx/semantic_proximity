BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Rescuers on Monday found the body of a Belgian army helicopter pilot who had disappeared in a mysterious midair incident at a weekend airshow, local media said.
Investigators are trying to determine how and why the unnamed pilot left the controls of his Agusta A-109 on Sunday and ended up dead hundreds of meters below.
The Belgian Armed Forces said in a statement that the pilot had fallen from the aircraft but that the co-pilot, alone on board, had landed it safely.
Public broadcaster RTBF, quoting public prosecutors, said the co-pilot told them he was watching three skydivers who had just jumped from the helicopter.
When he turned back round, the pilot s seat was empty and the door of the aircraft was open.
