manila ( reuters ) - the philippines relieved its navy commander of duty on tuesday , four months ahead of his retirement , with the armed forces offering no explanation for his removal .
military spokesman colonel edgard arevalo confirmed to reporters that vice admiral ronald joseph mercado was no longer in charge of the 23,000-strong naval forces , but declined to say why .
the reason for this change of command will be explained in due time , arevalo told reporters .
military sources quoted in media reports said mercado s removal was connected to controversy that had surfaced over the procurement of two frigates from south korea , which are due to be delivered by 2020 .
a defence official privy to the decision to remove mercado said it concerned equipment to be purchased for those frigates .
the official told reuters the former navy chief had lost the trust and confidence of defence secretary delfin lorenzana .
lorenzana did not respond to a request for comment on mercado s removal and calls to mercado s mobile phone went unanswered .
there were some policy differences between the defense department and the navy over the 18 billion pesos ( $ 358 million ) acquisition of two brand-new frigates from south korea , the military official said , requesting anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue .
rear admiral robert empedrad was promoted to navy commander at a low-key ceremony at the armed forces headquarters in manila .
congressman gary alejano , a former marine officer , said he would request a formal congressional inquiry take place over the navy s frigate acquisition project , having found mercado s sudden removal unusual .
the philippines is in the midst of a five-year , 125 billion peso ( $ 2.5 billion ) plan to modernise its ill-equipped armed forces , acquiring new boats , planes , helicopters , rifles , radars and communication equipment .
