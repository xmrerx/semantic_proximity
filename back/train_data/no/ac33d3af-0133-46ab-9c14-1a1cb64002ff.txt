the saudi foreign ministry said the government also handed germany s representative in riyadh a protest note over what it said were shameful comments gabriel made after a meeting with his lebanese counterpart .
after a meeting in berlin with lebanese foreign minister gebran bassil , gabriel told reporters that europe could not tolerate the adventurism that has spread there .
it was not clear from a reuters television recording that the remark was targeted at saudi arabia .
lebanese prime minister saad al-hariri resigned while in saudi arabia on nov. 4 .
