After working for months to build a solid white supremacist base, Donald Trump suddenly started focusing on minority outreach last week.
But CNN commentator and New York Times columnist Charles Blow explained just who these efforts are really aimed at, and it isn t African-Americans.According to Blow, Trump s minority outreach isn t aimed at people of color at all.
Rather, his message is targeting white moderate Republicans who have reservations about voting for a raging bigot.
Blow said that this is the most horrible form of bigotry.
It is the kind of bigotry that says, I will knock you down while I pretend to pick you up,' Blow said.
It says that, I m not talking to you, I m talking to the guy behind you or over your shoulder.
It s the kind of bigotry that says, I m urinitaing on you and telling you to dance in the rain.'
Blow said that he has spent the past week trying to find out if Trump s bullsh*t message had resonated with any people of color.
Here s a shocker, it didn t. Blow said this just goes to show that Trump s outreach isn t reaching anybody except for right-leaning whites.
It is the moderate ones who say, I don t want to be the woman/man who votes for the racist guy, and if this guy can now change his opinion, I do want to be conservative, but I don t want to be the conservative who votes for the racist guy, and now he s different,' Blow said.
Actually, he s not different.
He s not talking to us.
He s pretending to talk to us while he talks to you.
This is an insult to all people of color, black, Hispanic and otherwise, because he s using us as pawns, and you do not get an out, Blow continued.
He was a bigot yesterday, he s a bigot today, and he ll be a bigot tomorrow, and if you vote for him, you re voting for a bigot.
That s it.
