gas prices are expected to rise sharply this year , but donald trump thinks a ten-year low for a single day is something he should get credit for.on july 4th , gas prices dropped to an average $ 2.23 a gallon .
it s the lowest it has been on independence day in ten years.so , of course , trump bragged about it.gas prices are the lowest in the u.s. in over ten years !
i would like to see them go even lower .
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) july 4 , 2017keep in mind , we are only halfway through 2017 , and one day does not equal one year.also , presidents do not control gas prices , something conservatives are always hypocritically pointing out when gas prices come down during a democratic presidency or when gas prices are high during a republican presidency .
but when gas prices are low during a republican presidency , conservatives throw that knowledge out the window and claim that the president did it.such is the case now.but trump had nothing to do with current gas prices .
you see , the market has been flooded with oversupply from opec , which has driven the price of gasoline down over the last couple years.in 2015 , the national average price of gas dropped from $ 3.37 in 2014 to $ 2.35.and last year s independence day saw a gas price of $ 2.26 per gallon .
that s a mere three cent difference from the low that trump bragged about yesterday.you didn t hear conservatives giving president obama credit for that .
nor did they give obama credit for the even lower national average of $ 2.20 per gallon in november 2016.but , again , oversupply is the reason why we have cheaper gas right now .
once that supply is burned off , the price of gas will go back up and there s nothing trump can do about it .
one thing he will do , however , is blame anyone and anything else for the rise .
he certainly won t be taking credit or bragging.featured image via michael reynolds-pool/getty images
