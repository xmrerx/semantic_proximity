It would appear Fox News isn t even hiding their blatant racism anymore, nor doing anything about it.Appearing on the cable news network, Fox regular Eric Bolling decided he would go all in and call a black Congresswoman a crack addict, and in the worst way possible.While discussing Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), Bolling says, in the most repugnant way possible: You saw what happened to Whitney Houston.
Step away from the crack pipe.
Step away from the Xanax.
Step away from the Lorazepam.
It s gonna get you in trouble.
Which also insinuates she s going to get herself killed because that s what happened to Whitney Houston.Watch here:Now, if you didn t already think Eric Bolling was a raging racist and absolutely horrible person before, you undoubtedly should now.
And if you don t, maybe take a good, long look in the mirror and have so self-introspection to how horrible you may be yourself.Who the hell talks like this and is still allowed to keep their job?
It s incredibly vile, and unfortunately, not at all surprising.Featured image via video screen capture
