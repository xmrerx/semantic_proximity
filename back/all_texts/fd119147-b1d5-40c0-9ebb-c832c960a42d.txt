Every year the nation s press corps meets in Washington D.C. at the Correspondents Dinner.
A dinner which is always entertaining, to say the least, as President Obama jokes about events that may have happened throughout the past year, and people who have most significantly appeared in the media.This year was no different as the president quipped about each and every presidential candidate, not leaving anyone out.
He also made a joke indicating who he believes will be the president at next year s Correspondents Dinner.Obama said: Next year someone else will be standing here in this spot, and it s anyone s guess who she will be.
Obama clearly insinuated that he believes former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton will not only win the Democratic primary, but also win in November against whoever the Republicans may put up against her.Only time will tell to see if President Obama s prediction will come true, but no matter who the nominee may be on the Democratic ticket, we ve got to make sure liberals unite and against the Republican candidate.
No matter who, vote blue.
Not only for yourself, but for the good of entire nation.Watch the video of Obama s prediction here:Obama: Next year someone else will be here, and "it's anyone guess who she will be" #WHCD https://t.co/6OZtrfIwim https://t.co/w9u1yCIqQv CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) May 1, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
