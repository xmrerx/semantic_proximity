Leaked documents from left-wing financier George Soros s Open Society Foundations continue to reveal the extent to which the group has influenced the political response to Europe s refugee crisis.
Internal documents show OSF used $600,000 in reserve funding in March 2016 to bring pro-refugee positions into the political mainstream.
Jordi Vaquer, OSF s regional director for Europe, approved a $600,000 proposal entitled, Countering the anti-migrant rhetoric and toxic narratives surrounding migration in Europe.
According to OSF documents, half of the $600,000 would go towards lobbying efforts.
All $600,000 came from OSF s Europe Reserve Fund.
A summary of the proposal notes that the proposed reserve fund allocation will allow for additional resources to be allocated towards countering xenophobic attitudes in Europe, move parts of the political mainstream towards more pro-refugee positions, and build constituencies around a more progressive approach to migration and asylum.
