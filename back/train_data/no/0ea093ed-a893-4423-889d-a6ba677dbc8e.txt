rome ( reuters ) - italian magistrates are investigating whether a treasury official sold confidential government information to her previous employers , ernst & young , two judicial sources involved in the case said on wednesday .
magistrates suspect that susanna masi was paid some 220,000 euros ( 195,290.33 ) between 2013-2015 in return for sensitive material , including on planned tax reforms which could have given the professional services firm an unfair advantage over its rivals , the sources said .
masi s lawyer , giorgio perroni , confirmed his client was being investigated but denied she had done anything wrong .
neither ernst & young s italian office , nor lawyers representing the company , responded to requests for comment .
the judicial sources told reuters that magistrates had emails and wiretaps to back up their case .
perroni said he was still waiting to see the case files after which his client would request to meet the investigators .
we are certain that we will be able to demonstrate the correct behaviour of my client and the total lack of foundation of the accusations , perroni told reuters .
masi joined the treasury in 2012 , becoming a tax adviser for the government in 2013 .
in 2015 , she was appointed to the board of equitalia a state-owned tax collection agency while retaining her position within the treasury , her lawyer said .
corriere della sera newspaper , which first reported the story on wednesday , said besides leaking confidential information , masi was also suspected of lobbying on behalf of ernst & young for modifications to the tax code .
corriere said masi worked for ernst & young before joining the treasury .
perroni confirmed she used to work for the company in italy , but did not know the exact dates .
the treasury declined to comment on the case .
