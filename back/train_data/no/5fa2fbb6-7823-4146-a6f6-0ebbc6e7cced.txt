pristina ( reuters ) - a court in kosovo on friday sentenced four people , including a member of parliament , to prison terms ranging from 2 to 8 years for taking part in a grenade attack against the parliament building last year .
the four were found responsible for throwing a rocket propelled grenade at the building in august last year in order to halt adoption of a border deal with montenegro .
no one was injured in the attack .
tensions between opposition parties and the then-ruling coalition rose last summer as the parliament was getting ready to adopt border deal with montenegro , key for kosovo to get visa-free travel regime with the european union .
opposition parties opposed the deal saying the country of 1.8 million is losing land by handing over some 8,000 hectares ( 19,700 acres ) of kosovo territory to montenegro .
in a protest over the deal , opposition deputies released tear gas in the parliament chamber , while its supporters clashed with the police during street protests .
frasher krasniqi , parliament deputy of the biggest opposition party vetevendosje was found guilty and sentenced to 8 years in prison .
adea batusha , 23 , a niece of vetevendosje s leader , was sentenced to two years in prison .
one of the defendants was found dead in his cell in november 2016 before the trial started .
vetevendosje blamed the authorities for this death but police said he killed himself .
for all these unjust judgments , sooner or later , those criminals who ordered these fabricated trials will be held accountable , before the law and before the history , frasher krasniqi wrote in his facebook page after the verdict .
kosovo declared independence from serbia in 2008 , nearly a decade after nato bombing drove serb forces from its territory .
