Americans are waking up.
After being promised Trump would change his tune once elected, the people have been shown that he will not, in any sense of the word, change his tune.He s still the same loud, obnoxious, shady, thin-skinned demagogue he was when he announced his candidacy.It s because of this (and other damning information) that the American people are giving him low approval ratings, and rightly so.
In fact, his approval ratings have hit a record and historic low for any incoming president.A new Gallup Poll shows that 55 percent of Americans hold a negative view of Trump, while 40 percent have a favorable view.According to the poll:President-elect Donald Trump approaches Inauguration Day with a significantly lower favorable rating than his three immediate predecessors received when they were presidents-elect.
Trump s 40% favorable rating is roughly half of what Barack Obama enjoyed before his inauguration in 2009 (78%) and is much lower than the pre-inaugural ratings for George W. Bush (62%) and Bill Clinton (66%) Of the four most recent incoming presidents, Trump is the only president-elect whose unfavorable rating outweighs his favorable score.The best part lies within his own party: he has a lower approval rating from Republicans than any other GOP president.
While George Bush nabbed 97 percent approval among the GOP, Trump only has 82 percent.Like Trump, Mike Pence and Melania Trump also face historic low approval ratings for the vice presidency and first lady respectively.America really hates Donald Trump and his ilk.
That s a start.Congratulations, America, you elected a universally hated fascist who picks fights with John Lewis instead of Vladimir Putin.Gallup summed up what will be the state of the union for the next few months:But he enters office with a significantly more negative image than prior presidents-elect have had and with a less positive image even among those who identify with his own party.
The president-elect s general unpopularity is an unprecedented hurdle, whose impact on his ability to govern remains to be seen.Trump was illegitimately elected, lost the popular vote, and is hated by the American people.
He has absolutely no mandate, no legitimacy, no room to bargain.
