paris ( reuters ) - france s foreign ministry suggested on monday that new sanctions could be imposed on iran if needed over its ballistic missile program .
iran rejected on sunday a call by french president emmanuel macron for talks on tehran s ballistic missiles , saying they were defensive and unrelated to a nuclear agreement with world powers .
as you know , the european union has already placed sanctions on iranian entities involved in the ballistic program , foreign ministry spokeswoman agnes romatet-espagne said .
she was responding when asked to clarify comments made by macron during a trip to the united arab emirates last week about the prospects of possible sanctions with regard to those activities .
if needed , new sanctions could be taken , she said .
the united states accused iran on tuesday of supplying yemen s houthi rebels with a missile that was fired into saudi arabia in july and called for the united nations to hold tehran accountable for violating two u.n. security council resolutions .
saudi arabia and its allies accuse iran of supplying missiles and other weapons to the houthis , saying the arms were not present in yemen before conflict broke out there in 2015 .
iran denies the charges and blames the conflict on riyadh .
french foreign minister jean-yves le drian will be in the saudi capital later this week and intends to travel to iran before the end of the month .
the political dialogue between france and iran is active and makes it possible to address all topics , including strategic and regional issues , romatet-espagne said .
mr le drian will have a firm dialogue when he goes to iran .
