these two presidents could not be more different .
george w. bush is a natural born leader .
he inspires others to consider someone other than themselves , to come together and to unite .
he proves through his actions that we shouldn t be afraid to act as a humble servant of the lord .
barack obama s speech on the other hand , proves he is nothing more than a narcissistic , arrogant and condescending community agitator .
as george w. bush appeals to the better side of america and implores them to come together and heal in the face of heightened racial tensions , obama remains laser focused on himself , and on his insatiable desire to take away our second amendment right .
obama s speech was not geared towards healing a torn and divided community .
his speech was about promoting his radical gun-control agenda .
it was about sound bites , as he waited on cue for applause from a group of people who were there to mourn the loss of their father , their brother , their son or their trusted co-worker.watch george w. bush s eloquent unity speech , honoring the lives of the brave dallas law enforcement officers who were killed at the hands of a racist inspired by the obama-holder-sharpton war on cops and war on white americans : compare g.w .
bush s speech to the divisive , angry and condescending speech from a petulant barack hussein obama who just can t seem to get americans to buy into his final act :
