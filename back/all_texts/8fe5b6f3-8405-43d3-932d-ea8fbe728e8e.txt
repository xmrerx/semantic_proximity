The crew at Saturday Night Live once again did something that will likely send Donald Trump the undeservedly affluent and unstable man-child to whom the nuclear football will be handed off in January into yet another irrational Twitter tantrum.Lately, The Donald s cabinet picks have left many scratching their heads someone who wants to eliminate public schools as Secretary of Education, a climate change denier as head of the EPA, an oil drilling advocate to head up the Department of the Interior, and a white supremacist well anywhere, for example.
To the casual observer, the expert, and anyone who doesn t want to send the country screaming into a death spiral, these may seem like nonsensical picks a rational person would not even consider and they are but at least the SNL cast is here to make us laugh as we do our best not to think about the hellscape into which Trump will do his damnedest to transform America in the next four years.In the newest cold open, Kate McKinnon s Kellyanne Conway announces Trump s pick for the DEA Bryan Cranston s Walter White.
I like his style, White, who knows the DEA better than anyone, inside and out, said after the announcement.
I also like that wall he wants to build.
Nothing comes in from Mexico, meaning, a lot less competition for the rest of us.
Conway added that White is actually a genius with chemicals and we re lucky to get him.
It s time to make America cook again, Cranston says.
We want to fill this nation with red white and a lot of blue.
This segment is hilarious, but it drives home a very important point: Donald Trump seems to be working to undermine various agencies by appointing people who are too unqualified or too evil to run them.Watch the cold open below:
