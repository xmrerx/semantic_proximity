While appearing for the first time on the campaign trail with Hillary Clinton in North Carolina, President Obama stood by her side and brought down the house with a resounding endorsement of the presumptive Democratic nominee for president.
However, before he spoke, Clinton took to the podium first and delivered yet another speech that showed us that she is more than ready to be the next President of the United States.There was a moment during Clinton s speech, however, that was absolutely pure comedy gold, and a brilliant jab at the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald Trump.You may recall, and if you don t, you should, Trump was one of the lead birthers who made the ridiculous claim President Obama wasn t born in the United States.So, while speaking about the president on stage today, Clinton told everyone that she s honored to stay with President Obama, and knows that he s a person who has never forgotten where he came from.
She then looks directly into the camera and says: And Donald, if you re out there tweeting, it s Hawaii.
Haaa!
Mic drop.
Amazing, simply amazing.However, it can t be lost on us that she made a very real point of reminding us all that Trump once demanded to see the president s birth certificate, so clearly him being racist is not anything new.Watch the hilarious jab from Hillary here:Clinton: Obama has never forgotten where he came from, and Donald, if you re out there tweeting, it s Hawaii https://t.co/QBdR5mBnle CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) July 5, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
