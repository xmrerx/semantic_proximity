berlin ( reuters ) - christian lindner , leader of germany s pro-business free democratic party ( fdp ) , distanced himself from a possible three-way coalition with chancellor angela merkel s conservatives and the pro-environment greens after the sept. 24 election .
lindner told german magazine focus in an interview published friday that he saw big hurdles to reaching agreement with the greens on immigration and energy policies , reducing the prospects for a so-called jamaica coalition of the conservatives , greens and the fdp .
in the meantime , i can t imagine a jamaica coalition , lindner told the magazine .
merkel s conservatives were at 37 percent in the latest infratest dimap poll , versus 21 percent for the social democrats ( spd ) , their lowest reading since early january .
the anti-immigration , euro-hostile afd came in unchanged at 11 percent , making it the third-strongest political force , followed by the radical left party with 10 percent and the fdp at 9 percent , while the greens scored 8 percent .
the fractured political landscape could make it hard to form a viable alliance other than the current grand coalition between merkel s cdu/csu and the spd .
political experts say they are skeptical that the other possible option - the jamaica coalition - could work , given significant differences between the parties and the fact that such an alliance has never been tested on the federal level .
lindner s comments to the magazine underscored the problems facing such a coalition .
meanwhile , sahra wagenknecht , head of the radical left party , signaled her willingness to compromise with the spd to permit the possibility of a so-called red , red , green coalition among the spd , left and greens .
of course there can be compromises , wagenknecht told the rnd chain of newspapers , citing labor law and inheritance taxes as possible areas where the left party would be willing to make concessions .
