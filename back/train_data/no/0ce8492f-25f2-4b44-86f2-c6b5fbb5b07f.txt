edinburgh ( reuters ) - british outsourcer g4s has suspended nine members of staff at an immigration removal center while it investigates a bbc report alleging abuse in the treatment of migrants , the company said on friday .
we have received written allegations of abhorrent conduct at brook house and on that basis we have deemed it serious enough to suspend the staff involved , a spokeswoman for g4s said .
she said the company had not yet seen footage of the alleged incidents , however .
bbc panorama , a flagship documentary program , said on its website that an investigation revealed chaos , incompetence and abuse in the treatment of migrants in a program which will be aired next week .
the incident has been reported to the police , the spokeswoman said .
officers were not immediately able to comment .
the kind of behavior alleged is completely unacceptable , and does a great disservice to the vast majority of staff who do a great job in very difficult circumstances , the spokeswoman said .
the issue highlights the difficulty of running sensitive services for the government and the potential reputational damage for outsourcing companies .
earlier this year an investigation at the g4s-run medway secure training centre resulted in allegations of abuse and mistreatment of youngsters .
the center is now run by the government s national offender management service .
brook house , near gatwick airport , is staffed by more than 200 employees and has around 500 occupants .
more than 14,000 people passed through it in the last year .
the unit houses a mix of those who have not fulfilled their visa requirements and criminals who are being deported .
