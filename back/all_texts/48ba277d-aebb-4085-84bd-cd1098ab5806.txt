The #NeverTrump movement from sane Republicans who know what an absolute disaster a Donald Trump presidency would be for both their party and this nation and world is all but dead.
The spineless morons at the top of the GOP leadership, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and the #2 Republican Mitch McConnell, along with many others, have lined up behind the orange monster like obedient toy soldiers, despite the fact that Trump becomes more outrageous and embarrassing by the day.
However, there is one veteran Republican who is still staunchly #NeverTrump longtime GOP consultant Rick Wilson.Wilson took to his twitter account to slam his own party s leadership over their endorsement of Trump, and it was absolutely glorious.
He even gave Trump a new name Cheeto Jesus and ripped his colleagues a new one in the best way possible.1/ How the actual fuck does anyone at the RNC have standing to act shocked that Trump is not doing the basics of campaigning?
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) June 16, 20162/ You can't elide over his utter dipshittery.
No matter how much you try to act surprised, you own this.
You're covered in his stench.
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) June 16, 20163/ History will be so cruel to you.
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) June 16, 20164/ Your off the record sniping and grumbling is no substitute for moral courage.
That's so DC.
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) June 16, 20165/ You won't escape the stain.
It's like a big, visible "No Ragrets" chest tat that will mark your careers forever.
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) June 16, 20166/ Go public.
Man up.
Show courage.
Say what's in your hearts; he's insane.
He's poison.
He's doomed.
He's killing the Party.
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) June 16, 20167/ None of you are good enough to spin the unspinnable ratfuck that is Trump.
None of you can say, "I was just following orders."
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) June 16, 20168/ This weekend, people were lined up hundreds deep to give blood to the victims of Orlando.
Your Cheeto Jesus was praising himself.
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) June 16, 20169/ There is no better Trump.
There is not Presidential Trump.
He is a vile stain on the this Republic.
Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) June 16, 201610/ Your resumes will always read "Worked for a batshit crazy crypto-fascist who destroyed the GOP" Rick Wilson (@TheRickWilson) June 16, 2016And there you have it.
Trump continues to cause massive division within the RNC and the GOP at large, despite RNC chairman Reince Priebus s claims to the contrary.
Rick Wilson is right.
Go ahead, GOP leadership.
Stay on the Trump Train.
But remember you lie down with Cheeto Jesus, and his stain lies with you forever.
Either do the right thing, or listen to the sounds of the death knells for all of your careers.Featured image via Andrew Burton/Getty Images
