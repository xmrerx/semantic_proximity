ankara ( reuters ) - leading turkish and u.s. businesses urged the governments of turkey and the united states on tuesday to resolve a series of diplomatic rows that have prompted both countries to cut back on issuing visas to each other s citizens .
turkey has fumed over what it sees as u.s. reluctance to extradite muslim cleric fethullah gulen , accused by ankara of orchestrating an abortive military coup last year , and over u.s. support for the syrian kurdish ypg militia , seen by turks as an extension of the outlawed kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) .
gulen denies any connection with the coup bid .
the turkish-u.s. business council ( taik ) called on the u.s. and turkish governments to engage in talks to resolve the rows and prevent harm to both of their economies and citizens .
we call on the governments of turkey and america to enter into discussions to reach a meaningful resolution to the existing differences so that neither of our peoples or economies suffer , taik said in a statement .
relations sank to a new low with the arrest of a second u.s. consular worker earlier this month over alleged links to last year s coup attempt .
the statement by taik , a council comprised of leading turkish and u.s. corporations such as ford , microsoft , and turkish airlines , was the latest in a series of appeals to the nato allies to settle their differences .
but president tayyip erdogan has not retreated from the row , castigating washington over democracy issues in comments that may further dim hopes of a resolution .
