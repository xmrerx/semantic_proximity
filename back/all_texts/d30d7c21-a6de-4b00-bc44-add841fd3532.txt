There is most definitely no love lost between GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan.
This is especially true since Trump was caught on tape with then- Access Hollywood host Billy Bush having an extremely lewd conversation about women and bragging about sexual assault.
Ryan uninvited Trump from their joint campaign event the next day.
Trump has since been publicly attacking Ryan on Twitter, and he continued that trend Sunday.Here are the tweets Trump sent out, while the spineless speaker did nothing to control his own nominee:The Democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked Hillary Clinton.
We have Paul Ryan, always fighting the Republican nominee!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016Paul Ryan, a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016Even while attacking Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, Trump couldn t leave Ryan out of it:Wow, interview released by Wikileakes shows "quid pro quo" in Crooked Hillary e-mail probe.Such a dishonest person & Paul Ryan does zilch!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) October 16, 2016If Trump s previous public feuds and personal grievances are any indication, his obsession with Paul Ryan will not be ending anytime soon.
In fact, it will likely go right up to election day, and Trump will blame his loss on Ryan, along with the media, the Democrats, Hillary Clinton, the women making accusations against him, and everyone but himself.
Buckle your seat belt for this one Speaker Ryan.
You re definitely in for a rough ride.Featured image via Sarah Rice/Getty Images
