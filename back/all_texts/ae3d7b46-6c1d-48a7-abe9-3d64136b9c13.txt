It s no secret that Terry McAuliffe is closely connected to the Clintons.
Right before the election for governor of Virginia, a small scandal arose involving Hillary Clinton s brother and a Chinese company.
It s another pay to play where a visa was given for a donation.
Well, Terry McAuliffe was involved in this scandal but the press did a great job of covering it up.
Now it seems that the FBI might have a hand in digging up this information that we tried to call attention to.
Remember that part of the effort to get McAuliffe into office was for the Virginia governor to deliver the state for Hillary in 2016.
Well, fast forward and McAuliffe is trying to return voting rights to felons.
The GOP is suing to void McAuliffe s order.
Good timing, huh!Virginia Democratic Gov.
Terry McAuliffe is the subject of an ongoing investigation by the FBI and prosecutors from the Justice Department s public integrity unit, U.S. officials briefed on the probe say.The investigation dates to at least last year and has focused, at least in part, on whether donations to his gubernatorial campaign violated the law, the officials said.
McAuliffe wasn t notified by investigators that he is a target of the probe, according to the officials.
The Governor will certainly cooperate with the government if he is contacted about it, said Marc Elias, attorney for McAuliffe campaign, in a statement to CNN.
As part of the probe, the officials said, investigators have scrutinized McAuliffe s time as a board member of the Clinton Global Initiative, a vehicle of the charitable foundation set up by former President Bill Clinton.There s no allegation that the foundation did anything improper; the probe has focused on McAuliffe and the electoral campaign donations, the officials said.
Spokespeople for the Justice Department and the FBI declined to comment.Read more: CNN
