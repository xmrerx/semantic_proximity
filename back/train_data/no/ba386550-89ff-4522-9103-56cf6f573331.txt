number one , josh earnest has absolutely no clearance or visibility in the fbi investigation .
number two , they say it really seems part of a troubling pattern from the white house because the president earlier said he did not see any national security implications to the clinton emails and then we found out he had never been briefed.here s the clip : https : //youtu.be/k_cnn0cbe_g
