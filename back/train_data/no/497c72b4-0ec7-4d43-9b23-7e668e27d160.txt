in the wake of the horrific orlando shooting that targeted the lgbtq venue pulse nightclub , most gop politicians have avoided any mention of the fact that this was an anti-lgbtq hate crime .
they can t say anything about it ; after all , because they share much of the same sort of intolerance as the shooter did .
however , their presumptive nominee made a massive mistake in the wake of all of this , and actually made the laughable claim that he would be a better ally to lgbtq people than hillary clinton would .
that s a pretty funny claim , considering the fact that his party is full of gay hating imbeciles , and they have written anti-gay hate into their official party platform.none of that phases trump though , and he took to his twitter account to try to cozy up to the gays : thank you to the lgbt community !
i will fight for you while hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs .
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) june 14 , 2016well , the lgbtq community on twitter was having none of it , and the # lgbtqhatestrumpparty hashtag was born .
the tweets are just as fabulous as you would expect .
here are just a few of the best ones : make america great again = `` a time when opportunity and dignity were reserved for some , not for all . ''

( @ girlsreallyrule ) june 15 , 2016and the tweets keep rolling in .
trump is no friend of lgbtq people , as no goper could ever be a true friend to us .
it s just more pandering and lies .
it s especially silly to suggest he d be better for lgbtq people than hillary considering that democrats have full lgbtq equality as part of their official party platform , while the gop has nothing but hate for queer people in theirs.so , don t believe the orange monster , folks .
