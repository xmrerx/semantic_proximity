rudi gets it !
the former mayor of new york speaks out on the horrible obama foreign policy and how it created isis : this did not have to happen if our policies were different .
if president obama had listened to senator mccain and senator graham and a whole group of other people , and had set up a no-fly zone in syria five years ago if we had gone in and worked with the syrian legitimate rebels if we had not taken our troops out of iraq and afghanistan , isis never would have emerged .
isis is filling a vacuum created by a vacuous foreign policy isis is an obama creation .
