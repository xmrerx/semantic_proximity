manila ( reuters ) - mae paner is a policeman-turned-assassin , a widowed zumba dancer , a photojournalist and an orphaned child .
they are all characters in her new one-woman show against a bloody war on drugs in the philippines .
paner , better known by her stage name juana change , said she wanted to add her voice to the condemnation of president rodrigo duterte s fierce 15-month-old campaign which has killed thousands of people .
i feel very strongly that we have our work cut out for us as artists to wake people up , to wake our president up , and to tell him that we are against his war on drugs , paner told reuters television .
paner portrays four characters who are affected by the drugs war , from the assassin grappling with his guilt and the journalist scarred by images of the nightly carnage , to widows and orphans crying out for justice .
filipinos remain largely supportive of the campaign as a solution to tackling rampant crime , which duterte says stems mostly from drug addiction .
human rights groups , the catholic church and opposition lawmakers have raised alarm about the killings that have focused largely on the urban poor and have not spared young people .
more than 3,800 people have been killed in police anti-drugs operations in the past 15 months and at least 2,100 other homicides were likely drug related .
police reject allegations by human rights groups that they are executing suspected users and dealers .
some audience members who watched a recent performance of paner s play said they hoped it would prompt filipinos to ask questions about the drugs war .
the more this play is staged - wherever it may be shown , wherever more people can watch it - the more people can think and have much more informed opinions on this matter , said pastor kakai pamaran .
