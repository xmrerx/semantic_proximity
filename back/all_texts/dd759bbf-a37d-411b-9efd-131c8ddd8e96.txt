Uh oh, you guys, President Obama is in trouble!
On Friday, Donald Trump expressed outrage outrage that he had not yet been briefed on his best friend Putin s campaign to hack his political opponents for him and effectively install a living container of Tang as a puppet-President when NBC received a summary of the report.
Sure, the actual, current President saw the report before the media was informed about some details, but The Donald genuinely believes that he should have been briefed before his scheduled Friday meeting.Now, I know what you re thinking: why is Trump suddenly so interested in the intelligence briefings he has skipped religiously since forever.
Well, this involves him and his feigned outrage simply gives him another excuse to attack Everyone But Putin.
In fact, while Trump doesn t want anyone to look into Russia s interference with our election, he is demanding an investigation into the leaked report.
That s right he doesn t like leaks now.I am asking the chairs of the House and Senate committees to investigate top secret intelligence shared with NBC prior to me seeing it.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017This tweet was sent out shortly before Trump was scheduled to receive his own briefing.
Naturally, the rest of the world caught on to the fact that he wants Congress to investigate President Obama and any others who may have leaked the information an interesting turn in opinion on leaks, given his success with his partner Putin during the time running up to the election..@realDonaldTrump Good for you, sweetie!
But using the legislative branch of the US Government to fix your media grudges seems a bit much.
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump If you want to be the first to see top secret stuff, maybe it would be a good idea to show up at your daily intel briefing.
Just a thought Ethan Embry (@EmbryEthan) January 6, 2017You want to investigate your own government, but not Russian hacking.
Got it.
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/rsNyB3D8YE Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump Fuck off Nicole Sandler (@nicolesandler) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump You going to ask them to investigate how Rudy and Flynn knew about the email hack before it happened too?
Emma Kennedy (@EmmaKennedy) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump are you going to ask them to investigate Russia as well?
Of course not Roland Scahill (@rolandscahill) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump you blow off your meetings and trash the CIA to defend Russia.
What did you think would happen Molly Knight (@molly_knight) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump Trump addressing chairs pic.twitter.com/fx8WmPAZXZ sam morrison (@SamTheCobra) January 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump Good idea.
Go after NBC while you protect Putin.
Your priorities are clear as day.

@realDonaldTrump probably because you're implicated in the report, you racist, misogynistic little traitor.
OccupythePort (@occupytheport) January 6, 2017To be clear, the White House denies all responsibility for notifying the media not of top secret information as Trump claims, but of the basics: intelligence agencies have identified multiple Russians they can confirm as having delivered information to Julian Assange meaning Assange lied when he claimed the info did not come from Russia, and Trump lied repeatedly while mindlessly parroting those claims while taking no interest in the actual investigation.Friday afternoon, White House spokesman Josh Earnest noted that Trump tweeted a steadfast defense of the integrity of Wikileaks, a website run by an alleged rapist who has been hiding from charges for years, and noted that Julian Assange is the leading purveyor of the release of classified material.While Earnest did not directly accuse Trump of being involved in the hack, he told the press that Trump s tweet-demand for investigations leads me to conclude that his concerns are about something other than protecting classified information.
