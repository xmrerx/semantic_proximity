Sen. John McCain(R-Ariz.) dug himself into a hole on Meet The Press when he was asked to respond to this tweet by the President.The FAKE NEWS media (failing @nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC, @CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is the enemy of the American People!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 17, 2017McCain essentially said that he in no way agrees with the President s position, and thinks an adversarial press is a natural thing.
I guess the idea of an impartial press has been taken off the table altogether.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1J_X0gn9Bk0As you can see, McCain got a taste of what President Trump has been experiencing near the end of the interview with the host attempting to twist his words.While we can admire the politician s optimism, the fact that the news media is biased doesn t go away just because you don t like the person who said it.
