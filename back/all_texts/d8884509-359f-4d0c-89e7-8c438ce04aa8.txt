The prospect of President Obama and his family being replaced in the White House by Donald Trump and his family is a very depressing thought to millions of Americans, including comedian Chelsea Handler.During her show on Netflix this week, Handler lamented that we will soon have to say goodbye to the current First Family only to see a new family move in.
I was midway through the debate when it hit me, we re going to have to say goodbye to the greatest family on the planet, Handler said before putting up an image of the Duggar family and continuing, And no I m not talking about these assholes.
Handler then went after Donald Trump and his version of family values.
While Hillary Clinton and potential First Gentleman Bill Clinton play with balloons on stage, rotten apricot Donald Trump would rather play with his daughter s balloons.
Handler admitted that she isn t a fan of children but conceded that Sasha and Malia Obama are the exception.
Look at them playing with their dog Bo!
Isn t that cute?
Handler said before comparing the Obama girls to Trump s sons Eric and Donald Jr. Now, let s take a look at how the Trump boys play with animals, Handler said as a photo of the two Trumps holding up a cheetah they killed appeared on the screen.
Two assholes in their natural habitat, she quipped.Handler went on to list some of President Obama accomplishments and wished that he could run for a third term.Here s the video via YouTube:Handler isn t the only one who has slammed Trump s sons for using their daddy s wealth to kill animals instead of using it to help protect them for future generations to enjoy.Madonna slammed them earlier this month on her Instgram.
How Big of [a] Pussy Do you have to BE to kill this Noble Animal for sport?
Madonna wrote.
Just ask Donald Trump Jr and his brother Eric.
