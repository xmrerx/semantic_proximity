lima ( reuters ) - peru said on monday that it was expelling north korea s ambassador over the country s refusal to heed the world s constant calls to end its nuclear program .
the ambassador , kim hak-chol , has five days to leave peru , the foreign affairs ministry said in a statement .
earlier this month north korea launched its biggest nuclear bomb test , prompting global condemnation as u.s. president donald trump said appeasement would not work .
peru stressed that it was committed to a peaceful solution to the dispute and strict compliance with resolutions passed by the united nations security council .
the un security council is set to vote on monday to impose new sanctions on north korea after the united states watered down the text of a resolution to appease china and russia .
peru said it would carry out all diplomatic efforts aimed at denuclearizing the north korean peninsula .
peru s announcement follows a similar move by mexico last week and u.s. vice president mike pence s public call last month for latin american nations to isolate pyongyang .
north korea s embassy in lima declined comment .
