DNC Chair Tom Perez is a fear mongering racist who likes to stir up fake concerns for Democrat voters.
He s clearly afraid of the voter integrity policy of Trump who wants to clean up voter lists.
What s wrong with that?
Tom Perez has a long history of fear mongering and racism Judge Jeanine ripped into the Dem Chair tom Perez for his blistering speech (see video below) on how Donald Trump doesn t stand for our values and that we must resist .

His track record is full on radical.
e s in cahoots with Obama to continue the fundamental transformation of America.
Anyone who s a Democrat should be shocked that he s taking the party in such a far left direction.
Do your research and you ll know why he was the choice for Dem Chair.He just fired all Democrat Party staffers and is bringing in all new people.
The party is clearly taking a new direction and it s not a good one for any American.
