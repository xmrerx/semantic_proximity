In case you were unaware, Sean Spicer has spent much of the week attempting to justify his claim that Adolf Hitler wasn t as bad of a guy as everyone says because he drove people to concentration camps sorry, Holocaust centers rather than just gas them in town like Assad does.
We didn t use chemical weapons in World War II, Spicer, apparently under the impression that Passover needed a little bit of Holocaust denial from the White House press secretary, said Tuesday.
You know, you had someone as despicable as Hitler who didn t even sink to using chemical weapons.
I think when you come to sarin gas, he was not using the gas on his own people the same way that Assad is doing, Spicer later said in an attempt to clarify his remarks, forgetting about all those gas chambers in what he calls Holocaust centers (or, of course, the mobile execution vans).
Spicer continued to apologize throughout the week, but for some inexplicable reason found himself unable to undo the damage he did when he decided that Hitler wasn t such a bad guy after all.Spicer s Hitler week had all the makings of a perfect Saturday Night Live sketch, and Melissa McCarthy did not disappoint.
Dressed as Spicer in his Easter Bunny costume (if you didn t know, he played the role of the egg-delivering Easter hero during the Bush years)McCarthy s Spicer admitted that he finally made a mistake with the Hitler gaffe.
Everybody was like boo hoo, well what about the Holocaust centers?'
Yeah, I know they re not really called Holocaust centers Duh, I know that.
I m aware, Spicer added.
I clearly meant to say, concentration clubs, ok?
Let it drop.
It would be really great if the nitpickers could try and see the big picture and didn t focus on every little slur and lie I say, Spicey said.
That d be nice.
We won t ruin any more of it for you.
