santiago ( reuters ) - chile said on tuesday that it would beef up border policing ahead of a wave of visitors likely to arrive in the country from argentina next month during a visit of pope francis .
with less than three weeks until the pope s arrival , chilean authorities said they were working with the roman catholic church to prepare for an onslaught of tourists at the peak of the austral summer , a traditional time for vacationing in both countries .
we are going to see a record number of ( foreign ) visitors , reginaldo flores , the head of the interior ministry s border crossings unit , told reporters .
starting in chile on jan. 15 , the argentine pontiff will go to the cities of santiago , temuco and iquique , before heading to peru , where he will stop in lima , puerto maldonado and trujillo .
a planned mass in the chilean capital of santiago is expected to attract more than 500,000 people .
thousands of police officers will be present , officials said .
since his election to lead the world s 1.2 billion roman catholics in 2013 , francis , the first latin american pope , has visited brazil , bolivia , ecuador , paraguay , cuba and mexico , but has not made a pastoral trip to argentina .
