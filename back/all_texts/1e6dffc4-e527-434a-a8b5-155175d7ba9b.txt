Our Homeland Security Director gave us all the lowdown on the refugee program and it s what we all thought: ISIS has been trying to use the refugee program to come to America.
Why in the heck are we still trying to bring refugees here?
Can t we help them in the Middle East?
The only thing I can guess is that this is Obama s agenda and he s not letting up on fulfilling it.
The State Department and UN are pushing refugees through the system as fast as possible.
This is big, big business for the Refugee Resettlement contractors ho get paid per refugee and then get millions from the feds on top of that.
The kicker is that YOU pay for the goodies the refugees get once they re here.
That s why America is a global magnet for refugees!
