following the end of every term for the supreme court , scotusblog , which is in no way run by the supreme court , inevitably finds itself under attack from people who disagree with the rulings .
many of the trolls who are on the warpath are , predictably , conservatives , and they re attacking in part because they think that scotusblog s twitter account is the official twitter account for the supreme court.scotusblog could handle this by ignoring it .
they don t. they d rather have fun with the trolls , especially when they re trolled so hard that their account gets suspended .
they ve done this for several years without a problem , and they even warned everyone in the twitterverse about what they were going to do.you have one minute to unfollow us before we fill your twitter feed .
scotusblog ( @ scotusblog ) june 27 , 2016the supreme court only has eight justices this year , which could have resulted in tied votes on a lot of cases .
thanks in part to justice anthony kennedy , who has long acted as a swing vote on the bench , many of these decisions were actual decisions .
in the spirit of the situation , scotusblog decided they should explain what was really going on , considering these trolls seriously mistake them for the supreme court .
# breaking : facing constitutional crisis , in an unprecedented move , a blog was named to the empty ninth seat on the supreme court .
scotusblog ( @ scotusblog ) june 27 , 2016after a couple of false starts , the trolling commenced with some conspiracy silliness .
from there , it was mostly downhill for the trolls , and fun for scotusblog.we have no comment on the claims we are illuminati .
