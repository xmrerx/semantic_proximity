reuters hurricane irma deadly devastating force nature rapidly coalesce lowpressure blip west africa one powerful atlantic storm record follow unhindered atmospheric path feed unusually warm sea
combination many factor expert say friday set stage irma formation help storm achieve -PRON- full thermodynamic potential create monster tropical cyclone wreak havoc eastern caribbean may inflict widespread damage florida
-PRON- get lucky say john knaff meteorologist physical scientist national oceanic atmospheric administration noaa
storm goldilock environment major hurricane
-PRON- bad luck whoever -PRON- path go
brian kahn atmospheric scientist cloud specialist nasa jet propulsion laboratory call ocean condition spawn irma absolutely ideal
balmy water temperature along irma trajectory run deep beneath surface slightly high normal much degree fahrenheit place provide ample fuel storm development scientist say
irma also encounter little interference form wind shear sudden change vertical wind velocity blunt storm intensity -PRON- advance 10 18 mile per hour ideal pace hurricane
-PRON- fortuitous path least resistance essentially ordain wellplaced atmospheric ridge high pressure steer storm happenstance caribbean warm water well area mostly devoid wind shear
result gargantuan storm rapidly grow category 5 top saffirsimpson scale hurricane strength sustained wind 185 mile per hour forceful ever document open atlantic
-PRON- also rank one five atlantic hurricane know achieve wind speed past 82 year
irma lash cuba bahamas -PRON- drive toward florida friday hit eastern caribbean -PRON- treesnappe wind torrential rain pounding surf kill least 21 people leave catastrophic destruction -PRON- wake
friday night irma wind diminish 155 mile per hour 250 kph -PRON- downgrade category 4 storm though still consider extremely dangerous
tiny island directly cross irma like barbuda st martin little weaken -PRON- storm intensity could measurably diminish close encounter large land mass cuba en route us mainland scientist say
powerful irma -PRON- may end dampen another category 4 storm -PRON- wake hurricane jose like irma originate west coast africa follow similar course
water already ply irma could leave bit cooler robbing jose potential energy outflow irma could produce wind shear jose say scott braun research meteorologist nasa goddard space flight center
knaff say -PRON- surprise advent irma coincide precise peak atlantic hurricane season
much less certain role global climate humaninduced atmospheric increase heattrappe greenhouse gas scientist say
consensus climate change raise sea level likely exacerbate hurricane storm surge
rise ocean temperature clearly document well
research divide whether global warming make tropical cyclone frequent though datum climate modeling suggest high probability strong wetter hurricane atlantic -PRON- occur say tom knutson climate research scientist noaa
-PRON- think base model simulation climate change effect make storm slightly intense high rainfall rate change huge -PRON- yet clearly detect -PRON- observation -PRON- say
