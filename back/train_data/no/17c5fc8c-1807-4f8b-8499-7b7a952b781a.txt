beijing ( reuters ) - chinese president xi jinping told president emmanuel macron on friday he hoped france could play a constructive role in restarting talks on north korea , state tv said .
the french presidency said the two leaders had agreed in a telephone call on the need to put more international pressure on pyongyang to get it back to the negotiating table and avoid a dangerous escalation .
chinese tv quoted xi as saying : the korean peninsula nuclear issue in the end can only be resolved through peaceful means , including through dialogue and consultations .
north korea has tested a string of missiles this year , including one flying over japan , and conducting its sixth and biggest nuclear test on sunday .
china hosted on-again , off-again six-party talks on north korea , including japan , russia , the united states and the two koreas , that fizzled out in 2008 .
experts believe the isolated regime is close to its goal of developing a powerful nuclear weapon capable of reaching the united states , something u.s. president donald trump has vowed to prevent .
xi discussed north korea in calls with trump on wednesday and german chancellor angela merkel on thursday .
trump has urged china , north korea s only major ally , to do more to rein in its neighbor .
