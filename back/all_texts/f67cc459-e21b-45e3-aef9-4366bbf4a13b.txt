Donald Trump just unleashed an attack on any and all Americans who have a problem with his cozy relationship with Putin.
Sure, Russia in an effort directly spearheaded by the Russian dictator hacked our election with the intent of effectively installing Donald Trump in the Oval Office.
Sure, this has been confirmed by more than a baker s dozen intelligence agencies.
Sure, Trump, who very publicly asked Russia to hack his opponents, has been informed of this himself.
But according to him, all that matters is that we kiss Vladdy Poot s (we imagine this to be his cute little nickname for his Russian sugar daddy) ring and you re stupid if you feel otherwise.
Having a good relationship with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing.
Only stupid people, or fools, would think that it is bad!
We .. Trump tweeted, still failing to grasp the intracacies of the use of ellipses (It s three dots, not four or twelve, Donald!
), have enough problems around the world without yet another one.
When I am President, Russia will respect us far more than they do now and .
He added in a third tweet, both countries will, perhaps, work together to solve some of the many great and pressing problems and issues of the WORLD!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 7, 2017Of course, one of the world s problems is that Russia directly interfered with a sovereign nation s election at an unprecedented level, according to the report Trump received.
Naturally, Americans who have a problem with a foreign power interfering especially at this level in our election don t exactly enjoy the President-elect calling them stupid for caring about the integrity of the electoral process:@realDonaldTrump Russia just made a mockery of the US election.
Only a "fool" would think that's the sign of a good relationship.
Letters of Note (@LettersOfNote) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump So now you are calling Americans stupid.
Fannnntastic!
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump Only someone without real friends (you!!!)
would solicit the friendship of a dictator like Putin.
Ben Berkon (@BenBerkon) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump Donald, they hacked the US.
The only reason you re cheerleading for Putin is because he gave you the win.
Emma Kennedy (@EmmaKennedy) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump a good relationship is one thing.
Being in the pocket of, is quite another.
What do they have on you?
Helen Kennedy (@HelenKennedy) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump We've come to the conclusion that you'd be better off w a pacifier, blankie and straitjacket.
Certifiably batsh*t CRazY??

@realDonaldTrump Do two countries have "a good relationship" when one country tries to influence the free and fair elections in the other?
Simon Hedlin (@simonhedlin) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump Most of my good relationships don't involve the other person HACKING INTO MY PRIVATE DATA AND SABOTAGING MY FUCKING LIFE.

pic.twitter.com/FeDrxi8KEB Don Moynihan (@donmoyn) January 7, 2017Look, we get it.
Your love for Russia and disdain for our intelligence agencies is clear.
But why constantly reminded us?
@realDonaldTrump Big Lee ??

@realDonaldTrump they interfered in our election.
Why would we want 2 have a good relationship w/them?
Kelly Herself ?
(@Kelly_Herself) January 7, 2017.
@realDonaldTrump also, calling Americans who disagree with you "stupid" is not awesome.
Kelly Herself ?
(@Kelly_Herself) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump We want a good relationship with Russia, you idiot.
Part of that is them not interfering in our elections!
Tom Coates (@tomcoates) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump The Russians interfering with our election defines a terrible relationship.
Only a fool fails to see this.
Keith Fitzgerald (@Oldfitz) January 7, 2017Mr.
Trump, I want you to stop insulting me and my family.
And my fellow patriots.
#MAGA @realDonaldTrump Greg Laden (@gregladen) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump You want to get in bed w/ Putin a murderous thug?
Is that so he won't spill the beans about your Russian business dealings?
Not Maureen Dowd (@MaureenDowdTwit) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump There's a difference between diplomacy and sleeping with the enemy!
You're still in Putin's bed.
Auntie B (@b_auntie) January 7, 2017@realDonaldTrump You sure are working hard clutching your ankles for Putin.
Shameful traitor.
Kay (@karleenflem) January 7, 2017Yes, ideally, we should want a good relationship with every country, but Trump somehow doesn t consider it a problem that Putin directly ordered an interference in our election that likely helped him win.
To Trump, his personal benefit is more important than the good of our nation.
And we re stupid, right?Featured image via Getty Images (Drew Angerer)/screengrab
