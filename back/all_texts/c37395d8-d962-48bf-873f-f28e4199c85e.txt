Donald Trump has this tough guy syndrome that makes it impossible for him to resist doing and saying incredibly stupid things.
It has garnered him a lot of attention from the low-hanging fruit he calls a base, who love his stance on discrimination and approval of brutish violence.
Watching Trump rise is eerily similar to 1936 Germany in far too many ways.Included in the Donald Trump school of narcissism for the wealthy is a call to do whatever it takes to get rid of every terrorist on earth.
Not only should we remove every Muslim from the country and deny re-entry to anyone wanting to come back just until we have things figured out, we should also engage in torture again and murder the families of known terrorists.It all sounds like a cool scene out of a mobster movie for the common idiot who thinks beating each other up until someone says uncle is the way society should run.
In the real world, it s a violation of every international law and treaty we belong to, which as former General and CIA/NSA Director Michael Hayden explains to Bill Maher, is enough to cause the armed forces to refuse those orders, as they are required to do by law.You see, Donald, we can t have rich dudes playing reality TV with our lives, our country, our planet, or our future.
It doesn t really suit anyone at any level.
That s why our country has, along the way, put safeguards in place so megalomaniacs can t buy their way to power and just blow up the world because they can and they know they ll have a really cool bunker.What is truly scary is that the Republican party, in its desperation to stay relevent, decided to embrace the hate of the people who support Trump.
They have no choice anymore but to accept that what started out as a really bad joke could turn into a reality pretty quickly, opening the door for such qualified future GOP candidates as James Woods, Chuck Norris, Clint Eastwood and the late Charlton Heston, appearing through the magic of Disney.At least their insanity won t go far.
