danang , vietnam ( reuters ) - vietnam released water from seven dangerously full reservoirs on tuesday to avoid further flooding , after a weekend typhoon killed nearly 90 people .
authorities said particular effort was being made to avoid flooding around the city of danang , which will host u.s. president donald trump , china s xi jinping and russia s vladimir putin among asia-pacific leaders at a summit this week .
water was being released from seven reservoirs , in line with a flood relief plan , the steering committee for disaster prevention said , and observers had been posted at major reservoirs to monitor water levels constantly .
typhoon damrey , which struck on saturday , was the 12th major storm of the year .
eighty-nine people were known to have died because of the storm , 18 people were missing and 174 people were injured , the search and rescue committee said .
as much as 1,700 mm ( 67 inches ) of rain was recorded at one weather station in the week to monday .
rains are expected to continue until wednesday before reducing on thursday .
asia pacific economic cooperation ( apec ) meetings began in danang on monday , and trump , xi and putin are due to join other regional leaders at the main summit on friday and saturday .
the schedule of meetings has not been disrupted by the rain , but the leaders spouses may not be able to make a planned excursion to the unesco heritage town of hoi an on saturday .
waters in the streets rose to head height at the weekend , although they had subsided somewhat by tuesday .
because of its long coastline , vietnam is prone to destructive storms and flooding .
floods killed more than 80 people in northern vietnam last month , while a typhoon wreaked havoc in central provinces in september .
the storm hit a key coffee-growing region of the world s biggest producer of robusta coffee beans near the start of the harvest .
but farmers in daklak , the heart of the region , said the damage was limited .
