Let me talk about this little coward thing for a second.
The word coward is usually used by people who have done most of the htings that you ve done: like embellishing lies about your credentials as a journalist, like the fact that your own daughter in a testimony in a court case according to the Washington Post, said that you dragged your ex-wife down a flight of stairs, you want to talk about coward homeboy, and you point a finger this way, look at the three that are coming back.
We know who the coward is.
Williams went on to point out his service in the military while noting that O Reilly skipped his service.O Reilly has often played the bully on his successful Fox News show.
