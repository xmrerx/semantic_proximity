Republicans should be ashamed of themselves and that s the exact message one GOP lawmaker clearly received during a town hall in Louisiana.On Wednesday, Senator Bill Cassidy insulted his constituents by arriving half an hour late to his own town hall.
That gave voters extra time to get angrier.When he finally arrived, Cassidy tried to deliver a PowerPoint presentation about the supposed Republican plan to replace the Affordable Care Act, a plan that pretty much boils down to if you get sick and you can t afford health care you die.But once he entered the door, a woman made sure Cassidy knew about a kid who was uninsurable.Woman tells this child is uninsurable, pointing to child standing next to her, as @BillCassidy walks in.

Over 30 million Americans have been able to get insurance because of the law.
By repealing it, Republicans are handing down a death sentence to millions of people, many of whom are their own voters.
Americans would also face financial ruin because of the repeal.Cassidy s constituents were not interested in hearing about a useless Republican plan so they shamed him by turning their backs on him during the presentation, which forced him to take questions instead.Constituents turn their back on @BillCassidy as he goes through a PowerPoint of his Obamacare replacement.

Townhall ends, @BillCassidy says, and crowd starts chanting do your job pic.twitter.com/5RtVwvwCNo Caitlin Owens (@caitlinnowens) February 22, 2017Here s the full town hall via YouTube.Republicans are not repealing the Affordable Care Act because they care about our healthcare.
They only care about tearing down the legacy of America s first black president, a president who did something for the American people that Republicans refused to do even though many parts of the law were their ideas.Featured image via screenshot
