Bill Clinton visited Bluffton, SC to rally people to vote for Hillary but he met up with a former Marine Drill Sgt.
who spoke out against Hillary s lies surrounding Benghazi.
This is probably the first time anyone has EVER had a chance to confront Bill Clinton about Benghazi.
He clearly couldn t handle the confrontation.
I have to say I love these brave Americans for standing up.
Pretty awesome!
