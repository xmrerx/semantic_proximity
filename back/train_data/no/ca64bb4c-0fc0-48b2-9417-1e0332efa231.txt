the center for medical progress warned us these videos would get worse .just a short time after a judge issued a ruling that the biotech firm stemexpress can t block the center for medical progress from releasing another video that shows what it does with aborted babies planned parenthood sells to it , the pro-life group put up a preview of the 8th video in its series showing the scandal of planned parenthood selling aborted baby body parts.while the videos have focused on the planned parenthood abortion business , the biotech firm stemexpress , which buys and resells aborted baby body parts from the abortion giant , has filed a lawsuit seeking to block some information the center for medical progress obtained in its three year undercover operation.last month , a court in california blocked the pro-life group from releasing any videos regarding certain meetings of the middleman , stemexpress .
the restraining order does not apply to the planned parenthood abortion business or even to stemexpress in its entirety , making it so additional videos were released.today , a judge lifted the order and center for medical progress immediately released a new video.sign the petition !
congress must de-fund planned parenthood immediatelyin the video , cate dyer , the ceo of stemexpress , is shown in a lunch meeting with undercover operatives posing as representatives of a biotech firm .
dyer is laughing about how stemexpress purchases fully intact aborted babies from planned parenthood .
she laughs about how shippers of the aborted babies would give a warning to lab workers to expect such a baby .
oh yeah , if you have intact cases which we ve done a lot we sometimes ship those back to our lab in its entirety , she says .
tell the lab its coming , she laughs about the intact unborn babies .
you know , open the box and go oh my god , dyer adds.update : the following is a 2-minute preview of the full 8th video cmp plans to release as early as later today or tomorrow morning.after the swarm of negative publicity surrounding planned parenthood selling aborted babies and their body parts , stemexpress was forced to cut ties with the abortion company.meanwhile , two committees in the house of representatives have already launched investigations of planned parenthood .
one committee is looking into whether or not the abortion business is breaking federal law by altering abortion procedures to better obtain aborted baby body parts for sale .
another committee , among other things , is investigating the obama administration and whether there is any connection between it and the abortion giant.the house committee on oversight and government reform was to know if the obama administration , via the department of health and human services , provided any federal grants to planned parenthood that ultimately went to pay for the sales of aborted baby body parts and if they were used by planned parenthood to support transactions involving fetal tissue .
the expose videos catching planned parenthood officials selling the body parts of aborted babies have shocked the nation.as lifenews reported , the first video of undercover footage shows planned parenthood federation of america s senior director of medical services , dr. deborah nucatola , describing how planned parenthood sells the body parts of aborted unborn children and admitting she uses partial-birth abortions to supply intact body parts.in the second video , planned parenthood doctor mary gatter discusses the pricing of aborted baby body parts telling the biotech company officials that the prices for such things as a baby s liver , head or heart are negotiable .
she also tells the officials that she could talk with the planned parenthood abortion practitioners to potentially alter the abortion procedure to kill the baby in a way that would best preserve those body parts after the unborn child is killed in the abortion.so far , 12 states have responded to the planned parenthood videos and launched investigations into their abortion and organ harvesting business including south carolina , florida , tennessee , massachusetts , kansas , missouri , arizona , indiana , ohio , georgia , texas and louisiana .
the district attorney in houston texas is also investigating after the houston-based planned parenthood abortion facility was caught selling aborted babies.congress has expanded its investigation into the planned parenthood abortion business and five states have revoked taxpayer funding for planned parenthood s abortion business , including utah , arkansas , alabama , new hampshire and louisiana and iowa s governor has ordered a review of planned parenthood funding.the full , unedited videos have confirmed that revelations that some aborted baby remains sold by planned parenthood go to biotech companies for the purpose of creating humanized mice .
meanwhile , planned parenthood has been exposed as having sold body parts from aborted babies for as much as 15 years.the federal law that technically prohibits the sale of aborted babies and their body parts was written by a pro-abortion congressman decades ago and essentially spells out a process by which sellers of aborted baby body parts can meet certain criteria that allows the sales to be legal .
that s why a colorado congressman has introduced legislation to totally ban the sales of aborted baby body parts .
