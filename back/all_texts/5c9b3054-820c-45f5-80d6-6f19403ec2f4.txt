While it s usually Donald Trump s fans that make headlines in the media for angry, violent outbursts at rallies and other campaign events, it almost seemed like it was Trump supporters that might be in danger for a moment until their attempt to turn the tables was called out in a completely embarrassing way.Trump s supporters have been caught using fake photos of bloodied people to try and prove that they are under attack from liberal protesters.
Evil Dead actor Bruce Campbell was the one to correct them in a brilliant way that makes them look truly stupid and exposes them for the frauds that they are.The particular incident Campbell gracefully debunked was at a Trump event in San Jose, California, where protesters expressed hostility at the presumptive nominee s supporters.
After things took a turn for the worse, pro-Trump Twitter account Conservative Nation tried to leverage the event to get even more sympathy for Trumpers by tweeting a photo of a bloodied woman and saying that her wounds were caused by demonstrators.
Here s that tweet:TwitterFortunately Campbell saw the tweet, and didn t hesitate to fact-check the admins of Conservative Nation in front of his 400K+ Twitter followers.
Campbell revealed that the woman in the photograph was not a bloodied Trump supporter at all she was actually an actress for comedy-horror series Ash VS.
Evil Dead, and she isn t even injured it was a makeup test!
