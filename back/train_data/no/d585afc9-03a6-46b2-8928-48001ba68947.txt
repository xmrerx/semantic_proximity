this woman s remarks exemplify the me first and everyone s a victim attitude we re seeing so much of today .. a violinist is facing backlash for her heartless tweet following the amtrak train derailment tuesday .
jennifer kim , a professional violinist and music professor , was on board amtrak 188 when it went off the tracks in philadelphia about 9:30 p.m. , killing seven people so far and left 140 injured .
after the crash , kim sent out a tweet that caused a strong counter blast from people social media .
@ amtraknec @ amtrak thanks a lot for derailing my train .
can i please get my violin back from the 2nd car of the train ?
she wrote .
the vitriol sent her way was so great , she deleted her twitter account soon after her tweet started going viral , but thanks to screenshots it will never go away .
not even if she gets her violin back.via : bizpacreview
