The Stephen Colbert we love was in rare form Wednesday night when he was asked by an audience member what one question he would ask Donald Trump.
Let s just say it s good he wasn t on air at the time.
My question is, if you had Donald Trump on your show tonight, what would you ask him?
the woman who identified herself as a college student asked Wednesday, hours after the Republican presidential nominee encouraged Russia to hack into Hillary Clinton s emails.Source: Raw StoryIf you recall, Trump has a rather cozy relationship with the Russian dictator, Vladimir Putin.
After an apparent Russian hack on the Democratic National Committee s email server, Trump, who has exchanged praise with Putin in the past, encouraged Russia to hack some more.
Russia, if you re listening, I hope you re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, Mr. Trump said during a news conference here in an apparent reference to Mrs. Clinton s deleted emails.
I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.

He could have said that he d ask Trump about the legalities of colluding with a foreign leader to help sway the American election.
He could have said he d ask about treason.
Instead, Colbert chose to ask the billionaire this:Colbert thought about the woman s question for a moment, apparently trying to decide whether to say his answer out loud.
We re not broadcasting right now, so I d say, What does Vladimir Putin s dick taste like?
Colbert asked.Then the band started playing before Colbert laughed and said, that s a fine joke.
Don t tell your grandkids that joke.
Here s the video:Colbert s audience didn t seem to take offense.
There was a pretty healthy round of applause, although it might have been a little reserved, just out of shock.
They probably aren t used to Colbert playing blue.Featured image via video screen capture
