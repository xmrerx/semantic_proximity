monrovia ( reuters ) - liberia s supreme court cleared the way for a presidential run-off election , ruling on thursday that it had not found enough evidence of fraud to halt the whole process .
ex-soccer star george weah will now face off against vice-president joseph boakai in a vote that could mark liberia s first peaceful transition of power in seven decades .
the court dismissed a complaint from the third-place finisher charles brumskine s liberty party , which had said fraud had undermined the first round of voting in october .
in the absence of sufficient evidence , the court can not order a re-run of the election , justice philip banks said , reading out the court s decision .
there were over 5,000 polling places , ( so ) to present evidence of just a few is problematic , the judge said .
the evidence should have ( shown ) ... that they were committed in such magnitude that they could have altered the results .
the winner of round two will replace nobel peace prize laureate ellen johnson sirleaf as leader of the small west african country , one of the world s poorest despite abundant diamonds and iron ore .
the delays caused by all the legal wrangling have ratcheted up tensions in a country still recovering from decades of civil war that killed tens of thousands .
however , a spokesman for the liberty party said it would accept the result .
if we did not respect the judiciary , we would not have come , darius dillion said .
liberia has won , our democracy has won .
liberians are eager for change after johnson sirleaf s 12-year rule , which sealed a lasting peace that many doubted was possible , but which has failed to tackle corruption or significantly lift living standards of the country s poorest .
authorities still have to name a date for the run-off .
nec spokesman henry flomo told reporters outside the court he believed one could be held in two weeks , but said the date would be announced shortly .
the judges made the ruling with a 4-1 majority .
