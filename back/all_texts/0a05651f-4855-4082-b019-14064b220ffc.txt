Yesterday, House Republicans set themselves up for loads of humiliation after they quietly voted to take away the independence of the Office of Congressional Ethics without giving any warning whatsoever.Republicans in Congress had been trying to take away the ability of the ethic watchdog to do its own independent investigations.
As soon as the announcement was made, these GOPers were faced with an onslaught of criticism for trying to help aide corruption and keep the public in the dark.
To make the criticism even more humiliating, one of those people was President-elect Donald Trump.On Tuesday morning, Trump decided to abandon the Republican Party and blast them on Twitter for making the gutting of the ethics office their first priority when there were more pressing matters at hand:Twitter TwitterIt is important to note that Trump isn t necessarily condemning the House GOP s choice to limit the ethics office Trump is merely upset about the timing of it.
Sean Spicer, Trump s incoming press secretary, set the record straight with reporters that Trump s annoyance with the Republicans had nothing to do with the action itself, as Jennifer Bendery pointed out:TwitterThe GOP has been so humiliated by the response from Trump and many others that they ve practically been forced to take back their vote.
Shortly after Trump tweeted his disapproval of the initiative, the House GOP held an emergency meeting where they unanimously voted to abandon the issue for now.
Many Republicans plan to return to the idea later on, once the criticism has died down.TwitterThe GOP has truly gotten an embarrassing start to 2017, already having to back down from one of their corrupt ideas after their own Republican Party leader trashed it.
If the GOP thought Trump was going to have their back all the time, they have another thing coming.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images
