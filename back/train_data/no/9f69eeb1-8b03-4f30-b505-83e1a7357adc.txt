( fox59 ) parents of students at an indiana elementary school are not happy after a first grade teacher sent home a note asking children not to talk about god , jesus , or the devil , fox 59 reports.according to a statement from mccordsville elementary school , a debate about god happened in the first grade classroom earlier in the week , so the teacher sent the letter about her expectations to parents .
the section of the letter reportedly asked parents to have a talk with their children about the time and place to discuss faith.a parent submitted the letter to fox 59 , which in part reads : with mccordsville elementary being a public school , we have many different religions and beliefs , and i do not want to upset a child or parent because of these words being used .
a letter from the superintendent said it is okay for students to speak about their religion as long as it does not interrupt class : trying to limit a student s view on religion is a violation of a student s first amendment rights .
however , if the discussion becomes an academic disruption , then as a district , we can intervene to maintain the integrity of the educational process while at the same time being sure to not violate a student s constitutional rights .
