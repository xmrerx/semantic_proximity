That is so illegal!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 10, 2017Comey s removal of classified information from his office could put him in breach of FBI protocols that clearly state FBI agents will not reveal, by any means, any information or material from or related to FBI files or any other information acquired by virtue of my official employment to any unauthorized recipient without prior official written authorization by the FBI.
Comey admitted he took his personal memos with him after being fired in testimony before Congress on June 8 and directed a friend of his to leak some of its contents to a New York Times reporter to rebuff some of Trump s claims.
