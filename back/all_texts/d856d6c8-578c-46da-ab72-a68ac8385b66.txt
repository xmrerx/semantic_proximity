Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. will always be remembered as one of the most revolutionary civil rights leaders and someone who made a tremendous impact on America and the movement to end legislated racism.
On Monday, we honored King s life, which was taken far too soon.Despite King s fame and place in history, not everyone knows as much about him as they should as late night host Jimmy Kimmel discovered when he interviewed people on Hollywood s Walk of Fame.
For his show Jimmy Kimmel Live on Hollywood Boulevard, Kimmel had a camera crew interview pedestrians and see what they thought of King (falsely) endorsing Republican front runner Donald Trump.
The results are seriously too depressing to actually be funny.Out of the several people interviewed, many were completely unaware that King had been assassinated in 1968 therefore preventing him from making any type of endorsement to the GOP candidate.
Unsurprisingly, those very same people were oblivious to what King actually stood for, and were also unaware that Trump had made tons of racist comments that King would have never stood behind.
These people had seemingly been living under a rock for the past several months, and probably didn t even know that Trump has been endorsed by King s opposites modern-day white supremacists.One woman seriously said, I figure if he s going to endorse Donald Trump for president, then maybe he thinks he will be a good president.
And that wasn t even the worst response.
You can watch the frightening interviews below:It is mind-boggling how ignorant many people in America still are and it isn t much of a stretch to say that anyone who believes someone like Martin Luther King, Jr. would endorse such an imbecile is probably going to end up voting for him.If King were alive to hear these responses, it would certainly be a nightmare for him.
Especially since this has basically been Trump s response to people who aren t white like him:Featured image via Gage Skidmore
