Trump s first week as the Republican nominee is off to a hilariously bad start.Perhaps reading the latest polls that found a staggering seventy-seven percent of Hispanic Americans have a negative opinion of Trump (and that s putting it lightly), Trump did the only thing a man of his unchecked narcissism could think of: He bought a taco from the lobby of Trump Tower.
Yikes.Happy #CincoDeMayo!
The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.
I love Hispanics!

In case you re wondering how authentic his taco was, the Trump Tower Grill probably has the highest proportion of white people of any place in the country.
It s so white, that it s nearly impossible to find a single person of color in any of its promotional materials.via Trump Tower NYNeedless to say, this bit of shameless pandering to a group he launched his political career on labeling drug dealers and rapists has not gone over well..@realDonaldTrump this tweet is useless without a sombrero and black mustachehttps://t.co/S5zuo9K8in David Burge (@iowahawkblog) May 5, 2016@realDonaldTrump Mexico hates you Mayo De Cinco (@SinnerlnSecret) May 5, 2016No, I didn't predict that the Republican Party would lose its fucking mind.

@realDonaldTrump They will come here legally!

LEGAL immigrants are welcome Jesse #Trump2016 (@EaglesJesse) May 5, 2016Trump is positioned to lose the election by numbers not seen in decades.
Having swept the primaries by appealing to the Republican base, his chances of winning in the general are projected to hover slightly above zero.
Thanks to his racism, xenophobia, sexism, and hate-crime advocacy, Trump may have a lot of friends in the conservative movement, but he s turned off nearly everyone else.Posing for pictures with a taco sums up exactly why he is so universally reviled.
It s not just that he doesn t get it , he doesn t seem to even care.Featured image via Twitter
