a little over one year ago , radical activist , and rapper , tef poe was sitting in our white house discussing strategy with our community organizer in chief .
today , he s taken to twitter to warn white americans that their support for donald trump won t happen without paying a heavy price .
in his tweets , he promises violence and spews hate from every pore of his racist body .
yes , these are the types of people barack hussein obama has meeting with him in our white house to discuss strategy .
when you consider all of the important and historical world figures who have met with former presidents in our white house , it should cause every american to pause and wonder what kind of monster is residing at 1600 pennsylvania ave today.https : //twitter.com/tefpoe/status/710167227627147266in december , 2014 , president obama invited several youth activists to the white house to discuss # ferguson , police brutality , race and more.a day after meeting with president obama , some of those very activists ashley yates , tef-poe , t-dubb-o , james hayes , jose lopez , and phillip agnew held a conference call to discuss their feelings following speaking with the president .
