brussels ( reuters ) - the russian authorities decision to bar opposition leader alexei navalny from running in next year s presidential election raises questions about the vote , the european union s foreign service said in a statement on tuesday .
the central election commission said on monday navalny was not eligible to run in the march 18 election due to a suspended prison sentence .
he has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing and says the case is politically motivated .
the decision casts a serious doubt on political pluralism in russia and the prospect of democratic elections next year , the eu s external action service , or eeas , said in a statement .
politically-motivated charges should not be used against political participation , the eeas said .
it urged the russian authorities to ensure that there is a level playing field in the presidential vote in march and in all other votes .
the eeas said that navalny was denied the right to a fair trial in his prosecution in 2013 , according to the european court of human rights , to which russia is a signatory .
polls show president vladimir putin is on course to be comfortably re-elected , meaning he could remain in power until2024 .
navalny has been jailed three times this year and charged with breaking the law by organizing public meetings and rallies .
the european external action service ( eeas ) , set up in 2009 , runs a network of diplomats around the globe , drafts policy papers for eu foreign ministers and is led by the eu s top diplomat federica mogherini , who visited moscow in april this year .
