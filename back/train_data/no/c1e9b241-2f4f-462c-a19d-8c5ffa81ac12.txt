beijing ( reuters ) - a chinese court on friday jailed the country s number one most wanted fugitive for eight years for graft and taking bribes , state media said .
yang xiuzhu , a former deputy mayor of wenzhou city in the booming eastern province of zhejiang , gave herself in to chinese authorities late last year , returning from the united states after spending 13 years in hiding .
china ranked yang top in a 2015 list of its 100 most wanted graft suspects who were targeted with interpol red notices .
many on the list had fled to the united states , canada or australia .
some 48 have since returned to china .
yang s prison sentence and a fine of 800,000 yuan ( $ 121,500 ) was announced by the people s intermediate court in hangzhou , the official xinhua news agency said on social media .
the court gave yang a reduced sentence as she had expressed regret , pleaded guilty and actively returned her illegal gains , as well returned to china , xinhua reported .
in under three years in her position at the construction bureau , yang had embezzled nearly 20 million yuan in public funds and had accepted over 7 million yuan in gifts .
just under 27 million yuan of this had been recovered , the court said .
it was not possible to reach yang or a representative for comment .
president xi jinping s war on graft has spread beyond china s borders with overseas searches dubbed operation fox hunt and sky net hunting down officials and business executives who fled overseas with their assets .
wary that suspects might not get a fair trial and that accusations may be politically motivated , some developed nations have been hesitant to comply with beijing s requests to return people to china .
yang told reuters in 2015 that she was innocent and called the most-wanted list a political document targeting enemies of the current regime rather than a roster of criminals .
