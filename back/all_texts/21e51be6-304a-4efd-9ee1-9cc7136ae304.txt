Donald Trump has often campaigned as the self-described law and order candidate in the 2016 presidential election.
But one of the men Trump tried to persecute is speaking out against the reality TV star.As recently as last week, Trump argued that the Central Park Five should be behind bars.
The men were five young black men who were railroaded by the criminal justice system and falsely accused of raping a white woman (known as the Central Park Jogger).
Eventually, after they were imprisoned, another man was connected to the crime via DNA evidence and the Five were released.
They received a court judgment and were rewarded monetary damages for their unjust incarceration.Trump took out a full-page ad during the trial, calling for the boys execution.
Now, one of those men, Yusef Salaam, is speaking out about Trump and his incitement and what Salaam describes as calling basically for us to be murdered.
Yusef Salaam said Donald Trump s infamous full-page ad calling for the deaths of the Central Park Five would in an earlier era been the impetus that sparked mob justice in a new ad against Trump.
They had our names, our phone numbers and addresses in the papers so what would ve happened?
Somebody from the darkest places of society would ve come to our homes, kicked in our doors, and drug us from our homes and hung us from the trees in Central Park.
That would ve been the type of mob justice that they were seeking.
Trump still refuses to accept that these men are innocent, part of a troubling pattern from the Republican nominee in a blas attitude towards black concerns and safety.
Asked during the debates about police brutality against blacks and the protests of the Black Lives Matter movement, Trump has instead gone at length about stop and frisk and inner city crime.
It is his go-to position and rhetoric when speaking about black people.Featured image via screen capture
