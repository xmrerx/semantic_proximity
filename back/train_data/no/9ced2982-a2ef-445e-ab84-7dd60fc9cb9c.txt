mitch mcconnell just made a statement on the senate floor that the senate will follow the biden rule and wait until a new administration comes in to consider a supreme court nominee .
mcconnell made the case that the senate has the right to do this and that it s not against judge garland .
garland is a liberal judge but not as left leaning as some who were considered for the nomination on the supreme court .
in fact , orin hatch of utah was quoted as saying garland would be a good choice .
obama must have called his bluff on this one .
the senate s not biting and will stick to its guns or risk even more criticism from republicans.cspan video : mcconnell statement
