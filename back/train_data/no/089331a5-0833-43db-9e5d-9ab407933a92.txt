donald trump is counting on a big win tonight , although most pollsters indicate a victory for hillary clinton .
still yet , we re sure he s prepared a concession speech .
joking !
in preparation for donald s victory party , he has a cash bar set up for guests , according to ben jacobs of the guardian on twitter .
we do hope donald has paid the bar staff in advance .
also , his baker .
