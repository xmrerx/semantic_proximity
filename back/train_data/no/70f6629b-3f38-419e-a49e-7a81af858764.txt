if you re like me .
.
.
it s probably been an entertaining year full of liberal lunacy , hypocrisy , and fear .
there s been so many episodes , it s easy to forget .
luckily , they ve all been logged upon the internet.the circus added one more ring when donald got the nod to represent the gop .
.
.
the libs cried oh my god .
the media assured them there s no way that trump could win so they sat back on their parent s couch , enamored by the spin.election day was coming .
.
.
entertainment getting slow , thank god the folks in hollywood maintained the status quo .
a host of a-list wannabes began to trickle forth , and told us that if trump should win .
.
.
they d all be headed north.when donald passed two-seventy .
.
.
and victory was at hand , a trump-induced psychosis sprouted up in liberal land .
the fireworks were cancelled , and purveyors of fake news were left to invent reasons why their candidate would lose.they blamed it all on comey , then they blamed a russian hack a dog that ate their homework , and of course .
.
.
the men in black .
a unicorn , a sasquatch , and a faulty gallup poll next .
.
.
they ll blame the shooter who was on the grassy knoll.those celebs that promised egress .
.
.
failed to adhere we waited for the moving trucks , which never did appear .
yes , not a star left hollywood , although we wished it so , despite the fact that rush and sean would pay for them to go.so now we re stuck with miley , and we re stuck with barbra too , several washed-up actors .
.
.
and the women of the view .
we still have maddow s meltdowns , and sharpton s brand of hate .
and , we still have lena dunham .
.
.
though she s lost a little weight.in congress , you can bet there s more than one defective gene .
just climb on board the crazy train with nancy and maxine .
they often make me wonder just how awesome it would be , if parts of california could just slide into the sea.i m watching liberal journalists like cooper , wolf , and tapper , spew the leftist mantra .
.
.
as their careers go down the crapper .
deplorables will have their fun with liberal rank and file , watching rats abandon ship when clinton goes on trial.when debbie left the dnc , i thought we d lost our clown .
then , from the state of idaho , came sally boynton brown .
the dnc will be reborn , no matter what it takes .
and the mix will look like cereal .
.
.
with fruit loops , nuts , and flakes.then , i saw the women s march , a feministic treat .
i watched with fascination as they spilled into the street .
among the more disturbing sights were lady democrats who dressed up as vaginas .
.
.
others wore their kitty hats.an incoherent ashley judd paraded round a stage saying all those nasty women should demand a higher wage .
then ranting about blood-stained sheets upon those women s beds .
somewhere a doctor s wondering why he took her off her meds.madonna parked her walker to begin her caustic din , dreams of blowing up the whitehouse as senility sets in .
even in her senior years .
.
.
the party never ends .
she dances round her nursing home in vera wang depends.the liberals , you must admit , have done some crazy things .
it s fun to see them come unhinged as donald pulls the strings .
so , if you feel you need a shot of petulance and mirth , sit back and watch the liberals , it s the greatest show on earth .
