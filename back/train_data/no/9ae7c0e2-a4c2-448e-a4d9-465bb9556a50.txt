21st century wire says the fbi is walking a very fine line that crosses into the unacceptable.watch a video of this report here : the fbi has apparently arrested a man planning an attack on a miami-area synagogue with an explosive device.the suspect had allegedly planned to attack the aventura turnberry jewish center on friday evening.the plot , which is about as simple as they come , involved throwing an explosive device over a wall and into the synagogue grounds during friday night services , as congregants would have been marking the start of shabbat and the final day of passover.most importantly , the synagogue was never actually in any real danger.this is because , the man was stopped by fbi agents posing as fellow terrorists who set up a sting operation .
the bomb , apparently a dummy , was sold to him in hallandale beach by an fbi undercover operative just before the planned terror attack .what this means , is that the suspect james medina , may have never had the material means to carry out any attack with an explosive device unless it had been provided by the fbi.so why is anybody praising the fbi for stopping a terror attack when they are the very group that facilitated its implementation in the first place ? the synagogue s facebook page issued a statement saying the fbi had even told them that , there are no credible threats directed against us at the present time .
no credible threats means that the only threat was a fictitious false flag created by the fbi.democratic party national committee head and congresswoman debbie wasserman schultz , apparently unaware of the finer details , said she was , deeply grateful that the fbi arrested this individual before he was allegedly able to do harm to the aventura turnberry jewish center .where do we draw the line between posing as a terrorist , and actually being a terrorist ? how can the fbi be allowed to facilitate such incidents and then claim credit , both financially and politically , for stopping them ? all the false flag info you need : 21st century wire false flag files
