21st century wire says back to square one .
quietly , president barack obama is deploying more and more us troops in iraq , not necessarily to fight isis , but firstly to guard the iraqi oil fields.notice how this announcement is perfectly timed with the iraqi army s military offensive this week to retake the supposed isis stronghold of mosul in northern iraq.will a new kurdistan rise from the ashes of this geopolitical conundrum , or will it just be more instability ? there s more to this new trend than meets the eye .
watch this space fighting centers on key town of makhmurjason ditz antiwar.comeven as pentagon officials have sought to emphasize their claims of isis being on the run , ever more us ground troops are being deployed into iraq to try to cope with isis offensives , with the battle of makhmur leading to the introduction of us marines in front-line combat roles.officials are trying to downplay the operation as force protection for iraqi ground troops , who have been massing in the area in an effort to ultimately launch an attack on the isis-held city of mosul , not far away.the explanation is unsatisfying for several reasons , but primarily because this tactical assembly area already includes thousands of iraqi troops and kurdish peshmerga , and these are the same troops who are supposed to attack mosul .
yet these troops are apparently unable to even hold makhmur , let alone advance toward mosul.the makhmur district is also a key to holding oil fields around kirkuk , and the isis offensive is seen by many analysts as part of an effort to ultimately regain control over those lucrative oil fields , and have been outgunning the thousands of iraqi troops in the area.whether they re trying to save iraqi ground troops who still can t stand up to isis , or save oil fields , however , the latest escalation puts us troops even further in harm s way , and has put the war even further afield from the no boots on the ground affair initially promised by the obama administration.read more iraq news at : 21st century wire iraq files
