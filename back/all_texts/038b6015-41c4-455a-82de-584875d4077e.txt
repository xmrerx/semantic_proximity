Judge Jeanine nailed it tonight describing the unhinged left.
She is so right to say the left is a danger to us all.
She is especially worried for our President and other leaders in DC.
She s so right!PIRRO SAID: We are now in a danger zone of complete hatred and chaos unlike anything we ve witnessed in American history.
The normalization of calling for the assassination, decapitation or the beating of any president is simply shocking.
And it is the extension of this hatred that trickles down and motivates people like the shooter of Congressman Scalise.
That shooter wasn t crazy.
That s too easy.
He hated Republicans and thought they should die.
I worry, though, and you should all worry for our president and all elected officials The trickling down of hate is a danger to us all What s not helping is that the former President and Hillary Clinton are fueling this rhetoric.
The bitter Democrats waisted no time in continuing the violent rhetoric almost immediately after Steve Scalise was shot!
The ironic thing is that this only damages the Democrats!The Chair of the DNC Tom Perez has been going out giving obscenity laden speeches.
He s the leader of the party and he sets the tone.
How in the world is this negative rhetoric helping anyone?
The big loser in all of this is the American people.
DC is in gridlock on getting things done when the Democrats don t even try to be civil.
