On Tuesday, Donald Trump once again amped up the stupidity in his latest attack on intelligence agencies namely the CIA who have the gall to correctly state that Vladimir Putin spearheaded an effort to influence our election and effectively install a big orange puppet in office through a series of hacks and propaganda campaigns.
The Intelligence briefing on so-called Russian hacking was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case, Trump tweeted.
Very strange!
The "Intelligence" briefing on so-called "Russian hacking" was delayed until Friday, perhaps more time needed to build a case.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 4, 2017Now, it might seem strange that The Donald is concerned with an intelligence briefing given that he is famous for skipping them, but this one represents an opportunity to further kiss up to Vladimir Putin and attack the CIA (two of Trump s favorite pastimes lately).
On Saturday, Trump said that he knows things that other people don t know about the hacks and that we can t be sure who actually did it (you know, unless we listen to the CIA and the FBI).Now, Trump knows a lot about postponing things like his press conference concerning his numerous conflicts of interest he doesn t want to address.
But just because a delay in Trump world means something nefarious, it is probably just a teensy bit irresponsible of Trump to assume everyone is the same as he.Naturally, Twitter seized upon the opportunity to once again jam a collective boot up the president-elect s orifice (pick one):@realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/bNm40X2qg7 The Socialist Party (@OfficialSPGB) January 4, 2017Your "press conference" on "divesting from conflicts" was postponed a month.
Perhaps time needed to refine lies.
Strange!
@realDonaldTrump Freddy Scott (@freddyscott) January 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump Should they wear a special shirt so you know which team they are on?
Because it doesn't seem like you do.

@realDonaldTrump Right you're the next president of the United States, but THIS is what's strange.
Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) January 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump What's "strange" is that you put "intelligence" in quotations like you don't understand the word "intelligence".
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump should private information about your private intelligence briefings really be tweeted about?
Jack Slater (@Jack_Slater) January 4, 2017This is also very strange.
@TiernanDouieb @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/2xo7WKArVJ Trump's chins (@TrumpsChinFat) January 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump How dare they delay!
What do they think this is?
A press conference about your conflicts of interest?
Nick Jack Pappas (@Pappiness) January 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump Doesn't Putin brief you on hacking when he wakes you up in the morning?
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump Why don't you ask them why they need the extra time instead of posting this passive aggressive nonsense?
Ian Boothby (@IanBoothby) January 4, 2017@realDonaldTrump I believe you when you say Russia never hacked us because if you were right about Diet Coke, you must be right on Russia.

on your inside info on hacking- which you said you'd reveal Tues/Wed?
Not Maureen Dowd (@MaureenDowdTwit) January 4, 2017Trump has repeatedly denied that Putin or Russia was involved in the hacks (all while praising the Russian dictator repeatedly on Twitter).
Earlier this week, I met separately with FBI [Director] James Comey and DNI Jim Clapper, and there is strong consensus among us on the scope, nature, and intent of Russian interference in our presidential election, CIA Director John Brennan said recently.
CIA officials say it is quite clear that the hacks were intended to install Trump in office.The Electoral College failed us as the last line of defense against exactly this nightmare scenario.
An authoritarian, racist, inept, useless orange lump is about to step into the Oval Office.
It is up to us to oppose him every step of the way this year, to stand strong against his agenda of hate and corruption.
Remind yourself each morning that this is not normal because we absolutely cannot risk allowing it to become so.Featured image via screengrab and Drew Angerer/Getty Images
