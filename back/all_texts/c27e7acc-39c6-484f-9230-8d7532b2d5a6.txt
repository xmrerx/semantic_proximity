WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S.
Senator Ron Wyden said on Tuesday he will vote for a crucial Puerto Rico debt restructuring bill, saying it was the best alternative for the financially battered territory.
“I am going to vote for this bill,” Wyden told reporters after a meeting with U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew.
“I certainly wish that there were amendments, but for me I am not going to let the adequate be the enemy of the barely sufficient.”
