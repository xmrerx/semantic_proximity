( reuters ) - the u.s. congress is expected to vote this week on sweeping , debt-financed tax legislation .
here are key parts of the bill .
corporate tax rate : cuts corporate income tax rate to 21 percent from 35 percent , beginning jan. 1 , 2018 .
pass-throughs : creates a 20 percent deduction for the first $ 315,000 of qualified business income for joint filers of pass-through businesses such as partnerships and sole proprietorships .
for income above that threshold , the legislation phases in limits , producing an effective marginal tax rate of no more than 29.6 percent .
corporate minimum tax : repeals the 20 percent corporate alternative minimum tax , set up to ensure profitable corporations pay at least some tax .
territorial system : exempts u.s. corporations from u.s. taxes on most future foreign profits , ending the present worldwide system of taxing profits of all u.s.-based corporations , no matter where they are earned .
this would align the u.s. tax code with most other industrialized nations , undercut many offshore tax-dodging strategies and deliver to multinationals a goal they have pursued for years .
repatriation : sets a one-time mandatory tax of 8 percent on illiquid assets and 15.5 percent on cash and cash equivalents for about $ 2.6 trillion in u.s. business profits now held overseas .
this foreign cash pile was created by a rule making foreign profits tax-deferred if they are not brought into the united states , or repatriated .
that rule would be rendered obsolete by the territorial system .
anti-base erosion measures : prevents companies from shifting profits out of the united states to lower-tax jurisdictions abroad .
sets an alternative minimum tax on payments between u.s. corporations and foreign affiliates , and limits on shifting corporate income through transfers of intangible property , including patents .
in combination , these measures with the repatriation and territorial system provisions , represent a dramatic overhaul of the u.s. tax system for multinationals .
capital expensing : allows businesses to immediately write off , or expense , the full value of investments in new plant and equipment for five years , then gradually eliminates this 100 percent expensing over five years beginning in year six .
interest deduction limit : caps business deductions for debt interest payments at 30 percent of taxable income , regardless of deductions for depreciation , amortization or depletion .
clean energy : preserves tax credits for producing electricity from wind , biomass , geothermal , solar , municipal waste and hydropower .
carried interest : leaves in place “ carried interest ” loophole for private equity fund managers and some hedge fund managers , despite pledges by republicans including president donald trump to close it .
these financiers can now claim a lower capital gains tax rate on much of their income from investments held more than a year .
a new rule would extend that holding period to three years , putting the loophole out of reach for some fund managers , but preserving its availability for many .
brackets : maintains the current seven tax brackets , but temporarily changes most of the income levels and rates .
for married couples filing jointly , effective jan. 1 , 2018 and ending in 2026 , income tax would be : 10 percent up to $ 19,050 , versus 10 percent up to $ 18,650 under existing law ; 12 percent on $ 19,051 to $ 77,400 , versus 15 percent on $ 18,651 to $ 75,900 ; 22 percent on $ 77,401 to $ 165,000 , versus 25 percent on $ 75,901 to $ 153,100 ; 24 percent on $ 165,001 to $ 315,000 , versus 28 percent on $ 153,101 to $ 233,350 ; 32 percent on $ 315,001 to $ 400,000 , versus 33 percent on $ 233,351 to $ 416,700 ; 35 percent on $ 400,001 to $ 600,000 , versus 35 percent on $ 416,701 to $ 470,700 37 percent above $ 600,000 , versus 39.6 percent above $ 470,700 .
for single individuals , effective jan. 1 , 2018 and ending in 2026 , income tax would be : 10 percent up to $ 9,525 , versus 10 percent up to $ 9,325 under existing law ; 12 percent from $ 9,526 to $ 38,700 , versus 15 percent on $ 9,326 to $ 37,950 ; 22 percent on $ 38,701 to $ 82,500 , versus 25 percent on $ 37,951 to $ 91,900 ; 24 percent on $ 82,501 to $ 157,500 , versus 28 percent on $ 91,901 to $ 191,650 ; 32 percent on $ 157,501 to $ 200,000 , versus 33 percent on $ 191,651 to $ 416,700 ; 35 percent on $ 200,001 to $ 500,000 , versus 35 percent on $ 416,701 to $ 418,400 ; 37 percent above $ 500,000 , versus 39.6 percent above $ 418,400 .
these brackets would expire after 2025 .
standard deduction : in a change expected to end itemizing of deductions for millions of americans , the bill for eight years beginning on jan. 1 , 2018 would increase the standard deduction - a fixed amount that can be subtracted from adjusted gross income to lower taxable income - to $ 12,000 from $ 6,350 for individuals , and to $ 24,000 from $ 12,700 for married couples .
child tax credit : doubles the child tax credit to $ 2,000 per dependent child under age 17 , with a refundable portion of $ 1,400 .
the refundable portion allows families to lower their tax bills to zero and receive a refund for the remaining value .
personal exemption : temporarily eliminates the $ 4,050 individual personal exemption .
under present law , taxpayers who earn below certain income caps can subtract this fixed dollar amount from their adjusted gross incomes to lower their taxable incomes .
generally , one exemption has been allowed per individual , spouse and child or other dependent .
this would take effect jan. 1 , 2018 , but then the personal exemption would return in 2026 .
inheritances : raises the exemption for estate and gift taxes to $ 10 million from $ 5 million per person and indexes the new exemption level for inflation after 2011 .
that means even fewer americans would pay the estate tax , but it would stay on the books .
mortgages : for residences bought from jan. 1 , 2018 , through dec. 31 , 2025 , the bill caps the deduction for mortgage interest at $ 750,000 in home loan value .
after dec. 31 , 2025 , the cap would revert to $ 1 million in loan value .
suspends the deduction for interest on home equity loans from jan. 1 , 2018 until 2026 .
obamacare mandate : repeals a federal fine imposed on americans under obamacare for not obtaining health insurance coverage , a change expected to undermine the 2010 healthcare law .
anwr drilling : allows oil drilling in alaska ’ s arctic national wildlife refuge .
