UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - China s U.N Ambassador Liu Jieyi urged North Korea to stop taking actions that are wrong and called on all parties to seriously consider Beijing s proposal for a joint suspension of Pyongyang s ballistic missile and nuclear programs and military drills by the United States and South Korea.
We strongly urge (North Korea) ... stop taking actions that are wrong, deteriorating the situation and not in line with its own interests either and truly return to the track of resolving the issue through dialogue, Liu told the U.N. Security Council.
North Korea conducted its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on Sunday, which it said was an advanced hydrogen bomb for a long-range missile, prompting global condemnation and drawing a warning of a massive military response from the United States if it or its allies were threatened.
