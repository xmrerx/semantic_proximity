SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea s goal is reaching equilibrium of military force with the United States, its state agency said on Saturday, a day after its leader Kim Jong Un ordered the test of a medium-to-long range Hwasong-12 missile that flew over Japan into the Pacific Ocean.
Our final goal is to establish the equilibrium of real force with the U.S. and make the U.S. rulers dare not talk about military option for the DPRK, Kim was cited as saying in the report.
Pyongyang had fired its second missile over Japan in less than a month on Friday, prompting the United States to say it has military options to deal with the North, signaling its patience for diplomacy is wearing thin.
