let face obamacare nightmare since begin
website failure corruption state set ups million go unaccounted
yes gruber episode bury whole damn obamacare debacle
huge miscalculation part congressional budget office bigwhat future obamacare hold total cost expect 11 higher 2016 2025 initially expectedthere mistake big mistake
congressional budget office latest report federal subsidy reveal mistake monstrous proportion part federal governmenthere forecasting error look like congressional budget office cbo make projection future obamacare healthcare general year
initially cbo project 21 million people would sign private health insurance use obamacare transparent marketplace exchange 2016
however estimate substantially reduce 12 million
accord department health human service obamacare enrollment total 127 million end third enrollment period jan 31 2016
ultimately cbo foresee private health enrollment via obamacare top 18 million 19 million people 2018 2026why huge difference actual enrollment versus initial projection
begin government appear overestimate many people would sign private exchange versus enrol via employer
data thus far show nowhere near many people expect drop employersponsored insurance sign obamacare marketplace exchange mean considerably smaller uninsured pool initially anticipatedthe possibility share responsibility payment srp work initially expect
srp penalty charge consumer fail purchase health insurance qualified exemption
average srp first year obamacare 2014 total 190 accord hr block kaiser family foundation predict average penalty 661 2015 tax return 969 2016
despite increase penalty young adult enrollment still well initial expectation likely cost penalty still much le annual cost purchase health insuranceby 9 millionperson enrollment shortfall obamacare exchange pretty substantial
healthbenefit provider lick chop expectation add 20 millionplus enrollee within first three year follow implementation
however bubble pop insurer truly benefitingbut mistake far worstnow monstrous forecasting booboo look like note cbo report biggest booboo come federal government estimate many people would enroll medicaid child health insurance program chipinitial estimate back 2010 peg medicaid chip combine enrollment 52 million 2016
actual figure
68 million current enrollee 2016 difference 16 million
report note total medicaidchip enrollment grow 3 million last year expect swell 74 million 2026how federal government miss badly
cbo believe fewer people expect enrol employersponsored plan eligible free healthcare expand medicaid program
traditional medicaid fully cover consumer make 100 federal poverty level
obamacare expand medicaid program 31 state washington dc take advantage cover people earn 138 federal poverty level
federal government appear understand magnitude lure drop employersponsored care cover medicaidwhat even egregious estimate 2010 supreme court decision 2012 allow state right choose whether want expand medicaid programwhen president obama initially sign affordable care act law march 2010 medicaid expansion mandatory
however ruling 7to2 supreme court allow individual state make decision whether expand
ultimately 19 state choose
reasoning
federal government offer financial assistance expand state 2014 2016 fully plan pare back assistance 90 100 2017 2020
holdout state simply felt would leave hook much additional revenue generation cover new medicaid member
medicaid expansion mandatory cbo estimate another 4 million people would enrolledthis 16 millionperson shortfall far insignificant
fact cbo estimate federal government failure accurately forecast many people would enrol medicaidchip 146 billion next decade
take account factor like estimate 46 billion federal government save pay le expect subsidy marketplace exchange enrollee well 28 billion le expect collect revenue cadillac tax suspend additional two year obamacare expect cost 136 billion originally forecast longtermis obamacare sustainable
anyone guess point future obamacare hold total cost expect 11 higher 2016 2025 initially expect
