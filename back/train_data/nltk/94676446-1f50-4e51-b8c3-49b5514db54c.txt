nice little factoid candidate run president year one actually pay intern
take guess one person might
none favorite democratic socialist senator bernie sandersyou hear right one else donald trump even hillary clinton pay intern house tree anywhere borrow line dr suessthe washington post run unofficial investigation angle presidential candidate ignore cost unpaid internship despite rhetoric contrary
particularly fit consider talk big game erode middle class rise social inequality yet treat worker like slaveseven leading republican candidate talk income inequality openly even though may get much press coverage topic yet still somehow jeb bush marco rubio ben carson ted cruz donald trump care enough pay intern
bernie sander though
pay intern 1010 hour
shabbywhile admit nowhere close 1500 hour bernie advocate campaign trail far anything else candidate offeringif believe higher minimum wage important
think worker need treat respect difference candidate important
better predictor candidate go conduct office conduct campaignfeatured image via flickr
