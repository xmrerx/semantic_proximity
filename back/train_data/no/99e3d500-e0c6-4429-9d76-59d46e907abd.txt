dubai ( reuters ) - a spokesman for yemen s houthi group on thursday dismissed u.s. accusations that iran had supplied a missile fired at saudi arabia last month , saying it was an attempt to divert attention from the united states decision to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital .
after three years of war , america suddenly finds evidence that iran supports the houthis , abdel-malek al-ejri said in a message on his twitter account .
america did not find any evidence in all the missiles fired from yemen until now .
the story is clear .
they want to give arabs a story to divert their attention from jerusalem .
instead being angry at israel , they wave the iranian bogey , he added .
the united states on thursday presented for the first time pieces of what it said were iranian weapons supplied to the iran-aligned houthis , describing it as conclusive evidence that tehran was violating u.n. resolutions .
iran has denied supplying the houthis with such weaponry and on thursday described the arms displayed as fabricated .
president donald trump on dec. 6 announced u.s. recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital , stirring anger across the arab and muslim world and concern among washington s european allies as well as russia .
