The Chicago Cubs have just won the World Series for the first time after 108 years, and one Chicago native couldn t be happier about it.That person?
Hillary Clinton.Born in Chicago, and raised in the suburbs, Hillary has never in her lifetime, along with pretty much every Cubs fan, seen the Cubbies go all the way and become World Champions.Well, on Wednesday, November 2, 2016, all that changed.
The Cubs went head to head with the Cleveland Indians to win 8-7 in extra innings during Game 7.
It was a baseball game for the ages.Unable to contain her emotions, the press following Hillary on the campaign trail were able to catch her reactions to the Cubs big game and win, and it s pretty priceless.Here are some amazing images:Hillary Clinton watching Cubs win the World Series.

It couldn t have been a bigger nailbiter of a game if you scripted it.Hopefully, this is just one of two victories Hillary will be celebrating within the next week.
The presidential election between her and Donald Trump is also becoming a bit of a nailbiter, and we ll all be on the edge of our seats for that match-up as well.Featured Photo by Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images
