paul ryan s omnibus spending bill gives obama funding for his syrian refugee scheme , planned parenthood , obamacare , amnesty , nsa domestic spying , sanctuary cities for illegals , eliminates the budget sequester , and much more .
the bill is another 2,000 page whale that has become so common in the obama era , so there hasn t even been enough time yet to parse the bill and find out what s in it .
doesn t that sound like a former speaker of the house ?
and i m not talking about john boehner .
no , in one fell swoop , paul ryan has turned out to be even worse than john boehner .
this bill is downright pelosian in its terribleness .
this is a slap in the face to the american people .
we hope that once you recover from shock after reading this list , you ll pick up the phone and call dc to voice your anger .
please make the effort to jam the phone lines with angry patriots who are 100 % fed up !
with big government .
