WHO BETTER THAN A FORMER POLICE OFFICER TO UNDERSTAND THAT MORE GUNS EQUALS BETTER PROTECTION AND LESS CRIME:South Carolina could move away from the folly of gun free zones if one pro-Second Amendment state lawmaker has his way Fits News reports:State representative Mike Pitts of Laurens, S.C. is planning to introduce a bill that would permit campus carry in the Palmetto State.
In other words, he s going to file legislation that would allow college students who have concealed weapons permits to carry their guns on campus.As of this writing, college campuses in South Carolina are gun-free zones.
College campuses have been the location of terrible tragedies targeted by mass shooters because they are gun free zones, Pitts told us.
This bill would allow a responsible, trained permit holder to be in a position to defend themselves and others.
Pitts knows what he s talking about, too.
He s a retired city of Greenville, S.C. police officer, avid hunter and the leading Second Amendment advocate in the S.C. General Assembly.If you think about it, Chicago is one of the most anti-gun cities around and their crime is off the charts Disarming the law-abiding populace is never the answer to gun violence.
In fact, federal crime data has consistently shown that elevated gun ownership results in fewer murders, rapes and armed robberies.
