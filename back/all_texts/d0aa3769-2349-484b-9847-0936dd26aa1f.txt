Many thought Giuliani may be picked for Attorney General so this is a bit of a surprise to some, and a horrifying reality for the rest of the world considering the man doesn t have much of any foreign policy experience and is a warhawk.Honestly, the pick doesn t make that much sense, and many thought former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had the role locked up.
Which, in all honesty, would have made a whole heck of a lot more sense.The future Trump administration is getting more bizarre by the day and it s reading like a bad play where everyone runs for cover in the end.Featured Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images
