london ( reuters ) - u.s. agriculture secretary sonny perdue met with british politicians on thursday as the two countries eye the potential for increased farm trade once britain leaves the european union .
perdue talked to members of the environment , food and rural affairs select committee ( efra ) in the house of commons and is due to meet his british counterpart michael gove on friday .
britain is still part of the eu and we have to be respectful of that relationship but that doesn t preclude the fact we can begin the conversations on what would be in our best interests as two sovereign nations to pursue going forward , perdue told reporters after the meeting .
there have been concerns in britain about differing food safety standards with historic practices in the united states such as washing chicken carcasses in chlorine banned in the eu .
i think that is one of the things i m here to dispel .
we don t process chicken with chlorine any longer , he said , adding he wanted british consumers to be able to make decisions based on sound science and facts , not perception or myth .
committee members raised the importance of maintaining food standards in any trade deal .
we must ensure that a trade deal protects uk consumers and maintains a level playing field for our own producers .
food safety and animal welfare standards must upheld in any future free trade agreement , efra chair neil parish said .
perdue said would be premature to go into too much detail on future trade potential but added there might be scope for increased uk exports of lamb .
we think probably the uk is ahead of us in lamb and sheep production .
there is big demand to have access to the u.s. market in those products , he said .
parish said the domestic u.s. market presented significant opportunities for the uk food and farming industry and following brexit the government should focus on securing a great bilateral trade deal with our u.s. partners .
