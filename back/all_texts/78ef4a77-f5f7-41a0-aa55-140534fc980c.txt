Jared Kushner is an Orthodox Jew working in a White House surrounded by neo-Nazis, but he s also the son-in-law of Donald Trump, so principles be damned.
Now, Kushner is normally a reasonably handsome man, if you like the boyish white collar criminal type, but lately it seems, he s been channeling some of his father-in-law s worst qualities, including (bizarrely) his hair, which he s been wearing in that famous Trump combover/swirl/whatever the hell that thing is.I think we re in big trouble now.
For some reason, Jared Kushner has started styling his hair like Donald Trump.?

@SqueegeeSink @MikeSington Ivanka wants him to look like her dad?
Yeah I went there.

What if Ivanka chose the style, because the weird fascination and inappropriate relationship is a 2 way street?!

@MikeSington Well, he s in charge of everything I m sure his hair is falling out and a weird combover is necessary.

(@SheilaGinHB) April 29, 2017@MikeSington @gillyarcht The right-posterior oblique partline, combined with an anterior pushthrough, is classic emerging authoritarian.

@MikeSington Mimic the narcissist.
That is how you rise in power.
That is how you stay in power.
Trump will notice & limp ego will get momentary rise.
SnohoMo (@SnohoMo) April 29, 2017It s entirely possible that Kushner chose this new look to impress his father-in-law, although he was made the de facto president with his old hair, so he had clearly already made the right impression.More likely, this hairdo was Trump s doing.
Despite the fact that Trump is a one man What Not to Wear (ties too long, suits too big and that hair!
), #45 is obsessed with what everyone around him wears.
Kushner s monstrosity reportedly came courtesy of Trump s stylist which is located across the street from Trump s New York residence.
It s not tough to imagine him telling Kushner to get the Trump.
On a subconscious level, though, this hair style speaks to more than just trying to suck up to the boss.
It s about a full makeover, which with Kushner, includes his principles.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
