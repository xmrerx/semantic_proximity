the quiz read.Possible answers included He was shooting at Trump, His birthday, For completion of the windmill, or To scare off the attackers of Animal Farm.
Jim McCollum told the news site he did a double-take when his son showed him a screenshot he took of the test.
I had to read it two times, McCollum said.
I was like, Are you kidding me?
McCollum, a Jackson Hole High School graduate and Trump supporter, shared the quiz on Facebook, where it was shared widely and generated a lot of angry comments.
It was so inappropriate to show a name of a sitting president in that question, he said.
To me, that is so wrong in light of the situation in our country and the divisiveness and all.
He told the news site the incident is one of other examples of liberal bias in other classes at the school that make conservative students like son out to be the outcast.
He told me, Dad, they crapped on everything I believe in, McCollum said of his son.
