vienna ( reuters ) - austrian chancellor christian kern s social democrats asked facebook to disclose the identities of those behind sites which they say are spreading libel in an attempt to clean up a smear campaign scandal ahead of an election on oct. 15 .
kern has pledged to get to the bottom of his party s links to facebook pages which have made unsusbtantiated allegations against sebastian kurz , the head of the main opposition people s party , who is leading in polls for the forthcoming parliamentary vote .
the scandal has already cost kern s campaign manager his job .
the social democrats lawyers wrote to facebook in ireland on tuesday saying the group must , according to eu rules , hand over details about users who operate sites showing potentially libellous content about kern and kurz .
we ... ask you to give us all information you have about the persons behind these ... pages , especially names , email-addresses , ip-addresses or other contact details , vienna-based law firm freimueller/obereder/pilz said .
due to the urgency of the matter we ask for your answer within four days , the lawyers said in the letter obtained by reuters .
facebook had no immediate comment .
the social democrats have denied having any connection with two websites making unsubstantiated allegations against 31-year-old foreign minister kurz .
but austrian media reported on saturday that a former adviser to the social democrats who was dismissed this summer was originally behind the sites and that they had been kept in operation .
the social democrats also sued the as of yet unknown operators of the facebook pages for libel and for failing to comply with austria s media law which forbids anonymous publishing .
