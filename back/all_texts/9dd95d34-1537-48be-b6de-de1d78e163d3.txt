We liberals have known exactly who Donald Trump really is all along.
We knew which campaign promises he intended to keep and which were just a steaming pile of bullsh*t aimed at wooing his poorly educated supporters.
And since Election Day, we have been eagerly awaiting the mournful cries of those that swallowed his lies hook, line and sinker when they finally realize who he truly is and how he s going to screw over the American people.The Twitter page Trump Regrets has compiled the tweets of sorrowful Trump supporters who have caught on that they ve been had by a con-man.
The page was created in November 2016 and has already amassed 105,000 followers.
And yes, it is everything you hoped it would be.Some people are sick of his obsession with the media and the horrible grammar found in his numerous Twitter rants.
Other people are shocked that he did exactly what he said he was going to do by enacting his Muslim ban, building his stupid wall, pushing the Dakota Access Pipeline through and doing away with Obamacare.Damn @realDonaldTrump keeps getting worse every day.

P d off Amer.Patriot (@DRGNSLR441) January 25, 2017The list of tweets compiled by Trump Regrets goes on and on.
And there is no doubt that the number of Trump voters who realize they were duped by this orange tinged madman will certainly continue to grow.
But you have to wonder, how did they not see this coming?
Trump is doing the very things he said he would do all along.
Yet, somehow these morons just didn t manage to catch on and now they re in a state of shock.
The absurdity of it all boggles the mind.Featured image via Shawn Thew-Pool/Getty Images
