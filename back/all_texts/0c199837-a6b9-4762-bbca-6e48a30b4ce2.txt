When Donald Trump made his acceptance speech after winning the election, many of us were skeptical of his peaceful promise to be a president for all Americans especially after he spent his entire presidential campaign insulting the Muslim, Hispanic, LGBT, black, disabled and female Americans.
We had every right to remain guarded, and Trump is proving us right.On the first day of Trump s weird, completely unnecessary victory tour, Trump mocked the majority of Americans by making fun of the ones that didn t want him to be the next President of the United States.
At the rally in Cincinnati, Ohio last night, Trump railed against the extremely dishonest press for underestimating and criticizing him, completely ignoring the fact that most of America did not want him to win.Seemingly oblivious to the fact that he lost the popular vote by MILLIONS, Trump railed against specific members of the media, such as ABC s Martha Raddatz for having an extremely emotional reaction after realizing Trump would become America s future president.
Imitating Raddatz crying, Trump said: How about when a major anchor who hosted a debate started crying when she realized that we won?
How about that?
Tears.
No, tell me this isn t true.
Trump also explained how he d been watching the shocked reactions on people s faces as he followed the election results on TV, and seemed truly amused by it.
For a future leader of our country to show such a lack of respect, maturity and sensitivity to the very people he is going to be representing and leading is repulsive and should be condemned.
It s truly horrifying behavior.You can watch Trump insult Americans in the video below:Trump does not have the ability to be gracious or compassionate about anything, and it s clear that there won t be much improvement in the weeks leading up to his presidency.
If this is what Trump s speeches are going to look like, we re in for a long and painful four years.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
