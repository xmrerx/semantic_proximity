seoul ( reuters ) - south korea will resume the suspended construction of two new nuclear reactors from midnight , its energy ministry said on tuesday , but has torn up plans to build six more reactors as seoul seeks to meet pledges to cut reliance on nuclear power .
the move will restart work on the two reactors that was frozen after president moon jae-in came to power in may on a ticket calling for scaling back nuclear power .
it comes after results of a survey unveiled last week found a majority of south koreans actually backed the projects .
the world s fifth-biggest nuclear energy user currently runs 24 nuclear reactors , generating a third of the country s total electricity needs .
construction work ( for the two new nuclear reactors ) will begin immediately after midnight , paik un-gyu , minister of trade , industry and energy , told a news briefing in the capital .
but in a bid to press on with moon s commitment to boost use of natural gas and renewable sources in the nation s energy mix , the ministry said seoul will also cancel all plans to construct a further six nuclear reactors .
the number of nuclear reactors operating in south korea will be cut to a net 14 by 2038 it said .
the ministry said it will use alternative fuels such as solar and wind power to replace the six nuclear reactors with a projected combined capacity of 8.8 gigawatts ( gw ) .
additionally , the asia s fourth-largest economy will not allow extending the lifespan of 14 aging nuclear power stations , totaling 12.5 gw of capacity , the statement said .
the energy ministry said it will reflect changes in the country s long-term energy mix plan , which is expected to be finalised in november .
