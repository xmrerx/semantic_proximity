british pop singer rebecca ferguson , daughter of a white british woman and jamaican father , says she has been invited to perform at donald trump s inauguration , but her response may not be the rsvp the president-elect s team were expecting.the former uk x-factor runner-up said she would only accept the invitation on the condition that she could perform strange fruit a song protesting racism in 1930s america , made famous by billie holiday.the lyrics , written in the 1930s by jewish communist abel meeropol , were composed as a protest poem to highlight endemic racism in america s southern states.the song s opening lyrics deal with lynching , which was still happening in parts of the country at the time : southern trees bear strange fruit // blood on the leaves and blood at the root // black bodies swinging in the southern breeze // strange fruit hanging from the poplar trees.according to billie holiday s estate , holiday regularly performed the song at live performances in 1939 .
her record label , columbia , refused to let her record the song under their name , so they granted her a one-session contractual release that gave holiday clearance to independently record the track.later that year , the album featuring strange fruit sold a million copies , becoming holiday s biggest-selling record at the time .
in 1978 , the single was inducted into the grammy hall of fame .
last month , the beach boys told cnn that the group has been contacted about performing , but that no decision has been made at this point as to how or whether they will participate .
the so-called `` a '' list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration , but look what they did for hillary , nothing .
i want the people !
