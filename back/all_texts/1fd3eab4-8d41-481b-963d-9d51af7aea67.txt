WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Treasury said sanctions announced on Friday against a group of individuals and entities underscored a U.S. commitment to use such measures over Iran’s ballistic missile program and “destabilizing activities in the region.” It said in a statement that the sanctions were “fully consistent” with U.S. commitments under the Iran nuclear deal reached in 2015, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.
