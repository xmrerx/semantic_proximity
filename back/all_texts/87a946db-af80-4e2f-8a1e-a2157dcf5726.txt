WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic U.S.
Senator Jon Tester said on Sunday that he would vote against Judge Neil Gorsuch, President Donald Trump’s nominee to fill a vacancy on the U.S. Supreme Court.
The Montana lawmaker said in a statement that Gorsuch was “a smart man,” but added: “That doesn’t make him right for a lifetime appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court.”
