A close family friend, Shareena Joachim, 24, carried the Mace, they say.
Joachim was the first to reach the man as he stood by the door of the station s convenience store.
She tried to spray the Mace in his eyes but missed, hitting someone in her group instead, police said.
As she backed off, Gillard and others moved in.
Gillard swung the chair leg into the victim s head and face, hitting him over and over, until the chair leg broke over his head, police said.
One woman beat the victim with what police believe is a hammer.
Two juveniles, police said, stomped and kicked him in the head.
As the group pulled back, Joachim pulled the boy by his red-and-yellow jacket toward the victim, let him look, and then ushered him back into the van before it pulled away.
The Inquirer reported the unnamed victim is in a medically induced coma.WPVI-TV quoted a police spokesman saying the victim s prognosis was not good.
