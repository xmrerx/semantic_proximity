washington ( reuters ) - republican presidential candidates marco rubio and ted cruz released tax returns for several years on saturday in an effort to pressure billionaire front-runner donald trump to follow suit .
rubio , whose financial decisions earlier in his life have come under scrutiny , paid $ 78,917 in taxes on $ 335,561 in gross income in 2014 , along with his wife , jeanette .
cruz paid $ 389,124 in taxes on $ 1.2 million income in 2014 along with his wife , heidi , who is employed by goldman sachs and currently on leave from the bank .
rubio and cruz , both first-term u.s. senators , trail trump in national polls and are fighting to stop the political novice from locking up the republican nomination for the nov. 8 election after big wins in south carolina and nevada .
the real estate developer has said he will not release his returns until a routine audit has been completed .
“ if donald is embarrassed about his tax returns , it ’ s up to the voters to assess the facts .
it ’ s time to stop delaying and come clean with the american people , ” cruz said in a statement .
rubio released his last five years of federal returns on saturday , while cruz submitted four years .
rubio said trump , who has promoted his success as a businessman as one of his key qualifications for the presidency , may not be as wealthy as he suggests .
“ i think part of it is he ’ s not as rich as he says he is , ” rubio said while campaigning in georgia .
rubio and his wife have only one debt : the mortgage on their house , the campaign said , seeking to emphasize that the senator had moved past previous financial woes .
rubio often refers to the nearly $ 150,000 in student loan debt he incurred by the time he graduated from law school , paid off with proceeds made from his 2012 autobiography .
he also faced questions for struggling for several months in 2008 to pay the mortgage on his $ 384,000 south florida home , despite a $ 300,000 salary from his job at a miami law firm .
rubio also drew scrutiny for liquidating a retirement account to cover expenses , such as home repairs and school fees .
that was reflected in $ 68,241 of income as part of his 2014 return .
during his 2010 bid for the u.s. senate , which followed his stint as a florida state lawmaker from 2005-2006 , rubio had to defend his use of a republican party-issued american express credit card for more than $ 7,200 personal expenses , which he later paid back .
trump has accused rubio of living beyond his means .
rubio ’ s adjusted gross income in 2010 was $ 183,826 in 2010 .
it spiked to $ 929,439 in 2012 , when his book “ an american son : a memoir ” was published .
“ there is no doubt the rubio family has come a long way from the days when their largest monthly expense was a check to ( student loan provider ) sallie mae and checks were sent in the mail to pay bills with the hope the payment did not arrive before the next paycheck was deposited into their account , ” rubio ’ s campaign said .
cruz ’ s wealth , with $ 1.2 million in combined income with his wife in 2014 , placed them well above the $ 423,000 threshold of the top 1 percent of earners in texas , according to a 2015 economic policy institute report .
