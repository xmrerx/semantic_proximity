President Trump, waved off a question about gun control after Sunday s deadly shooting at a Texas church, saying: This isn t a guns situation and described the gunman as deranged At least 26 killed in shooting at Baptist church in Sutherland Springs, TexasComments by the anti-gun crowd on social media were ridiculous: Nothing to do with guns at all.
Ridiculous statement.
It s as if he can t even see reality.
Is he alright?
How can someone show their double-standards so blatantly ?
Why is it not terrorism?
?wrong skin color I guess.
A mental health problem at the highest level .

They love guns more then themselves.
Blood is on every citizen s hands.
