Glenn Beck has just proven once again, (to anyone who still gives a darn about what he has to say) how little he cares about shaking things up in DC and in doing so, has proven how irrelevant he really is to conservatives who used to believe in him.
From Jim Hoft of Gateway Pundit, who was also a close friend of Andrew Breitbart: It s only a matter of days now before Glenn Beck announces his allegiance to the Democrat Party, Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi.He has allowed his hatred and pride to consume him.And now that Donald Trump won the election he is doing all he can to make sure Trump fails.
Wow.On Monday Glenn Beck said Steve Bannon has ties to white nationalists.
This is a complete lie.
Check out this Dec. 12, 2011 interview with Andrew Breitbart where he exposes Glenn Beck as a race-baiter, a liar and a coward :Andrew Breitbart exposed USDA S Shirley Sherrod after she made extremely racist comments, bragging about how she used her power as a government official to discriminate against a white farmer in a room packed with blacks.
The controversy was real, but the mainstream media and Glenn Beck, who we believe has always been jealous of Andrew Breitbart s ability to with connect with conservatives and more specifically, the Tea Party tried to destroy Andrew over this video.
