America s village idiot could soon be in charge of taking care of America s veterans.Donald Trump has been stocking his administration with racists and extremist government insiders but their collective IQ is not low enough apparently, so he is considering picking Sarah Palin as the next Secretary of Veterans Affairs despite the fact that she has zero experience running a department, has never been in the military, and quit her last government job halfway through her term.ABC News reports that Trump is seriously considering Palin for the post.NEW: Sarah Palin under consideration for Secretary of Veterans Affairs, sources tell @ABC News.

#notmypresident @ K e v i a 0 4 (@NastyResister) November 30, 2016Our veterans deserve someone who can actually do the job, not a quitter who has no idea what she is talking about most of the time.Sarah Palin is totally unqualified to have any job in our federal government and Donald Trump is irresponsible for considering her for the post.
This woman couldn t even handle being the Governor of Alaska, so appointing her to head one of the biggest departments in our government is absolutely crazy.By considering Palin, Trump isn t proving that cares about veterans, he is demonstrating how much he doesn t give a shit about them.Featured Image: Screenshot
