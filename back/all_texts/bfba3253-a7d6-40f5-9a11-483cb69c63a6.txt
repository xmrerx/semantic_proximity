This is so horribly amazing that it defies description.
Conservatives who have a bone up their asses about a southern border that s not nearly as porous as they insist actually believe that Donald Trump will come back from Mexico with a check for his border wall.
Or, at least, a solid agreement for payment.They re on Twitter saying it.
Even former members of Congress are saying it.
Joe Walsh, who s a nitwit as it is, said that it would be game, set and match if Trump was able to accomplish that:You know, if @realDonaldTrump comes back from Mexico tomorrow with a big check from Mexico to pay for the wall that s game, set, match.
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) August 31, 2016Okay, so it s common knowledge that Walsh is delusional.
But so are others, apparently: Even Mexico s President knows #Trump will be our President; hence the invite!
Thinking #1 will be cost of the Wall!

I sense a wall is getting paid for pic.twitter.com/T54dxz58mn Liberty New England (@LibertyNEblog) August 31, 2016 If Trump comes back from Mexico with a cheque for the Wall, then this election is OVER!
#TrumpWins FitAussieForTrump (@SmurfBoobs) August 31, 2016That s a checkmate on #progressives if #Trump gets any reconciliation w Mexico s President.
Any agrmnt to build or fund the wall it s over!
Mudbone (@MGMiles76) August 31, 2016 @realDonaldTrump when your in #Mexico tomorrow don t forget to pick up the check for the wall.

Jerry for TRUMP (@123jerryv123) August 31, 2016 @HillaryClinton All Mexicans?
Really?
hum?
The President of Mexico is meeting with Trump tomorrow to work out a deal on the WALL!
#MAGA Trent R. (@trex554) August 31, 2016That s an astonishing level of gullibility right there, but Trump is a demagogue and his loyal followers eat up every single one of his words.
Even some conservative websites are peddling a lie that Mexico already agreed to pay for the wall: Because what s not written in this story is the Mexican political leadership arguing about the viability of the Southern Security Wall being built.
They have conceded the most important aspect.The argument has moved beyond will the wall be built, and now is focusing on who is going to pay for it.
The media will skip noticing that little nuance.
The answer is that, if a President Trump even manages to get authorization for the wall, we will end up paying for it.
Oh, sure, he ll claim that Mexico s paying for it with heavy tariffs and by ending NAFTA, and possibly other ways too, but the truth is that we will pay for it, since most of what he s saying about trade isn t likely to happen without him disbanding Congress.This would be hilarious if it wasn t so sad.Featured image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images
