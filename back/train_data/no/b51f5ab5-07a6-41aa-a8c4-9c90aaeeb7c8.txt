katie couric s career has been pretty much in a free fall since she left the today show to accept a job as the new host of the cbs news , after the disgraced ex-host dan rather , retired ( not surprisingly ) after he was caught using manufactured evidence to support a fake hit-piece designed to harm the credibility of president george w. bush .
