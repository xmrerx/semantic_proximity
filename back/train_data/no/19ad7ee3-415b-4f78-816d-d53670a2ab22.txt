i guess the people who work for the baltimore mayor are like rats on the sinking titanic .
maybe they figured out that it s not so smart to let rioters destroy your town and then expect the taxpayers to pick up the bloated tab .
baltimore mayor stephanie rawlings-blake is having a problem with retaining her staff .
ever since she helped bring the hammer down on six baltimore police officers over the accidental death of freddie gray , four members on her office on criminal justice have resigned .
as in , her four highest-ranking cabinet members have each resigned , one by one , over a three-week period .
that does not paint a pretty picture on what regard the baltimore mayor is held in with her staff members .
shannon cosgrove , deputy director of the office resigned tuesday .
angela johnese , director of the criminal justice office , and heather brantner , the mayor s sexual assault response team coordinator , left their positions in the mayor s office on may 22 .
levar michael , who headed the office s nonviolent programs , left two weeks ago .
not one of the departed provided a reason for leaving .
the rawlings-blake now faces even further scrutiny as it was determined that the costs incurred to the city stemming from the baltimore riots exceed $ 20 million , quite a hike from the initial estimate of $ 9 million .
so , who wants a job in the baltimore mayor s office ?
