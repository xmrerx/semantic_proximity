9-11 is a distant memory for liberals George Washington University has hired a former Islamic extremist to work at its center on homeland security a man who once denounced the United States and made threats against the creators of the TV series South Park for depicting the Prophet Muhammad in a bear suit.While reformed extremists have worked at universities in Europe to help fight terrorism, this is believed to be a first in the United States.Jesse Morton, who was known as Younus Abdullah Muhammad when he was a recruiter for the al-Qaeda, brings a unique perspective to counter-terrorism work, said Seamus Hughes, deputy director of the Program on Extremism at George Washington University s Center for Cyber & Homeland Security .Watch Younus Abdullah Muhammad here:During his days as an extremist, Morton earned a master s degree in international affairs from Columbia University.Hughes said before making the hiring decision, he discussed Morton with the FBI, leaders in the security community and the lawyers that prosecuted Morton.He said he s sure Morton is completely reformed from the days he served time in federal prison after inciting people to join a terrorist organization.
I trust him, he said.
We did our due diligence.
Nadia Oweidat, a fellow at the think tank New America who s interviewed dozens of former extremists, said she doesn t doubt Morton s sincerity.
People go through phases.
They evolve and are finally able to see the light, she said.She doesn t think Morton made up his de-radicalization to get a shorter prison sentence.
When an extremist defects, they risk being completely targeted by their community it s like saying you re gay publicly, she said.
There are life-altering consequences and you don t approach it lightly.
She said other organizations should also recruit former extremists in the hopes of preventing future massacres such as the San Bernardino shooting or the November terror attack in Paris, both committed by radicalized Islamists.
