berlin ( reuters ) - turkey will never be a member of the european union as long as it is governed by tayyip erdogan , german foreign minister sigmar gabriel said on thursday , accusing the turkish president of failing to take accession talks with the bloc seriously .
his remarks in an interview with mass-selling newspaper bild are likely to further inflame relations between the two nato allies after erdogan urged german turks to boycott germany s main parties in next month s general election .
it is clear that in this state , turkey will never become a member of the eu , gabriel said .
it s not because we don t want them but because the turkish government and erdogan are moving fast away from everything that europe stands for .
eu leaders have been critical of erdogan s crackdown on opponents before and after a failed military coup against him in july last year .
accession talks have ground to a virtual halt though turkey remains a candidate for membership .
turkey s western allies fear that sweeping new powers erdogan won in a tightly fought referendum in april are pushing turkey away from democratic values .
erdogan says both the crackdown and the increased presidential powers are needed to help tackle serious challenges to turkey s security both at home and beyond its borders .
at a highpoint in tensions earlier this year , erdogan angered germany , home to 3 million turks about half of whom can vote in the election on sept. 24 , by accusing german authorities of nazi-like behavior .
relations between the two countries have also been strained by turkey s arrest of a turkish-german journalist and a german human rights activist .
