barnicle : so you re asking the democrats to be as fair as the republicans were conway : they were very fair .
excuse me , president obama had seven of his cabinet members confirmed on january 20 , 2009 , his inauguration day .
are you going to guarantee me the same courtesy ?
it doesn t sound that way if you read the hill and the washington post , yesterday .
and then he had five more that week .
president bush had nine his first week .
he had state and defense and ag and commerce and education and energy and treasury .
are we going to have that ?
it doesn t seem that way .
