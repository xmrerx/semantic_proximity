PLEASE GO TO THE 2:00 MARK IN THIS VIDEO WHERE LYNCH SPEAKS ABOUT OUR BABIES AKA MINORITY CHILDREN:So it s no surprise that Lynch stood before a black congregation today and spoke of WE NOT as in ALL Americans but just the black community.
Her true racist colors are showing She DID say something about those of us who re not of the black community and it was rooted in the fear mongering that people like Jesse Jackson and Al Sharpton pushed in the black churches for so many years.It s so sad that even our own black president for the past 8 years said it never thought we could be post racial .Well, most Americans don t feel that way.
Communities across America are dismissing the TIRED rhetoric pushed at them.
WE UNITED ALREADY DIDN T WE?
Americans united to vote in Donald Trump .Americans of all backgrounds can t wait for a new administration that won t drag us all back into the same tired rhetoric
