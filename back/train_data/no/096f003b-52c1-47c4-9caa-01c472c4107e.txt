ottawa ( reuters ) - canada said on wednesday that defense contractors would be allowed to sell weapons such as automatic firearms and electric stun guns to ukraine , a move the government in kiev has long pressed for .
the canadian foreign ministry said in a statement it would closely examine every bid and noted that exportation of these items is limited .
ukraine , which says it needs the weapons to help counter russian-backed separatists who have occupied eastern parts of the country , also wants to buy arms from the united states .
washington though has yet to make a decision .
in september , russian president vladimir putin warned the united states not to supply ukraine with defensive weapons .
a war in eastern ukraine between pro-russian separatists and ukrainian government forces has killed more than 10,000 people in three years .
around 200 canadian troops are stationed in ukraine to help train local soldiers .
the mission is due to end in march 2019 .
canadian foreign minister chrystia freeland is a strong critic of russia , in particular its decision in 2014 to annex the ukrainian region of crimea .
