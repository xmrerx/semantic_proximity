harare ( reuters ) - zimbabwe s former vice president emmerson mnangagwa , who was sacked by president robert mugabe this week , has been expelled from the ruling zanu-pf , a party spokesman said on wednesday .
mnangagwa , a liberation war veteran and a long-time ally of mugabe , was until this week seen as a favorite to succeed the 93-year-old leader .
but mnangagwa s relationship with mugabe s wife , grace , has become increasingly strained as their two factions within zanu-pf fight for dominance .
mnangagwa s removal on monday came two days after grace publicly called him a coup plotter .
