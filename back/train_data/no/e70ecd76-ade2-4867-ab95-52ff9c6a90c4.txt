( reuters ) - a british tourist who caused a security scare at a donald trump campaign rally in las vegas in june by trying to grab a gun from a police officer pleaded guilty on tuesday to charges of illegal weapon possession and disorderly conduct , court papers showed .
michael steven sandford , 20 , admitted as part of his plea deal with prosecutors that he had approached a policeman at the event , saying he wanted an autograph from the presidential candidate , then tried to pull the officer ’ s gun from his holster with both hands , the papers said .
sandford , who had by then overstayed his tourist visa by about 10 months , was immediately arrested and removed from the rally .
he also acknowledged having visited a las vegas gun range the day before the june 18 incident at the treasure island casino-hotel , to take shooting lessons with a rented glock handgun , firing 20 rounds at a paper target , court papers showed .
no mention was made in the plea agreement about whether sandford intended to harm trump , then the presumptive republican nominee in the u.s. presidential race .
in the initial june 20 criminal complaint stemming from the incident , prosecutors said sandford had told a u.s. secret service agent he had driven to las vegas from california with the aim of shooting trump .
on june 29 , sandford was charged with felony counts of being an illegal alien in possession of a firearm and disrupting government business , but he was not accused of plotting to kill trump .
at tuesday ’ s hearing in federal court in las vegas , sandford pleaded guilty to those two charges , each of which carry a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison and a $ 250,000 fine , the u.s. attorney ’ s office said in a statement .
sentencing is scheduled for dec. 13 .
brenda weksler , one of sandford ’ s federal public defenders , declined to comment .
