Senator John McCain got some bad news on Tuesday when the women listed as the RSVP on his re-election fundraisers was arrested on drug charges.According to AZ Central, 34-year-old Emily Pitha, a former member of the staff of retired U.S. Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., was one of two people who were arrested after the Maricopa County Sheriff s Department raided her house.
When police entered her home they discovered a meth lab, LSD, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, counterfeit money, about $7,000 in cash and a marijuana grow house behind the home.In addition to all of the drugs and cash, two children were in the home (5 and 10).
Detective Doug Matteson said: [The kids] had easy access to all of (the) drugs and materials, even the bomb-making materials that were located in the back with the meth lab.
A Maricopa County Sheriff s Office spokesman said authorities executed the search warrant after a package containing over 250 grams of raw ecstasy (MDMA) from the Netherlands was delivered to the house.McCain s campaign manager, Ryan O Daniel, released a statement following the raid, saying: We commend the hard work and dedication of our law enforcement officers in their fight to keep our community safe from illegal drugs and associated criminal activity.
The campaign immediately terminated any relationship with Ms. Pitha upon learning of her alleged involvement in the operation.
It s a bit awkward that McCain s campaign is now embroiled in a drug scandal, when the senator has spent so much time claiming that he is tough on drugs.
Perhaps he should tone down the rhetoric if he is not going to bother to properly vet the people associated with him.
