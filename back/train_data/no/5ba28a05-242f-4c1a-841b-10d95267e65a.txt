former nbc anchor matt lauer claims he s planning on doing some soul searching now that he s got time on his hands after being fired for sexual misconduct .
he might want to take a look at the old footage of him awkwardly interviewing sandra bullock about a nude scene yikes !
is it his tone of voice or just overall creepiness during the interview ?
you be the judge lauer begins the 2009 interview about bullock s film the proposal by telling her how long it s been since he last interviewed her on the today show.he then adds with a smile : the major thing that s changed since i ve seen you last ?
i have now seen you naked .
bullock cringes and replies : and i m so sorry about that .
were you able to sleep afterwards ?
lauer then says creepily : it s now my screensaver , before continuing to push the issue by saying : you were naked for most of this movie .
bullock laughs awkwardly and insists : no , i m not .
i m not naked for most of this movie , [ perhaps ] emotionally naked .
lauer continues to question bullock about how she , playing a publishing house executive , covers her body with a wash cloth during the scene in which she bumps into her assistant played by ryan reynolds after a shower.later in the interview he brings up her nudity again , asking : did i mention you have a nude scene in this movie ?
pretty much from the time you opened your mouth , bullock snaps.lauer then tries to end the interview by saying : sandra bullock , come back more often but she replies no , not after this interview , no .
