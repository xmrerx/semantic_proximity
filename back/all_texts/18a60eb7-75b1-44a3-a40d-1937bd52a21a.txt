A ridiculous Kathy Griffin breaks down over the fall out from her controversial photo: I don t think I will have a career after this.
I m going to be honest, he broke me.
Nice job of blaming the victim!
How dare this woman try and turn this around to blame the Trump family and President Trump.
Please see the comment below the video that makes clear that Griffin stated she wanted to go after Barron Trump BEFORE this all happened!
This woman is responsible for everything that s happened to her!In case you missed it: Kathy Griffin is now digging herself a deeper hole.
She s hired a high profile attorney because she s now claiming to be the victim after she pulled a horrific stunt that shocked people on both sides of the aisle.
The word is that Griffin is saying the Trump family bullied her!
If you ever wondered how low victimhood can go this could be it.
This woman did something that traumatized the Trump family but is now claiming SHE S THE VICTIM??
?Lisa Bloom s twitter feed is full of extreme left tweets and claims about Barron Trump that are outrageous!
