If Donald Trump thought he d be seeing Elton John sing his praises on Inauguration Day he was sorely mistaken.During an interview with BBC, Trump transition team member Anthony Scaramucci claimed that openly gay singer Elton John will be performing at Trump s inauguration on January 20th.
Elton John is going to be doing our concert on the mall for inauguration, Scaramucci said, adding that John s appearance shows our commitment to gay rights.
This will be the first American president in US history that enters the White House with a pro-gay rights stance, Scaramucci continued.There s just one problem.
Apparently, Trump and his team failed to ask Elton John first.Because after hearing about this claim, Elton John told Trump to go f*ck himself.First a representative for John made it crystal clear that the openly gay artist isn t going anywhere near Trump s inauguration.
Elton will not be performing at Trump s inauguration, the rep said.Then John s publicist Fran Curtis rejected the claim more emphatically.
Incorrect.
He will NOT be performing.
Donald Trump may be a fan of Elton John, but the feeling is far from mutual.
John supported Hillary Clinton for president and said of Trump just last month that, We need a humanitarian in the White House, not a barbarian.
Just because Donald Trump said on 60 Minutes that same-sex marriage is settled law, it doesn t mean that the LGBT community believes him.
After all, Trump s running mate is Mike Pence, a man who is vehemently anti-gay.
Plus, conservatives expect Trump to nominate anti-gay judges to the Supreme Court, which puts gay rights in serious jeopardy.So while Trump is claiming that he s pro-gay rights, his actions need to speak louder than his words if he wants the LGBT community to stand behind him.
Because Elton John is not going to be used as a propaganda tool.Featured Image: Wikimedia
