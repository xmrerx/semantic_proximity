Some of Donald Trump s biggest fans and supporters are working and middle class Americans who often struggle from paycheck to paycheck and are fed up with how our current system operates.
That current system being, of course, where all the money is on top, the middle is taxed too much, and regular working people aren t given a fair shake.What these people fail to realize is that the person they want as Commander-in-Chief is merely pandering to that anger and using it for his own selfish goals of achieving the highest office in the land, even though he lacks any of the required experience.In what can only be seen as the best foreshadowing of what a Trump presidency would be like, a Trump-themed Lamborghini was driven up to the White House by a car enthusiast and parked outside.
The car, like Trump, screams unattainable opulence.
When a man refers to a million dollar loan from his father as a small loan you know he has no grasp on reality.According to the man in the video, the car is in town for goldRush Rally, which apparently is an automotive lifestyle rally.
Secret Service did show up to see what was going on.
The man from the video said: They just wanted to come take a look at who I was and what s going on, because, especially being in front of the White House with Donald Trump plastered on the front of the car, I can see why they d be questioning what s going on.
Ya think?However you look at this, it s probably one of the most obnoxious things you ll see this year, if not you re entire life.
Only to be outdone by an actual Trump presidency.
Which, by the way, we need to make sure never ever happens.Check out the video here:Featured image via video screen capture
