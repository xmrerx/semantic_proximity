hanoi ( reuters ) - vietnam on tuesday issued a strong condemnation of chinese military live-fire exercises in the disputed south china sea , amid rising tension between the two countries .
the maritime safety administration of china s southern province of hainan , which oversees the south china sea , said last month there would be live fire drills around the paracel islands , which vietnam claims , until september 2 .
vietnam strongly objects this action by china and seriously requests china to respect vietnam s sovereignty over the hoang sa ( paracel ) archipelagos , foreign ministry spokeswoman le thi thu hang said in a statement .
vietnam once again asserts that ( we ) will resolutely protect our sovereignty and our legitimate rights and interests in the east sea ( south china sea ) through peaceful measures that are suitable with international laws , the statement said .
china claims nearly all the south china sea , through which an estimated $ 3 trillion in international trade passes each year .
brunei , malaysia , the philippines and taiwan also have claims .
tension between china and neighboring vietnam is at its highest in three years over the disputed waters .
vietnam suspended oil drilling in offshore waters that are also claimed by china in july under pressure from beijing .
china has appeared uneasy at vietnam s efforts to rally southeast asian countries over the south china sea as well as at its growing defense relationships with the united states , japan and india .
