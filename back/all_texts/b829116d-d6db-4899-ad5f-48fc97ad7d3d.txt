So, aside from the GOP s premature statement that Pence won the debate tonight, who is really winning?
Who is going to win when all is said and done?
Probably The Onion and The Daily Show.
The Onion ran a story with the following headline: Moderator Reminds Vice Presidential Debate Audience To Remain Silent When Exiting Early.
It was already assumed that this debate wouldn t have nearly the spirit of the presidential debates, but The Onion took it nine steps further with this quote from the moderator, Elaine Quijano: It s crucial that you stay in a single-file line and make sure to keep moving in an orderly fashion so the aisles are clear for others attempting to leave their seats.
And please abstain from slamming the door so as not to disturb those audience members who are sleeping.
[emphasis mine] The Daily Show s live feed included a picture of a glass of milk with a tie, and some toast with a tie:The allusion is to milquetoast, which refers to a 1920s comic book character, Caspar Milquetoast, who was timid, and now is a general reference to people who are meek or timid.
Accompanying that image was audio from the actual debate.
It s also an illustration that the VP candidates do seem to remain in the background of each campaign.The general expectation was a very boring debate and both of these demonstrate that expectation very well.
However, we did end up with quite a bit of spirit between Kaine and Pence, probably a lot more than expected.
Either way, it s pretty clear that it s The Onion and The Daily Show that won the debate tonight.
