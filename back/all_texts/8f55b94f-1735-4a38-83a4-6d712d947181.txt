The Bundy militia has now been making a nuisance of itself and terrorizing Harney County, Oregon with its armed occupation of Malheur Wildlife Refuge for two weeks now.
It s been frustrating to sane people nationwide, but especially to the area s residents, whose lives have been disrupted by this nonsense.
Unfortunately, though, it has been confirmed that these people have no intention of going anywhere.
In fact, one of the militants, LaVoy Finicum, says they have a right to be there, even if the local residents want them to leave.Finicum said to the press that he knows that the people who actually live in the area want the militia to get out of dodge, and a third says we like what you re doing but not liking your method, appreciate it but we want you to go, and about a third saying don t go, stay.
However, the United States is a republic, so they aren t going anywhere.
He went on to say: Let s talk about a republic.
It s the right of an individual that we re looking at, not the right of the collective.
You know if there is just one rancher that is saying please help me, please don t go, what about him?
What about the Hammonds?
What about that family that is in prison?
Let them be released, he said.
It is about the one family right now.
Nevermind the fact that the Hammonds want absolutely nothing to do with this band of nutcases, and their attorney has said that these idiots do not speak for them.
That matters not to these yahoos, though.
This isn t about the Hammonds, this is about men wanting to play army and who are committing treason while fulfilling that fantasy.
Arrest them all, now.Watch the video of Finicum s remarks below:Featured image via video screen capture
