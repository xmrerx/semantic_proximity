ankara ( reuters ) - turkey s military operations in syria s rebel-held province of idlib aim to prevent a wave of migration into turkey , prime minister binali yildirim said on tuesday .
turkey has said it will provide assistance to rebels it has long backed as it implements a de-escalation agreement designed to reduce fighting with pro-government forces in the area , the most populous pocket of syria still in rebel hands .
on sunday , a turkish army reconnaissance team scouted the idlib province before an expected military operation to impose peace in the bitterly contested syrian northwest .
the reason for our activities is to prepare the groundwork and prevent a potential migrant wave into our country and lower tensions , yildirim told a parliamentary meeting of the ruling ak party .
turkey , which is already hosting around three million syrians , has been one of the biggest supporters of rebels fighting syrian president bashar al-assad during the six-and-a-half-year war , but its focus has moved from ousting him to securing its own border against jihadist and kurdish groups .
yildirim also said turkey aimed to create control points in idlib for future deployments , and that the activities of the armed forces in idlib would help prevent internal conflicts between civilians and militant groups in the region .
