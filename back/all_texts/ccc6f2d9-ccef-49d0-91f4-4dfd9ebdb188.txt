WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Senator John McCain survived a Tea Party challenge when he won Arizonaâ€™s Republican nominating contest on Tuesday, enabling him to seek a sixth term as U.S. senator from the southwestern state, according to media projections.
McCain, 80, defeated former Arizona state Senator Kelli Ward and is slated to defend his Senate seat against Democratic Representative Ann Kirkpatrick in the Nov. 8 election.
