Hammer attacks have been happening way too often lately.
Honestly, if you Google NYC hammer attacks you come up with way too many cases.
Is this the new trend in street crime?
Last year, it was slashing with a razor or knife.
Horrible!We just reported on a hammer attack last week:While the left wants to take guns away, the hammer is the culprit in this subway brawl This is a terrible attack that was provoked by nothing!
Two men asked if the person on the subway could move over.
The passenger was man-spreading aka using up two seats by spreading his legs apart.New York launched a campaign last year with posters on the subway telling passengers not to man-spread .
As you can see, it was a total waste of taxpayer dollars.It all went downhill from there An argument over man-spreading on a Lower East Side subway train ended in an all-out brawl with one man attacking another with a hammer, officials said Saturday.The 30-year-old hammer victim was on a Queens-bound J train pulling into the Bowery station when his 53-year-old pal asked a stranger taking up two seats to make room.The seat hog complied but that didn t stop the 30-year-old man from getting into an argument with him and six friends he was riding the train with, sparking a fight.One of the six friends repeatedly kicked the 30-year-old man in the head and chest, officials said.J train nightmare ensues after off-duty cop shoves conductor When the victim tried to defend himself, his attacker s friends jumped in and one of them pulled a hammer out of his backpack and bashed the victim repeatedly with it.The victim and his friend, 53, were on a Queens-bound J train coming into the Bowery/Delancey St. station when the older man asked a stranger taking up two seats to move.The victim s friend tried to shield the victim but was also beaten, witnesses told police.The suspects fled the train at the Bowery station and have not been caught, police said.First responders took both victims to Beth Israel Hospital with non-life-threatening wounds.Via: NYDN
