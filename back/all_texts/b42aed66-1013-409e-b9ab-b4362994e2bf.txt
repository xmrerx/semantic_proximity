We already know that Donald Trump hates exercising.
In Italy, Trump rode in a golf cart, rather than walk 700 yards like the rest of the world leaders at the G-7 meeting.
I guess it would make sense then that Trump s insists on burning as few calories as possible at his frequent golf outings, but what he did at his own Bedminster Club in New Jersey has even his rich white male base fuming.
He drove his cart onto the green.
I m not a golfer, and even I know this is never done.President Trump driving his golf cart all over the green is the most Trump thing ever(via MikeNFrank/Twitter) pic.twitter.com/UWuIcCIOnT Sports Illustrated (@SInow) June 22, 2017People weren t having it:Bad etiquette.
It s disrespectful to every paying member of that club.
It doesn t matter if he owns the course.
Jerry Sardella (@SpecV63) June 22, 2017beyond bad ettiquette, played with my 72 yr old mother last wk & she almost died when a guy drove up near the fringe, like 10 ft frm green John from Frederick (@BittnerJohn) June 22, 2017For as much time he spends on the course, he should know there are rules in the game of golf and driving on the green is a big no no.
Nick Walker (@Nicksplosion) June 22, 2017All the ones defending him driving on the green are assholes who would drive a cart on a green.
Putting through tire tracks is no fun.
Daniel (@ahhdeeh) June 22, 2017As a golfer, I am appalled LoyalOppositionKaren (@ybbkaren) June 22, 2017What an ass hat!
In a 30-second video & he broke 2 rules of golf.
BTW- this is a CLUB.
The members own the course, not just him Lisa Cutter (@CutPhD) June 22, 2017Trump strongly held the straight white middle America vote until he drove the golf cart on the green Jack Wickham (@jawickham) June 22, 2017Of course, this is hardly the worst thing Trump has done, even today, but this may be the first time Trump s entitled jerk and bully attitude even hit home with his base at least the part of his base that plays golf.Featured image via Ian MacNicol/Getty Images
