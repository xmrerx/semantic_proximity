As much as the media pundits want to pretend like they re treating Hillary Clinton like everyone else running for president, the truth is, they re not.
She s still criticized on what she wears, how often she smiles, and even on the tone of her voice in how she delivers her message.While the men on the campaign trail can sometimes wear some very unflattering suits or not look their finest, no one utters a word.
As the men shout they re called passionate and enthusiastic, whereas Hillary is called hostile, shrill or angry.
And as much as even some liberals don t want to admit there s a double-standard, there is, and it s not hard to see if you actually take the time to notice.Appearing on Jimmy Kimmel Live on Thursday night, Kimmel put together a sketch with the former Secretary of State to perfectly simulate what s been happening to Hillary throughout her campaign.Kimmel begins by asking Hillary: I m going to help you win this election no problem.
Are you familiar with mansplaining?
And Hillary plays it off as though she has no idea what he s talking about, so Kimmel proceeds to mansplain pretty much everything that comes out of her mouth.
He also makes sure to stick in jabs about what she should wear and how often she should smile and/or appear serious.This is pretty much the most spot-on take on what s been happening to Hillary not only throughout this election cycle, but throughout her entire career.Absolutely perfect.
Well done, Jimmy..@JimmyKimmelLive: I m going to help you win this election no problem.
