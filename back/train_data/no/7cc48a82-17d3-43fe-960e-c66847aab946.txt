berlin ( reuters ) - there will never again be a border dividing northern ireland and the republic , a british minister said days before a summit at which the irish border issue threatens to derail britain s brexit plans .
but in the interview with the rheinische post newspaper , international trade minister greg hands reaffirmed that britain would quit the european union s customs union , a move most experts believe would lead to the reimposition of a border .
currently , both parts of the island are members of the same customs union , meaning checks of goods crossing the border are unnecessary .
if britain left the customs union and no new checks were imposed , many experts warn it would create a back-door route to circumvent eu tariffs .
as part of its negotiations to quit the european union , britain must satisfy the bloc s remaining 27 members that it has settled issues including its financial obligations , citizens rights and maintaining a low-friction border between the two parts of the divided island .
failure to do so could bring a veto from any of the bloc s member states , including the republic of ireland , preventing britain from moving on to a discussion of its future relationship with its much larger neighbor .
all sides , the irish government , my government and the european commission are committed to the peace deal that ended the northern ireland conflict , hands said .
there will never be a border between north and south .
extracts of the interview were published on thursday .
he said he was confident that no veto would be cast at the mid-december summit .
the 1998 good friday peace agreement between britain and the republic of ireland was the crucial step that brought to an end decades of violence in northern ireland , partly by offering extensive provisions to allow residents of the british province to maintain allegiance to both eu member states .
