21st century wire says this was one of the most eagerly anticipated cyber events ever , but today s october surprise turned out to be an october tease.on monday , wikileaks founder julian assange warmed up the international community , and more importantly trump supporters , when he hinted , if we are going to make a major publication about the u.s. , we wouldn t do it at 3 a.m [ tues ] .
as it turns out , after much hope and lots of hype , trump supporters couldn t even get to first base with assange this morning over in america , the trump camp was buzzing with the promise that hillary clinton would be mortally wounded by this morning s big reveal .
trump s online again-offline again surrogate-cum-secret agent , roger stone , was over the moon with joy , and even tweeted : wednesday @ hillaryclinton is done .
# wikileaks .
roger stone ( @ rogerjstonejr ) october 2 , 2016trump backer alex jones insisted that the wikileaks document dump would be historic and that the clintons will be devastated !
and even went so far as to promote a live broadcast special on his channel infowars.com , promising to unveil the devastating news.in the end , nothing happened .

https : //t.co/m4sakik1go infowars ( @ infowars ) october 3 , 2016a classic case of the media jumping the gun , before anything was actually confirmed.it wasn t only jones and co .
many a trump supporter stayed up all night in anticipation of what this wikileaks trove might bring did # julianassange just make me stay up 20 hours straight for him to say see you in november ?
# wikileaks tim black ( @ realtimblack ) october 4 , 2016it is still possible that the major information release previously promised by assange is imminent , and assange did hint at this in the wake of the dnc leaks which led to the resignation of chairwoman debbie wasserman-schultz and others over systemic democratic party corruption .
in his statement , he reiterated the incredible workload that he and his team have in vetting all the information in their possession before it s released .
wikileaks also has to be careful in order to preserve the integrity of the leaks , but also to organize and catalogue the information for press and public consumption.assange has since indicated that waves of documents will now be revealed in a time-released fashion , with some items dumped each week , right up until the us election on november 8th.when asked during his berlin videocast about what the impact might be based on his knowledge of the information , assange simply relied : we think they re significant .
