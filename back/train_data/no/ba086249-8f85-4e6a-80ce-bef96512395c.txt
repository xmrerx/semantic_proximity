donald trump and elizabeth warren are engaged in a twitter feud for the ages and she s kicking his ass.on saturday , the massachusetts senator ripped the republican nominee to shreds for picking indiana governor mike pence as his running mate on the 2016 ticket .. @ realdonaldtrump & @ mike_pence are a perfect match : two small , insecure , weak men who use hate & fear to divide our country & our people .
elizabeth warren ( @ elizabethforma ) july 16 , 2016 of course @ realdonaldtrump a guy who calls women fat pigs & bimbos picked a vp who is famous for trying to control women s bodies .
elizabeth warren ( @ elizabethforma ) july 16 , 2016what s worse ?
@ realdonaldtrump & @ mike_pence s sexism isn t some radical fringe of the @ gop .
they re in line with the party platform .
elizabeth warren ( @ elizabethforma ) july 16 , 2016 and of course @ realdonaldtrump a guy who [ doesn t ] feel good about marriage equality picked a vp famous for lgbt discrimination .
elizabeth warren ( @ elizabethforma ) july 16 , 2016terrifying to think of @ mike_pence being a heartbeat from presidency but the direction @ gop wants to take our country is more terrifying .
elizabeth warren ( @ elizabethforma ) july 16 , 2016in response , donald trump threw a temper tantrum which , of course , included another instance of referring to warren as pocahontas and goofy .
trump also called her lazy and a fraud , and suggested she didn t earn her senate seat with hard work .
goofy elizabeth warren , who may be the least productive senator in the u.s. senate , must prove she is not a fraud .
without the con it s over donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) july 17 , 2016i hope that crooked hillary picks goofy elizabeth warren , sometimes referred to as pocahontas , as her v.p .
then we can litigate her fraud !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) july 17 , 2016 if goofy elizabeth warren , a very weak senator , didn t lie about her heritage ( being native american ) she would be nothing today .
pick her h donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) july 17 , 2016well , warren wasn t going to let trump get away with any of that bullshit , and she launched a barrage of tweets leveling trump into a pile of rubble.nasty name-calling & lies about my family aren t going to shut me up , @ realdonaldtrump .
is that really all you ve got ?
elizabeth warren ( @ elizabethforma ) july 17 , 2016 pres reagan s solicitor general was the harvard prof who hired me , @ realdonaldtrump .
he says your right-wing conspiracy theories are a lie .
elizabeth warren ( @ elizabethforma ) july 17 , 2016it might blow your mind that a woman worked hard & earned a good job on her own , @ realdonaldtrump , but it s not the 1800s .
it happens .
elizabeth warren ( @ elizabethforma ) july 17 , 2016 you want to talk about who s a fraud , @ realdonaldtrump ?
