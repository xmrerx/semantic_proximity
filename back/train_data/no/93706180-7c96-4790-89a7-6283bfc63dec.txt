the clinton crime syndicate may find a few bumps in the road , as they attempt to claw their way back into he white house .
women who have been intimidated and silenced by the clinton crime syndicate in the past , have recently been inspired by other women who are bravely speaking out against this serial pervert and the woman who has enabled bill s war against women for decades since returning to the campaign trail as an advocate for hillary , bill clinton has been harried by renewed interest in his past sexual misconduct as well as hillary s alleged role in intimidating his victims into silence.roger stone , author of the new york times bestselling the clinton s war on women , claims that he has personal knowledge of previously unknown victims who are preparing to come forward with accusations against the former president .
i identified 24 women who ve been assaulted by bill clinton , stone said on the sean hannity show .
now some of these women are still terrified .
some of them have had irs audits .
some of them have had their families threatened .
but others have come forward .
are you saying there s women whose names we don t know that are mentioned in your book or not mentioned in your book that are going to come forward and start telling those stories ?
sean asked .
yes , i think it s very probable , stone responded .
not all of them because some of them are still terrified , their families have been threatened , their lives have been threatened .
are we talking about affairs , or are we talking about assaults ?
asked hannity .
we re talking about assaults , declared stone .
i don t want to get out ahead of myself but i think as broaddrick , and [ kathleen ] willey , and jones speak out , other women are encouraged who have been assaulted , who have been threatened by hillary are encouraged by the courage of those three women .
