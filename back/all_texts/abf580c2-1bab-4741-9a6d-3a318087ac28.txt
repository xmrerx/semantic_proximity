WOW!
Not until people like Brett Hume tweeted out bashing CNN for their fake news did CNN finally retract a lie about Trump.CNN has FINALLY corrected a Tuesday report after the release of former FBI Director James Comey s opening statement for his Thursday testimony in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee contradicted the reports sources.The CNN report said Comey was expected to dispute President Trump s claims that Comey said he was not under investigation on multiple occasions.The report, titled Comey expected to refute Trump, was based on unnamed sources and said Comey s conversations with the president were much more nuanced, and that Trump drew the wrong conclusion.The story was complied by four CNN journalists, including Gloria Borger, Eric Lichtblau, Jake Tapper and Brian Rokus.Borger reiterated the reports claims in an appearance on CNN Tuesday.
Comey is going to dispute the president on this point if he s asked about it by senators, and we have to assume that he will be, said Borger, the network s chief political analyst.
He will say he never assured Donald Trump that he was not under investigation, that that would have been improper for him to do so.
Comey s opening statement did, however, mention asserting that Trump was not under investigation, however the statement failed to specify whether Trump was not under criminal investigation, but only said there was no counter-intelligence investigation on the president.Read more: The Hill
