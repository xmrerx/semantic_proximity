It looks like Breitbart superstar Milo Yiannopoulos 15 minutes of fame has ended after a teensy weensy little pro-pedophilia video has surfaced.
We get hung up on this sort of child abuse stuff to the point where we are heavily policing consensual adults, Yiannopoulos can be heard saying during a podcast, adding that it s normal in the homosexual world (it s not) for young boys and older men to have relationships :In the homosexual world, particularly, some of those relationships between younger boys and older men the sort of coming of age relationship those relationships in which those older men help those young boys discover who they are and give them security and safety and provide them with love and a reliable, sort of rock, where they can t speak to their parents.According to Yiannopoulos, 13-year-old boys are sexually mature people who can have relationships, which are positive experiences, with older men.
During the interview, the Trump supporter and (until recently) CPAC headliner explained that he is advocating for man-on-child sex.Here is a longer cut where Milo Yiannopoulos says that he "is advocating" for legal sex between 13 year olds!
& older men.

Even the vile white supremacists at Breitbart have decided that he might have gone too far and these are the people who worked under President Steve Bannon!But what probably hurts most about all this for Milo, who calls Donald Trump daddy, is that he lost his precious book deal.
Publisher Simon & Schuster announced Monday that Milo s precious book isn t happening anymore: After careful consideration, Simon & Schuster and its Threshold Editions imprint have cancelled publication of Dangerous by Milo Yiannopoulos.
He s not taking this well.
after apologizing for calling the 13-year-old boys he referenced boys rather than young men, the normally boisterous right-wing figure was reduced to simple sentences whining about what his pedophilia advocacy has cost him:(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));They canceled my book.Posted by Milo Yiannopoulos on Monday, February 20, 2017 because he s the real victim here:(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.3"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));I've gone through worse.
This will not defeat me.Posted by Milo Yiannopoulos on Monday, February 20, 2017Milo would complain on Twitter, but he has been banned from that platform ever since he led a racist mob attack on Saturday Night Live s Leslie Jones.Sadly, he probably will get through this given the enthusiastic response from conservatives, who don t care if Milo thinks it s OK to molest children: Sorry, Milo the free market has spoken, and its invisible hand slapped you across the face.Featured image via screengrab
