What is with conservatives being all butthurt over criticism all of a sudden, now that Republicans are the target of so much ire?
Suddenly they re all about respecting the President and his family, despite 8 long years of racist hate and conspiracy theories (without a shred of evidence supporting them) spewing forth from their mouthpieces.Consider Sean Hannity and what he just said.
He literally said in comments on Media Matters For America: Nobody picked on Malia and Sasha, no conservative that I know of.
Nobody picked on Michelle Obama except for the stupid statements, for the first time in my adult life I m proud of my country.
She inserted herself into the campaign.
If she s going to say something like that then she deserves to be criticized.
What.
WHAT?
Just WHAT???
Hannity spent all of 2016 criticizing the hell out of Michelle Obama, including sharing a fake story about her from the lying website The Gateway Pundit.
He offered to charter a plane for the Obamas to disappear to Canada, Kenya or Indonesia anywhere as long as they didn t come back.But there s more, not just from Hannity s shit-spewing cakehole, but from conservatives damn near everywhere:And there s so much more.
Hannity s a god-damn, motherfucking hypocrite for saying that conservatives were very kind to the Obamas.
The above list is just the tip of the iceberg conservatives were anything but kind to them during their term in the White House.
What everyone s doing with Trump is nothing compared to that.Featured image by Rob Kim via Getty Images
