This picture is representative of the violence Americans witnessed last year after former President Obama made it clear (through his silence) to Americans and to illegal aliens that it was acceptable to violently attack American citizens who held an opposing political view:This picture represents a post-Obama America, when American citizens who support our current law-and-order President have had enough, and are fighting back against violent basement dwellers and paid Soros activists.
Is there really anything better than watching an Antifa thug running from a Trump supporter wielding an American flag?
