beirut ( reuters ) - two weeks after russia said it had critically injured the leader of the tahrir al-sham militant group in syria , an undated video was published on wednesday , purporting to show its leader abu mohamad al-golani , apparently in good health .
the video showed golani lecturing his fighters and played scenes of militants in battle .
after the reported strike earlier this month , a russian defence ministry spokesman said golani had lost an arm and was in critical condition .
russia is an ally of syrian president bashar al-assad .
previously called the nusra front , the group severed ties with al qaeda last year and in january re-branded itself as leading force in the hayat tahrir al-sham alliance .
opposed to the syrian government , the jihadist group is the dominant faction in the northwestern rebel-held province of idlib .
