We ve heard nonstop from Donald Trump, and his family and campaign, how wonderfully, generously philanthropic he is.
He has personally donated millions of dollars to various charities over a number of years, to hear them tell it.
However, many are extremely skeptical of that claim, as well they should be.
David Farenthold, of the Washington Post, has been investigating where at least some of that money has gone, and is coming up damn near empty-handed.Since Sept. 21, Farenthold has been calling charity, after charity, after charity, trying to find even one that s received money from Trump personally.
To date, he s called 386 charities, everything from schools to AIDS charities, to religious foundations, and everything in between.
Below is just a tiny sample of Farenthold s list:And many more.
It s true that there are lot of charities telling Farenthold, No comment, but, well, gee, Trump s tax returns could settle that uncertainty.
Too bad he won t release them and we have to go about discovering the truth the hard way.But we digress.
A ton of other charities are saying, Never, though.
In fact, between 2008 and now, Farenthold has found maybe $1 million or so in charitable donations from Trump.Trump, however, keeps insisting that he s given millions to charity, and apparently his people told Farenthold that he prefers to give quietly so that more charities won t find out and call him.
Chris Christie claimed that Trump gave tens of millions of his own money, but Buzzfeed s Andrew Kaczynski says there s no proof of that.In an earlier story, the Post revealed that they d found less than $10,000 in charitable giving over a period of seven years.
At the time that story ran, Trump s campaign was saying that there s no way for the press to know or understand his giving (again, releasing his tax returns would settle this).
Despite a mounting body of evidence against him, the claim is, inexplicably, still there.We call bullshit, and it looks like the Post does too.Farenthold has been posting updates on his quest on Twitter, complete with photos of his notes:I ve been trying to find evidence that @realDonaldTrump gave any $ out of his own pocket between 08 and this May.
Results so far: pic.twitter.com/JSggLbJcit David Fahrenthold (@Fahrenthold) September 21, 2016But that money could still be out there!
If @CortesSteve or anybody else knows of gifts that haven t been previously reported, let me know!
David Fahrenthold (@Fahrenthold) September 21, 2016At RNC, @ChrisChristie said @realDonaldTrump gave to Sandy Relief fund run by Ms. Christie.
Turns out, Trump didn t. https://t.co/ykSCxFzgw7 David Fahrenthold (@Fahrenthold) September 21, 2016UPDATE: I ve now called 346 charities, looking for proof that @realDonaldTrump really does give millions of his own $ pic.twitter.com/NpTrQYnoh3 David Fahrenthold (@Fahrenthold) September 23, 2016.
@realDonaldTrump folks have said he gives quietly, from own pocket, to keep other charities from finding out and badgering him for $.
https://t.co/dFTpISw9Os David Fahrenthold (@Fahrenthold) September 28, 2016I ve now called 381 charities, looking for proof that @realDonaldTrump really does give his own money to charity.

Still a chance the Dwyer H.S.
Band (#380) got it all pic.twitter.com/1jRKkv7G7u David Fahrenthold (@Fahrenthold) October 5, 2016This is the reporter behind the Post s damning story on the Trump Foundation s lack of paperwork, and their lack of legal right to solicit donations in excess of $25,000 per year.
Farenthold has been deep into everything Trump has to do with charity since last February, and his investigations just unravel more and more of the mountainous lie that is Donald Trump.
