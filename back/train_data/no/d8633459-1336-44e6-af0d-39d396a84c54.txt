confusing different policies and different ideologies defines the modern democratic party whether it s on domestic or foreign policy , you can count on the democrats to confuse the heck out of the american people andrew mccarthy says it best in his national review column , democrats know the election was legitimate but persist in a dangerous fraud .
andy reminds us of the democrats 180 on accepting the results of the election .
horrifying !
inveighed an indignant hillary clinton at the last presidential debate , less than three weeks before election day .
what so horrified her ?
donald trump s refusal to pledge that he would accept the legitimacy of the election.trump speculated that the electoral process could be rigged .
until he saw how it played out , the republican nominee said , he could not concede that the result would be on the up-and-up .
* * * a flabbergasted clinton responded that she was shocked horrified !
to hear trump talking down our democracy .
this was a top theme in her campaign s closing days : the election was absolutely legitimate ; trump was traitorously condemnable for refusing to say so.of course , clinton and the democrats who parroted her would prefer that you forget that now.ever since election day , the democrats have tried to undermine the trump administration by questioning the legitimacy of his victory .
but until now , i don t recall any of them actually denying that trump won the election .
that is the position taken last night by the newly-installed chairman of the democratic national committee , tom perez.speaking to a democratic rally in newark , perez said , among other things : republicans don t give a shit about people and donald trump , you didn t win the election .
according to perez , the wrong candidate was inaugurated on january 20.and the knock on perez when he ran for dnc chairman was that he wasn t crazy enough !
in today s democratic party , insanity isn t optional .
it is mandatory.via : powerline
