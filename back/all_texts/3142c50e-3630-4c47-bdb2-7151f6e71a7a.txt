Knowing there were problems ahead for the Jews, Soros father, who was a successful lawyer, bribed a government official to take 14 year old George Soros in and say he was his Christian godson.
While hundreds of thousands of Hungarian Jews were being shipped off to the death camps, George Soros accompanied his appointed godfather around confiscating property from Jews.
George admitted it wasn t difficult at all to take part in taking property from the Jews.
Kroft asked Soros if it bothered him?Soros: It created no problem at all.Kroft: No feeling of guilt?
Soros: No.Soros makes it very clear in the interview that it didn t really bother him at all.
He said he was 14 years old, and that s when his character was formed.Soros: I would say that that s when my character was made.
It was a tremendous threat of evil.
It was a very personal experience of evil.
Kroft: Do you believe in God?Soros:No.Kroft: Soros told us God was created by man, not the other way around.
