MADRID (Reuters) - If the ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont fails to appear in court, the normal procedure would be to issue an arrest warrant, the president of Spain s Supreme Court said on Thursday.
When someone doesn t appear after being cited by a judge to testify, in Spain or any other EU country, normally an arrest warrant is issued, Supreme Court President Carlos Lesmes said.
Puigdemont said on Wednesday he would ignore a court order to return to Spain to answer charges over the region s push for independence.
He did not turn up at a High Court hearing on Thursday.
