jakarta ( reuters ) - indonesian anti-terrorism police have detained 18 people with links to militant groups in a bid to cut the risk of attacks during christmas and the new year in the world s biggest muslim-majority country , police said on monday .
near-simultaneous attacks on churches in the capital , jakarta , and elsewhere on christmas eve in 2000 , killed nearly 20 people .
ever since , authorities have stepped up security at churches and tourist spots for the holiday .
police chief tito karnavian said while there was no evidence of a specific plot , the detentions were made in a bid to head off trouble .
we re doing a pre-emptive strike , karnavian told reporters .
the majority of them have links to previous incidents ( and people ) who we had arrested earlier , he said .
police said that 12 people had been detained in south sumatra , four in west kalimantan , one in malang in east java and one in surabaya in the same province .
under indonesia s anti-terrorism laws , investigators can hold people for seven days before determining whether they will be designated suspects or released , said police spokesman setyo wasisto .
indonesia has seen its share of militant attacks over the years aimed at foreign , christian and government targets including blasts on the tourist island of bali in 2002 that killed 202 people .
since then , police have managed to stamp out or weaken many militant networks although there has been a resurgence in radicalism in recent years , inspired largely by islamic state .
a series of small-scale attacks since early 2016 has been linked to islamic state , which is believed to have thousands of sympathizers in indonesia .
