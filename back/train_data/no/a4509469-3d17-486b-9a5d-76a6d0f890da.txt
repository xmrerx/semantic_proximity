and the afl-cio is crying in their money pit wouldn t it be a great get to have college football players unionized ?
the players are students and not employees unless you want to bust this whole thing wide open and tell the truth about how players might be compensated .
it s really pretty shocking that the nlrb decided to shoot this down since they re 3-2 dem .
the national labor relations board rejected a bid by football players at northwestern university to form a union .
in an unanimous decision released monday , the board said it lacked jurisdiction in the matter .
by statute the board does not have jurisdiction over state-run colleges and universities , it said .
the board is the main federal labor law enforcement agency .
its members are nominated by the president and it currently has a 3-2 democratic majority.the announcement reverses a march 2014 decision by a board regional director , who ruled that the players were employees of the university , not students .
therefore , they had the right to form a union.while that ruling applied only to northwestern athletes , it had major implications for college athletics generally , being the first time a student-athlete group has been granted collective bargaining rights .
other groups could have cited it as a precedent if they tried to unionize.via : washington examiner
