21st Century Wire says Kellyanne Conway thrashed NBC s Chuck Todd around the set on Meet The Press when he tried to paint the Trump administration as releasing false information about their inauguration attendance numbers.
Conway, like many viewers, immediately caught Todd in the fact that the topic was meaningless and was quick to point out a number of main stream media reports containing falsehoods that were pushed by establishment media.
Conway hit her stride regarding the topic of inauguration attendance numbers when she told Chuck Todd, Presidents aren t judged by crowd sizes at their inaugurations, they are judged by their accomplishments.
When Todd hit back with a double down on the accusations that the comments by Trump Press Secretary, Sean Spicer, were put out there to push a provable falsehood Conway fired back with some choice phrases that have commentators on the edge of their seats.
We re going to have to rethink our relationship with the media.
