The alt-right political movement is not something most mainstream voters know much about, but this year it is imperative that they do.
This brand of conservativism is one that is disturbing on many levels, and made up of neo-Nazis, white nationalists, and other assorted racist extremists.
What s more is that Steve Bannon, head of the insanely bigoted conservative website Breitbart, is now heading up Donald Trump s campaign for president.
Therefore, Hillary Clinton is planning to do the people of America a favor this coming Thursday and give a speech educating the people on this fringe movement that is definitely a big player in the Trump campaign.The Clinton campaign says of the speech: This alt-right brand is embracing extremism and presenting a divisive and dystopian view of America which should concern all Americans, regardless of party.
They go on to remind everyone that Trump s entire campaign staff is made up of people who embrace this bigoted garbage.
Indeed, this is something that used to be on the fringes, in the bowels of the interwebs where only basement-dwelling imbeciles who embrace the new white supremacy even knew anything about this largely online movement.
However, Donald Trump has changed all of that, and empowered these dangerous idiots to come into the light.
They see him as an inspiration.
They have definitely picked up on Trump s dog whistling.
After all, we all know that Make America Great Again, is really just code for Make America WHITE Again.
Despite Trump s recent pathetic efforts to reach out to minority voters, we all know what he is REALLY doing trying to make white people uncomfortable with such blatant racism believe he s just not-racist enough for them to be able to pull the lever for him this November.Thank you, Secretary Clinton, for this public service.
Hopefully, people listen.Featured image via Mark Makela/Getty Images
