baghdad ( reuters ) - islamic state will be completely defeated in iraq this year , iraqi state television quoted prime minister haider al-abadi as saying on tuesday .
islamic state s cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in july , when u.s.-backed iraqi forces captured mosul , the group s de facto capital in iraq , after a nine-month battle .
the group s last territory in iraq is now a stretch skirting the western border with syria following the fall of the town of hawija and surrounding areas on oct. 5 in an offensive by u.s.-backed iraqi forces .
