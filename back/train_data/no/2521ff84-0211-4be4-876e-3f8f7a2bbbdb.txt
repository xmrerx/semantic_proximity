beirut ( reuters ) - western intelligence agencies warned former lebanese prime minister saad al-hariri of an assassination plot against him , the saudi-owned pan-arab newspaper asharq al-awsat reported on sunday .
it cited unnamed sources close to hariri .
however , major general abbas ibrahim , head of lebanon s general security , said he had no information about an assassination plot against political figures in lebanon .
the army also said it had not uncovered any such plots .
asharq al-awsat reported that the sources revealed that he had received western warnings of an assassination attempt that was prepared against him .
it did not give further details of the alleged plot .
hariri announced his surprise resignation on saturday , citing a plot to kill him , and saying the climate in lebanon resembled that before the assassination of his father rafik al-hariri , who was also prime minister , in 2005 .
he criticized iran and its lebanese ally hezbollah for their role in lebanon and other arab countries .
hariri traveled to riyadh on friday and did not return to lebanon .
his resignation was made in a televised statement from saudi arabia , an arch rival of iran .
asharq al-awsat reported the same unnamed sources as speculating that hariri would probably remain outside lebanon because of the security threat against him .
on saturday , saudi-owned television channel al-arabiya al-hadath , part of the same media group as asharq al-awsat , reported that an assassination plot against hariri had been foiled in beirut days earlier , citing an unnamed source .
saudi gulf affairs minister thamer al-sabhan said in a television interview that hariri s personal security detail had confirmed information of a plot to kill him .
lebanon s internal security force said in a statement on the reports that it had no information about the matter .
