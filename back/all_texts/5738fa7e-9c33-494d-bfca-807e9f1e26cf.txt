Bill Bennett has been the voice of reason for conservatives so it was incredibly important when he finally spoke out against the #NeverTrump crowd.
Bennett is like the quiet uncle who doesn t say much but when he does everyone listens because we know it s gonna be meaningful and right on target This statement is no exception: There are a lot of people in the middle and there are still undecided people.
He does not need to speak to the #NeverTrumpers, some of my friends and maybe former friends who suffer from the terrible case of moral superiority and put their own vanity and taste before the interest of the country.
But he can speak to the middle and he can speak to the problems.
