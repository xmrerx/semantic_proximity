vladivostok ( reuters ) - russian president vladimir putin said on thursday after talks with japanese prime minister shinzo abe that the two leaders decisively condemned north korean weapons tests .
we decisively condemned north korea s launch of a medium-range ballistic missile that flew over japan s territory on august 28 , as well as the new nuclear tests conducted on september 3 , putin said in a statement .
putin reiterated that the crisis around north korea should be resolved only by political means , and that it posed a threat to peace and stability in the region .
he called for it to be resolved through a road map proposed by moscow and beijing .
putin also said he and abe discussed the prospect of joint economic activities by their countries on the disputed kurile islands .
the islands , called the northern territories in japan and the southern kuriles in russia , were seized by soviet forces at the end of world war two , when 17,000 japanese residents were forced to flee .
putin said he and abe discussed the prospect of a peace treaty officially ending world war two hostilities , which has never been signed because of the territorial dispute .
putin did not say how close the two countries were to such an agreement .
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov later said there could not be a timeframe for concluding a treaty .
this is a very complicated and sensitive issue , he said .
russia and japan are steadily building up mutual trust , mutually beneficial cooperation , which can not but promote the creation of a favorable atmosphere for finding a solution for the peace treaty .
