Says the women whose whole life has been a series of lies.Hillary Clinton on Sunday effectively dismissed her two remaining White House rivals, suggesting that she s better vetted and tested than Democratic primary opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders and that presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump is only pretend successful.
I have been vetted and tested, the Democratic front-runner and former secretary of state said on NBC s Meet the Press.
Clinton also suggested that the Vermont senator has not had a negative ad against him during the primary and said, I am going to be the nominee.
I m in a much stronger position, and voters who have given me 3 million more votes think that as well.
Clinton repeated what she has said in recent days, We re stronger together, a likely reference to the acrimony between the Clinton and Sanders campaigns and supporters, as Sanders keeps alive his longshot White House bid.Recalling how she stayed late into her failed 2008 primary race against now-President Obama, Clinton said that Sanders, campaigning hard this weekend in California ahead of the state s June 7 primary, has every right to finish off his campaign however he chooses.
She also appeared to dismiss Trump s business success, the centerpiece of which is his real estate holdings, in an apparent attempt to get him to release his tax returns.
She compared him to business people who are really successful, instead of pretend successful.
