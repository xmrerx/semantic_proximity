The cases of fraud, money laundering and theft of American tax dollars by Muslim immigrants is outrageous!
The list just keeps on growing Why?
Because the punishment is just a slap on the hand and these people are NEVER deported!The case below is just the latest in a string of Muslim immigrants who take advantage of our system:A man accused of running a welfare scam out of a Portland halal grocery is pleading guilty.
The market sells meat permissible under Muslim law.
According to federal court documents, Ali Ratib Daham is pleading guilty to federal food stamp and other welfare fraud.
He is also admitting to money laundering and theft from the state s MaineCare program.
Daham is agreeing to a jail sentence of at least 33 months and will pay more than $1 million in restitution to the government.
In exchange, prosecutors are agreeing to drop dozens of other charges in the case.The plea deal will be considered in federal district court Tuesday.
The guilty plea could cause him to be deported.They never deport these people, and tell me how is he going to repay $1 million when I ll bet the money was moved abroad a long time ago.
Yes, these crooks send the money back home!
America is a global magnet for all of the goodies we give immigrants.
Did you know the feds give money to these people to start a small business?
They then screw the system and make off with millions Taxpayers should be outraged!
Via: FOX23 MaineA PREVIOUS REPORT ON THEFT BY IMMIGRANT STORE OWNERS: RING OF MUSLIM STORE OWNERS STOLE $16 MILLION!A ring of Muslim store owners played the system and made over $16 million off of the American taxpayers BUT Muhammad Sarmad was sentenced to just 18 months in prison and 3 years of supervised release.
Does anyone else see how this is a joke of a sentence for a HUGE crime?
How is this a deterrent when the guy gets out in 18 months?
Baltimore, Maryland U.S. District Judge Richard D. Bennett sentenced Muhammad Sarmad, age 41, of Nottingham, Maryland, to 18 months in prison, followed by three years of supervised release, for conspiracy to commit food stamp fraud and wire fraud in connection with a scheme to illegally redeem food stamp benefits in exchange for cash.
At the sentencing on March 27, 2017, Judge Bennett also ordered that Sarmad pay restitution of $3,550,662.Sarmad, co-defendant Mohammad Irfan, and other family members owned and/or operated New Sherwood Market, 6324 Sherwood Road in Northwood, Maryland; Martin Mart, 1504 Martin Boulevard in Middle River, Maryland; Rosedale Mart, 6326 Kenwood Avenue in Rosedale, Maryland; and M&A Mart 7400-A Belair Road in Baltimore.
All of the stores were authorized to accept SNAP, except the M&A Mart.
According to their plea agreements, from October 2010 through at least July 2016, Sarmad, Irfan, and their co-conspirators exchanged EBT benefits for cash, in violation of the food stamp program rules.
Sarmad, Irfan, and their co-conspirators typically paid half the value of the EBT benefits in cash.
To avoid detection, they often debited the funds from the card in multiple transactions over a period of hours or days, or called a different store where the transaction was processed manually.
Since the M&A Mart was not authorized to accept SNAP, Sarmad or a co-conspirator would call one of the other stores to run the transaction at the other store and then hand out the cash at M&A Mart.Sarmad, Irfan and their co-conspirators received instruction regarding the requirements and regulations of the food stamp program, including that only eligible food items could be exchanged for EBT benefits, and that a retailer may never exchange EBT benefits for cash or non-food items.
Sarmad admitted that from October 2010 through August 2016, Sarmad and his co-conspirators obtained more than $3.5 million in payments for food sales that never occurred or were substantially inflated.In addition to Sarmad and Irfan, nine other retail store operators have pleaded guilty to their roles in similar schemes to illegally redeem food stamp benefits in exchange for cash, and are awaiting sentencing.
