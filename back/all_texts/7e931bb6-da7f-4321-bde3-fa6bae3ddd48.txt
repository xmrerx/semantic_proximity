They didn t pay the electric bill.
Oh, I like that much better.
Oh, those lights were brutal.
Did they come from the dishonest press?
Oh, don t turn them on.
Better huh?
Don t turn them on.
Plus we save on electricity.
Right?
And because the lights didn t work I won t pay the rent.
So we get better lighting and we don t pay the rent, right?The crowd goes wild Via: Gateway Pundit
