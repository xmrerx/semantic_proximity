A video uploaded to the Facebook page operated by the North American sportsman Association, Backcountry Hunters and Anglers (BHA), shows members tearing down a tarp that previously covered the sign marking the entrance to the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon.As the video plays, the words Removing extremists attempts to grab our public lands appear clearly across the bottom of the screen.
It s a bold-faced grab, BHA member Mark Heckert says angrily.
This is an illegal occupation by force.
I don t care what face they put on it, that s exactly what it is.
A declaration on the organization s Facebook page reads: BHA refuses to allow those who want to steal your public lands get away with this.
According to the organization s website, BHA s membership rolls include hunters, fisherman, hikers, backpackers and other outdoor enthusiasts from all across the U.S. and Canada.Earlier this month, Addicting Info reported on an open letter from the badass birders who also declared war on the Bundy terrorists.BHA members share the sentiments of the birding community, with one major difference.
Many of these men and women also have guns.As the group s About page on Facebook notes: Some of us hunt with center-fire rifles and shotguns, others with muzzle-loaders or archery gear Unlike the Oregon terrorists, BHA members have not threatened to use their weapons to take back THEIR land from the YallQaeda terrorists.
But they have made it abundantly clear that will not allow THEIR land to be stolen by these right wing extremists.During a press conference held by Ammon Bundy shortly after the group of armed anti-government nuts seized control of the Wildlife Refuge, Bundy said his goals are to open the land up to ATV riders and pick-up truck drivers, all in the name of right wingers freedom to destroy whatever the goddamn well feel like destroying.In stark contrast to Bundy s repulsive mission, BHA members are conservationists, who have pledged to protect public land and care for it, so that it can be enjoyed by generations to come.
Among the group s stated goals is to protect wild spaces like Mulheur from excessive off-road vehicle use, which damages the land and threatens wildlife species.Members of the group take the following pledge:As a North American hunter and angler,As you can see from the video below, these guys don t take that pledge lightly.// < !

It s time to restore law and order, U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service.
