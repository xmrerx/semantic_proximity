We think the Stop Hillary PAC needs to double down on their ad campaign to make sure every American sees this brilliant ad: Dear Hillary Clinton, I d like to ask you why you ignored calls for help in Benghazi and then four Americans were murdered, the ad starts.
I d like to know why you lied, saying the attack was a response to an Internet video.
I d like to hear why you tried to silence the Benghazi whistleblower.
But Mrs. Clinton, I can t. What difference does it make?
