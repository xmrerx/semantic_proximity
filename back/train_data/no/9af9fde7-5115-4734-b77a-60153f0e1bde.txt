london ( reuters ) - britain said on tuesday it had summoned the chinese ambassador in recent days to express its concern that a british rights activist was denied entry to hong kong last week .
we are very concerned that ben rogers , a uk national , was denied entry into hong kong on 11 october in absolute disregard of the one country , two systems principle , foreign office minister mark field said in parliament .
he added : foreign office director-general for economic and global issues summoned the chinese ambassador on this issue over the past few days .
rogers , a co-founder of the ruling conservative party s human rights commission , has been a vocal critic of chinese-ruled hong kong s treatment of human rights activists , including that of jailed student protest leader joshua wong .
hong kong , which returned to chinese rule in 1997 , is governed under a one country , two systems principle that promises it a higher degree of autonomy and freedom than on the mainland .
last week , foreign secretary boris johnson said london needed an explanation from hong kong and beijing on the matter .
