Ivanka Trump is a lot of things to her father someone he wants to have sex with (his words, not ours), a doting daughter he wants to bang, and she serves as one of his advisors.During an interview with Fox News, she said that in her capacity as an advisor to the President, I try to stay out of politics.
I don t profess to be a political savant, said Trump s daughter.
I instead like to focus on areas where I can add positive value, where I can contribute to the agenda.
Policies around workforce development, around ensuring that barriers are removed from around the working family.
Policies that enable that family to survive, she said.
Focusing on how we can help our veterans and how we can really deliver them the care that they so need.
Focusing on issues related to the really devastating opioid problem we have in this country.
I m more interested in being for something than against something, she says which is convenient because she certainly hasn t been against much that Trump has done.This includes his numerous attempts to ban Muslims from entering the United States, his decisions to undo workforce protections for the LGBTQ community and others nor has she stood against any of the bazillion other horrible things he has done.She also doesn t stand for much, being a person whose clothing line is made by Chinese workers slaving away in abysmal conditions for $62 a week.
Investigators looking into the horrific abuses have been arrested or outright disappeared.
Ivanka has yet been silent about their plight.How can Ivanka both stay out of politics and promote her father s agenda?
She can t. It s that simple.Watch the interview below:Featured image via screengrab
