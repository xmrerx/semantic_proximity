NEW LONDON, Conn. (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would use his upcoming trip to Saudi Arabia to challenge the leaders of Muslim countries to “fight hatred and extremism” while pursuing a peaceful future for their faith.
Speaking to the graduating class of the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, Trump said he would seek new partners in the region because “we have to stop radical Islamic terrorism.”
