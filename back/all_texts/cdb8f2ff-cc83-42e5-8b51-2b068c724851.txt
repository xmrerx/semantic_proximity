The First Couple greeted an eager crowd celebrating Black History Month at the White House when the thing conservatives hate most about him became obvious once again.
He s black.
His wife, Michelle, is also black.
They have black children.
They are also wonderful parents and self-made role models as President and First Lady of the United States.The president knows it, so when the introductions included a Haaaaaaay Michelle, The President tossed a magnificent You know you re at Black History Month When joke that makes her go a bit shy.
She managed to pull it off with the grace and style of the First Lady of the United States.
It s important we remind the people who would use this episode to somehow call the president a race-baiter or that he is pandering to people celebrating black history:WATCH: POTUS: "We know it is black history month when we hear someone say 'heeey, Michelle!
Girl.
You Look so good!

It has been, for the eight time, dedicated by a black man holding the highest office in the land.
Doing so under such incredible obstructionism as to make anything he could have accomplished nothing short of miraculous, he saw our country out of a financial crisis many of us thought would be the next Great Depression.
He restored honor to the White House in the wake of a buffoon and his band of thieves and thugs.
Who better to comment on what Black History Month means than that guy?The video is from the ABC News Twitter feed, and you can tell that ABC is hard at work deleting the racism, just by the leftover comments from people calling others out on it.
The original posts about the tweet came from News One and Globalgrind, who have both disabled their comments for the story.Featured image from screen capture
