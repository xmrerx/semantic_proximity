When they go low, we go high, First Lady Michelle Obama told the crowd at the 2016 Democratic Convention a message her husband appears to have taken to heart.On Friday, a pro-Trump Deplorable showed up to the President s speech in North Carolina but Obama didn t call for the elderly man s death or beating, and he certainly did not insult the Trump fan.
Instead, he calmed the crowd down.
Hey!
Hey!
Listen up!
I told you to be focused and you re not focused now.
Listen to what I m saying, he said, even saying hold up about 18 times to get the crowd to stop booing Mr. Trump Fan.
Everybody sit down and be quiet for a second.
He not doing nothin , the President continued.
You don t need to worry about him.
Instead of insulting the man for wearing what appears to be a military uniform like Trump would, the President called for the crowd to respect the man s service to his country.Pointing out that the man was apparently a veteran and elderly ( we gotta respect our elders ), the President told the crowd not to lose focus worrying about the awkwardly out-of-place Trump worshipper.Can you imagine what would have happened if someone held up a Hillary sign at one of Trump s events?
Would we even be able to recognize the person after the crowd got done beating them following The Donald getting them riled up over a protester s presence and offering to pay their legal defense fees?
Would the Right even mourn him?That s the difference between us and them : Where they would dig deep and find a new low to which they can sink, we simply respect that the gentleman was however wrong he is practicing his First Amendment rights.Watch the video below:Featured image via screengrab/Getty Images (Sara D.
