salisbury city councilwoman april jackson posted a facebook status last thursday proclaiming that president trump is retarded .
ya lls president is retarded .. he s far pass the holly center , jackson wrote on her facebook page.for those that don t know , the referenced holly center is a state-operated , 24-hour residential training facility for individuals with developmental disabilities .
that s right .
jackson not only called the president of the united states retarded , she then made it worse by comparing trump to a facility where mentally disabled or challenged people try to make their lives better.here s the original deleted post : meanwhile , the woman who calls president trump retarded appears to struggle when it comes to putting a complete sentence together on many of her facebook posts : anyone else notice that jackson either liked , laughed or loved her own post ?
pathetic.not to be outdone , jackson commented on the controversy surrounding her comments , and as far as i can tell , she apologized for nothing .
watch below : local news station wboc-tv 16 tried to contact jackson to ask her about her post on facebook .
not surprisingly , jackson didn t respond.wboc-tv 16 , delmarvas news leader , fox 21 via-mrctv
