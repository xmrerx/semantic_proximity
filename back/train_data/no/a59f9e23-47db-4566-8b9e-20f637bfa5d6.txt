riyadh/dubai ( reuters ) - saudi arabian banks have begun freezing the accounts of suspects ensnared in an anti-corruption probe , banking and business sources told reuters on monday .
dozens of people including royals , ministers and businessmen have been detained in an investigation by a new anti-corruption body headed by crown prince mohammed bin salman .
the central bank ordered banks to freeze the accounts of people under investigation in the probe , the sources said , declining to be named because he was not authorized to talk to media .
two of the sources said the number of accounts affected could run into the hundreds , but none of the sources mentioned the names of those affected .
the freezing of accounts has already happened , said another source .
the freezing is a precautionary measure that will end as soon as the suspects are either charged or pronounced innocent .
a central bank spokesman was not immediately available to comment .
eleven princes , four ministers and tens of former ministers are among those arrested , including billionaire prince alwaleed bin talal , saudi arabia s best-known international investor , according to saudi officials .
the allegations against the men include money laundering , bribery , extorting officials and taking advantage of public office for personal gain , a saudi official said .
the new anti-corruption committee has the power to seize assets at home and abroad before the results of its investigations are known .
