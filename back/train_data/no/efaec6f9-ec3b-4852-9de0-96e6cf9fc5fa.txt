vienna ( reuters ) - at least 3,000 people formed a chain of light in vienna on wednesday to protest against the formation of a government that includes the far-right freedom party .
demonstrators holding flickering candles , torches and bicycle lamps encircled the capital s government district .
our republic s most powerful political offices should be exclusively reserved for trustworthy people who are not in the slightest connected to right-wing extremists , said alexander pollak , spokesman for sos mitmensch , one of several human rights groups which organized the demonstration .
it was the biggest protest in austria since coalition talks between the conservative people s party ( ovp ) and the freedom party ( fpo ) started two weeks ago .
organizers estimated the number of people taking part at 8,000 to 10,000 , the police at around 3,000 .
we are here because they ( the fpo ) feed hatred and want to divide people , said brigitte griesser , holding a candle .
but the protest was far smaller than unrest 17 years ago , when the fpo last formed a government with the ovp and more than 100,000 took to the streets .
( the shift to the right ) has become a european trend ... it s no longer just an austrian issue and that s why it is not that controversial any longer , said protester juergen pucher .
