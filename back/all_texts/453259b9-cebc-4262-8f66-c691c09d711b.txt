Protests have erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina after another African-American man was shot and killed by police on Tuesday afternoon.
The victim was reportedly disabled and was reading a book in his car when cops approached him.According to police reports, officers came across Keith Lamont Scott while they were at his apartment complex to serve a warrant to someone else.
Police claim that Scott had a gun and posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers, but family and witnesses dispute that claim.
A woman identifying herself as the victim s daughter, Lyric Scott, said that her father didn t have a gun, he had a book.
He sits in the shade, reads his book, does his studies, and waits on his kid to get off the bus, the woman said.
He didn t have no gun.
He wasn t messing with nobody.
All they did, them jumpout boys, them undercover detectives, they jumped out their truck, they said, Hands up he got a gun, he got a gun, pow pow pow pow.
That s it.
