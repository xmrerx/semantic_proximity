MADRID/BARCELONA (Reuters) - Spanish authorities have done enough to discredit and prevent a planned referendum this Sunday on independence in Catalonia, two senior government officials told Reuters on Monday, though they may now let a secession party happen.
There may be a party on Sunday at which, on squares and in streets, some voting stalls may be installed and a mock vote may take place.
But it will not be a referendum, one of the officials said on condition of anonymity.
The officials said Catalonia lacked a proper election commission, ballots boxes, ballot papers, a transparent census and election material, and other material needed to hold the vote.
They also said the result of the vote or a potential unilateral declaration of independence afterwards would not be granted any international recognition or legitimacy.
Not even Venezuela or North Korea will recognize it.
And if they do, I am not sure it would help the independence campaign a lot, the official said.
