Sarah Silverman and Bill Maher destroyed the so-called Fox Republican debates in what Maher described as completely fact free.
They both wondered why Hillary and Bernie couldn t debate the Republican candidates right now.
This, they agreed, would at least inject some facts in the debates since the Fox moderators refused to do so.
Megyn Kelly, if you re such a serious person, said Maher, ask one question about the environment.

She s right!
It s something out of the Twilight Zone, where candidates are trying to outdo each other to see who s more likely to destroy the middle class.It s also quite crazy that the candidates weren t asked why the Republicans want to cut funding for the very water agency that could have stopped the water problem before the poisoning of the children of Flint, Michigan.
The water poisoning of course was done under the watch of a Republican governor.
It s alarming that Fox moderators didn t address this issue, especially since the debates were in Detroit.It seems as though the Fox moderators showed little interest in fact checking and the idea that Fox moderators are hard on Trump or any other Republican candidates is ludicrous.Featured image via screenshot
