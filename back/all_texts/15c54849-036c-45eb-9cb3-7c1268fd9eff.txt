TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Kono said on Wednesday that any attempt to revise Tokyo s 2015 agreement with South Korea over comfort women forced to work in Japan s wartime military brothels would be unacceptable and make relations unmanageable.
Kono s comment comes after his South Korean counterpart, Kang Kyung-wha, said the agreement failed to meet the needs of victims and apologized for the controversial deal.
The Japan-South Korea agreement is an agreement between the two governments and one that has been highly appreciated by international society, Kono said in a written statement.
If the South Korean government ... tried to revise the agreement that is already being implemented, that would make Japan s ties with South Korea unmanageable and it would be unacceptable.
