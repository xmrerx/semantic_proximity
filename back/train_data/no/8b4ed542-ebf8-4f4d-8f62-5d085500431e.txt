jerusalem ( reuters ) - israeli forces on sunday destroyed a significant cross-border attack tunnel from the gaza strip , which the military said was being dug by the enclave s dominant islamist group , hamas .
the announcement , cleared by israeli censors who had previously barred reports of detection work around the central gaza frontier , followed a surge of palestinian unrest in response to last week s u.s. recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital .
it also came as palestinian factions tried to meet sunday s deadline for an egyptian-mediated handover of gaza by hamas to western-backed president mahmoud abbas after a decade s schism .
a network of gaza tunnels allowed hamas gunmen to blindside israel s superior forces during the 2014 war and the israelis , with u.s. help , have since stepped up work on counter-measures .
the tunnel destroyed on sunday ran hundreds of meters into israeli territory and , though unfinished , was a new project that showed a significant effort by hamas , military spokesman lieutenant-colonel jonathan conricus told reporters .
he did not elaborate on how israel knew hamas was responsible for the tunnel , which he said reached to within 1km ( 0.6 miles ) of the nearest israeli civilian community .
hamas did not respond immediately to a request for comment .
the previous such announcement was on oct. 30 , when israel blew up a tunnel dug by islamic jihad .
in the process of that demolition , 10 gunmen from the group and another two from hamas were killed - deaths that israeli sources described as an unintended result of the passage s collapse within gazan turf .
conricus said that to the best of our knowledge there were no such casualties on sunday , though he added that the tunnels could be death traps for gaza gunmen .
the idf ( israel defence forces ) will continue to discover , expose and demolish these terror tunnels , he said .
