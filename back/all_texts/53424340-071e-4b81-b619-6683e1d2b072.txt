Gateway PunditPalestinian activist Rasmea Odeh will avoid jail but lose US citizenship https://t.co/jXv3QNBwrl pic.twitter.com/H0sC9phJqd Middle East Eye (@MiddleEastEye) March 24, 2017Rasmea Odeh, 69, will avoid jail time as part of the deal, the Rasmea Defense Committee announced on Thursday.
She will plead guilty to Unlawful Procurement of Naturalization, lose her U.S. citizenship, and be forced to leave the country, but will exit the U.S. without having to serve any more time in prison or ICE detention, a victory, considering that the government had earlier fought for a sentence of 5-7 years.
An activist with the Arab American Action Network, Odeh was alleged to be a member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), a designated terror group.
She was convicted in Israel in 1970 of taking part in two bombings the year before, one at a supermarket in Jerusalem and another at the British consulate.
Two Israeli students were killed in the supermarket bombing.
Nine were injured in the two blasts.
