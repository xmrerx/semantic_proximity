Former Vermont Governor Howard Dean has already served as the Chair of the Democratic National Committee from 2005-2009.
As the Democratic Party recovers from shocking losses and a lack of leadership, he chose to run for that same position again.
However, as of Friday, Dean has chosen to get out of the race for DNC Chair, saying that it is a time for the party to be led by new faces.This is a huge win for the progressive wing of the party, who has appointed new, farther left leaders like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to Senate leadership positions while retaining Nancy Pelosi as the Democratic leader in the House of Representatives.
Gov.
Dean was right to do this, as he has had his run, and it is time for new blood.
However, he seems to have his reservations about selecting a sitting member of Congress, such as Rep. Keith Ellison (D- Minn.) for the top job.
There are three people left in the pile of candidates, including NARAL Pro-Choice President Ilyse Hogue.Should she leave her current job, Hogue would be a great pick, seeing as women s rights are under attack, and she s the perfect person to preserve them.
Speaking in regards to the demands of the job and the need for someone to be able to do it full time, Gov.
Dean stated: I know this job better than anyone in this room.
It requires 80 hours of work a week and constant travel across the country to fundraise.
This is a full-time job.
Whether or not that is true, I have no idea.
However, I am glad that Gov.
Dean put his party s welfare before his own political ambitions.
The Democratic Party is becoming more and more progressive by the day, and it s time for those young, progressive voices to take the reigns.
We must not give in to moderate challengers like Rep. Tim Ryan (D-OHIO), and we must not give into continuing the same old failed leadership.
Godspeed to whoever wins, and may we take back Congress with your leadership in 2018.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
