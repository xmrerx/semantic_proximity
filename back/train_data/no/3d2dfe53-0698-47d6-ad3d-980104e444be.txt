of course , america s favorite criminal candidate says america shouldn t believe the infamous hacker who claims he accessed her unsecured server because he s a criminal .
lol if anyone can spot a criminal , it s crooked hillary the infamous romanian hacker known as guccifer , speaking exclusively with fox news , claimed he easily and repeatedly breached former secretary of state hillary clinton s personal email server in early 2013 .
for me , it was easy easy for me , for everybody , marcel lehel lazar , who goes by the moniker guccifer , told fox news from a virginia jail where he is being held.guccifer s potential role in the clinton email investigation was first reported by fox news last month .
the hacker subsequently claimed he was able to access the server and provided extensive details about how he did it and what he found over the course of a half-hour jailhouse interview and a series of recorded phone calls with fox news.fox news could not independently confirm lazar s claims.in response to lazar s claims , the clinton campaign issued a statement wednesday night saying , there is absolutely no basis to believe the claims made by this criminal from his prison cell .
in addition to the fact he offers no proof to support his claims , his descriptions of secretary clinton s server are inaccurate .
it is unfathomable that he would have gained access to her emails and not leaked them the way he did to his other victims .
the former secretary of state s server held nearly 2,200 emails containing information now deemed classified , and another 22 at the top secret level .
