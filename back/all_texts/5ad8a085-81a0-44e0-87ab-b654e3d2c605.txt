Suggesting a person should be killed because the Left disagrees with his desire to make America great again is beyond the pale But lets discuss micro aggressions and demands for safe spaces A tombstone for Donald Trump mysteriously appeared in Central Park this weekend, just one week after over a thousand avowed communists, socialists, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT)16% fans, and pro-illegal immigration activists took part in an anti-Trump protest in Central Partk.The Gothamist posted a tweet showing the tombstone, which reads Made America Hate Again.

Eric Karjaluoto (@karj) March 27, 2016Meanwhile, an Assassinate Donald Trump page has been reposted on Facebook.
The page s creator said that they don t personally plan to kill Mr. Trump, but they believe it should be done :Assassinate Donald TrumpMarch 25 at 3:10pm I find it important to say for my own protection that I have no intention or interest in assassinating a presidential cacandidate.
Rather, I think it s something that should be done and I think the page needs to exists again, since the Republicans whined it down.
