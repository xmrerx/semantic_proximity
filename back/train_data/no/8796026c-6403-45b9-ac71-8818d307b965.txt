cj is tired of watching barack obama divide our nation says it s time to hire a uniter .
black teen conservative political activist and internet sensation cj pearson , 13 , touted his endorsement of sen. ted cruz ( r-tx ) for president during an exclusive interview on breitbart news sunday .
in 2016 it is time for us to mend the divisive traits that this president has inflicted upon our country .
and i believe ted [ cruz ] can be that uniter , pearson told breitbart s matthew boyle .
he said he sees cruz as a fighter for conservative values ; a fighter who will not give up , who will not give in to the d.c. establishment left or right and will fight for what he believes in .
pearson shot to national acclaim when he created a video on youtube in february criticizing president barack obama .
the video , titled president obama : do you really love america ?
quickly garnered over a million hits and he has since appeared on several mainstream media outlets to discuss his views .
i think his entire term has been a downright failure , has been an embarrassment to this country , pearson said of obama s presidency .
he criticized the commander in chief for making a big government even bigger and for the implementation of the affordable care act , among other controversial policies .
obama , in pearson s estimation , is a leader who is more likely to apologize for america than to sit and fight for america .
pearson , who lives in georgia , serves as the national coordinator for students for cruz , which is the official youth arm for the cruz for president campaign .
