This is hysterical and sad at the same time.
Watters World discusses the Democrat debate with Democrats who discuss Hillary s pantsuits deep stuff Here are a few of the comments: I didn t watch it actually I saw that Lincoln Chafee was in the debate and that just turned me off immediately.
I just found it very boring.
I had a hard time staying awake.
I actually missed Donald Trump.
I can t believe it.
