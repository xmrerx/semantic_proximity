WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump defended his decision to rescind a program for immigrant children brought into the United States illegally as necessary to safeguard the rule of law in the country.
“I do not favor punishing children, most of whom are now adults, for the actions of their parents.
But we must also recognize that we are nation of opportunity because we are a nation of laws,” Trump said in a statement.
Trump said former President Barack Obama bypassed Congress to set up the DACA program in 2012.
“There can be no path to principled immigration reform if the executive branch is able to rewrite or nullify federal laws at will.”
