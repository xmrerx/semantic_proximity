On Friday, Donald Trump was so angry about the more than half the country that feels it is probably not a good idea for his administration to be in bed with Russia that he was completely unable to type coherently when unleashing his unpresidential ravings on Twitter.
Specifically, he found himself unable to spell the word hereby.
Trump informed the American public that he the President* wants to hear by launch investigations into his political enemies because they have been in photographs taken during public, scheduled meetings with some of the same Russian folks with whom members of his administration have been busted having secret, off-the-books meetings.
After half the world pointed out he had spelled it incorrectly, he gave it another go, changing it to hearby still wrong, but closer.Then he unironically tweeted about education We must fix our education system for our kids to Make America Great Again.
Wonderful day at Saint Andrew in Orlando.

OK, OK.
Here.
Bye, the dictionary tweeted shortly after Trump s numerous flubs:OK, OK.Here.Bye.
