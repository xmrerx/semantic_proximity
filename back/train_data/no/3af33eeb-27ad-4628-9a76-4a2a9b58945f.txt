seventeen aid workers fled the violence , according to a humanitarian source .
there were no immediate details of casualties .
the government and rebel groups signed a ceasefire on thursday in the latest attempt to end a four-year civil war and let humanitarian groups reach civilians .
the ceasefire formally came into force on sunday morning , but fighting broke out soon afterwards , according to a humanitarian security report seen by reuters .
our forces came under heavy fire this morning in koch county , dickson gatluak , a spokesman for the government side , said .
our forces acted in self defense and repulsed the attacking forces and defeated them , he added in a statement .
rebel spokesman lam paul gabriel said the army attacked first and rebel forces were now pursuing government soldiers towards the town .
the world s youngest country plunged into war in late 2013 after president salva kiir sacked his deputy , riek machar .
the dispute erupted into fighting that spread across the country , largely along ethnic lines between forces loyal to kiir , who is dinka , and machar , who is nuer .
the violence , which the united nations says has amounted to ethnic cleansing , has forced a third of the population to flee .
earlier this year , pockets of the country plunged briefly into famine .
