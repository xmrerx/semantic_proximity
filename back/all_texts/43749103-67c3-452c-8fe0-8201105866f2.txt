Early this morning, Donald Trump was up to his usual nonsense on Twitter, spreading misinformation and stroking his ego.
Today, he took a break from trying to convince America that the size of his inauguration crowd was respectable and once again complained about not winning the popular vote.In doing so, Trump brought up his tired, pathetic voter fraud conspiracy because he s incapable of dealing with the fact that most of America hates him.
In a tweet, Trump brought up his completely unnecessary, expensive and wasteful investigation into a matter that has been debunked several times:For the record, Gregg Phillips is a random dude on Twitter that runs a voter fraud conspiracy app called Voter Stand, and the information that Trump is referring to was officially debunked in November.
Phillips even admitted that there was no proof of voter fraud in an interview with Politifact.Trump s voter fraud conspiracy has been condemned by both Democrats and Republicans alike, and earlier today Republican Illinois Congressman Adam Kinzinger took Trump to task on CNN s New Day.
In a blistering rant, Kinzinger stated that by spreading this false information and investigating voter fraud , Trump was undermining America s electoral system and Constitution.
Kinzinger, who was one of the few Republicans that would not endorse Trump, said: This basically undermines the idea of an election, this undermines the Constitution.
Just as I was upset about the Russian hacking because it s an attack on the election system of our constitution, I don t like this.
Kinzinger also slammed Trump for failing to bring forth any real proof that massive voter fraud took place.
He said, You have to show why you re undermining the constitution just show us the proof before you make the accusation.
