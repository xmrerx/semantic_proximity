You might want to sit down for this one The policy of NYC is so upside down and crazy that you might now believe it!
The policy is to just let criminal illegal aliens roam the streets instead of deporting them or locking them up.
I kid you not!
The theory from the brainiacs at city hall is that this promotes public safety .PROMOTES PUBLIC SAFETY??
?WELL, ICE ISN T PUTTING UP WITH THIS ANY MORE!
THEY ARRESTED THE CRIMINALS ANYWAY!Earlier this week, U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement announced in a press release that they arrested five illegal aliens from four different countries, including an Indian national wanted for assault and sexual abuse, after New York City refused to cooperate federal immigration law.New York City is a sanctuary city, meaning that they do not demand their police department cooperate with federal immigration laws nor requests from immigration officials, particularly on orders such as detainers.
Detainers serve as a legally-authorized request, upon which a law enforcement agency may rely, to continue to maintain custody of an alien for up to 48 hours so that ICE may assume custody for removal purposes, according to the October 18 press release.
But some cities simply catch and release these criminals in hopes of promoting cooperation between the city and the illegal alien community.In fact, Mayor Bill De Blasio orders that the New York City Police Department routinely ignore these requests.
De Blasio officials have said that their sanctuary city policies promote public safety.All of these men are illegal aliens and all have been arrested for various degrees of drug possession or violence in the past.
But, NYPD has never reported them to authorities.
In their desire to appear politically correct, De Blasio s administration is allowing criminals to roam the streets.HOW IS THIS PROMOTING PUBLIC SAFETY?READ MORE: TH
