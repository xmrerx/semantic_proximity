This highly visible campaign has nothing to do with being anti-gay this is about the safety of women and children and about Target looking the other way According to a CBS Minnesota report, an anti-Target campaign is working to send Target a strong message after the corporation doubled down on its policy to continue allowing patrons to use the bathroom of their self-identified gender.Opponents of Target s bathroom policy unveiled a truck with a young girl standing at a bathroom stall in front of a man staring at her with the message What about her rights to privacy & protection?
Send Target a message don t shop where women and children s emotional and physical safety and privacy are under assault, Minnesota chair of the Child League Julie Quist said.The truck is set to visit every Target store in Minnesota with the hope of reversing the policy.Claire Chretien, an organizer of the campaign, said, I don t feel safe knowing that at Target a six-foot, five-inch, 250-pound man can follow me into a bathroom and store won t do anything about it.
Target CEO Brian Cornell likened the policy to when Target included African-American models in advertising in the 1960s, noting its long history of embracing diversity and inclusion.
