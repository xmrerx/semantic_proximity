Donald Trump s antics at a campaign rally on Wednesday night were completely and totally unhinged, even adjusting for the strange standards of Donald Trump.
Despite media claims that Trump was making a pivot towards more seriousness and substance, and the belief that new communications hires would keep Trump more on message, he was a wild man once again.Seemingly out of nowhere, Trump began a riff on how much he hates mosquitoes.Trump doesn't like mosquitoes (in Cincinnati, OH at the Sharonville Convention Center) pic.twitter.com/ZQY0pywHKi Marcus DiPaola (@marcusdipaola) July 7, 2016Using a weird voice, Trump said, I don t want mosquitoes around me.
He then slapped at a mosquito on his podium and screamed, I DON T LIKE MOSQUITOES.
I don t like those mosquitoes, I never did.
Speaking of mosquitoes, oh hello Hillary how are you doing, he concluded, before moving on to another topic.Republicans have noted that instead of squeezing some mileage out of the critical FBI press conference on Hillary Clinton s emails, Trump has stumbled from one controversy to the next.
First his campaign tweeted anti-semitic imagery about Clinton that they deleted, then he praised Saddam Hussein at a campaign rally, and has now appointed himself the bug-hunter-in-chief.Trump s problem appears to be that he is relying on the headline-grabbing antics of his campaign that worked so well for him against the Republican field.
But in the general election, against a candidate in Hillary Clinton who doesn t have to pander to racists, the bombastic Trump style is appearing more and more like a dud.And Trump s antics easily ally him with an existing frame for his campaign that has been exploited by Democrats.
Both Clinton and President Obama have invoked the need for a steady hand over the launch codes for America s nuclear launch codes, and contrasted that need to Trump s public rhetoric.The candidate clearly believes he can wing it on the way to the White House, but general election audiences are not nearly as enraptured with Trump s antics as Republicans were.Featured image via Twitter
