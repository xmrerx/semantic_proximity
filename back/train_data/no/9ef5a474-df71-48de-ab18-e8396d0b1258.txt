buenos aires ( reuters ) - u.s. president barack obama said on wednesday he did not expect a breakthrough on middle east peace before he leaves office and reiterated his support for a two-state solution in which israelis and palestinians could live peacefully side by side .
speaking to students and teachers in argentina , obama said he expected to continue working on middle east peace after he leaves office next january .
the president ’ s comments came amid reports that his administration was considering a renewed push on the issue .
obama conceded that despite his and others ’ efforts , the decades-long dispute had not come closer to being resolved during his presidency .
“ this is not something i was able to get done , ” he said .
“ i am not that hopeful that it ’ s going to happen in the next nine months .
it ’ s been 60 years ; it ’ s not going to happen in the next nine months. ” having twice failed to achieve israeli-palestinian peace , the obama administration is discussing ways to help preserve the prospect of an increasingly threatened two-state solution , u.s. officials said earlier this month .
despite his skepticism about progress anytime soon , obama reinforced his commitment to that prospect .
“ there ’ s been talk about a one-state solution or sort of a divided government .
it ’ s hard for me to envision that being stable , there ’ s such deep distrust between the two peoples right now , ” he said .
“ and the neighborhood is in such a mess that i continue to believe that a two-state solution is the best way .
now , over time that could evolve . ”
