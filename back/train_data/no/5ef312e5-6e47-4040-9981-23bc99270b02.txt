aden ( reuters ) - a rebel former governor of aden who is leading a movement for southern yemen s secession has said an independence referendum would be announced soon and a parliamentary body set up to administer the territory .
aidaroos al-zubaidi , who was sacked as aden governor by president abd-rabbu mansour hadi , set out his secessionist plans to thousands of supporters gathered on saturday in yemen s main southern city to mark 54 years since the october 1963 uprising against the british .
zubaidi , who has previously declared a council that seeks secession for southern yemen , said in a television interview late on friday that an independence referendum would be held soon .
speaking to supporters on saturday , zubaidi said a new 303-member parliamentary body , the national association , would act like a small parliament to represent yemenis from all areas of the south .
zubaidi announced in may a new council formed by senior tribal , military and political figures .
the council seeks the secession of southern yemen and is looking to establish a political leadership under his presidency that would administer the south .
the move threatens more turmoil in the impoverished arabian peninsular country where the internationally-recognized government is forced to sit in aden because houthi rebels control the capital sanaa .
the council was born out of a power struggle between the southerners and president abd-rabbu mansour hadi that has undermined regional power saudi arabia s efforts to coordinate a military campaign against the tehran-supported houthis .
hadi s government has rejected the formation of the council , saying it would deepen divisions and play into the hands of the houthi rebels .
many southerners feel that officials in the north have exploited their resources and cut them off from jobs and influence .
