Folks, Barack Obama s tyranny has hit the fine, upstanding patriots currently occupying a federal building in Oregon hard.
Not only did the crazed, armed occupiers mommies forget to pack snacks for them, but they seem to have run out of clean underwear and tampons as well as other items needed for their pretend revolution (don t worry, they do have plenty of guns).Even though police have promised them the freedom to move in and out of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge a strange thing to grant terrorists these grown men playing cowboy seem entirely incapable of driving to the store to buy their own supplies.
The new wish list, posted to Twitter by extremism analyst J.J. McNab, includes much more than snacks.The militants now want supporters to provide them with tampons, underwear, t-shirts, money, blankets, socks, bed sheets, shampoo, deodorant (let s face it that many Teabillies in one place can get a bit smelly), gaming supplies, and cigarettes:The need for tampons is no laughing matter.
Recently, one of the militants announced that they plan to use women and children as shields against anything they view as an attack in that case, the presence of women and children was used to dissuade the evil government from shutting off the electricity.
This, of course, is a tactic that was used at Bundy Ranch as well, with one armed terrorist revealing that If they are going to start shooting, it s going to be women that are going to be televised all across the world getting shot.
I personally think that helping them would be a great idea.
Send as many tampons as you want (using that big, bad government mail system) to:Malheur National Wildlife Refuge, c/o Y All Qaeda36391 Sodhouse LnPrinceton, OR 9772Let s send them more tampons than they will ever use.
They can find their own damn coats.If you don t want to waste money on tampons, make a phone call and urge the FBI to finally take action against these dangerous domestic terrorists.Featured image via FreakOutNation
