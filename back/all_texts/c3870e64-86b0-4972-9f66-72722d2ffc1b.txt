As polls show Clinton beating Donald Trump in Kansas and catching up in Georgia, another solid red state is showing the presumptive Democratic nominee beating the Republican nominee.A recent poll conducted by OH Predictive Insight shows Hillary Clinton beating Donald Trump in Arizona by 5 points, 47-42 (with approximately 6 percent backing a third party candidate and less than approximately 6 percent unsure).The poll surveyed a whopping 1,060 likely Democratic, Republican, Independent and Non-Declared voters across the Grand Canyon state, and found that Trump s trailing comes from his serious deficit with women and urban voters.
The last time a Democrat carried Arizona was in 1996, when Bill Clinton was elected to his second term.The pollsters responded with shock at Arizona s competitiveness.
Mike Noble, managing partner of the polling company, said of the findings: It s very surprising to think that Hillary Clinton may carry Arizona, a state that holds the narratives of SB1070, two nationally known anti-illegal immigration sheriffs, liberal gun laws and consistently conservative constituents.
Wes Gullet, another partner in the company and a former Phoenix mayoral candidate, echoed Noble s shock at the results: It s shocking to think that a Democratic presidential candidate would carry Arizona if the election were held today, considering that every statewide office in Arizona is held by a Republican as well as significant majorities in the Arizona House and Senate.
Arizona should be a reliable red state.
The poll also showed 10 percent of Democrats backing Trump while 13 percent of Republicans are backing Clinton.
Clinton also led Trump among Independents 45-38, a seven point advantage.In 2012, Mitt Romney won Arizona by 9 percent.
The fact that Clinton nabs Independent voters and more Republicans than Trump does with Democrats could turn Arizona blue.The state that has given us SB 1070, Jan Brewer, Sheriff Joe Arpaio and a cranky John McCain may be turning blue after all.
Maybe putting a racist, sexist xenophobe as the Republican Party s nominee wasn t such a good idea.Featured image via Sara D. Davis/Getty Images
