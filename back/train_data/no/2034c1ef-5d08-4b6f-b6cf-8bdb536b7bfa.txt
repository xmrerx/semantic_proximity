beijing ( reuters ) - china s prosecutor began on monday formal legal proceedings against disgraced senior politician sun zhengcai , once considered a contender for top leadership , who has been accused of corruption and other crimes .
sun was abruptly removed from his post as party chief of the southwestern metropolis of chongqing - one of china s most important cities - in july and replaced by chen miner , who is close to president xi jinping .
later that month , he was put under investigation and in september , the party announced he would be prosecuted for corruption .
sun was accused of leaking secrets , bribery and abusing his power .
in a brief statement , the prosecutor said that it had begun proceedings against sun for suspected bribery and had approved the taking of coercive measures against him , a chinese legal term that generally refers to detention .
the case is proceeding , it added , without giving any other details .
sun was expelled from parliament last month , removing his immunity from prosecution that he had enjoyed as a member of that body .
chongqing is perhaps best known outside china for its association with bo xilai , another disgraced former party boss of the city .
he , too , was once a contender for top leadership .
he was jailed for life in 2013 after a dramatic corruption scandal .
it has not been possible to reach sun or a representative for comment since he was put under investigation .
it s unclear if he has been allowed to retain a lawyer .
the next likely step against sun will be to put him on trial , where he is certain to be found guilty as the legal system is controlled by the ruling communist party which will not challenge the party s accusations against him .
