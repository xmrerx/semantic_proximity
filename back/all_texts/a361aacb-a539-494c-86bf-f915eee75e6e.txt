WASHINGTON (Reuters) - There is “simply no place” in American public discourse for “hate and violence” displayed in Charlottesville, Virginia, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday.
Just before meeting with Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, Tillerson commented on the shared values between the United States and Canada, then said, unprompted: “I think that’s why it’s appropriate to comment on the recent events in Virginia and our condemnation of that kind of hate and violence,” according to a pool report.
“There is just simply no place for that in our public discourse and I want to add our condemnation of that,” Tillerson said, a day after President Donald Trump insisted that both left- and right-wing extremists were violent during a weekend rally by white nationalists in Charlottesville.
