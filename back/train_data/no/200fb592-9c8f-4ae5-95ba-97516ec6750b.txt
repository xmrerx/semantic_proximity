singapore ( reuters ) - a singapore mass transit train bumped into another at a station on wednesday injuring 28 people , authorities said , the latest mishap on the transit system in a city-state that has long prided itself on its efficient public services .
transit operator smrt said 26 passengers and two staff suffered light to moderate injuries and had been taken to hospital .
it s an awful day , transport minister khaw boon wan said .
commuters were inconvenienced , and some even injured .
we are deeply sorry for that , khaw was quoted by the straits times newspaper as telling a news conference .
densely populated singapore is highly dependent on public transport .
it is one of the world s most expensive places to own a vehicle and it recently announced that it would not allow any net growth in its car numbers from february next year .
the accident happened at 8.20 a.m. ( 0020 gmt ) , smrt said in a statement .
a faulty west-bound train had stalled at joo koon station on the system s east-west line two minutes earlier , it said .
a second train stopped behind the faulty train but moved forward unexpectedly a minute later , coming into contact with the stationary train .
a software glitch in the signaling system was the cause of wednesday s accident , the transit authorities later said .
a photograph posted on the straits times website showed two trains stopped and in contact but with no major damage apparent .
earlier , the singapore civil defence force said in a twitter post that it had been alerted to an incident at the station at 8:33 a.m .
the collision comes after a string of disruptions to mass rapid transit services .
last month , services were partially suspended on a weekend because of flooding in a tunnel after heavy rain .
the mishaps have led to a rare public apology by top transit executives and an assurance from the government to address the causes .
