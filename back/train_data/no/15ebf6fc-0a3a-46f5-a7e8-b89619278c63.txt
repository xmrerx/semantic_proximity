esteemed democratic attorney alan dershowitz unloaded on left-wing sensation maxine waters on fox and friends sunday .
dershowitz responded to waters calling him a racist on msnbc : alan dershowitz : well , she doesn t know what she s talking about .
first of all , i wasn t talking about the grand jury i was talking about the petit jury .
grand jury doesn t matter .
grand jury will indict a ham sandwich .
but if there were to be an indictment it would matter greatly where the trial was .
maxine waters should know better and does know better if i d have said race didn t matter she would have called me a racist .
she throws around the term so loosely and so inappropriately and it weakens her credibility by calling everybody a racist .
when she calls real racists racists , nobody is going to believe her race matters .
maxine waters ought to know that and maxine waters ought to be ashamed of herself .
