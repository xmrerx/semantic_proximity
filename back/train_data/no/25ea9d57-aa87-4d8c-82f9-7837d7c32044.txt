21st century wire says what a twisted world we have become.a female , black student activist , kayla mckelvey ( image below ) , has been jailed for tweeting racially charged threats directed at events that she , herself , was organising and attending .
she essentially employed the false flag attack model , where one claims to be under attack from another , who in actual fact has nothing to do with it , to further an agenda.the so-called activist pleaded guilty to causing false public alarm , but claimed the tweets were meant to raise awareness of racism on campus .one wonders how much racism there really is on campus , if someone has to deliberately go out of their way to create fake racial threats .
this then raises the questions , what exactly did mckelvey hope to achieve by creating a threat to black people on campus ? the threats caused kean university to shell out $ 80,000 in additional security costs , costs that mckelvey will now be forced to repay after her 90 days behind bars.such actions do absolutely nothing to raise awareness of racism , and only further racial divides .
if we stop seeing race altogether , and instead see humanity , we can really solve the problem.get 10 % off a 21wire tv membership package today using promo code : stu21wiretvmore on eroding western culture : 21st century wire culture files
