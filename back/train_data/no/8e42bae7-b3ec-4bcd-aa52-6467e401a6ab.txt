washington ( reuters ) - the united states on monday urged iraq s federal government and kurdish regional government institutions to resolve their disagreements after iraqi kurdish leader masoud barzani said he would resign later this week .
we call on all kurdish parties to support the krg as it works to resolve pending issues over the remainder of its term and prepare for elections in 2018 , u.s. state department spokeswoman heather nauert said in a statement commending barzani s decision .
it urged iraq and the krg to work urgently to resolve pending issues under the iraqi constitution .
the statement appeared to reflect a u.s. belief that the departure of barzani , whose sept. 25 independence referendum is widely seen has having backfired , may make it easier for the two main kurdish factions to work together and to negotiate with the federal government led by prime minister haider al-abadi .
in the statement , nauert stressed a u.s. desire to work with krg prime minister nechirvan barzani , masoud barzani s nephew and a fellow member of the kurdistan democratic party ( kdp ) faction , and with deputy prime minister qubad talabani , a member of the other faction , the patriotic union of kurdistan ( puk ) .
a strong krg within a unified and federal iraq is essential to its long-term stability and to the enduring defeat of isis , she said , referring to the islamic state militant group , whose destruction is a major u.s. policy objective in the region .
disputes between the krg and the baghdad federal government range from the perennial tussle over how to share oil revenues to the control of territory and border crossings .
suggesting that barzani s departure may yield greater kurdish unity and improve the odds of a resolution with baghdad , a u.s. official said : we can t allow this tension to continue .
they have to be able to find a way to live together .
now is the time to get them to sit down and try to work things out .
