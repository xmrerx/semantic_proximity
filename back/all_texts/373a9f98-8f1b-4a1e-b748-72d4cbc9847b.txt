America should ve known Hillary would be allowed to skate.
When Chicago thug politics mesh with the Clinton Crime Syndicate, American citizens don t have a chance.
The Democrat party is starting to make the mafia look like girl scouts .In a scathing video ad titled Tale of Two Press Conferences, the GOP plays side-by-side excerpts from Comey s statement and a March 10, 2015 press conference when Clinton was first cornered with accusations about her private email server.The result is a smackdown that casts Clinton as a bald-faced liar.
I did not email any classified material to anyone on my email, Clinton says in the footage on one side of a split-screen.
110 emails in 52 email chains have been determined by the owning agency to contain classified information, Comey says at screen-right.After Clinton says that she thought it would be easier to carry just one device for my work and for my personal emails instead of two, Comey is seen rebutting her on Tuesday declaring that she used numerous mobile devices to view and send e-mail on [her] personal domain.
RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said in a statement that Clinton has spent the last 16 months looking into cameras deliberately lying to the American people.
This video perfectly highlights Hillary Clinton s serial lies over her secret email server, which jeopardized national security, left over 2,000 classified emails unprotected, and covered up unethical conflicts of interests related to her family foundation while she was Secretary of State, he added.
