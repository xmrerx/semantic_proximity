tokyo ( reuters ) - a tunnel at north korea s nuclear test site collapsed after pyongyang s sixth atomic test in september , possibly killing more than 200 people , japanese broadcaster tv asahi said on tuesday , citing unnamed sources familiar with the situation .
reuters has not been able to verify the report .
about 100 workers at the punggye-ri nuclear site were affected by the initial collapse , which took place around sept. 10 , the broadcaster said .
a second collapse during a rescue operation meant it was possible the death toll could have exceeded 200 , it added .
experts have said a series of tremors and landslides near the nuclear test base probably mean the country s sixth and largest blast on sept. 3 has destabilized the region , and the punggye-ri nuclear site may not be used for much longer to test nuclear weapons .
