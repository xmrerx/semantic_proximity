berlin ( reuters ) - european aviation safety authorities have urged airlines to remind passengers about how best to transport electronic devices containing lithium ion batteries over the busy christmas travel period .
lithium ion batteries , found in devices such as laptops , mobile phones , tablets , and electronic cigarettes , are seen as a fire risk , and there are concerns that if a fire were to start in the hold of a plane , it could not easily be extinguished .
it is important that airlines inform their passengers that large personal electronic devices should be carried in the passenger cabin whenever possible , the european aviation safety agency ( easa ) said in a statement on tuesday .
many airlines in europe already have their own procedures in place , such as telling passengers that laptops should not be carried in hold baggage .
easa said that where such items are too large to be carried in the cabin , then they must be completely switched off , protected from accidental activation , and packaged suitably to avoid damage .
they should also not be carried in the same bag as flammable items such as perfume or aerosols .
easa also said that if devices can not be carried in the cabin , such as when passengers have to put carry-on bags in the hold due to a lack of space in the cabin , airlines should remember to ask passengers to remove any spare batteries or e-cigarettes .
lithium ion batteries are also used to power so-called smart bags , suitcases which offer gps tracking and can charge devices , weigh themselves or be locked remotely using mobile phones .
