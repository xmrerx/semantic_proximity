CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Efforts by some delegates to block the Republican National Convention from nominating Donald Trump for president appear finished, U.S.
Senator Mike Lee, a Trump opponent, told Reuters on Tuesday.
“I don’t see any way around it,” the Utah lawmaker said as the Republican convention prepared to formally make Trump the nominee for the Nov. 8 presidential election.
