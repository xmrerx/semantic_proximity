Wow!
Thrill up his leg for Obama, Chris Matthews does a stunning 180 on his support for Hillary and boldly calls out any person who is still planning to support her.
He accuses her supporters of being too dainty to stand up for America.
Watch him tell his liberal viewers that the only chance we have to turn this nation around is to vote for Trump.
If you like the way things are the way they are headed in this country.
If you d like to continue the destruction of our manufacturing base, and the jobs that went with it.
If you like the uncontrollable immigration, if you like the string of stupid wars from Iraq to Libya to Syria.
If you want to say yes to all of that, if you want to keep this all the way it is, fine then vote for Hillary Clinton.
If you don t like the way things are headed, you ve got a chance to really shake the system at its roots.
If you wake up on Election Day and it s the same as it is today, if it s the same 4 or 5 or 8 years from now, remember you had a chance really change it up but you were too dainty to do it.

That said, with America facing a potential constitutional crisis after her election, I am not able, under the circumstances we are now facing, to vote for Secretary Clinton.
