While most of us were sleeping, Donald Trump spent his night retweeting a white supremacist who was convicted in the UK for harassing a Muslim woman in front of her two young children.
Jayda Fransen was arrested in October during a neo-Nazi rally for violating terms of her bail.
Fransen, Deputy Director of Britain First is thrilled to have been retweeted three times by the so-called president of the United States.
Trump even retweeted a video of a boy on crutches being murdered, just in case you haven t had enough gore in your life.The former reality show star s retweets even stunned Paul Joseph Watson, Infowars editor-at-large who suggested the move was not great optics.
Yeah, someone might want to tell whoever is running Trump's Twitter account this morning that retweeting Britain First is not great optics.
Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) November 29, 2017Even Infowars thinks Trump went too far.
Let that sink in for a moment.Here s a screen capture of the snuff film Trump retweeted.Fransen was super excited that Trump shared her anti-Muslim videos to his 44 million followers and went all caps in her tweet.
THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES, DONALD TRUMP, HAS RETWEETED THREE OF DEPUTY LEADER JAYDA FRANSEN S TWITTER VIDEOS!
Fransen tweeted.
DONALD TRUMP HIMSELF HAS RETWEETED THESE VIDEOS AND HAS AROUND 44 MILLION FOLLOWERS!
GOD BLESS YOU TRUMP!
GOD BLESS AMERICA!

Good morning, Mr President @realDonaldTrump what the hell are you doing retweeting a bunch of unverified videos by Britain First, a bunch of disgustingly racist far-right extremists?
he tweeted.
Please STOP this madness & undo your retweets.

Piers Morgan (@piersmorgan) November 29, 2017The video of the man being pushed off of a rooftop was filmed in Egypt during the 2013 overthrow of president Mohamed Morsi and the man complicit of the crime was hanged after being found guilty, according to BuzzFeed News.When British Labour Party politician Jo Cox was murdered by a far-right terrorist, he shouted, This is for Britain , keep Britain independent , and Britain first as he attacked her.Cox s husband responded to Trump s retweets, writing, Trump has legitimised the far right in his own country, now he s trying to do it in ours.
Spreading hatred has consequences & the President should be ashamed of himself.

Brendan Cox (@MrBrendanCox) November 29, 2017Trump just promoted a woman who was convicted of a hateful act in Britain, much to the distress of a widowed man whose wife s murder shocked the world.
Either Trump doesn t know how to Google or he s a hateful bigot or both.
