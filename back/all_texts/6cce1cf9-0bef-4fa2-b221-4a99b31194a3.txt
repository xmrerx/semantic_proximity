Former Utah Senator Bob Bennett lay in a hospital bed fighting a losing battle against pancreatic cancer and the ravages of a stroke, but in his last days he wanted to atone for the damage Donald Trump has done to Muslims in America.Instead, with a slight slurring in his words, Bennett drew them close to express a dying wish: Are there any Muslims in the hospital?
he asked.
I d love to go up to every single one of them to thank them for being in this country, and apologize to them on behalf of the Republican Party for Donald Trump, Bennett told his wife and son, both of whom relayed this story to The Daily Beast.Bennett served in the Senate for three terms, but his vote in favor of TARP left him vulnerable in the 2010 wave and he lost to Tea Party supporter Mike Lee.In his last days he also spoke to the Deseret News newspaper in Utah and told them, There s a lot of Muslims here in this area.
I m glad they re here.
Over the course of his presidential campaign, Donald Trump has repeatedly attacked Muslims.
He spoke out in favor of a ban on Muslim travel to the United States, and argued for a system to track Muslim citizens.
His Islamophobia brought the ire of newly elected London mayor Sadiq Khan, who is Muslim.Khan told Time magazine, If Donald Trump becomes the President, I ll be stopped from going there by virtue of my faith, which means I can t engage with American mayors and swap ideas.
Conservative tacticians thought those sorts of tactics would win London and they were wrong.
I m confident that Donald Trump s approach to politics won t win in America.
Unfortunately, Trump s ideas on Muslims have proven popular with a majority of Republican voters, even those who didn t support Trump in the primaries.Senator Bennett died on May 4.Featured image via YouTube
