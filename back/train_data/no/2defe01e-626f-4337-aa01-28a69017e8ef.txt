( reuters ) - virginia governor terry mcauliffe has signed a bill that makes the state the first in the united states to regulate fantasy sports , a multibillion-dollar online business whose legality has been challenged across the country .
the measure signed by mcauliffe , a democrat , mandates that players be 18 or older , offers players limits on how much they can bet , requires annual audits and bars employees from competing in company contests .
it takes effect on july 1 .
“ this bill , which was passed by super majorities of both chambers , will empower virginia to regulate this emerging industry and keep consumers safe from abuses , ” brian coy , a mcauliffe spokesman , said in a statement .
the governor signed the bill on monday .
the growing fantasy sports industry dominated by draftkings and fanduel has drawn increased attention from state regulators over the past year , with the attorneys general of new york , illinois and nevada questioning their legality .
the games are illegal in several states .
the companies charge customers to take part in mostly single-day games in which they draft a roster of players whose performance on the field earns points .
in statements on a sports gaming website , spokesmen for draftkings and fanduel welcomed the virginia measure .
texas reached a deal with fanduel last week in which the company will halt paid operations in the state on may 2 .
