Seven years ago, this story would ve seemed like something from The Onion (a satirical publication).
Unfortunately where Barry Sotoero, aka Barack Hussein Obama is concerned, nothing is unbelievable, and truth seems to be stranger than fiction Recently, a new Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) report was released stating that one of the United States Navy s top commanders was released from command after he sent out an email revealing that President Barack Obama was in the process of purchasing a multi-million dollar seaside villa in Dubai.The report indicates that Rear Admiral Rick Williams, Commander of the US Navy s Carrier Strike Group 15, posted a query on January 8 to the Naval Institutes Readiness Kill Chain.
It inquired why Navy security and intelligence personal had been dispatched from a Naval Support Facility in Thurmont to an Obama house hunting mission.
The message has since been deleted.As to the Obama house hunting mission Admiral Williams was making his query about before being fired, this report continues, SVR intelligence assests in the UAE identified it as being a luxury seaside villa located in the Palm Jumeirah development of Dubai being offered for sale at the price of $4.9 million (18 million United Arab Emirates Dirham), and which a deposit on it was made this past week by the Washington D.C. based global public affairs company Podesta Group.
Important to note about the Podesta Group, this report notes, is that its leader is Tony Podesta, who aside from being one of the most powerful oligarchs in the US, is a close personal friend of President Obama too.Within 18 hours of posting the query, Vice Admiral Noral Tyson fired Admiral Williams on orders from President Obama.
Her action was reportedly due to a loss of confidence in his ability to command based on allegations of his misuse of government computer equipment.
To cover their tracks, the Pentagon reportedly began releasing anonymous stories that Admiral Williams had been viewing pornography on his computer.
Of course, this is an impossibility due to the US Navy/Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI), which blocks such sites.
