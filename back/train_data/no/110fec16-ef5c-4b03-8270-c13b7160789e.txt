it s now no surprise that donald trump , the most hated presidential candidate in the field , is the gop s frontrunner .
it seems being hated is all the republican party is good for these days.and there s even better news for democrats ! a new poll from the pew research center shows that the gop is overwhelmingly hated by the american public and has reached its highest level of disdain since 1992 .
according to the poll , 62 percent of americans have an unfavorable impression of the gop whereas only 33 percent view it favorably .
american s positive perception of the gop fell four points in the last six months.the poll also found a very interesting trend : most of the negativity towards the gop came from self-identified republicans , where only 68 had a favorable view of their own party an 11 point drop from october.as trump rises is in the polls , republicans feelings about their party falls .
what a coincidence.in contrast , 45 percent of americans had a favorable view of the democratic party versus 50 percent who harbored negative views .
eighty-eight percent of democrats had a favorable view of the party.not surprisingly , independent voters were more favorable to the democratic party preferring them 37 to 28 percent than the republican party .
as trump continuously tells the public he s winning with independents , he certainly hasn t been very successful .
also not surprising was respondents who were black , female or young were also much more likely to give favorable impressions of the democratic party compared to the gop.when broken down , the poll reminds us of what we already know : white people , in general , are almost identical in how they feel about both parties ; 37 percent have a favorable view of both parties , while 59 percent have an unfavorable view of the democrats and 58 percent for the republicans.it looks like the two-party system has failed the oppressed whites yet again how sad.over 2,000 americans responded to the poll , which was conducted between april 12 to 19 and it has a margin of error at 2.5 percent.featured image via john sommers ii/getty images
