AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - A man with a Palestinian flag yelling God is great was detained by police in the Netherlands on Thursday after smashing the windows of a kosher Jewish restaurant in Amsterdam.
The violent outburst came a day after U.S. President Donald Trump recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, a decision that reversed decades of U.S. foreign policy, angered much of the Muslim world and was widely rejected by Western leaders.
The assailant, who was wearing a black-and-white-checkered head scarf, smashed several windows of the restaurant HaCarmel before he was pushed to the ground and hand-cuffed by police, a video of the incident posted on local media websites showed.
We are disgusted, the Organization of Jewish Communities in The Netherlands said in a statement.
The attack was an act of revenge, meant to instil fear, and is no less than an act of terror.
