there are so many reasons for this little coward to leave america and travel abroad for the duration of his term .
does he have knowledge of an imminent attack on america and wants to be overseas when it happens ?
is he using taxpayer money to travel around the world campaigning for un secretary general ?
perhaps he wants to be on the other side of the world when criminal proceedings against hillary heat up ?
plotting against america for seven straight years can be exhausting .
maybe he just needs a break ?
or perhaps it s just as simple as wanting to hit some international golf courses on our dime .
