Katie Couric s career has been pretty much in a free fall since she left the Today Show to accept a job as the new host of the CBS News, after the disgraced ex-host Dan Rather, retired (not surprisingly) after he was caught using manufactured evidence to support a fake hit-piece designed to harm the credibility of President George W. Bush.
Shortly after Katie failed miserably at her CBS News host gig, she was caught editing a documentary on gun violence that she used to help push her radical anti-gun agenda.Katie recently left Yahoo News where she had a less than spectacular career.
It now appears that the liberal hack reporter Katie Couric has now sunk to a new low.
While it s impossible to imagine she could sink any lower, Couric has managed to slither under the bar with her new InStyle magazine gig.The questions Couric asked of perfect strangers weren t funny and they certainly weren t interesting.
They were cringeworthy and very uncomfortable.
One only needs to watch the interview to see how truly painful it was.Watch the cringeworthy interview here:
