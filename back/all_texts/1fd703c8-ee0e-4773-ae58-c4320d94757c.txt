FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A suspicious package that prompted an evacuation of a Christmas market in Frankfurt has turned out to be harmless, the city s police said on Twitter.
Authorities said the package in question at Roemer square, the heart of the city s Christmas market, was a donation for the homeless.
Well intentioned, but poorly placed, the police said on Twitter.
The all clear came about 45 minutes after the evacuation was announced.
