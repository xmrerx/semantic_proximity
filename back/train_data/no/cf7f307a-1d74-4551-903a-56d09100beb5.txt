21st century wire says most people accept that a certain amount of political campaigning is staged , and even a little contrived at times.for the most part , the public is fairly unaware of just how fabricated the political images they see on tv really are.earlier , 21wire showed the abysmal scene from gop candidate jeb bush s recent staged town hall meeting .
as bad as that jeb moment was , it almost pales in comparison to what s on offer here after their narrow iowa gop caucus victory this week , the cruz campaign took a cheeky swipe at rival donald trump .
cruz communications director rick tyler remarked to cnn after the final results were announced , reality hit the realty tv star in iowa , so nobody is talking about him now , so he s trying to regain some attention on twitter .
after watching the following behind-the-scenes video out-takes from the rafael edward , or ted cruz campaign machine , one could easily make the argument that it s cruz who is putting up the dramatic tv facade , and even using his own family members as political props .
