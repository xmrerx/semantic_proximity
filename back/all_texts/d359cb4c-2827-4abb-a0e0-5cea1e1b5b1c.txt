WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Wednesday he would accept a corporate tax rate of 21 percent and would sign a bill with that number.
The White House has previously said it preferred a 20 percent tax rate for corporations, down from 35 percent at current levels.
“If it got down to 21 ...
I would be thrilled,” he said.
“We haven’t set that final figure yet.”
