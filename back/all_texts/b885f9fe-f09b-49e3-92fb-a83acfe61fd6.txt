CNN viewers will no longer be entertained by the car crash-caliber antics of Trump s trailer park propaganda minister Kellyanne Conway.
Politico reports that the Trump White House will be freezing out news organizations that do not promote his hateful agenda and The Donald s favorite fake news outlet is the first victim of this extremely questionable policy.
We re sending surrogates to places where we think it makes sense to promote our agenda, a White House official explained.
A CNN reporter had a more honest explanation of what is going on: They re trying to cull CNN from the herd.
White House Press Secretary, notorious liar and legendary moron Sean Spicer, claims that the network is not being frozen out because he sometimes answers the network s questions but he does not deny that administration officials are not appearing on CNN.
I m not going to sit around and engage with people who have no desire to actually get something right, he said ironically, apparently forgetting that he famously falsely claimed that Trump had the biggest inaugural crowd ever.
Just last month, Trump refused to take a question from CNN because he says they are fake news.
This move is unprecedented.
While Presidents have feuded with news networks in the past President Obama and Fox News, for instance they did not intentionally freeze out the networks.
Obama officials, for example, appeared on Fox regularly.This is a clear attempt to damage CNN s ratings by denying them access to the Trump White House an immature and unpresidential move by a thin-skinned bully, and it is entirely unacceptable to only send representatives to networks that are willing to lie for him.If the standard for the Trump White House sending representatives to a network is their willingness to promote his agenda, everyone should aspire to be exactly like CNN.
No news network should ever promote any President s agenda when it conflicts with the facts.Featured image via screengrab/Getty Images (Drew Angerer)
