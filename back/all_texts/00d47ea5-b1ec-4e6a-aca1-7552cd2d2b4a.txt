As Republicans cry phony, crocodile tears over the 49 slain LGBT citizens in Orlando, Anderson Cooper had just about enough, and Pam Bondi, Florida s Attorney General, felt the wrath.While interviewing Bondi, Cooper quickly turned the tables on the Trump supporter when she expressed her support for the LGBT community following the terrorist attack on Pulse.Cooper, who is openly gay, let her have it right away in his opening question: I saw you the other day saying that anyone who attacks the LGBT community, our LGBT community, you said will be gone after with the fullest extent of the law.
I talked to a lot of gay and lesbian people here yesterday who are not fans of yours and who said that they thought you were being a hypocrite, that you for years have fought against basically you have gone after gay people and have said in court that gay people, simply by fighting for marriage equality, were trying to do harm to the people of Florida, to induce public harm I believe is the term you used in court.
Do you really think you re the champion of the gay community?
Bondi, who was almost rendered speechless, quickly pivoted to defending her bigotry, stating that she had an obligation under the Florida Constitution to defend marriage as being between one man and one woman.
Bondi then chastised Cooper for making her look like she hates gay people.But Anderson Cooper wouldn t let her off the hook.
he reminded her that her use of the term public harm was in of itself harmful to the LGBT community, and when Bondi tried to backtrack, and Cooper again called her out for it, she did what any conservative would do she blamed it on her lawyer.Moving on, Cooper then blasted her over the sick irony that Bondi set up a help center for the married LGBT couples who lost a spouse in the attack when her defense of banning same-sex marriage would not have allowed them such access.
As usual, she pivoted, saying her position is not a champion of the LGBT movement, but to human beings who have lost their lives.
This might be the best interview Anderson Cooper has ever done because it exposes the hypocrisy, the phony, ill natured opportunism of the Republican Party.Watch the interview here:Featured image via Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images
