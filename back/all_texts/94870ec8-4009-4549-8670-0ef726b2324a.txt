LONDON (Reuters) - The British government expects to bring a budget for Northern Ireland before parliament at Westminster in mid-November, after the region s largest parties failed to reach agreement on forming a government, the Northern Ireland minister said on Thursday.
I would expect the budget bill to be considered in this House shortly after the November recess, which ends on Nov. 13, James Brokenshire told parliament on Thursday.
