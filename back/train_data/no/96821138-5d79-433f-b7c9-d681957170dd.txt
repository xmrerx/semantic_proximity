riyadh ( reuters ) - saudi arabia has released 23 of the 200-or-so powerful individuals detained since november on corruption charges after they reached deals with the government , okaz newspaper reported on tuesday .
the report did not name those involved in what appeared to be the first large-scale release since the royals , business people and government officials were detained in a crackdown spearheaded by crown prince mohammed bin salman .
the suspects have been held at riyadh s luxurious ritz carlton hotel since early november and told to hand over assets and cash in exchange for their freedom .
okaz said more detainees would be released in the coming days and trial proceedings would begin soon for those who continue to deny the charges against them .
saudi authorities see the settlements not as blackmail but as an obligation to reimburse money taken illegally from the world s top oil producer over several decades .
video posted on social media showed a smiling saoud al-daweesh , the former chief executive of saudi telecom , telling well-wishers he had been treated decently .
private affairs ( a unit of the royal court ) brought us a full lamb dish day and night .
they treated us well and did a good job , he said .
saudi officials did not respond to requests for comment .
