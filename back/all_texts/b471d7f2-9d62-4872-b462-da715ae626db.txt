The investigations into the Trump-Russia scandal are an increasing problem for Trump as he desperately tries to steer any and all spotlights away from him and onto, well, pretty much everything else.
Unfortunately for him, Rep. Adam Schiff drew an absolutely brilliant map between Trump and Russia during his statement this morning.Schiff left absolutely nothing out of his statement.
His map is as follows:Schiff does acknowledge that all of this could just be a bunch of wild coincidences, but with a caveat: Is it possible that all of these events and reports are completely unrelated, and nothing more than an entirely unhappy coincidence?
Yes, it is possible.
But it is also possible, maybe more than possible, that they are not coincidental, not disconnected and not unrelated, and that the Russians used the same techniques to corrupt U.S. persons that they have employed in Europe and elsewhere.
We simply don t know, not yet, and we owe it to the country to find out.
He s right.
When mapped out, this string of coincidences is pretty damning indeed.
We need an investigation, and if Trump really were innocent, he and his minions would likely not be trying to deflect.
They d be saying, Go ahead, investigate us!
Investigate to your heart s content!
You won t find anything.
But they aren t. This scandal is about to blow up again.
