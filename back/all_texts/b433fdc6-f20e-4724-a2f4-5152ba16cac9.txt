DUBAI (Reuters) - Senior Saudi Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, once seen as a leading contender to the throne, was freed after reaching an acceptable settlement agreement with authorities paying more than $1 billion, a Saudi official said on Wednesday.

Three other people involved in corruption cases have also finalised settlement agreements with authorities, the official told Reuters.
