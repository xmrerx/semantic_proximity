No matter which candidate you re pulling for to be the Democratic presidential nominee, you re likely to find the cold open from Saturday Night Live s season finale pretty damn hilarious.
Of course there will be some who won t see it as funny, and those people need to calm the hell down, because it s comedy and no one is perfect, and SNL just perfectly encapsulated what s happening in the Democratic race, whether you like it or not.Both Kate McKinnon and Larry David reprised their roles as Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, and met up at a bar to unwind from what s been a pretty grueling race.
The bartender announces that the bar is closing, but Bernie refuses to leave announcing that he ll leave when he s good and ready to leave.
It s at this point that Hillary and Bernie have one last drink at the bar Bernie a drink that that s refreshing and revolutionary that draws huge crowds, while Hillary had a beer no one likes, but gets the job done.
The pair then rehashes over the campaign and what they might have done differently, and while Bernie admits that he secretly imagines being a millionaire and eating fancy foods, Hillary admits that she really really wants to be president.
Something Bernie is keenly aware of.Hillary then invites Bernie to dance where, of course, she insists on leading, and the two dance off throughout the SNL studio.It s going to be a long summer without the SNL cast going after the candidates from both sides at every turn, but one thing is for certain, the season premiere this fall is bound to be pretty damn epic.Watch the cold open here:Featured image via video screen capture
