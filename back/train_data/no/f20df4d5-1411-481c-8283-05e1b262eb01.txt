berlin ( reuters ) - a female german politician has triggered a fierce debate by accusing a former ambassador of sexism after he failed to recognize her at a conference and then said he was not expecting such a young and beautiful woman as a speaker .
sawsan chebli , a 39-year-old state secretary in the berlin city government , said she was sitting in the front row waiting to speak at a meeting of the indo-german society but was not recognized by the head of the group , hans-joachim kiderlen .
when he realized his mistake , the retired former german ambassador to india reportedly said : i wasn t expecting such a young woman .
and you are also so beautiful .
chebli , a member of the centre-left social democrats , went ahead with her speech but posted on her facebook page afterwards that she was in shock .
of course , i m always experiencing sexism , but i have never experienced anything like what happened today , she said .
her comments prompted an outpouring in german newspapers and social media , already abuzz as million of women across the world have been sharing their experiences of sexual harassment and abuse in an online campaign using the hashtag # metoo .
chebli , a former spokeswoman for the german foreign ministry born to palestinian refugee parents , was swamped with insults on her facebook page , including suggestions that she wear a muslim headscarf if she does not want to receive compliments .
she also received messages of support , including from women who had similar experiences , including teresa buecker , editor-in-chief of the feminist magazine edition f. i have also been called up to the stage as the beautiful speaker - it is degrading and disrespectful , buecker wrote on twitter .
