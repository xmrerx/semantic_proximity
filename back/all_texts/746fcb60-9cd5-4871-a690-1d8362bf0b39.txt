If you re not paying attention to Donald Trump on Twitter at the moment, you are missing out on witnessing a truly unhinged individual playing a classic game of projection.With allegations and proof being revealed day after day regarding Trump and his administration s ties to Russia, especially throughout the course of his campaign and the years prior, Trump is left to do the only thing he appears to know how to do deflect and blame others of doing exactly what he is doing.Earlier in the day Trump tweeted an image of Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer grabbing a donut with Vladimir Putin,We should start an immediate investigation into @SenSchumer and his ties to Russia and Putin.
A total hypocrite!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 3, 2017Schumer did nothing wrong, and unlike Attorney General Jeff Sessions, he didn t commit perjury surrounding this event.Schumer even tweeted back:Happily talk re: my contact w Mr. Putin & his associates, took place in '03 in full view of press & public under oath.
Would you &your team?

Chuck Schumer (@SenSchumer) March 3, 2017Which is far more transparent than Trump has ever been.Trump, clearly upset that people aren t reacting to this revelation that Schumer and Putin grabbed a Krispy Kreme together then decided to try and throw Nancy Pelosi under the bus in the same regard.He said: I hereby demand a second investigation, after Schumer, of Pelosi for her close ties to Russia, and lying about it.

@realDonaldTrump doesn't know difference between official mtg photographed by press & closed secret mtg his AG lied about under oath.
