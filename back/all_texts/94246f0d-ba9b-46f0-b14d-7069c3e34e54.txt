Get ready for Donald Trump to throw the worst temper tantrum of his presidency.When you think of Trump, what s the first word that comes to your mind?
That s the question that a new Quinnipiac poll asked Americans.Trump has often bragged that he has the best words, but this poll makes it clear that Americans had the best words to describe him.
And they are words that even Trump can understand.
Idiot is the top word Americans used to answer the poll, followed by incompetent and liar.
Americans also used words such as, asshole, unqualified, ignorant, racist, embarrassment, narcissist, bully, arrogant, dishonest, bigot, buffoon, blowhard, clown, and greedy, just to list a few.Adding insult to injury, Trump s approval rating reached a new low in the poll.
Only 36 percent approve while 58 percent disapprove.In addition, 61 percent say Trump is not honest and 56 percent say he does not have good leadership skills.The poll also shows that Americans overwhelmingly disapprove of the way Trump talks about the media 65 percent to 31 percent.
Most, 57 percent, also trust the media more than him to tell the truth, a statistic that will likely send Trump off the deep end.Americans also want Democrats to take back control of the Senate.Overall, it s pretty damn clear that the American people loathe Trump.
And even though Trump will try to spin the numbers or use Fox News propaganda to dispute them, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Poll Tim Malloy says Trump really is out of excuses at this point.
There is no way to spin or sugarcoat these sagging numbers, Malloy said.And this poll was taken long before Trump s embarrassing overseas trip to Poland and the G-20 Summit in Germany, where Trump kissed Putin s ass for two hours and offered to let Russia work on American cyber security despite the fact that Russia has been launching cyber attacks against our nation.So it s likely Americans would use even more negative words to describe Trump if they could pick again.Trump is going to blow a gasket when he learns of this poll and you can bet the hissy fit will be public for all to see because Trump is thin-skinned, which curiously was not a word Americans thought of for the poll.
Maybe they will next time.Featured Image: Isaac Brekken/Getty Images
