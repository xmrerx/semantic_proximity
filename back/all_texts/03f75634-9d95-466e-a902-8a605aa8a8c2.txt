Our FBI Director has testified once before in regards to the inability to screen Syrian refugees.
This time he repeats his concerns before the House Homeland Security Committee in a hearing yesterday.
Is anyone listening or is Trey Gowdy so focused on the Hillary hearings on Capitol Hill that he s not paying attention to the effort to forever change America.
We are scheduled to bring in 200,000 Muslim refugees that WE CANNOT DO BACKGROUND CHECKS ON.
This is insane!
The left is hell bent on flooding towns across America with these people which is NOT in the best interests of anyone.
Please act to at least call your Congressman to ask questions and demand answers.FBI director James Comey said during a House Committee on Homeland Security hearing on Wednesday that the federal government does not have the ability to conduct thorough background checks on all of the 10,000 Syrian refugees that the Obama administration says will be allowed to come to the U.S. We can only query against that which we have collected, Comey said in response to a line of questioning from Mississippi Rep. Bennie Thompson .
And so if someone has never made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their interest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the cows come home, but there will be nothing show up because we have no record of them.
The Senate hearing on Syrian refugee resettlement took place on October 1, 2015 and is the first such hearing since 9/11.
Can you believe that?
I watched the entire hearing on CSPAN and couldn t believe the answers given to our Senators about refugee resettlement!
The most important clip from the hearing is VERY IMPORTANT!
Please watch the clip below where Matthew Emrich (Associate Director Department of Homeland Security->Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate) is hammered by Senator Jeff Sessions on the inability to vet refugees:
