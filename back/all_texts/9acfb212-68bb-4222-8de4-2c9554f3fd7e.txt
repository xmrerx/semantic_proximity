PARIS (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday said he deliberately laid out his vision for sweeping European Union reforms just after Germany s election and before coalition talks there are concluded in order for his proposals to have more influence.
Some had said I should wait for the coalition talks to be concluded, Macron said, adding that had he done so, the reaction in Berlin would have been: Your proposals are great but it s too late, the coalition deal already lays out what will we do on Europe for the next four years.
