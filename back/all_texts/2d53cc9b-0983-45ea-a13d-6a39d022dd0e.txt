When did our Washington DC Mall become a staging area for feminist statements?
Do families traveling to DC really need to see a statue of a naked woman standing next to the Washington Monument?
Don t we have a number of museums in DC that would be a more appropriate temporary home for a 45-foot statue of a naked woman?The organizers of Catharsis on the Mall are planning to have a 45-foot-tall statue of a naked woman near the Washington Monument for several months.The National Park Services confirmed to FOX 5 it received and was reviewing a public gathering permit application for Catharsis on the Mall which would include erecting a 45-foot tall statue of a naked woman.Organizers for the event said the statue, called R-Evolution, is a woman standing in her strength and power expressing her humanity; how she feels when she is safe, when she can just be.
It was created by artist Marco Cochrane in collaboration with model Deja Solis and was first featured at Burning Man, an annual festival held in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada, back in 2015, according to organizers.Catharsis on the Mall said it would like to have the statue next to the Washington Monument looking at the White House beginning Nov. 9 and lasting through March 2018.Via: Fox5NY
