The racists came out in full force when Jimmy Kimmel put up a minute of video that is too outstanding to ignore.
In a segment called, The Hateful 8 Ball, Kimmel gets advice from a mystical Samuel L Jackson inside a magic 8 ball toy.
Jackson plays the part as you d expect, nailing the role of angry black man with iconic voice ever so perfectly.Definitely a great moment captured for all time not only for a funny comedic piece, but as a historical record for the kind of racism that follows Donald Trump around.
On hearing the name, the Trump trolls who keep this buffoon relevant enough that he might just win the GOP nomination hopped all over the comments on The Patriot Nation, the right-wing propaganda rag posting the video for other racists to be outraged at.This rocket doctor doesn t understand why racism has to be about race:When Bill Taylor, who went to Ball State University, says that President Obama had no qualifications other than he s black to run for president, that s it.
All bets are off, Obama is worthless.
Bill was obviously far too involved with the investigation into how little Obama was vetted to notice the birther movement, college transcript fiasco and fake Barry Soetoro stuff that still thrives in circles of stupidity all over the internet.Bill says he s a racist, pretty sure it s because he s black, not sure if we re talking about Jackson or Obama anymore; It s very sad.Then there are the people who just really are that stupid:It takes a classy person to be a Donald Trump supporter.
You have to be able to just hate so indiscriminately.
Can you actually consider yourself to be fair if you truly hate everyone equally?
