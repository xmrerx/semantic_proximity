ankara ( reuters ) - turkish authorities have issued detention warrants for 216 people , including former finance ministry personnel , suspected of having links to last year s failed coup attempt , the state-run anadolu news agency said on wednesday .
it said 17 former finance ministry personnel had been detained so far and another 65 were sought over alleged links to gulen s network , anadolu said .
separately , authorities carried out operations across 40 provinces targeting private imams believed to be recruiting members to the network of u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen from turkey s armed forces .
ankara blames gulen for orchestrating the july 15 coup attempt last year and has repeatedly demanded the united states extradite him , so far in vain .
gulen denies involvement .
in the aftermath of the coup , more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial and some 150,000 have been sacked or suspended from their jobs in the military , public and private sector .
the extent of the purges has unnerved rights groups and turkey s western allies , who fear president tayyip erdogan is using the abortive putsch as a pretext to stifle dissent .
the government , however , says the measures are necessary due to the gravity of the threats it is facing following the military coup attempt , in which 240 people were killed .
