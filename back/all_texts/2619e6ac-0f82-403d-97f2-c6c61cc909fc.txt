The second day of the Democratic National Convention took an emotional turn when a group of black women, whose children s lives were lost long before their time, stepped on the stage and began to tell their heartbreaking stories and say emphatically: Black Lives Matter.The room hushed as Mothers of the Movement told of their children and the violent ways they had left this earth.
Geneva Reed-Veal (mother of Sandra Bland), Lucia Bath (Jordan Davis) and Sybrina Fulton (Trayvon Martin) explained to the crowd of delegates why they were standing there in front of them, somewhere they never expected to be.
Their stories brought the DNC to tears.
You don t stop being a parent when your child dies.
I am still Jordan Davis s mother.
His life ended the day he was shot and killed for playing loud music.
But my job as his mother didn t, Bath said.
I lived in fear my son would die like this.
I even warned him that because he was a young, black man, he would meet people who didn t value his life, she said.
That is a conversation no parent should ever have to have.
So naturally, right-wing racists came out in droves.
@Tyronem07172460 @RedPillTweets The mothers of the movement are a freaking joke.

The inclusion Mothers of the Movement at the DNC is proof that the Democratic party and Hillary Clinton do believe Black Lives Matter.You can watch these mothers give their moving speech here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eW8_tr3JCEk]Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
