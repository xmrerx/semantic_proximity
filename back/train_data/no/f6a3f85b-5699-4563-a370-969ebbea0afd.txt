mogadishu ( reuters ) - thousands of somalis prayed in mogadishu on friday at a symbolic funeral for more than 300 people killed by the country s deadliest truck bombing .
the truck detonated next to a fuel tanker on saturday , creating a huge fireball that incinerated multi-story buildings .
around half the dead were burned beyond recognition , said authorities .
the government conducted mass burials soon after the blast , in keeping with the muslim practice of interring the dead as quickly as possible .
religious leader abdi hayi said mourners had decided to conduct a symbolic funeral six days on , as it had not been possible to give so many of the victims a proper send-off with prayers at a mosque .
since we have not seen many bodies we came to conduct the funeral at the spot of the blast , he said .
the bomb attack was the deadliest since islamist militant group al shabaab began an insurgency in 2007 .
al shabaab has not claimed responsibility , but the al qaeda-linked organization has increasingly used truck bombs .
somalia has been mired in conflict since 1991 , when clan warlords overthrew a dictator then turned on each other .
one of the poorest countries in africa relies on foreign donors to support its institutions and basic services .
the battle-scarred coastal city is on edge after the bombing .
a central road in the city emptied quickly after locals suspected a minivan loaded with vegetables was carrying a bomb .
as police checked the van , shopkeepers and residents fled the scene .
i closed my shop and ran away , said shopkeeper abdullahi omar .
we have much fear and still the shock ... persisting in our minds .
