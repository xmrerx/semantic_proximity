Deep State Is Trying to Take Down a President It Needs to Stop Dennis Kucinich goes there and tells Sean Hannity that the deep state is trying to destroy America as we know it.
This man is a Democrat who is brave enough to speak out!
You have a politicization of the agencies.
That is resulting in leaks from anonymous unknown people and the intention is to take down a president.This is very dangerous to America.It is a threat to our republic.
It constitutes a clear and present danger to our way of life.What is the motive of these people?
Who s putting these leaks out?
Why isn t somebody coming forward to make that charge and put their name and their reputation behind it instead of attacking through the media and not substantiating their position?
