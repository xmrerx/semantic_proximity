munich , germany ( reuters ) - a german prosecutor urged judges on tuesday to give a sentence of life imprisonment to beate zschaepe , the main surviving member of a neo-nazi gang accused of murdering 10 people , most of them immigrants , over seven years from the year 2000 .
prosecutors say zschaepe was part of the national socialist underground ( nsu ) group which killed eight turks , a greek and a german policewoman .
zschaepe , 42 , has denied taking part in the murders with two friends who killed themselves in 2011 when police discovered the gang by chance .
but she has , through her lawyer , said she felt morally guilty for not stopping them .
judges have yet to give a verdict .
the accused is criminally fully responsible for her behavior , said federal prosecutor herbert diemer , calling for zschaepe to be given a life sentence for 10 murders .
he described zschaepe as an ice-cold , calculating person , adding that there were no mitigating circumstances .
zschaepe , 42 , listened impassively , resting her chin on her hands .
prosecutors said in july that four years of hearing evidence had shown that zschaepe was a co-founder , member and accomplice of a terrorist organization .
the group had carried out the most violent and infamous terror attacks including two bombings and 15 bank robberies since the end of the red army faction s two-decade spree in 1991 , in which 34 people are estimated to have been killed .
although the nsu murders were carried out by zschaepe s two friends , uwe mundlos and uwe boehnhardt , both now dead in what is believed to have been a murder-suicide , she played a major role behind the scenes , according to prosecutors .
