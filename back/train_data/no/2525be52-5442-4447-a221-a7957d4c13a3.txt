berlin ( reuters ) - german police arrested a 29-year-old man they said was an active member of islamic state who was plotting a truck attack on an ice rink .
the arrest , a year after anis amri , a failed tunisian asylum seeker with islamist links , hijacked a truck and drove it into a christmas market in berlin , killing 12 people , comes as security services have warned of growing numbers of radical islamists in germany .
he was considering an attack on the ice rink on the schlossplatz in karlsruhe , police in the south-western state of baden-wuerttemberg said , adding that the suspect was a german citizen whose name they gave only as dasbar w. to that end he was assessing areas around karlsruhe castle and , from september 2017 , had begun seeking employment as a delivery driver - without success , the police statement said .
in 2015 , the suspect traveled to iraq to fight for islamic state , receiving weapons training and working as a scout seeking potential attack targets in the city of erbil , police said .
he returned to germany the following year .
before leaving for iraq , dasbar worked for islamic state from germany , producing propaganda videos and proselytizing to converts in online chat rooms , police said .
earlier this month , germany s security service warned that the number of salafists - followers of a radical islamist ideology - had risen to an all-time high of 10,800 , though the number prepared to mount attacks was in the order of hundreds .
