beijing ( reuters ) - china s foreign ministry reiterated on thursday that it believes venezuela has the ability to handle its debt issue , after the oil-rich country started making interest payments on bonds following a delay that had threatened to trigger a default .
venezuela has borrowed billions of dollars from russia and china , primarily through oil-for-loan deals that have crimped the country s hard currency revenue by requiring oil shipments to be used to service those loans .
on wednesday , venezuela won easier debt terms from russia , as well as a vote of confidence from china - two countries that could provide a lifeline as caracas seeks to keep its deeply depressed economy solvent .
asked whether china was concerned that the debt would not be repaid , chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told a regular news briefing that china-venezuela financial cooperation was proceeding as normal .
we believe that venezuela s government and people have the ability to properly handle their debt issue , geng said .
venezuelan bond prices have been on a roller-coaster over the past 10 days , as president nicolas maduro called investors to debt restructuring talks , while pledging to keep honoring the country s obligations .
but s & p global ratings declared it in selective default on two of its sovereign bonds early this week after it failed to make the coupons within a 30-day grace period .
on wednesday , the country s economy ministry said it had started transferring $ 200 million in interest payments on those bonds , which mature in 2019 and 2024 .
