A Donald Trump president is a very scary prospect for all sane Americans.
Most politicians, GOP and Democrat alike, are in no way behind that bloviating fool and his crazy, dangerous and violent supporters.
California Governor Jerry Brown has taken that one step further, and turned Trump s constant talk of building walls right back around on him.
Brown, in fact, says that California will need its own wall if Trump becomes president.Brown made the statements during a dinner party for a labor union.
He said to the crowd: And I promise that if Trump were ever elected, we d have to build a wall around California to defend ourselves from the rest of this country!
Governor Brown then assured the cheering and laughing crowd that he was just kidding: By the way that is a joke.
We don t like walls, we like bridges.
Brown then went on to point out how important immigration is to the American workforce: Some of these old white guys ought to recognize that the whole pension system would collapse if we didn t have a bunch of young people coming into this country and into this state.
They re not all coming from here.
They re coming from other places.
Brown is right, of course.
Walls are not the solution bridges are.
However, if Trump and his band of lunatics take over America, a wall around California and anyone else wanting to shield themselves from such a travesty might not be such a bad idea.Watch the video of Governor Brown s remarks below:Featured image via screen capture from Jerry Brown Facebook
