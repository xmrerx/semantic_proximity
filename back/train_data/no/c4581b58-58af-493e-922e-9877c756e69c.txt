( reuters ) - florida power & light shut unit 4 at the turkey point nuclear power station in florida sunday night due to a likely valve issue , and is reducing power at unit 1 at the st lucie power plant due to salt build up in the switchyard , a spokesman at the u.s. nuclear regulatory commission said monday .
he could not say whether the turkey point 4 outage was related to hurricane irma , which battered florida over the weekend , and he could not say whether fpc planned to shut or just reduce st lucie 1 .
