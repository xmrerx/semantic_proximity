LONDON (Reuters) - London s East Croydon station was due to reopen on Monday after police said an item they had been investigating was not harmful.
The item at East Croydon has been declared non-suspicious, Britain s transport police said on Twitter.
The station will be reopening very shortly.
The temporary closure caused delays for commuters and for travellers using the city s nearby Gatwick Airport.
Britain is on its second-highest level of security alert after several attacks in the country in recent months.
