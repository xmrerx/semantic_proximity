The fallout from the sexual harassment scandal involving Fox News founder Roger Ailes continues as secrets about how he operated leak out.
The latest revelations are about a creepy misuse of corporate funds, if the allegations are true.New York magazine s Gabriel Sherman, who broke the Ailes harassment story, is reporting that sources inside Fox say that Ailes used corporate money in order to finance surveillance and spying on writers that were seen as hostile to Fox News.Sherman reports that News Corp., Fox s parent, recently fired five consultants whose only job was to do the thug work for Roger Ailes against his enemies.They were part of what is being described as the Black Room, a program Ailes set up.According to one highly-placed source, Solivan worked out of what Fox insiders called the Black Room, an operation Ailes established around 2011 to conduct PR and surveillance campaigns against people he targeted both inside and outside the company.
The Black Room was located on the 14th floor of the News Corp building at 1211 Avenue of the Americas, a quiet part of the office that housed Fox News Latino and some marketing and promotions employees.The Black Room allegedly went after John Cook and Hamilton Nolan, writers for Gawker who covered Ailes aggressively.According to one source, private detectives followed Cook around his Brooklyn neighborhood and Fox operatives prepared a report on him with information they intended to leak to blogs.Sherman also reports that he was a target of Ailes Black Room operation:In 2012, while I was researching a biography of Ailes, Fox operatives set up web pages to attack my reputation, and Fox funds paid for Google search ads against my name that linked to the sites.
One source also said private investigators employed by Fox contributor Bo Dietl were instructed to follow me and my wife.Fox News is a creepy network, set up and operated by a major creep who also appears to have been some sort of sexual predator.
This revelation, which would sound bizarre coming from any other cable news channel, seems to fit right in.Featured image via YouTube
