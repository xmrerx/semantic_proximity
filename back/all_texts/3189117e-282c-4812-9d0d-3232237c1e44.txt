This is totally unpresidential behavior.Throughout the campaign, Donald trump repeatedly attacked Senator Elizabeth Warren by calling her Pocahontas just because Warren has Native American ancestry.Warren fired back on multiple occasions and often destroyed Trump to the point where he stopped attacking her.Trump s nasty attacks on Warren were outrageous during the campaign, and they are even more outrageous now that he occupies the White House as the so-called President of the United States.
During a meeting with Republican and Democratic senators on Thursday, Trump brought up Warren s effort to read a letter by Coretta Scott King to the Senate in which King condemned Jeff Sessions racism and voiced her opposition to his nomination for a federal judgeship back in 1986.As Warren tried to read the letter, Mitch McConnell silenced her and Republicans voted to basically censure her because they claim the letter impugned Sessions character.
You know, because calling out a racist has somehow become a bad thing in our society.Politico reports,According to participants in Thursday s meeting, Trump referred to Warren several times as Pocahontas, the moniker he gave her during his campaign, and told the Democrats he was glad Warren is becoming the face of your party.
Seriously.
Trump actually referred to a sitting United States Senator as Pocahontas, which at this point should be considered a racial slur the way he is using it.
Republicans apparently had no problem with Trump s disgraceful attack on Warren.Trump is no longer a bombastic political candidate trying to get attention.
He is the f*cking president now and this kind of behavior is embarrassing and stains the dignity of the office.Make no mistake, Donald Trump not only owes Warren and the Democratic Party an apology, he owes America an apology.This kind of behavior is intolerable and he should be ashamed of himself.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
