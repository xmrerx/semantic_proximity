tripoli ( reuters ) - at least 31 migrants died after their boat sank off libya s western coast on saturday and some 200 others were picked up by the coastguard to be brought back to port in tripoli , officials said .
the migrants were on two boats off the coast near garabulli , east of tripoli , one of which had already sunk when the coastguard arrived at the scene , said abu ajala amer abdelbari , a coast guard commander .
the boat had sunk and they were spread out in the sea , they were trying to swim towards the coast , he said .
there were about 60 people who we were able to save because they were clinging to the ( remains of the ) boat .
another 140 migrants were picked up from the second boat , he said .
the dead , including a number of children , were brought back to tripoli naval base where they were unloaded in white plastic body bags .
libya is the main departure point for mostly african migrants trying to cross to europe .
smugglers usually pack them into flimsy inflatable boats that often break down or sink .
most migrants are picked up by international vessels and taken to italy , where more than 115,000 have landed so far this year , although an increasing number are intercepted by libya s european-backed coastguard and returned to the north african country .
since july , there has been a sharp drop in crossings , though this week has seen a renewed surge in departures .
nearly 3,000 migrants are known to have died or be missing after trying to cross to europe by sea this year , the majority of them between libya and italy .
the international organization for migration said on friday that since 2000 the mediterranean had been by far the world s deadliest border for migrants .
