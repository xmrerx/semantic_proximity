Fox News raging pile of upper one percent garbage, Eric Bolling, decided to use his time on cable news shaming the working poor of America for having the nerve to still be poor over the course of this past tax season.Bolling raged incoherently about how unfair it is that poor people are helped by the government, they don t pay ENOUGH in taxes (yes a Republican is whining that people aren t paying enough taxes but only the poor people of course), and how the rich jackasses like him have to shoulder the burden.He makes a good point, Right?
A guy paid millions of dollars a year to sit in a chair for 1 hour a day and be an ass on national tv really has it ROUGH when he has to pay a portion of that in taxes to prevent the bottom 50 percent of the population from starving.
I mean, after he pays his terrible 30 percent he only has millions of dollars left to live on.
How can he survive this?Bolling went on to cite some statistics that he must have written down while drunk one night because they re so utterly stupid that it defies explanation how a political expert like him would think they sounded remotely accurate.
He even went on to complain about the death tax which only affects people who literally have millions of dollars being HANDED to them as an inheritance.Only the wealthiest estates pay the tax because it is levied only on the portion of an estate s value that exceeds a specified exemption level $5.43 million per person (effectively $10.86 million per married couple) in 2015.Source: CBPPThe top rate for it is 18 percent.
If you are going to whine about having to pay 20% of a 5 MILLION dollar inheritance (literally free money), you re simply a greedy, terrible person who doesn t appreciate anything.The cherry on the sundae really was when Eric threw a second hissyfit over the fact that President Obama paid less in taxes than he did.
He ignored the fact that President Obama doesn t make millions per year as president, unlike Bolling who makes a fortune warming a seat for 1 hour a day.Watch Fox News blame poor people for hurting the rich below:Featured image via video screen capture
