denpasar , indonesia ( reuters ) - indonesian police have recaptured a u.s. citizen who escaped a week ago from an overcrowded prison on the holiday island of bali , the jail s second breakout of foreign inmates this year .
cristian beasley from california was rearrested on sunday , badung police chief yudith satria hananta said , without providing further details .
beasley was a suspect in crimes related to narcotics but had not been sentenced when he escaped from kerobokan prison in bali last week .
the 32-year-old is believed to have cut through bars in the ceiling of his cell before scaling a perimeter wall of the prison in an area being refurbished .
the kerobokan prison , about 10 km ( six miles ) from the main tourist beaches in the kuta area , often holds foreigners facing drug-related charges .
representatives of beasley could not immediately be reached for comment .
in june , an australian , a bulgarian , an indian and a malaysian tunneled to freedom about 12 meters ( 13 yards ) under kerobokan prison s walls .
the indian and the bulgarian were caught soon after in neighboring east timor , but australian shaun edward davidson and malaysian tee kok king remain at large .
davidson has taunted authorities by saying he was enjoying life in various parts of the world , in purported posts on facebook .
kerobokan has housed a number of well-known foreign drug convicts , including australian schappelle corby , whose 12-1/2-year sentence for marijuana smuggling got huge media attention .
