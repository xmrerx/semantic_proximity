If you ve ever wondered why suddenly, now, Christian conservatives are making a huge stink over where people go to the bathroom, grab a match and take a look at this attack ad in Texas.Mail piece says @BriscoeCain is well known to those who frequent gay bars in Montrose section of Houston #TxLege pic.twitter.com/fqMH682gWz Scott Braddock (@scottbraddock) May 20, 2016On its face, it looks like a pretty standard below the belt political attack ad.
It might make a candidate an asshole and a bigot to spread unfounded rumors that your opponent is gay, but on the next page is where the real insight into the Republican party is: Irony: Mailer against a Hotze-backed candidate, @BriscoeCain, says he should be kept out of men s bathrooms #TxLege pic.twitter.com/wLOzL3nQRY Scott Braddock (@scottbraddock) May 20, 2016The transgender bathroom laws that are popping up across the country are not specifically about transgender people.
Once the Supreme Court ruled that marriage equality was the law of the land, anti-gay bigots had to take their fight elsewhere.
Besides, gay marriage might not be so bad if you don t actually have to see people *gasp* holding hands or *I feel faint* kissing.
What s a better way to keep people out of the public than to ban them from using public restrooms?If you think this is a bit of a stretch, think about the bathroom laws themselves.
Imagine a very masculine looking man, who happened to have been born with a vagina.
Do women, who already see predators around every corner, really want to share a bathroom with him?
Should a woman, feminine in every way except for what s between her legs, be forced to use the men s room?
Of course not.
Anti-LGBT conservatives don t want them to use the bathroom at all, just like Briscoe Cain s opponent doesn t want him in bathrooms.Yes, this is just one person, but this guy (unfortunately, not a Republican) feels that gay people should have their own bathrooms.
You know, separate, but equal.Here are a few more charmers:Keep the freaks, perverts, and Fags out of the bathrooms!!

Grant (@DieBABIP) April 28, 2016When you #fags have your own bathrooms fully designed I will support the #LGBT community in having them built across the nation> #Deal?
James Perry (@fuzzydeduction) March 25, 2016 Question: Why are fags allowed to use male bathrooms?
Jim Screechie (@WaHeName) October 27, 2014@Holden114 I don t really see why.
Gay men can use bathrooms that little boys use.
Is there something wrong with that?
Brandt (@UrbanAchievr) May 13, 2016 I remember reading about how people were afraid gay men would rape boys in men s bathrooms.
The news media must be covering up those reports I m fejimanz (@fejimanz) May 9, 2016why are gay men allowed in men bathrooms, they like men, why they in the same bathroom?
Now the guys that cut it off, want another bathroom ASTRONAUT (@astronaut_____1) May 4, 2016 I propose we also put in bathrooms strictly for lesbians and gay men.
Idk like if im peeing and a lesbian just walks in idk man Cat (@pleasecatcallme) April 26, 2016You hate fighting off unwanted advances?
Try being a woman.This is why fags should not share bathrooms with us straight guys ?
https://t.co/mdV3kliW6v Mist (@HolyChanteuse) April 19, 2016Apparently, beaches should also be off limits to gay people: @zekestokes said he s gonna lead a boycott against Myrtle Beach Bc of trans bathrooms.
Haha.
Like we care.
Who wants fags at the beach?
Gator Chomper (@Swampnut) May 3, 2016Ironically, Cain is a Tea Party candidate and he s about as anti-gay as his opponent, Rep. Wayne Smith, 72.
Cain is married to a woman.
I suppose in most people s eyes, that makes it safe for him to pee.Featured image via Briscoe Cain Facebook page.
