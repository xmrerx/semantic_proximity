At this point, America has become quite familiar with Donald Trump and his antics.
He continues to show his racism and misogyny on a level unseen in the US political world since Jim Crow existed, when politicians were unchecked by political correctness.
In his latest showdown with Megyn Kelly, Trump has decided to turn tail and run from the debates.
Whoopi Goldberg, however, has a message for Trump.
On ABC s the view, she said: You re a coward, Donald.
You re a coward.
If you re gonna be President of the United States, you have to go and talk to the people you may not like.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZAlM_vT_frc] Coward is definitely the right word to describe Trump, not only for skipping the debates but for being too afraid of doing what s right.
Since the controversy with Kelly, tens of thousands of male Trump supporters have taken to twitter to call Kelly some of the worst names.
Bitch, for example, was tweeted 423 times and counting.
Trump doesn t have the courage nor the integrity to tell his supporters to have more class.
In addition, Trump has shown a tendency of being afraid of strong women besides Kelly so hes reacts stupidly on multiple occasions.Joy Behar of the View pointed out that when women criticize him, Trump has a tendency to go ballistic.
The minute a woman does something to him, it makes his hair stand up straight, said Behar, describing Trump s harsh reaction to her criticism of his hair as opposed to his silence when men criticized him.Referring to Kelly s questions and statements to Trump during the debates, Goldberg said: She didn t just attack Trump with just stuff she made up.
This is stuff she said back to him.
This is stuff he said and he couldn t take it.
She got under his skin and he cut and ran.
Only a coward cuts and runs.
It s been apparent for a while that Trump is a certified coward.Featured image via Wikimedia Commons
