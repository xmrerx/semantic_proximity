paris ( reuters ) - the leaders of the european union s remaining 27 member states are very likely to approve this week the deal struck by their chief negotiator with britain and move to a second phase of exit talks , a french presidency source said on wednesday .
eu leaders are almost certain to judge on friday that sufficient progress has been made on the rights of citizens , the brexit divorce bill and the irish border to allow negotiations to move to the next phase .
the eu executive recommended last week that leaders approve the start of trade talks .
