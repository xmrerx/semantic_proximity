There s no lengths lying conservative media won t go to in order to try and defend their golden boy, Trump, and anyone around him.
Take Jeff Sessions, for example.
Sessions was just caught lying under oath about contact with Russian officials during the campaign, and conservatives are desperate to figure out how to defend him.
Take the following tweet by the origin of fake news, Fox: Democratic lawmakers who met with Russian Ambassador.
pic.twitter.com/NEmwYLa790 Fox News (@FoxNews) March 3, 2017That s right conservatives are trying to say that since Democrats have talked to Russians before, there s no wrongdoing here.Except that awkward part where none of the pictured Democrats lied under oath about it.Except that SUPER awkward part where Democrats weren t part of a presidential campaign that benefited from, if not colluded with, Russian hacking and attempts to derail our 2016 electoral process.Users on Twitter are calling Fox News out for this incredibly misleading bullsh*t: @FoxNews Which ones then lied about the meeting under oath?
Kevin M. Kruse (@KevinMKruse) March 3, 2017 @FoxNews how many are in #Trumps cabinet or are asked to lead national security?!?!
Mike Wickett (@mikewickett) March 3, 2017 @FoxNews I m confused, which of these people was nominated for a cabinet position and then lied under oath?
Buttered Scones (@tedlangley) March 3, 2017 @FoxNews again, must have context.
Trumps team met with Russia during height of election hacking.
Please do not make these look the same Mike Battuello (@Mikebattuello) March 3, 2017 @FoxNews Again.
It s not against the law to meet with foreign ambassadors.
It s against the LAW to lie under oath about such meetings.
Kathie (@Anastaisastweet) March 3, 2017 @FoxNews ok, but did they lie under oath about it?
We need an independent prosecutor to sort this out; party line & divided nation need ans!
Josh Marcus (@MoshuaJarcus) March 3, 2017 @FoxNews How many of these were questioned in confirmation hearings and lied?
Dipti Khanna (@DKhanna77) March 3, 2017 @FoxNews and precisely which ones lied about it under oath.
