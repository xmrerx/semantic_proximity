Among them is Kentucky Rep. Thomas Massie, who was re-elected in November with 71 percent of the vote, making a stand against Trump a relatively safe bet.
He has categorized himself as a staunch ideological conservative and can tell voters he was standing up for what he believed in, said Stephen Voss, a political science professor at the University of Kentucky.
The White House could send a bunch of money to go after him but there s no reason to think the Republican voters would buy into a fight on this.
Massie tweeted Wednesday that he d switched his vote from no to hell no.

Rep. Mark Meadows, chair of the caucus, did not face a primary challenger and was re-elected to his seat last year with more than 64 percent of the vote, slightly higher than Trump s total in his western North Carolina district.
