Donald Trump should not be lashing out like this.
It s embarrassing.After months of boycotts and protests, Nordstrom and several other retailers have dropped Ivanka Trump s product line from their inventory.The Grab Your Wallet campaign has only been growing since Trump won the election the Russians rigged in November.
The campaign began as a protest against Trump over his grab them by the p*ssy remark.
This is a sharply divisive subject, Nordstrom co-president Pete Nordstrom said.
No matter what we do, we are going to end up disappointing some of our customers.
Every single brand we offer is evaluated on their results if people don t buy it, we won t sell it.
And so, Americans across the country listened and stopped buying from Nordstrom, forcing them to make a choice.
They can die as a company defending the Trump brand, or they can survive by dumping it.Nordstrom made the smart choice, and now Donald Trump is pissed.My daughter Ivanka has been treated so unfairly by @Nordstrom.
She is a great person always pushing me to do the right thing!
Terrible!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017If Trump didn t want his daughter s business to be negatively affected by his campaign and presidency, he should have stayed out of it to begin with.
Now his family is paying the price and Twitter isn t shedding a single tear.
@realDonaldTrump you put the brief in briefing.

Erich McElroy (@erichmcelroy) February 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump are you saying you usually choose the wrong thing and she stops you?

Jeffrey Guterman (@JeffreyGuterman) February 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump @Nordstrom is there a point when you re going to start acting like a President?

@realDonaldTrump @Nordstrom yes the president just publicly bitched about his daughter losing income streams Roland Scahill (@rolandscahill) February 8, 2017Donald Trump should not be using the office of the presidency to attack a company for dropping his daughter s product line.
That s a clear conflict of interest.But Nordstrom is far from being the only retailer to ditch Ivanka.
As Raw Story points outs, Home Shopping Network, Retailers Belk, Neiman Marcus, Jet and ShopStyle have all dropped her this week.Donald Trump is truly pathetic.
It s one thing to criticize companies for outsourcing jobs, it something entirely different, however, to criticize a business for deciding what products to sell.
And Trump is definitely trying to punish Nordstrom for not continuing to sell Ivanka s product line.
Of course, Ivanka s products are made overseas, which makes Trump a hypocrite, too.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images
