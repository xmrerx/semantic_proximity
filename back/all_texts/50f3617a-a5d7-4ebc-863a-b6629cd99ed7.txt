When Ben Carson was asked about the multiple women accusing Donald Trump of sexually assaulting them, he proceeded to completely freak the f*ck out.Appearing on MSNBC s Morning Joe, Ben Carson was questioned about the long list of women alleging that they were sexually assaulted by the billionaire GOP nominee.
BBC reporter Katty Kay pressed Carson, asking whether or not he thinks the women accusing Trump are lying.
Infuriated, Carson cut her off.
That s your characterization because you need to characterize it that way to make me the bad guy, Carson said.When Kay didn t drop the subject and continued to pursue the matter of Trump s sexual assaults, the former presidential candidate cut her off yet again.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Stop.
Can you turn her mic off please?
Turn her mic off so I can talk.
Host Joe Scarborough laughed and said that no, her microphone would not be shut off.
Carson, visibly frustrated, continued in his tailspin.
