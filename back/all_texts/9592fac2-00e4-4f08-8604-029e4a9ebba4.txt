Alexander McCoy, a veteran of the U.S. Marines, helped led a protest outside Donald Trump s Trump Tower on Monday.
The event was organized to shame Trump after recent reports revealed that he lied when he said he had raised $6 million to support veterans earlier in the year.In the video, McCoy explained that the episode shows that Trump has not shown any honor in his actions or his policies.
He added, he would make a reckless and dangerous commander-in-chief, and as Americans we would be fundamentally less safe with Donald Trump as president.
McCoy also referred to Trump as a fraud.
The veterans assembled outside the New York City landmark to raise awareness of what Trump has done.Former Marine Alexander McCoy and Army veteran Perry O Brien, who led the demonstration, have repeatedly said that Trump overstated the amount of money he raised at a Jan. 28 fundraiser for veterans causes to inflate his reputation among Republicans.
(Of) the $6 million that Donald Trump supposedly raised for veterans charities, a significant portion of that money either never existed or it just vanished, O Brien, 34, who served in Afghanistan for over three years, told the Daily News as his fellow veterans and their supporters touted signs reading Vets Vs Hate.
Trump put on the so-called fundraiser on the night he chose to skip out on the Republican primary debate because he was afraid of tough questioning from Fox News moderator Megyn Kelly.
Trump initially claimed the event had raised $6 million, and spent the next few days praising himself for the accomplishment, as part of the publicity drive for his campaign during the primaries.Subsequent reports showed that the money raised was about half that amount, according to the Daily News.
Some veterans groups told the paper that they haven t received any of the money Trump promised in his first, extravagant claims.Featured image via YouTube
