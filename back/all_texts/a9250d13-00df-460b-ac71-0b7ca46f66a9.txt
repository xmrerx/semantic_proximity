OSLO (Reuters) - Ex-Bosnian Serb general Rakto Mladic s conviction for war crimes did not come as a surprise, Serbia s prime minister said on Wednesday.
We need to look to the future, so we finally have a stable country, Ana Brnabic told reporters during a visit to Oslo.
We need to leave the past behind, she said.
A U.N. tribunal convicted Mladic of genocide and crimes against humanity for orchestrating massacres and ethnic cleansing during Bosnia s war and sentenced him to life in prison.
