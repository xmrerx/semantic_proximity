washington ( reuters ) - donald trump on wednesday rowed back statements that women who sought abortions under a proposed ban should be punished .
“ if congress were to pass legislation making abortion illegal and the federal courts upheld this legislation , or any state were permitted to ban abortion under state and federal law , the doctor or any other person performing this illegal act upon a woman would be held legally responsible , not the woman , ” trump said in a statement .
it contradicted an earlier statement during an msnbc town hall appearance when he said in response to questions from the moderator that woman should face some form of punishment .
