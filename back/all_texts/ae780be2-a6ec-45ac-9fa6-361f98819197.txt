Within hours of the death of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Republicans made it clear that there would be no nominee confirmed while President Obama is in office.
The party that prides themselves on defending the constitution has once again shown that they ve never read it.Cries of this president hasn t earned the right and we owe it to the country to block any Obama nominee were common themes among the party of spite.
While they certainly have the power in the senate to block the president s nominees, they don t have the power to stop him from trying.And try he shall.
The president gave a moving tribute to Justice Scalia Saturday, calling his service historic and applauding him as an incredible man and a dedicated public servant.
While those of us who know better would have preferred words like incredible bigot and person living in the past, the president showed what Scalia s own party couldn t afford him: Respect for him and his family in their time of grief.They opted instead to politicize yet another death, assuring their base immediately that they would never allow a secret Muslim (no they didn t say it but if you follow their base you know they re thinking it) to serve on the United States Supreme Court.
What it boils down to is fear.
Republicans fear they will lose their conservative voice on the court.
They have already seen the law prevail in the cases of gay marriage and the Affordable Care Act subsidies when the 4-4 tie of liberal versus conservative was again broken by centrist Justice Kennedy.
If President Obama, or any Democrat for that matter, gets a nominee confirmed, the balance will swing toward the left and the demise of the reason so many of their party are in office to begin with: Citizens United.Watch the president s remarks below:Featured image from screen capture
