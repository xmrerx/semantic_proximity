cairo ( reuters ) - egyptian security forces have killed 11 suspected militants in a shootout near the sinai , the interior ministry said on tuesday , just days after more than 300 people were killed in an attack on a mosque in north sinai .
the shootout occurred during a raid on a suspected militant hideout in the sinai-bordering province of ismailia , the ministry said in a statement .
it said the area was being used by militants to train and store weapons and logistical equipment for attacks in north sinai .
militants detonated a bomb and then gunned down fleeing worshippers in last friday s mosque attack , the deadliest in egypt s modern history .
no group has claimed responsibility for the assault , but egypt s public prosecutor linked islamic state militants to the attack , citing interviews with wounded survivors who said militants brandished an islamic state flag .
six suspected militants were arrested as part of the operations , which also included a raid on an additional suspected militant hideout in the 10th of ramadan , an area just outside of cairo .
since 2013 egyptian security forces have battled an islamic state affiliate in the mainly desert region of north sinai , where militants have killed hundreds of police and soldiers .
the interior ministry statement on tuesday did not directly link the suspected militants targeted in the operations to last week s mosque attack .
