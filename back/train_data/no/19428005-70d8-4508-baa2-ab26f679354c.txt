bamako ( reuters ) - rival tuareg groups said on thursday they had signed a peace deal in northern mali , raising hopes of an end to years of fighting and broken ceasefires .
senior members of the separatist cma and their pro-government opponents known as the platform said they had settled their differences in the arid region , which is still reeling from a 2012 islamist insurgency .
past deals have fizzled as goodwill faded - though observers said they were optimistic , as the pact had been signed in bamako on wednesday night under the watch of the united nations , government officials and international mediators .
we assure that in future we will respect all the commitments we have made before you and before the international community , senior platform official fahad ag almahamoud said on state radio .
cma official bilal ag cherif echoed the message , saying : all parties must respect this document in their behavior and their everyday actions .
rival tuareg groups have fought over territory and politics for years .
more recent clashes have complicated efforts to counter al qaeda-linked militants who took the north in 2012 before a french-led intervention pushed them back .
the peace deal followed a temporary ceasefire agreed last month which allowed the regional governor to return to the city of kidal .
this seems like a more permanent agreement ( following the ceasefire ) and could hold for now , said andrew lebovich , of the european council on foreign relations .
it depends on the internal calculations of each group and if people are simply using the agreement to rebuild their forces .
