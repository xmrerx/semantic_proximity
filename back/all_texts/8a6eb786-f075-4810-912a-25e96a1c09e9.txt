Hundreds of Universities across the nation are encouraging students to report other students or even professors who use what they deem to be offensive or even impolite verbiage.
The investigations are being done by Bias Response Team ROBERT SHIBLEY ON WHAT S GOING ON AT ALL THESE COLLEGES;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_lpVv-fShg&feature=youtu.beVia Washington Examiner: Over the past year, I surveyed more than 230 such reporting systems for the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education and asked dozens of schools for records about their Bias Response Teams.
What I found is detailed in a new report describing how universities broadly define bias to include virtually any speech, protected or not, that subjectively offends anyone.
On many campuses, administrators are called upon to referee whether speech is polite.
The threat to free speech is a real and present issue in America today as some Americans are putting a higher premium on political correctness than the right to freedom of speech.The threat to expressive rights isn t confined to speech from the Left or the Right.
Bias reporting systems are being used to report all kinds of speech.At Appalachian State University, students have reported on one another for messages that were pro-Trump as well as calling Trump a RACIST.
The former were reported by students as hate speech, the latter politically biased slander that was unlawful.
While students at Ohio State University reported each other for comparing Hillary Clinton to Hitler, students at Texas Tech were telling administrators that the Black Student Union s tweets in support of the Black Lives Matter movement offended them.
Meanwhile, the University of Oregon thought it define community expectations to students who complained about the oppression.Source: Washington Examiner
