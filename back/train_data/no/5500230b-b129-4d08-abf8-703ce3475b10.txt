( reuters ) - the pace slowed in the third week of enrollment for 2018 obamacare individual insurance as nearly 800,000 people signed up through the federal government website healthcare.gov , down about 75,000 people from the previous week , a u.s. government agency reported on wednesday .
there was an increase , however , in the number of new consumers to the program created by former president barack obama , to 220,323 from 208,397 in the previous week , the u.s. department of health and human services said .
republican president donald trump and lawmakers are trying to undo obama ’ s health law but do not have enough votes to repeal it and so must continue to run the insurance program , which offers income-based subsidies .
uncertainty over its future drove 2018 monthly premiums up more than 30 percent on average as insurers such as anthem inc , centene corp and molina healthcare sought to cover higher costs .
the nonpartisan congressional budget office has estimated that 11 million will enroll in 2018 , up from 2017 ’ s 10 million , even as the period for sign-ups has been cut in half to six weeks and will end on dec. 15 .
total sign-ups for obamacare individual insurance in the 39 states that use healthcare.gov reached 2.28 million during the first three weeks of enrollment .
the figures do not include enrollment in washington , d.c. or the 11 states including new york and california that run their own enrollment and websites .
among the states using healthcare.gov with the highest number of individuals signing up were florida , 498,168 ; texas , 271,737 ; north carolina , 138,932 ; georgia , 119,968 ; and pennsylvania , 101,286 , the agency said .
