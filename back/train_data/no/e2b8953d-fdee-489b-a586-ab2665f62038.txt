seoul ( reuters ) - south korean president moon jae-in said on friday north korea s latest launch of a missile over japan will only result in further diplomatic and economic isolation for the north , and officials said moon had also warned of possible new threats .
president moon ordered officials to closely analyze and prepare for new possible north korean threats like emp ( electro-magnetic pulse ) and biochemical attacks , moon s spokesman park su-hyun told a briefing .
north korea said earlier this month it was developing a hydrogen bomb that can carry out an emp attack .
experts disagree on whether the north would have the capability to mount such an attack , which would involve setting off a bomb in the atmosphere that could cause major damage to power grids and other infrastructure .
