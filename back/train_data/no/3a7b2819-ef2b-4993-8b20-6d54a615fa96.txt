nothing says thanksgiving or family like a room full of brain washed liberals sitting around the dinner table talking about ways to strip americans of their constitutional rights this thanksgiving , the obama administration wants americans to talk about why congress won t pass more gun control but not about obama s foreign policy failures.during the white house press briefing , press secretary josh earnest continued to press a narrative set up by gun control activists in response to the terrorist attacks in paris .
as people sitting around the thanksgiving table talking about these issues as they should and i m sure they will all across the country , i hope that s a question that will be raised and asked by members around the table , earnest said , referring to a bill supported by democrat to ban people on the no-fly list from purchasing a gun.earnest attributed opposition to the bill from republicans and some democrats to fear of the national rifle association.but as breitbart news gun reporter awr hawkins has noted , the campaign is misguided as the no-fly list is imprecise .
a law based on that list could would block innocent individuals from exercising their second amendment right to purchase firearms.via : breitbart newsand for those who choose to take the pro-american side of the second amendment argument , here s a little video you might want to share with your guests :
