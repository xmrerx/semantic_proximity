riyadh ( reuters ) - saudi arabia s public prosecutor issued an arrest warrant on saturday for a twitter user who called for anyone who supports women driving to be killed , days after a royal decree ended a long-time ban on women taking the wheel .
the twitter user , who was not named , was alleged to have referred to men who support women driving as cuckolds who should be killed , according to state-linked asharq al-awsat newspaper .
the prosecutor s announcement comes two days after a separate arrest warrant was issued for a man who threatened in a video clip posted online to attack women drivers .
many saudis welcomed tuesday s announcement by king salman lifting the ban by next year , but others expressed opposition online or in quiet conversations after decades of support for the policy by prominent clerics .
in the statement , the prosecutor vowed to monitor for threats of abuse and pursue cases against those who incite attacks against society and violations of the rights of others .
