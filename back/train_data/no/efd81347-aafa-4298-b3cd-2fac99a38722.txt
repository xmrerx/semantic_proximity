nah nah nah nah hey hey hey good bye support for hillary clinton among democratic voters under 50 has tanked in the past month , according to a new monmouth university poll.in december , she led fellow democratic presidential contender sen. bernie sanders , i-vt. , 52 % -35 % in that demographic .
now she trails him 39 % -52 % .she also has lost significant support among democratic women , with her lead over sanders shrinking from 45 points to 19 points in that group .
her support went from 64 % -19 % last month to 54 % -35 % now.clinton still beats sanders 52 % -37 % overall among democrats , though sanders gains have cut into her lead , monmouth found .
and she has considerable support among important primary voting blocs .
voters over 50 prefer clinton 64 % -24 % , and black and latino voters side with her 71 % -21 % .
with a shrinking margin , a strong showing by sanders in iowa and new hampshire could cut clinton s national lead even more , said patrick murray , director of the monmouth survey .
however , he would still have to overcome clinton s demographic advantage in the ensuing contests .
that means in places like south carolina , nevada and super tuesday states in the south where blacks and latinos make up a sizable portion of the electorate .
murray points out that the same situation helped president obama beat clinton .
it looks like the demographic that hurt clinton in 2008 may be what helps her in 2016 , he said.last week , sanders campaign announced it was launching a tour of historically black colleges and universities with stops in a number of southern states.the monmouth measurement of sanders s support among young people resembles the results of a recent usa today/rock the vote survey that found he leads clinton 46 % -35 % , among millennial democrats and independents .
