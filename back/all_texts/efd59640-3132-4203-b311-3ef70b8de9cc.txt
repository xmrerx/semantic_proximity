Just underneath that post, a man left a video of students at Vo-Tech shouting white power while holding a Donald Trump campaign sign.Watch: There are also incidents reported of students calling other students their slaves.
Parents of York County School of Technology Students wrote on Facebook that, There have been reports that Trump s presidential win was announced at school today amidst chants of white power.
That white students referred to other races as their slaves, and at some points even spit on those students.
I think we should all have a chat tonight with our students, whether they were participating, appalled bystanders, or victims, the statement continued.
This whole situation is absolutely horrible.
Another student said her breasts were grabbed by another student who said it was his right.
Some parents are pulling their children out of school.Other schools are reporting racial incidents as well in Michigan and Minnesota after Trump s victory, according to Raw Story.In Royal Oak, Michigan, a group of students started yelling build the wall in the middle school s cafeteria.
Parents are now concerned for their children s safety.These are the children of Trump supporters and they taught their kids to hate.
But don t call them deplorables because that s mean and hurts their feelings.
Trump was a bigot when he was a businessman.
The alleged billionaire was a bigot while he was the GOP nominee and previous to that.
And as President, he will continue to be a bigot.#NotMyPresident.Featured image via screen capture
