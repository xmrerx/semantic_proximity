hamat , lebanon ( reuters ) - the united states delivered two a-29 super tucano light attack aircraft to lebanon s army on tuesday , a sign of continued u.s. support despite israeli accusations that the lebanese military is controlled by hezbollah .
the planes will be used as armed observation aircraft , a security source in lebanon said , and represent a big upgrade for the lebanese armed forces ( laf ) .
earlier this month , u.s. ally israel said hezbollah , an iran-backed shi ite muslim movement , had gained control over lebanon s conventional military , a charge the lebanese army denies .
hezbollah , which was designated as a terrorist group by the u.s. state department in 1997 , last fought israel in a war in 2006 .
lebanon is formally in a state of war with israel .
the significant increase in laf combat capability that this aircraft represents will ensure that the laf will remain a national unifying force , a bulwark against extremism and terrorism , said u.s .
ambassador elizabeth richard .
the islamic state militant group held a pocket of land straddling lebanon s border with syria until august .
over the last decade , the u.s. government has invested over $ 1.5 billion in training and equipment , and has trained over 32,000 lebanese troops , richard said .
we have recently announced another $ 120 million in foreign military financing , which brings the total investment in the laf to over $ 160 million just this year , she said .
the united states will deliver another four super tucanos to lebanon .
the two new aircraft - which have advanced combat and surveillance capabilities - will make a qualitative leap in improving the aerial capabilities of the laf , said lebanese army commander general joseph aoun .
