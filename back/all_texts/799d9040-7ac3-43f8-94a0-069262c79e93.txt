WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan said on Wednesday that any legislation to address the roughly 800,000 undocumented people in the United States covered by the so-called Dreamers program would also need to also address border security.
“It’s only reasonable and fitting that we also address the root cause of the problem, which is borders that are not sufficiently controlled, while we address this very real and very human problem that’s right in front of us,” Ryan told reporters of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.
