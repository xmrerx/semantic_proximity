a world war ii veteran attended the trump rally today at the hilbert circle theater in indianapolis .
the veteran asked donald trump and bobby knight to discuss leadership .
here s the great response from bobby knight : that was very nice of you to say that .
i appreciate that .
but let me tell you another thing about mr. trump .
and i think we re a little bit alike in that regard .
if we re involved in something that we want to win , and particularly something that s necessary .
if there s something out there that we need to win , we re going to try and beat your ass every time we can .
