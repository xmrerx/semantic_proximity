beirut ( reuters ) - the head of iran s revolutionary guards said on wednesday that the united states should experience painful responses following president donald trump s harsh criticism of tehran at the united nations .
in his first speech to the u.n. general assembly on tuesday trump called iran a corrupt dictatorship and accused it of supporting terrorism and destabilizing the middle east .
he also hinted he might not recertify a 2015 nuclear deal with tehran when it comes up for a mid-oct. deadline .
taking a definitive stand against trump is only the beginning of the path , said general mohammad ali jafari , according to sepah news , the news site of the revolutionary guards .
what is strategically important is that america witnesses more painful responses in the actions , behavior and decisions that iran takes in the coming months .
in recent months , tensions have ramped up between iran and the united states in the gulf , with both sides accusing each other of provocative maneuvers with military vessels .
jafari urged iranian president hassan rouhani to deliver a definitive response to trump in his speech at the united nations on wednesday .
with the successive and exhausting defeats that the americans have faced in the region from iran , it s natural that their nervous system and coherence of thought have fallen apart , sepah news quoted jafari as saying .
in tuesday s speech , trump called the 2015 nuclear deal , negotiated between iran and six world powers , and backed by his predecessor barack obama , an embarrassment .
under the deal , iran agreed to curb its atomic program in return for easing economic sanctions .
