Donald Trump just attacked an American car company and got humiliated in response.In his first tweet of the day on Tuesday, Trump accused General Motors of manufacturing the Chevy Cruze in Mexico and shipping it across the border tax-free to sell in the United States.
He then threatened them to make the car here or pay a huge tax penalty.General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border.
Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017There s just one problem.
Most Chevy Cruzes are made here in the United States by American workers.General Motors fired back at Trump in a statement.
General Motors manufactures the Chevrolet Cruze sedan in Lordstown, Ohio.
All Chevrolet Cruze sedans sold in the U.S. are built in GM s assembly plant in Lordstown, Ohio.
GM builds the Chevrolet Cruze hatchback for global markets in Mexico, with a small number sold in the U.S.
But as a result of Trump s accusations and threats General Motors stock price tumbled briefly and then recovered.
Keep in mind that General Motors was nearly wiped out of existence at the beginning of the Great Recession, which would have cost thousands of Americans their jobs.
Trump s attack on General Motors could have harmed the company in a way that would have harmed American workers he the stock price fallen more than it did.And Americans were unforgiving on Twitter in response to Trump s bullshit and even called out the fact that GM CEO Mary Barra is one of Trump s economic advisers.
@realDonaldTrump attacks on individuals companies are crony capitalism, with potentially devastating consequences.

Next time Trump decides to attack an American company he should do his homework first and then look in the mirror because his company has most of their products manufactured in China and Mexico, which make Trump the biggest hypocrite in America.Featured image via Twitter
