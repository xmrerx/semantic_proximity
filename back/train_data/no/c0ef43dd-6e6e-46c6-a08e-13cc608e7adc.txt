donald trump showed up to vote in new york city with his wife melania and hilarity ensued.when the trump s walked through the doors they were greeted by a round of boos and jeers .
clearly , new york voters are not trump fans.but trump s day got even worse when he tried to sneak a peek at melania s ballot , apparently just making sure she votes for him.well , a photo of the moment was captured and now the internet is having a field day mocking the republican nominee.this picture is everything .
