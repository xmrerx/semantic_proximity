rome ( reuters ) - the leader of one of italy s biggest political parties , the northern league , criticized magistrates on thursday after the genoa court froze several of the bloc s bank accounts .
matteo salvini , speaking to reporters at the lower house of parliament , said five of the party s bank accounts were frozen on thursday , following a july conviction of party founder umberto bossi and others of illegal use of party funds .
the court in genoa in northern italy has accepted a request by prosecutors in the fraud case to preventively freeze the accounts , a source close to the matter told reuters .
the magistrates are trying to outlaw a political party , salvini said .
they re trying to stop the advance of the league , which has reached a historic high .
salvini said he would meet with the party s lawyers on friday to discuss how to fight the seizure .
bossi is no longer in frontline politics , but he remains an influential figure in the party .
in july , the genoa court said bossi had used party funds to pay for family expenses .
the ruling is being appealed and is not definitive .
the league would win 15 percent of the vote if an election were held now , recent polls show , which is about three times higher than it faired in the 2014 european elections .
that would make it the country s third most-popular party , and a national vote is due early next year .
as hundreds of thousands of boat migrants have arrived in italy in the past three years , the opposition northern league has attacked the government s and the european union s handling of the immigration crisis .
at the same time , salvini has tried to broaden the appeal of the party , which was founded to protest rome s funneling of taxpayer money to the under-developed south .
