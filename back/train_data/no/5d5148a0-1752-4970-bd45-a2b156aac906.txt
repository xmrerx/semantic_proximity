i am a student of history so i tend to actually be familiar with many of these episodes that have been mentioned .
i am the first one to acknowledge that america s application to concern around human rights has not always been consistent .
and , i m certainly mindful that there are dark chapters in our own history in which we have not always observed the principles and ideals upon which the country was founded .
just a few weeks ago i was in selma , alabama celebrating the 50th anniversary of a march across a bridge that resulted in horrific violence and the reason i was there and the reason it was a celebration is because it was a triumph of human spirit in which ordinary people without resort to violence were able to overcome systematic segregation .
there voices were heard and our country changed .
america never makes a claim about being perfect , we do make a claim about being open to change .
