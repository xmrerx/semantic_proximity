beijing ( reuters ) - china said on wednesday it will continue to talk to myanmar about a controversial stalled dam project , after myanmar s new energy minister cast doubt over the scheme .
valued at $ 3.6 billion , the myitsone dam project in the north of the former burma has been a sticking point between the two countries since the previous military-backed government suspended work in 2011 .
reuters reported in april that officials in china and myanmar were discussing alternative options that would allow myanmar to scrap the massive project amid environmental concerns .
big hydropower dams are not a priority in myanmar s strategy to tackle chronic power shortages , energy minister win khaing told reuters on tuesday .
speaking in beijing , chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman hua chunying said china s position on the myitsone dam had not changed , which was that china had always upheld deepening cooperation with myanmar on a mutually beneficial basis .
the myitsone hydropower station is a commercial cooperation project both sides have already agreed upon , and has already been through a complete approval process , hua told a daily news briefing .
we will continue to maintain communication with the myanmar side and proactively and appropriately handle the problems or difficulties which arise during cooperation on the project , to allow relevant cooperation to continue to develop healthily and stably , she added .
the proposed dam , on the upper reaches of the ayeyarwady river in kachin state , would have sent most of its power across the border to china s yunnan province , which now has an oversupply of electricity as it switches to less energy-intensive industries amid an economic slowdown .
a government panel set up in august 2016 was still reviewing the dam , myanmar s energy minister said , adding the government was in dialogue with the chinese operator , state power investment corp subsidiary yunnan international power investment .
