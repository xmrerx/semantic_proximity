abuja ( reuters ) - the vast majority of almost 2 million nigerians driven from their homes by the conflict with boko haram can not return because of a lack of security , an aid agency said on wednesday .
about 1.8 million people have been displaced in nigeria by the conflict with the islamist insurgency , which has left at least 20,000 dead and shows little sign of ending as it drags into its ninth year .
the norwegian refugee council ( nrc ) said in a report that 86 percent of internally displaced people were not ready to return home in the immediate future .
insecurity is cited by 84 percent of them as the main reason for wanting to stay put , it said .
only about six in 10 people said they wanted to return to their villages at some point , but could not do so now , the nrc report said .
many of the displaced say they have tried to return home , only to be forced to flee back to safer camps and cities because of continued attacks by boko haram and general insecurity .
while the end game is for communities to return home , the unfortunate truth is that pushing people back now will have harmful consequences , jan egeland , nrc secretary general , said in a statement .
although boko haram in recent months has increased its attacks on displaced people , they still feel safer in camps and urban centers than in their communities , said egeland .
the nigerian government and military have repeatedly said the insurgency has been defeated .
despite that , boko haram has killed 381 civilians in nigeria and cameroon since the beginning of april , more than double the amount dead in the preceding five months , amnesty international said last month .
the nrc survey did not take into account the roughly 200,000 refugees who have fled to neighboring countries such as cameroon , chad and niger .
the humanitarian crisis in northern nigeria is now one of the biggest in the world , with $ 1 billion needed to fund relief efforts in 2017 , the united nations says .
