london ( reuters ) - british lawmakers on tuesday voted in favor of legislation to sever political , financial and legal ties with the european union at its second reading , allowing the bill to move to the next stage of the parliamentary process .
the opposition labour party , which said several clauses in the legislation amount to a power grab by government , opposed the bill but would have needed to convince eu supporters in the governing conservatives to side with them to vote it down .
after more than eight hours of debate on monday , lawmakers voted by 326 to 290 in favor of the eu withdrawal bill , which will now go on to face days of line-by-line scrutiny .
