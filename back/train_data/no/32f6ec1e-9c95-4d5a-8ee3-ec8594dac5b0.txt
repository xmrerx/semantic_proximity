moscow ( reuters ) - attackers set fire to a building used by a russian director whose film about the last czar s romance with a ballerina has been condemned by religious conservatives , russian news agencies reported on thursday .
a molotov cocktail was thrown in through a window , igniting a fire in a building in the city of st petersburg that houses , among other organizations , the studio of director alexei uchitel , the news agencies reported .
the fire caused minor damage to a part of the building occupied by a different film studio , lendok .
uchitel s forthcoming film , called matilda , is about a reputed love affair between tsar nicholas ii , before his coronation , and ballerina mathilde kschessinska .
some conservatives have called for the film to be banned , saying it besmirches the reputation of the late czar .
the russian orthodox church has designated him a saint .
he and his family were executed soon after the 1917 bolshevik revolution .
i can not think of any motivation ( for the attack ) other than it being a reaction to alexei uchitel making the film mathilda , tass news agency quoted lendok director alexei telnov as saying .
the attack resulted in broken windows and a burned window sill in a part of lendok s premises used for movie viewings , concerts and conferences .
it was a miracle there was not a big fire , the agency quoted telnov as saying .
a spokesman for the st petersburg police told reuters officers were making checks after fire and smoke were spotted at the studio s address .
an assistant to telnov said he was busy making a film so could not comment .
uchitel s representatives could not be reached for comment .
uchitel s movie is to be released in october .
natalia poklonskaya , a member of the russian parliament , has said she asked prosecutors to have the film s release stopped , saying it would insult the religious feeling of believers .
