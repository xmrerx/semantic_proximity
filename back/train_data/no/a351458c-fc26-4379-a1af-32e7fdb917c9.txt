to watch a black comedian with a net worth of $ 70 million in a country with a majority white population whine about his victimhood is just pathetic .
and for anyone who thinks it s okay for rock to spew this kind of hatred for whites in a video because he s a comedian , you may want to watch this video ( especially starting at the 3:10 mark ) because there s nothing funny about anything he has to say : my dad used to say : you can t beat white people at anything nothing .
but you can knock em out . '
in my neighborhood , there s like 3- 4 black people in my neighborhood in alpine .
it s me , gary sheffield , mary jane blige , patrick ewing .
hall of famer , hall of famer , greatest r & b singer of our time .
who lives next to me ?
what s the white man next to me ?
he s a dentist .
he didn t invent anything , he s just a dentist .
that s what america is .
( so , going to college and becoming a successful dentist is something that was given to him ? )
tell the third generation white coal miner about his white privilege chris .
tell the white single mom flipping burgers by day and cleaning hotel rooms by night about her white privilege chris .
maybe , just maybe , if you took off your racist goggles for 5 minutes , you might see that blacks don t have the market on victimhood .
and if you think anything has changed since victim chris rock made this racist video , here is a video he made about the confederate flag 3 years ago .
watch as he attempts to mock every white person ( or cracker as he calls them ) .
the best line is when he calls al sharpton martin luther king with a perm :
