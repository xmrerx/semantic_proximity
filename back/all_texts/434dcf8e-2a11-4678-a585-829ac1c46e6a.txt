WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Friday that it will continue to work with the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress on a “legislative piece” to address the Dodd-Frank financial regulation law.
White House spokesman Sean Spicer made the comment as President Donald Trump prepared to sign executive actions to direct a review of the Dodd-Frank Act and put the brakes on a retirement advice rule.
