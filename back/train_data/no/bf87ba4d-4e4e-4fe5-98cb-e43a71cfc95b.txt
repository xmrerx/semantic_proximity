after sarah huckabee sanders read a letter from a little boy to the press ( see below ) , liberal media like the washington post tried to prove that it was fake by using a handwriting analyst ! the liberals try their best to prove the letter is fake : the washington post reported : handwriting and children s cognitive experts were called and asked whether the letter appeared to be written by a child .
we called one ourselves .
two , actually.deborah mccutchen is a professor at the university of wisconsin who studies cognitive processes in reading and writing ability .
she looked at the letter .
she noted that the handful of small spelling errors followed the phonetic sounds of words pitcher instead of picture which would be common in the writing of a young child .
then again , the letter also included a hyphen , which seemed sophisticated for a 9-year-old.sheila lowe , president of the american handwriting analysis foundation , said she didn t see anything that would be inconsistent with a 9-year-old s writing , but she also clarified that she did not specialize in analyzing the writing of children .
she noted that the margins on the right side of the paper were very wide , which can indicate a feeling of concern about the future.it s not fake meet dylan and listen to him and his mother talk about how president trump invited them to the white house for a personal tour : here s the video of sarah huckabee sanders reading dylan s letter on wednesday to the press , who immediately jumped into action to try to prove the letter was fake : dylan aka pickle thank you for your letter and hope to meet you soon !
