wow !
thrill up his leg for obama , chris matthews does a stunning 180 on his support for hillary and boldly calls out any person who is still planning to support her .
he accuses her supporters of being too dainty to stand up for america .
watch him tell his liberal viewers that the only chance we have to turn this nation around is to vote for trump .
if you like the way things are the way they are headed in this country .
if you d like to continue the destruction of our manufacturing base , and the jobs that went with it .
if you like the uncontrollable immigration , if you like the string of stupid wars from iraq to libya to syria .
if you want to say yes to all of that , if you want to keep this all the way it is , fine then vote for hillary clinton .
if you don t like the way things are headed , you ve got a chance to really shake the system at its roots .
if you wake up on election day and it s the same as it is today , if it s the same 4 or 5 or 8 years from now , remember you had a chance really change it up but you were too dainty to do it .

that said , with america facing a potential constitutional crisis after her election , i am not able , under the circumstances we are now facing , to vote for secretary clinton .
