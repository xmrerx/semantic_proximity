Vice President Mike Pence chose to appear on ABC, NBC, CBS and (of course) Fox News this Sunday, but is snubbing CNN following the Trump administration s announcement that surrogates will not appear on networks that do not promote his agenda.CNN reached out to the White House and according to a spokeswoman they were offered Trump s propaganda minister Kellyanne Conway, the woman responsible for alternative facts as an alternative to lies and the infamous Bowling Green Massacre that killed the credibility of anyone remotely associated with Donald Trump.Now CNN could have taken what they were offered, but this is a woman who spends the majority of her time screaming about fake news and attacking anyone who confronts her with anything resembling a fact.
Because of this, CNN did what everyone should do and told Conway to f*ck off.Brian Stelter, host of CNN s Reliable Sources, tweeted Friday that In lieu of Pence, the W.H.
offered Kellyanne Conway for an interview, but CNN declined.

Some critics say TV networks should think twice before booking Kellyanne Conway, he said.
What do you think?

Kellyanne Conway is entertaining, but she is a fact checker s worst nightmare in that they need to rest sometimes.
Limiting her exposure may save lives that would otherwise be lost to exhaustion and sleep deprivation.Featured image via screengrab
