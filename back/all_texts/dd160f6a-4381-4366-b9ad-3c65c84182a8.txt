Teen Vogue writer, Lauren Duca, humiliated Tucker Carlson last week for being a sexist partisan hack, and now she is battling sexist trolls on social media.And, of course, watching a strong independent woman crushing one of their Fox News heroes hurt conservatives feelings so they attacked Duca through social media by sending her rape threats and other demeaning messages designed to scare her.But Duca is fearless and was not about to let some sexist right-wing punks make her cower.So she used her Twitter account to shame them and humiliate them.
Now they can tell Tucker Carlson all about the time they were owned by a woman, too.Example!

Love trumps hate.

@TuckerCarlson is a partisan hack.

Lauren Duca (@laurenduca) December 27, 2016Messages like this positioning sexual assault as a means of keeping women in line make me want to fight even harder.

It s exhausting and wholly unethical.
It will also never be enough to silence me.
