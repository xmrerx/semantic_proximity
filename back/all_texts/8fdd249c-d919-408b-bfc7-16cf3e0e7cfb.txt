History has been made (once again) in the United States.
Hillary Rodham Clinton after decades in public service, has been officially nominated as the first female candidate for President of the United States from a major political party.Sending Secretary Clinton over the 2,383 vote necessary was South Dakota, which awarded 15 delegates to Clinton and 10 to Senator Bernie Sanders, who delivered the acclamation that officially cemented Clinton s nomination.Clinton walked away with 2,838 to Sanders 1,843.
Vermont, which had passed, allowed a final tribute to Sanders, before walking off the convention floor.Just 96 years ago, women (some of them) were given the right to vote.
It wasn t until 1965 when ALL women were truly given the right to vote, freely and democratically.
And today, July 26th 2016, a woman has been nominated to take on a rampant sexist and misogynist.Today is a day America should celebrate.To celebrate this truly historic day, the strongest, most successful women in American politics will speak, including Nancy Pelosi, the first female Speaker of the House, Cecile Richards of Planned Parenthood, Barbara Boxer (Senator from California) as well as a plethora of female Representatives such as Lois Frankel and Kathrine Clark, and feminist activist Lena Dunham.Clinton responded on Twitter with a moving tribute dedicated to little girls all across America:This moment is for every little girl who dreams big.

Trump has made it his mission to demean anyone (including women) who stand in his way.Hillary Clinton will knock him down, and the door will hit him on the way out.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
