WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday that new sanctions imposed against Venezuela were aimed at hobbling the regime of President Nicolas Maduro by restricting the country s access to U.S. debt and equity markets.
We urge those within the regime, including those who have been sanctioned, to distance themselves from the violence and the dictatorship, Mnuchin told reporters at the White House.
He said the sanctions were not aimed at changing leadership in Venezuela.
White House national security adviser H.R.
McMaster said at the same news conference that United States had no plans to take military action in Venezuela, but that President Donald Trump intended to take advantage of a broad range of ... integrated options in the future.
