notice at the beginning of the video where joe biden hops out of his vehicle and briskly makes his way up the stairs for a photo op in front of his childhood home .
the cameras catch his every move .
but where is hillary ?
it s pretty clear that this photo-op for hillary was all orchestrated by hillary and the press .
the cameras were focused solely on biden while hillary limps up the stairs ( the camera s catch her walking towards biden , but only very briefly , as she appears to have some sort of physical disability that s preventing her from walking without assistance ) .
does anyone else think joe biden might be having some serious regrets about not running for president ?
it s somewhat ironic that joe was likely pushed out of the way by the corrupt clinton machine , only to have to cover for # unfit crooked hillary virtually months before the general election in his childhood home .
standing outside the home , clinton embraced the owner with one arm while holding onto the railing on the front walk .
moments later , she pivoted and grabbed the railing with the other hand.then she pivoted back , only to reach for the railing again with the other hand.inside the house , she held onto a chair and moved to lean on the kitchen table.earlier in the day , she was caught on camera stumbling while trying to make her way from the podium during a rally with biden.here s joe biden covering for # unfithillary again during her rally , as he was forced to catch her , as she was falling as she stepped down from the podium : american mirror
