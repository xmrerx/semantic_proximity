MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday U.S. accusations that Russia was responsible for cyber attacks against Democratic Party organizations were “nonsense”, Interfax news agency reported.
“This is again some kind of nonsense.
(Our) website experiences tens of thousands of attacks by hackers every day,” Interfax quoted Peskov as saying.
