Donald Trump gave his first ever apology on Thursday.
It was half-assed and the work of a teleprompter, but regardless, he did manage to spit out the words.
The Republican nominee told the crowd at a rally in Charlotte, North Carolina that he regrets it if he at times has said the wrong thing and caused personal pain.
At the same time, he said that this should all be excused and ignored because too much is at stake.
As you know, I am not a politician.
I have worked in business, creating jobs and rebuilding neighborhoods my entire adult life.
I ve never wanted to learn the language of the insiders, and I ve never been politically correct it takes far too much time, and can often make it more difficult to achieve total victory.Sometimes, in the heat of the debate and speaking on a multitude of issues, you don t choose the right words or you say the wrong thing.
I have done that, and I regret it, particularly where it may have caused personal pain.
Too much is at stake for us to be consumed with these issues.
Trump then attacked the honesty of his rival, Hillary Clinton, and swore that he would never lie and would always put the interests of his voters first.
In this journey, I will never lie to you, Trump promised the crowd.
I will never tell you something I do not believe myself.
I will never put anyone s interests ahead of yours.Trump said that Clinton has proven to be one of the greatest liars of all time, which is particularly ironic coming from a man who was awarded Lie of the Year by Politifact in 2015.
So while sometimes I can be too honest, Hillary Clinton is the exact opposite: she never tells the truth.
One lie after another, and getting worse each passing day, he said.So those wrong things he has said, the ones he regrets so much, like when he said that all Mexicans are rapists.
Yeah, well, that was just him being too honest.
What a great apology.
