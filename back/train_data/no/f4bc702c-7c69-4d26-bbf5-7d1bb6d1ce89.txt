rome ( reuters ) - an italian judge ruled on tuesday that a convicted mobster and son of late boss salvatore toto riina be detained for a year in a secure labor unit , a judicial source said , less than two weeks after his father died , leaving the sicilian mafia s future uncertain .
convicted of mafia membership in 2004 and sentenced to nearly nine years in prison before being released on parole , giuseppe salvatore riina , 40 , has been under police surveillance in the northern town of padua .
criminals who are deemed dangerous to society or likely to re-offend can be sent to a secure unit , known as a workhouse in italy , with the aim of rehabilitating them into society through manual labor .
in riina s case , investigators in rome found that he had contact with drug dealers , prompting a prosecutor in padua to ask for him to be held under tighter security , the source said .
riina declined to comment through his lawyer .
a decision has not yet been taken on which of italy s five workhouses riina will be sent to , the source said .
the judge handed down a one-year term , rather than the three years the padua prosecutor had requested .
on state television last year , riina said he had been happy during his childhood , when his fugitive father lived under an assumed name .
toto riina died on nov. 17 in a hospital in parma , the italian city where he had been serving 26 life sentences for murders committed between 1969 and 1992 .
nicknamed the boss of bosses , toto riina changed the structure of the sicilian mafia , concentrating power in his own hands .
his savagery prompted hundreds of mobsters to testify against him , allowing magistrates to uncover the secrets of cosa nostra and prosecute its leaders .
