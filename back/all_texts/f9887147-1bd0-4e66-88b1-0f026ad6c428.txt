Don t you just love all the lies coming out of Hillary s lying pie hole?
She says she was really eager to meet with the FBI sure she was!
I d beg to differ that she was probably so nervous trying to keep all her lies straight.
The only way she would be eager to meet with the FBI is if the fix is in and she knows she ll not be charged with anything.
We ll see!The lie that REALLY stood out is that she said she heard of the Bill/Loretta meeting in the news .
Do you think for one minute that she didn t hear this from Bill first?
She also claims it was a short chance meeting So a 30 minute meeting where no pictures or reporters were allowed is a chance meeting.
This is laughable!In Hillary Clinton s first interview since meeting with FBI officials regarding the investigation into her use of a private email server, she told NBC s Chuck Todd she was eager for the meeting, and pleased to have the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a conclusion.
However, she declined to comment on reports that charges will not be filed against her in the case.Clinton also revealed that she first learned of her husband s tarmac meeting with Attorney General Loretta Lynch from the news.
She described it as a short, chance meeting at an airport tarmac and that the two did not discuss the Department of Justice s review.
Yet she acknowledged that both the former president and attorney general have admitted they wouldn t do it again.
Hindsight is 20/20, Clinton said: INTERVIEW WITH POLITICAL HACK CHUCK TODD:
