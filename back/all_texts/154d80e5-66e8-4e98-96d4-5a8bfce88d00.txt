This is the same school district that is begging the State of Michigan residents to fund a $500 million debt they cannot pay back.
If the state doesn t come to some sort of agreement to bail out the devastated, Democrat run city of Detroit schools yet again, by the June 30th deadline, they will run out of money and the schools could be forced to shut down.
As usual with public schools run in poor cities run by Democrats, it s the kids who suffer at the hands of these self-serving criminals After 38 years of working for Detroit Public Schools, an assistant superintendent admitted in federal court today that she cheated kids with disabilities out of school supplies by helping a crooked vendor run a kickback scheme that could send her to prison for nearly six years.With her voice quivering, Clara Flowers, 61, of Detroit pleaded guilty to accepting $324,685 in kickbacks from a vendor as a thank-you for helping him bill DPS for school supplies that were intended for children with disabilities but were never delivered.Flowers, the assistant superintendent of Detroit Public Schools Office of Specialized Student Services, offered no explanation or excuses for her actions.
When asked to explain what she did, Flowers, in a shaky voice, said: I received kickbacks from Norman Shy.
Flowers said the kickbacks from Shy who has also been charged in the case came in the forms of checks, prepaid gift cards and home improvements on her private residence.
Their scheme, she said, lasted from 2009 through 2015.Under the terms of her plea agreement, Flowers sentencing range is 57-71 months in prison.
She also was ordered to make $324,785 in restitution to DPS, and another $27,488 in restitution to the Internal Revenue Service for unpaid taxes.
