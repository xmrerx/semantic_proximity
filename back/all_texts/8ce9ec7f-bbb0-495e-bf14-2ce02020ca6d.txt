Put down the bricks and vote!
Hmmm I wonder if he has a particular party in mind?Black Lives Matter activists need to need to ensure that every demonstrator is a vote in the fall elections in order to win policy changes pertaining to police misconduct and officer-involved shootings, according to the head of the NAACP.
To bring about the kind of change that we need, we need to ensure that every demonstrator is a vote and that we to show up en masse and in the millions at the polls in November, NAACP president Cornell William Brooks said on CBS Face the Nation Sunday morning.The question of how the Black Lives Matter movement would affect the presidential campaigns has taken on increased significance over the last week, with two videos of police shootings going viral in the days before a self-described black nationalist ambushed and killed five Dallas police officers who were protecting protesters on Friday night.
We need to bring about reform at the state and municipal level and at the federal level and, of course, call upon our presidential candidates to take racial profiling seriously and address it in their party platforms and in their campaigns, Brooks said.Presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, who needs to mobilize the Obama coalition of record minority turnout to win this fall, said that the recent events call for white Americans to hear the legitimate cries of black Americans mistreated by police.
I will call for white people like myself to put ourselves in the shoes of those African-American families who fear every time their children go somewhere, who have to have the talk about how to really protect themselves when they re the ones that should be expecting protection from encounters with police, she said Friday.
