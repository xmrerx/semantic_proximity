When Hillary Clinton called out half of Trump supporters for harboring deplorable behaviors which include, but are not limited to the following: racism, sexism, homophobia and Islamophobia the GOP threw a hissy fit.
How dare Clinton call out the Trump base, which does lean more in the direction of white supremacy than any other campaign base of support.The media crucified her, and called it her 47 percent moment.
But, as the facts have shown, she wasn t wrong.In fact, a new poll backs up her claim.
Langer Research Associates, with the help of ABC News, found that four in 10 Trump supporters believe minorities have too much influence in America, while 1 in 5 said whites don t have enough influence.Certainly not half of Trump supporters, but close enough (and too close for comfort).Not surprisingly, those who hold the view that minorities have too much influence are also less educated, more conservative, and are die-hard Trump supporters:Holding these pro-Trump views - that is, seeing too little influence for whites and men and too much influence for minorities and women - peaks among strong conservatives and core Trump supporters, those who wanted him to win the GOPpresidential nomination.
It s also more prevalent among conservatives overall, people who disapprove of Obama s job performance or feel they ve gotten worse off financially under his presidency, men and older, less-educated and less well-off Americans.Who would have thought that white Americans who hate the first black president would think blacks, Hispanics and Latinos have too much influence.These findings follow a disturbing trend among Trump supporters.No wonder Trump loves the poorly educated they eat up his racist message and proudly expound it wherever they can.Just how many deplorables make up the Trump base of support teeters back and forth.
it can be as much as 67 percent, and it can be as low as 40 percent.
But the fact remains that a sizable amount, an influential amount, exist, and they are voting this year.Featured image via John Moore/Getty Images
