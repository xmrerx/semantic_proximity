The irony of the Tweet put out on Mother s Day by Planned Parenthood is certainly not lost on us.
The cognitive dissonance of a baby killing, baby parts seller promoting motherhood is a nutty comment!
Planned Parenthood, the nation s largest abortion provider, on Sunday celebrated Mother s Day with a tweet picturing two mothers holding their children.
Planned Parenthood is committed to building a world that values, respects, and supports safe and wanted motherhood, a caption on the picture reads.
Social media users were quick to point out the cognitive dissonance of an abortion provider celebrating mothers.
Does anybody else see the irony of abortion provider Planned Parenthood wishing a Happy Mother s Day?
Angel C tweeted.
Appalling!
chimed in Jana Allen.
But I guess not all unborn babies matter, another Twitter user said.
The unborn are innocent victims murdered at PP.
