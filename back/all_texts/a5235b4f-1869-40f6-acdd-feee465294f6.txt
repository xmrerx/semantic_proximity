Fox Business held their second Republican debate, and things went off the rails almost immediately.Just a half hour in, Donald Trump was asked to address the comments he made alleging that fellow candidate Sen. Ted Cruz was not legally allowed to run for president because he was born in Canada.
Cruz defended his eligibility by pointing out that the Constitutional requirement to run for president has always been interpreted to mean children of American citizens born in foreign countries were considered U.S. citizens just like anyone else.
In one of the biggest burns of the night, Cruz went a step further by pointing out that some of the more extreme birther theories that Trump s fans support hold that not only does a child need to be born in the United States, but both parents need to be born in the country as well.
By that logic, Cruz said, Donald Trump would be disqualified himself, because his mother was born in Scotland.Trump was not happy.Feigning concern for Cruz, Trump claims that if he were to choose Cruz as his vice presidential candidate, the Democrats would sue, because we can t take him along for the ride.
Trump later claimed that if Cruz were to win the presidency, he would possibly face being kicked after a lawsuit over his eligibility.
The entire auditorium was booing, but the jeers had been going on so long it was impossible to tell if they were meant for Trump, Cruz, or for the painful death of brain cells happening to everyone watching.By this point, the Republican Debate had come to a complete standstill.
No questions were being asked.
No other candidates were allowed to speak.
Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, the two front-runners, were arguing on national television about birther conspiracy theories.
As far as television goes, it was entertaining stuff.
As far as the fate of the country goes, it was chilling.Watch the surreal fight below:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9L-prXogME]Feature image via screengrab
