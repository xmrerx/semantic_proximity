Poor Hillary, she s always the victim of some Right-Wing conspiracy When members of Congress are not allowed to see the contents of the emails Hillary had on her private UNSECURED server that s a pretty big deal!The government intelligence in Hillary Clinton s private emails as secretary of state is sometimes considered so sensitive that some congressmen have been hindered in their ability to even read them, a new report Thursday says.The material in the emails is classified at a level above top secret, Fox reported, meaning that some lawmakers have been required to sign new agreements not to reveal their contents.
The situation highlights the sensitivity of the information that is being pored over, despite Clinton s long habit of downplaying their significance.A level above top secret is considered subject to special access programs, requiring the additional security because of the increased sensitivity.Congressional reviewers who scoured the SAP information in Clinton s emails already had Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented clearance the highest level of security clearance but were required to sign extra non-disclosure agreements.Last week, Intelligence Community Inspector General I. Charles McCullough III wrote senior lawmakers to advise them that several dozen additional classified emails have been identified including specific intelligence from special access programs.
In a later interview with National Public Radio, Clinton downplayed the IG letter and claimed it was politically biased.
This seems to me to be, you know, another effort to inject this into the campaign, it s another leak, she told the network.
I m just going to leave it up to the professionals at the Justice Department because nothing that this says changes the fact that I never sent or received material marked classified.
