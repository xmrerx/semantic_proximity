berlin ( reuters ) - police brought in experts and an explosives robot to investigate a suspicious package found at the christmas market in the west german city of bonn late on friday .
bonn police cordoned off and evacuated a large area of the market just before 9 p.m. local time , and experts were still examining the object five hours later , a spokesman said .
we assume it s not dangerous , but we re still investigating , the spokesman said .
he said the object was discovered shortly before the market was to close for the evening , so it was not crowded .
germany is on high alert for potential attacks a year after failed tunisian asylum seeker anis amri killed 12 people when he hijacked a truck and drove it into a crowded berlin christmas market .
chancellor angela merkel , marking the first anniversary of the attack on tuesday , said germany should learn from security shortcomings exposed in the incident .
german authorities evacuated part of a christmas market in potsdam near berlin earlier this month after a package containing powerful firecrackers , wires and nails was delivered to a nearby pharmacy .
officials later said that criminals had used the incident to try to extort millions of euros from logistics firm dhl , which had delivered the package .
