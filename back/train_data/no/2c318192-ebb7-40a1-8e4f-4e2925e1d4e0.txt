washington ( reuters ) - u.s .
senator john mccain , the chairman of the senate armed services committee , took immediate issue on tuesday with president barack obama ’ s budget request , saying it would leave the defense department with at least $ 17 billion less than it said it needed and planned for this year .
“ while the committee will closely review the president ’ s defense budget request , it is already clear that this request is inadequate to address the national security threats we face and the growing demands they impose on our men and women in uniform , ” mccain said in a statement .
