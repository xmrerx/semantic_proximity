that s the plan , white house press secretary josh earnest said when asked if the president planned to veto the bill , saying it would complicate diplomatic relations .
earnest defended the administration s stance against the bill saying it is not an effective , forceful way for us to respond to terrorism .
lawmakers are expected to attempt to override the veto , and if successful , would mark the first time in obama s presidency.utterly disgraceful , even for obama .
now his infamous bow to the saudi king takes on a new , and sickening meaning.in april , a senior saudi prince urged americans not to vote for donald trump in the upcoming general election , after trump promised to blow the lid off secret documents proving that the saudi government helped plan the 9/11 attacks.via : top right news
