Was this Somali immigrant refusing to appear in a ND court simply because he does not recognize American law?
Or is it simply a case of believing he is entitled to special privileges because he is a victim of Islamaphobia in America?
*UPDATE to story belowOriginal Story Dec 9, 2015A Muslim migrant who kidnapped a North Dakota woman and raped her while chanting Allahu Akbar has refused to appear in court.Abdulrahman Ali, a Somalian who arrived in America four years ago, is accused of sexually assaulting a gas station attendant in a bathroom at Gordy s Travel Plaza in Mapleton, North Dakota.After trying to kiss her, Ali allegedly forced the woman into the women s bathroom, locked the door behind him and started sexually molesting her while slapping and kicking the victim.
When the woman tried to escape, Ali threw her against the wall.
Documents say she was unsure if Ali was speaking English or a different language, but she could recognize one thing Ali said while they were in the bathroom alone.
She heard Ali utter Allah Akbar, which, in Arabic means God is the greatest, reports Valley News Live.Ali s sister responded to the arrest by claiming her brother was a good person but that he was suffering from mental health issues.Ali, who refused to face a judge, claiming he was sick, faces charges of gross sexual imposition, kidnapping, aggravated assault, and two counts of terrorizing.The report again underscores concerns that the west is importing a real rape culture via the influx of refugees and migrants from the Middle East and North Africa.Rapes occurring in and around migrant camps are now so prevalent, that authorities in Germany are covering up details of incidents so as not to legitimize critics of mass immigration.Via: Valley News Live*UPDATE- April 13, 2016 A Fargo man charged late last year with sexually assaulting a Mapleton store clerk appeared Wednesday, April 13, in Cass County District Court, but his case appears to be stalled for now as attorneys wait for a mental health exam.Abdulrahman Ibrahim Ali, 36, faces charges of gross sexual imposition, kidnapping, aggravated assault, and terrorizing stemming from an incident in December at Gordy s Travel Plaza in Mapleton.
The most serious charge, Class AA felony gross sexual imposition, could carry a lifetime prison term if Ali were convicted.At one point Wednesday, Ali said he was having problems at the Cass County Jail and that he was taking medication but was not sleeping.Mental evaluations are used in criminal cases to assess whether a defendant is unable to assist in his own defense or was mentally ill or deficient at the time of the alleged crime.
Either situation can prevent a defendant from standing trial.Ali s family has said he suffers from biploar disorder and that minor criminal charges against him in Ohio and Minnesota were dismissed on mental illness grounds.
