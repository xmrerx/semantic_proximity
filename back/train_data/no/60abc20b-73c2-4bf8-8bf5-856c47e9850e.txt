london ( reuters ) - buckingham palace issued a new photographic portrait of queen elizabeth and her husband prince philip on saturday to mark their upcoming 70th wedding anniversary .
the couple married at london s westminster abbey on nov. 20 , 1947 , just two years after the end of world war two , in a lavish ceremony attended by statesmen and royalty from around the world .
the portrait , taken earlier this month , showed the queen wearing the same dress which she chose for a service of thanksgiving to mark their diamond wedding anniversary held at the abbey where they were married .
she is also wearing a scarab brooch in yellow gold , carved ruby and diamond which philip gave her in 1966 .
elizabeth has been married for far longer than any other royal , and the newly-released picture showed the couple framed by thomas gainsborough s 1781 portraits of george iii and queen charlotte , who were married for 57 years - the second longest royal marriage .
