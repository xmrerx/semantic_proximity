dubai ( reuters ) - a ship carrying 5,500 tonnes of flour docked in yemen s hodeidah port in the red sea on sunday , the first after more than two weeks of a blockade by a saudi-led coalition fighting the houthi movement , local officials said .
saudi arabia and its allies closed air , land and sea access to the arabian peninsula country on nov. 6 , to stop what it calls a flow of arms to the houthis from iran .
the action came after saudi arabia intercepted a missile fired towards its capital riyadh .
iran has denied supplying the houthis with weapons .
the delivery is the first aid to arrive through hodeidah port , controlled by the houthis , after the coalition allowed a flight carrying humanitarian aid workers to the yemeni capital of sanaa on saturday .
the ship is 106 meters long and carries 5,500 tonnes of flour , one of the yemeni officials said .
aid agencies said the blockade had worsened the humanitarian crisis in yemen where the war has left an estimated 7 million people facing famine and killed more than 10,000 people .
the coalition gave clearance for u.n. flights in and out of sanaa from amman on saturday , involving the regular rotation of aid workers .
after re-opening sanaa airport , unicef has also sent vaccines there .
the charity save the children said an estimated 20,000 yemeni children under the age of five were joining the ranks of the severely malnourished every month , an average of 27 children every hour .
