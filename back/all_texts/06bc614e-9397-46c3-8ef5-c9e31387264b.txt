Jeffrey Toobin chimes in to protect Hillary Clinton and it is in very poor taste but mostly untrue.
The reason Mr. Toobin s claim is untrue is that Amb.
Stevens asked for more security 600 times!
He knew the dangers but was not putting anyone at risk it was the State Department that failed him by not adding more security!During one of the breaks in Hillary Clinton s testimony on Benghazi, Jeffrey Toobin insinuated that Ambassador Chris Stevens purposely put himself in harm s way.Stevens travelled to Benghazi from Tripoli on September 10, 2012 and planned to stay until September 14, 2012.
Stevens only had two Diplomatic Security personnel with him.Committee member Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-Ga.) said that Stevens had asked Clinton and her State Department multiple times for extra protection.
Clinton said that Stevens did not have her personal email account but had the means to call or email any relevant person at the State Department.
He had the email and he had the direct line of everybody that he worked with for years.
He had been posted with officials in the State Department.
They had gone through difficult, challenging, dangerous assignments together.
He was in constant contact with people.
Yes, he and the people working for him asked for more security.
Some of those requests were approved, others were not, Clinton said.Toobin said to CNN s Wolf Blitzer that Stevens purposely put himself and the security team in dangerous situation.
Yes, Mr. Toobin, blaming the victim is in very poor taste:
