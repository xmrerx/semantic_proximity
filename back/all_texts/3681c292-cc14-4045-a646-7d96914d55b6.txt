Don t you just love an entitled IRS lawyer who claims she can t be fired?
What s even better is she was an ethics lawyer who really had no ethics at all.
She was fired from the IRS but just yesterday was disbarred.A lawyer who worked in the IRS ethics office was disbarred Thursday by the District of Columbia Court of Appeals, which concluded she misappropriated a client s funds from a case she handled in private practice, broke a number of ethics rules and showed reckless disregard for the truth in misleading a disbarment panel looking into the matter.The lawyer, Takisha Brown, reportedly had bragged that she would never be punished because her boss would protect her, but an IRS spokesman said Wednesday that she was no longer an employee at the agency.
Our records indicate that this employee no longer works for the IRS, spokesman Matthew Leas said, though he wouldn t comment further on the case, which became another black eye for the embattled tax agency when The Washington Times first reported on it last year.Ms.
Brown had her licenses suspended and then was disbarred after misusing money she won for a client in an automobile accident case.
Under terms of the deal, Ms. Brown was to use part of the settlement to pay the victim s medical bills, but the lawyer withdrew the money herself and ignored repeated requests from the client s physicians to make good on the bills, the appeals court said.Ms.
Brown also misled a disbarment hearing panel when it began looking into the matter, the court said.
The record amply supports the conclusions that Ms. Brown intentionally misappropriated funds and made false statements with reckless disregard for the truth, the appeals court concluded in a 14-page order finalizing her disbarment.Read more: WASHINGTON TIMES
