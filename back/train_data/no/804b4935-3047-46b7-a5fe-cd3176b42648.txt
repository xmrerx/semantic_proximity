rome ( reuters ) - italy s parliament will be dissolved between christmas and the new year with national elections likely set for march 4 , a parliamentary source in contact with the president s office said on wednesday .
the source said the vote could also be held on march 11 , with a final decision due to be taken shortly .
a national election must be held by may , but most political parties are keen to hold elections as soon as possible .
while the centre-right is seen winning most seats at the forthcoming ballot , opinion polls suggest it will not win an absolute majority , making a hung parliament the most likely outcome .
