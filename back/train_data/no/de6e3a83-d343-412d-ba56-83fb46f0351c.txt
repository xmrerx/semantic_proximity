copenhagen ( reuters ) - danish police said on tuesday the size of a headless female torso found on the sea s edge in copenhagen suggested it could be that of a swedish journalist who died after taking a submarine ride with the vessel s danish inventor .
police said divers were still searching the area and they were investigating reports of other body parts that may have been spotted in copenhagen harbor .
danish inventor peter madsen has been charged with killing kim wall , a swedish journalist , in his home-made submarine .
we re dealing with a torso where arms , legs and head were cut off deliberately .
the length of the torso doesn t speak against it being kim wall , but we still don t know , copenhagen police spokesman jens moller said in a video statement .
madsen told a court she had died in an accident on board the submarine and that he had buried her at sea , changing his earlier statement that he dropped her off alive in copenhagen .
police are conducting dna tests to identify the torso - found on monday by a passing cyclist - and the results are due wednesday morning , moller said .
the bizarre case has dominated danish and swedish media , and drawn interest from around the world .
madsen has been charged with the manslaughter of wall , who has been missing since he took her out to sea in his 17-metre ( 56 feet ) submarine on aug. 10 .
he denies the charge .
he was rescued a day later after his uc3 nautilus sank in the narrow strait between denmark and sweden .
police found nobody else in the wreck .
madsen , an entrepreneur , artist , submarine builder and aerospace engineer , went before a judge on saturday for preliminary questioning .
the case is closed to the public in order to protect further investigations , police said .
