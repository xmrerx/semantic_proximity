The Washington Post just got called out BIG TIME on a fake story they published This is a screenshot of the article:THE BIG LIE FROM WASHINGTON POST: President Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russian foreign minister and ambassador in a White House meeting last week, according to current and former U.S. officials, who said Trump s disclosures jeopardized a critical source of intelligence on the Islamic State.The information the president relayed had been provided by a U.S. partner through an intelligence-sharing arrangement considered so sensitive that details have been withheld from allies and tightly restricted even within the U.S. government, officials said.They tried to discredit President Trump in his dealings with Russia by saying President Trump revealed highly classified information to the Russians .NOT TRUE!
They got caught and then called out by the Trump administration s National Security Advisor.This is awesome:National Security Advisor, H.R.
McMaster made a statement saying, The story that came out tonight, as reported, is false.
Natl Security Adviser McMaster made a statement denying a report that @POTUS revealed classified info to Russia.
