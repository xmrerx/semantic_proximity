vatican city ( reuters ) - the vatican said on saturday it had opened an investigation into reports that a former teenage altar boy , who allegedly repeatedly forced a dormitory mate to have sex with him , went on to become a priest .
the allegations concerning the st. pius x institute , known as a pre-seminary , were made in a recent book and in italian television reports .
the pre-seminary is a residence inside the vatican for altar boys who serve at masses in st. peter s basilica mostly presided over by priests , bishops and cardinals .
at times they also participate in papal liturgies .
the boys go to italian schools while they live in the vatican , a sovereign city-state surrounded by rome .
the reports said that despite complaints to superiors against the teenager , he was accepted into what is known as a major seminary when he became an adult .
he was later ordained a priest and is now serving in a parish in northern italy , they said .
the statement said an initial investigation in 2013 had resulted in no adequate confirmation .
a new investigation had been opened following the latest reports in order to try to shed full light on what really happened , it added .
