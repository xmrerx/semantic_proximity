A PAC that claims to support principled conservative candidates that will lead the fight to restore constitutionally limited government, free markets, and individual liberty to our Republic, has released an ad in Georgia that appears to link Democrat Jon Ossoff to the shooting of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise and left-wing violence in general.
They call themselves the Principled PAC, they re acting on behalf of Republican Karen Handel, and if they can put an ad like this together, they re anything but principled.They call the left unhinged, and claim that the left endorses and applauds shooting Republicans.
Then it implies that Ossoff supports such behavior by saying: When will it stop?
It won t if Jon Ossoff wins on Tuesday, because the same unhinged leftists cheering last week s shooting are all backing Jon Ossoff, and if he wins, they win.
It ends with calling on people to vote for Karen Handel:This is the worst example of politicizing a tragedy there is.
It s so much worse than conservatives screaming moar gunz, every single time there s a shooting.
And Ossoff is sickened by this.
He has already responded by saying: The man is fighting for his life.
I think it s disgraceful to politicize it, and I think Secretary Handel should call for it to come down.
You have a national tragedy that has united people.
There are still [two] who are in critical condition.
It s just got no place in an attack ad.
A spokeswoman for Handel called it shameful, and said that the so-called Principled PAC should be ashamed of itself.
She did not call for the ad to come down, though, as she ought to.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images
