BERLIN (Reuters) - German federal prosecutors on Tuesday finalised their ban on an Islamist association accused of radicalizing youngsters, saying that complaints about the ban from two members of the group had been withdrawn.
Last year, the interior ministry banned the Islamist group True Religion, saying it had persuaded about 140 people to join militants in Iraq and Syria.

The federal prosecutor said that since the association itself had not complained about the ban and the two members complaints had been withdrawn, the prohibition ruling was final.
The case comes as Germany commemorates last year s Islamist-motivated attack on a Berlin Christmas Market which killed 12 people and injured many others.
