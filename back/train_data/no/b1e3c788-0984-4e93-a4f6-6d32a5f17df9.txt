madrid ( reuters ) - pro-independence catalan parties junts pel si and cup have asked parliament to meet to discuss and possibly declare the region s independence from spain on monday , catalan newspaper la vanguardia reported on wednesday .
the regional parliament s governing body is meeting today to decide when to call a parliamentary session to discuss the results of a banned referendum on splitting from spain .
during this session , the parliament could declare independence .
given the referendum was declared unconstitutional , this declaration would not bear any legal consequence and it is highly unlikely to be recognized internationally .
