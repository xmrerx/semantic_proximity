Despite the damage that the presidency of George W. Bush and his war mongering administration did to the reputation of the United States, the world continues to look at America as a place of hope and great possibilities.
This can clearly be seen with the excitement and electricity generated when Barack Obama ran for and then won the presidency.
The world realizes the influence the United States exerts on the planet and thus looks very closely at our political developments, especially when it relates to presidential candidates.Thus, much of the world has been alarmed and scared by the rise of Donald Trump, a man who has promised to do all sorts of crazy thing once he becomes president.
He won t rule out using nuclear weapons, he s repeatedly insulted and threatened Mexicans with his stupid wall, he wants to kick start an arms race, he wants to ban Muslims from entering the United States, Islamophobia would be state policy, and he wants to punish women who have abortions.As is stated in the video below: If Trump actually makes it to the White House, there s only one thing you can predict about this wholly unpredictable man: There will be a surge in what people will call anti-American-ism.
People will mock the nation as dumb, vulgar, and aggressive.
It will be like it was in the Geroge W. Bush years, only much much worse.
We don t need another Bush, or someone who can actually be worse if that s even possible.
Let s help keep America safe from this man by doing what we can to make sure he does not become president.Watch and share this video:Featured image via video screenshot.
