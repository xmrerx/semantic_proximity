WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House on Tuesday blasted Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives for using a panel to investigate the 2012 attack in Benghazi, Libya, as a tool to attack Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
“This is a political exercise,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a daily briefing after Republicans released their report.
