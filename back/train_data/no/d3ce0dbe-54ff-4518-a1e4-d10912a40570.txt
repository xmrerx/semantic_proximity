aboard air force one ( reuters ) - the white house said on wednesday that it was confident it could meet its obligations under the paris climate change agreement , despite a court ruling temporarily blocking the administration ’ s limits on power plants ’ carbon emissions .
the u.s. supreme court dealt a serious blow to the obama administration ’ s climate change agenda on tuesday when it took the unusual step to delay implementation of the clean power plan until legal challenges to the regulation are completed .
the clean power plan was designed to lower carbon emissions from u.s. power plants by 2030 to 32 percent below 2005 levels .
while the plan was expected to be the main tool for the united states to meet climate goals agreed to in an international deal in december , white house spokesman eric schultz told reporters in a briefing that it was only one part of the nation ’ s response to climate change .
the long-term extension of the tax credits for renewable energy last year will continue to provide momentum that will transition the power sector toward cleaner sources of energy , schultz said .
“ the inclusion of those tax credits is going to have more impact over the short term than the clean power plan , ” he said .
schultz said the administration was in talks with its partners in the deal and that diplomats in those countries understood the complexities of establishing policies in the united states .
he also said he expected that litigation involving the clean power plan to be wrapped up in time for the united states to comply with the climate agreement .
