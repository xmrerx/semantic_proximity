we can think of two candidates who have no business being on that stage .
we d love to know who made this decision they ll be fewer candidates on the main stage at next week s fox business network republican debate in milwaukee as both chris christie and mike huckabee have been told to take their seats at the kids table.that leaves just eight candidates on the main stage including frontrunners donald trump and ben carson , and also sen. rand paul , who many predicted would suffer christie s undercard debate fate.next week s undercard debate will again feature four candidates but with the addition of christie and huckabee , that means lindsey graham and george pataki both got pushed out.the debate line-up was announced tonight on lou dobbs show on fox business network.besides trump , carson and paul , sens .
ted cruz and marco rubio , govs .
jeb bush and john kasich and business executive carly fiorina round out the line-up.for the undercard debate , bobby jindal and rick santorum remain in their places on stage.so far only one candidate has managed to climb out of the undercard debates , fiorina , who spent the august fox news debate at the kids table and was hoisted onto the mainstage by cnn , after the network tinkered with its rules.one undercard candidate dropped out , texas gov .
rick perry , who was the first candidate to pull the plug on his 2016 ambitions having only appeared at the fox news undercard debate.since cnn s september debate in simi valley , california , the junior varsity squad has had the same roster : graham , santorum , jindal and pataki .
