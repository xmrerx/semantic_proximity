new us ambassador nikki haley strutted into the un on friday with a blunt message to american allies : for those who don t have our backs , we re taking names .
the former south carolina governor made the remark to reporters as she arrived at the world body s headquarters in manhattan to present her credentials to un secretary-general antonio guterres .
our goal with the administration is to show value at the un and the way that we ll show value is to show our strength , show our voice , have the backs of our allies and make sure that our allies have our back as well , she said .
for those that don t have our back , we re taking names , we will make points to respond to that accordingly , president trump s envoy said.she said trump wants her to put fresh eyes on the un .
everything that s working , we re going to make it better , she said .
everything that s not working we re going to try to fix , and anything that seems to be obsolete and not necessary we re going to do away with .
she then hopped on an elevator and went to the 38th floor to meet guterres , who became un chief on jan. 1 .
they then went into his office for a private sit-down .
there have been reports that the white house is poised to demand major cutbacks in un agencies and personnel in slashing washington s financial contributions to the organization .
