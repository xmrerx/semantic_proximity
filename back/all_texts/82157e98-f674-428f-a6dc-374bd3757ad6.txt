Harry Reid s disrespectful comments are just another example of a leftist Democrat who puts politics before honor every time.Sen.
Harry Reid is fighting back against claims that Hillary Clinton was responsible for the deaths of four Americans in Benghazi, Libya by calling the most outspoken parent crazy.
While speaking to reporters, Reid slammed Patricia Smith, the mother of Sean Smith, who died in the 2012 terrorist attack.
At the national convention, they had that poor Smith woman some out and say, Hillary Clinton killed my son, Reid told reporters (wearing sunglasses inside).
How crazy, he said.The Senate Minority Leader was referring to Smith s speech to the Republican National Committee in July.
American MirrorHere s Hillary lying about a video being reason for the attack on the unsecured Benghazi compound, even though she ALWAYS KNEW (see email above) that it had NOTHING to do with the attack:Here s the speech Sean Smith s mother, Pat Smith gave at the RNC Convention.
Who s the crazy one Harry?
