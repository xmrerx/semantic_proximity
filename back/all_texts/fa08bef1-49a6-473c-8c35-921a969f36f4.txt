Is it any wonder veterans are getting behind Donald J. Trump in huge numbers?
Isn t it about time we took care of our veterans the way they deserve to be taken care of?
The VA under the Obama administration has never been more dysfunctional and corrupt.
Hillary is nothing more than Obama in a pants suit.
Our veterans deserver better than 4 more years of the most disrespectful Commander In Chief our nation has ever known.
This corrupt VA has to be completely overhauled.
Every American should demand nothing less!Hundreds of veterans have died while waiting to get care from the Department of Veterans Affairs, all while the department spent millions of taxpayer dollars on high-end art.According to an investigation by COX Media Washington, D.C. and American Transparency, the VA has spent $20 million on high-end art over the last 10 years, $16 million of that spent during President Obama s tenure.The investigation found one particularly egregious example: $670,000 combined spent on two sculptures at a VA center for the blind.Other examples include $21,000 spent on an artificial Christmas tree, $610,000 spent over five years for a new facility in Puerto Rico and more than a million dollars combined on three art projects in Palo Alto, Calif.
Instead of hiring doctors to help triage backlogged veterans, the VA s bonus-happy bureaucracy spent millions of dollars on art, Andrew Andrzejewski, founder and CEO of OpenTheBooks.com, writes in Forbes.
