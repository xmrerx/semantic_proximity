this isn t the first punch this group of black chicago residents have delivered to the failed democrat party .
in 2015 , they made a video message directly aimed at barack obama and the democrat party .
the video exposed the lies obama and the democrats told chicago residents to get votes , and then after the election , they ignored the residents while unemployment rates and crime skyrocketed and the city crumbled around them .
watch the viral video here.the taxpayer-funded installation of a giant , gold-lettered # realfake sculpture , placed by chicago just opposite trump tower , serves as the backdrop for a cutting short film , chicago carnage , from rebelpundit filmmakers jeremy segal and andrew marcus featuring community organizers paul mckinley and mark carter.the city of chicago installed the sculpture just across the chicago river from trump tower in a space that could only be intended to give a giant middle finger to president trump late last month .
the sculpture sits as perfect photo-op to take selfies and group photos flipping off the trump sign , while standing underneath it right next to the golden sculpture that screams real fake.both say chicago is a city that is overrun with very real deadly violence and poverty within a few short miles from this sculpture and it is by intentional design under the liberal agenda .
it is ironic that this sign would show up right here , and not in front of city hall , mckinley says .
it is a great deception to distract people from real issues .
carter says , they are not trying to resolve the problems in this city , they need things to happen exactly the way they are happening .the fake news is that this city is a city for everyone .this is city for the elite .
he goes on to slam the city for looking like a bomb has been dropped , and looking like a third world city .
every day of the week there is a body count , 30 people shot up , 40 people shot up , that s not real fake , says mckinley .
they want you to be focused on donald trump being the problem , carter said , to which mckinley asks , why are we all messed up , trump just got in there ?
there is nothing fake about this guy , said carter , he tells you what he s about , the fake is barack obama , the fake is bill clinton .
the democrat machine is dummying down the people , socially engineering the people into poverty.they want you to believe that there is some white racist republicans or some white racist conservative doing this .
no , this is the democrat machine , these are white and black racist democrats that are doing this to us.they don t want the killing to stop .
they need the people to continue to poor .
they need these blood sucking programs , that have never done anything to bring down violence , unemployment and poverty.mckinley says , this is the most racist city and segregated city in the country , right here in chicago .
