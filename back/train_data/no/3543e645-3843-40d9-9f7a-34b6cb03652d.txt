brussels ( reuters ) - temporary border controls inside the european union s free-travel zone could be extended for up to three years during a crisis , the european commission proposed on wednesday , giving it more leeway to stem migration .
the proposal by the eu executive comes as border controls in germany , austria , denmark , and norway expire , part of the european union s response to a surge of refugees and migrants in november 2015 that tested eu rules on passport-free travel .
those countries must lift the frontier checks by november this year under a two-year-limit set by the bloc in the so-called schengen area , which is named after a town in luxembourg and aims to be a symbol of free movement in the bloc .
while not referring to the four countries , the commission s plan , if agreed by eu governments , would allow them to keep the controls in place for another year if they can justify them .
eu home affairs commissioner dimitris avramopoulos said the threat of migrants coming through greece and the western balkans was no longer a valid excuse for frontier checks .
no internal border control ... in relation to those from the eastern mediterranean will be possible after november , avramopoulos told a news conference .
all member states maintain the possibility to introduce internal border controls for other threats to their internal security , he said , stressing those must remain exceptional .
germany has long argued it needs the controls to combat the threat of islamic militancy in europe .
the eu has taken in more than 1.7 million people from the middle east and africa since 2014 .
but after a mass influx in 2015 , numbers have gone down steadily following a 2016 deal that closed the route from turkey to greece .
the eu has also stepped up support for libya to curb arrivals in italy .
sweden has lifted its border checks but has stepped up internal controls .
norway is part of schengen but not the eu .
