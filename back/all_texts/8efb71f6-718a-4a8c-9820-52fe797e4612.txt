The recently concluded Republican National Convention in Cleveland was a four-day never-ending cavalcade of dystopian nightmares, racism, fascism, sexism, and all the worst of America rolled into one.This video, produced by Blue Nation Review, compiles bits and pieces from the convention floor and the people assembled outside of the event to paint a picture of what has become of the Republican Party and the conservative movement.https://www.facebook.com/bluenationreview/videos/614383415410204/Not only does it show the convention speakers people like Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani leading the crowd in bloodcurdling chants to lock up Hillary Clinton, but it also showcases some of the bizarre comments speakers made while speaking about why they attended.Actor Antonio Sabato Jr. points out to a shocked TV crew that he thinks Obama is a Muslim working against America, while Newt Gingrich gives Melania Trump a pass for stealing Michelle Obama s speech because she s beautiful.
Conspiracy theorist and Trump ally Alex Jones is shown, leading a rally calling for Clinton to be thrown in jail.
Jones, who believes that the 9/11 attack was executed by the U.S. government, is a staunch Trump supporter, and Trump has appeared on his radio show.Even more shocking are the interviews with average Americans who attended the Convention.
They proudly point out to the interviewers that they oppose same-sex rights for gays, believe that Obama is a black nationalist, blame Jews for controlling the world, and believe there isn t anything wrong with calling for white supremacy.At the end of the video, Trump is shown in his acceptance speech, dispensing with dog whistle politics as the Republican Party has previously done and instead explicitly telling these people that if elected President of the United States he will be their voice.
It is hard to watch this compilation and see the Republican Party and the conservative movement as simply a benign political movement anymore.
Instead, they come across as a very clear threat to what America stands for.Featured image via screen capture
