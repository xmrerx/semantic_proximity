athens ( reuters ) - greek president prokopis pavlopoulos on thursday ruled out a revision of an international treaty defining the borders of greece and turkey .
the treaty of lausanne defines the territory and the sovereignty of greece and of the european union and this treaty is for us non-negotiable .
it has no flaws , it does not need to be reviewed , or to be updated , pavlopoulos said during a meeting with turkish president tayyip erdogan , on a two day official visit to the neighbouring country .
erdogan was quoted earlier in a greek newspaper interview suggesting a revision to the 1923 treaty of lausanne , which established the borders of modern-day turkey .
in comments to pavlopoulos , erdogan said there were some details in the lausanne treaty which are not clear .
