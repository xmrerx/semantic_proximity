Of course Hillary manages to turn the question around and make it appear as though the Congressman never asked her a direct question.
Her answer to the Congressman was an admonishment asking the question was somehow calling the credibility of the diplomatic security professionals working in the State Department Hillary Clinton is a highly skilled liar who always manage to dodge the actual question and leave you wondering, How the hell did she just get out of answering that question!
Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that she doesn t believe Ambassador Chris Stevens had her personal email, even though Sidney Blumenthal did in testimony before the Benghazi Select Committee on Thursday.Hillary was asked by Representative Rep. Lynn Westmoreland (R-GA) You got a lot of emails from Sidney Blumenthal, and you say that Mr. Blumenthal was a friend of yours, and he had your personal email address.
You say Chris Stevens was a friend of yours.
He asked numerous times for extra protection.
Now, if I had been Mr. Stevens, and I think anybody out there, anybody watching this, would agree, if I had been Mr. Stevens, and I had had a relationship with you, and I had requested 20 or more times for additional security to protect, not only my life, but the people that were there with me, I would have gotten in touch with you some way.
I would have let you know that I was in danger, and the situation had deteriorated to a point I needed you to do something.
Did he have your personal email?
She answered, Congressman, I do not believe that he had my personal email.
He had the email, and he had the direct line to everybody that he d worked with for years.
He had been posted with officials in the State Department.
They had gone through difficult, challenging, dangerous assignments together.
He was in constant contact with people.
