Tucker Carlson had the Head of the White House Press Association on tonight .It was a slugfest!This was a tense exchange because it was a personal gripe from Carlson who was speaking about the business of journalism .Jeff Mason was a deer in the headlights:HIGHLIGHTS FROM THE INTERVIEW: Tucker hit him hard when he said he d never seen a lamer speaker at the event Ouch!He went on to say, The whole evening was arranged around a guy who wasn t there President TrumpThe best part of the interview was when he confirmed with a question that there a no Republicans in the WH press corp How many registered Republicans in the White House press corp?
Zero!
Let s just drop the pretense the press in Washington hates Donald Trump You ve gotta love Tucker s hard hitting interview style with people like this.
He hammered home the truth and made the guy come clean about the bias in the Washington Press.
