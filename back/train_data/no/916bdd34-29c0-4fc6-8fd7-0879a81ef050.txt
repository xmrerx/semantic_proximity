brussels ( reuters ) - the premier of belgium s flanders region , which has itself seen separatist frictions in the past , denounced spanish authorities on friday for arresting sacked separatist catalan officials and urged the eu to mediate in the dispute .
carles puigdemont , dismissed by madrid as catalan leader after the region s unilateral declaration of independence , traveled to belgium and failed to appear in a spanish court on thursday to answer charges of rebellion .
but nine associates were remanded in custody in madrid pending possible trial .
locking up democratically elected leaders is more than a bridge too far , flanders premier geert bourgeois said in a statement .
i m perplexed that something like that is possible in today s europe .
flanders , home to more than half of belgium s inhabitants , has also seen separatist campaigning in past decades but a series of constitutional reviews has given broad autonomy to the regions and kept a lid on tensions .
bourgeois , of flemish nationalist party n-va which is also part of belgium s federal government , called on european institutions to mediate ; a proposal it has already rejected .
once again i m urgently calling on all european entities to finally take action and look for democratic solutions with both spain and catalonia , he added .
the european commission reiterated on friday it fully respected spain s internal political and judicial order .
