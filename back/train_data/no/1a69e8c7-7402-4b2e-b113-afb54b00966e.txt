johnson , who this week visited the british territories of anguilla and the british virgin islands to see the devastation caused by irma , will discuss the international response with tillerson and french political director nicolas de riviere .
i ve seen firsthand the devastation hurricane irma has caused people in the caribbean .

the three will also discuss the situation in north korea , which carried out its sixth and largest nuclear test earlier this month .
the u.n. security council voted unanimously to boost sanctions on north korea on monday , but u.s. president donald trump has said they were a small step and nothing compared to what would have to happen to deal with the country s nuclear program .
