outsider gop candidate donald trump has vigorously denounced the outsourcing by carrier s air-conditioning business .
his opposition has helped him get a nine-point polling advantage in the state .
but trump s support for major reforms to the h-1b program to reduce the outsourcing of professional jobs is raising his support among upper-income professional-class voters in many other states.the caterpillar outsourcing is all the same thing happening over and over again , said john miano , a lawyer and software expert who has sued the federal government to reduce or stop various outsourcing programs , such as the h-1b visa .
what we see is that companies ask for more [ h-1b visas ] while they re laying off the same kind of [ american professionals ] this is going to be an election that decides whether this continues , miano said.early in 2016 , caterpillar asked the federal government for 71 h-1b visas needed to hire foreign white-collar college-grads .
at least 30 of the requested h-1b visas are for engineers and other skilled professionals in mossville , which is suffering the most layoffs.at least 44 of the visas requested in 2016 are for foreign graduates who are already working at caterpillar in the united states .
these continuation visas are automatically approved , and do not count against the much touted annual limits on h1-b visas.another 22 of caterpillar s visas are for new hires.since 2012 , caterpillar has requested 768 visas for h-1b workers .
roughly speaking , companies get one-fifth of the h-1b visas they request , suggesting the company has outsourced at least 100 u.s.-based jobs to lower-wage foreign graduates.the visa allows the h-1b workers to stay for at least three years , and some manage to stay permanently .
for example , the company has also helped get green cards the precursor to citizenship for roughly 70 foreign college graduates .
most of these green card employees have replaced americans software graduates.read more : breitbart
