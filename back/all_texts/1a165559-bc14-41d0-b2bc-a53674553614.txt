There s one thing that Trump s surrogates all share, and that s a ridiculously blind loyalty to Trump.
They can t see his evils, and their minds automatically twist any evil he says or does into something good.Such was the case on CNN, where Rick Santorum spoke up on Trump s trashing of civil rights icon John Lewis, who is also a Democratic representative from Georgia, and who said Trump is an illegitimate president.Trump has taken a lot of flak, especially given that he did it so close to Martin Luther King, Jr. s birthday.
Former presidential adviser David Gergen was talking about why Trump was wrong to go after Lewis the way he did: This was an attack on [Lewis ] life, what he stands for, what he did for this country and marching across that bridge.
Then former Philadelphia mayor Michael Nutter weighed in with: When will the person who will be president act like a grownup and serious person, not always take the bait?
Show some restraint, show some dignity.
There is no bottom to the depth that he will go to argue with anyone, and cause disdain.
Donald Trump was wrong.
John Lewis is an icon.
He can say whatever he wants.
When Santorum got a chance to speak, he said he and most other people in politics would have handled Lewis comments much differently.
Then he put forth this obscene gem: Donald Trump is the president because he did things like this.
Which just speaks to how low Trump s voters really are.
If anyone can defend Trump s pettiness that way, or in any way, they are just as ridiculous as he is.Watch the fireworks below:Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
