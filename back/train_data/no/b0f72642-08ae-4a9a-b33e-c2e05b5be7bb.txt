washington ( reuters ) - the white house said on wednesday it opposes a bill from the u.s. house of representatives that it said would undercut regulations aimed at requiring fast food and chain restaurants to disclose the calories in food they sell .
but the white house stopped short of issuing a formal veto threat for the bill , which it said “ would undercut the objective of providing clear , consistent calorie information to consumers. ” tackling the american obesity epidemic has been a signature issue for the white house and first lady michelle obama .
the menu regulations , finalized by the food and drug administration in 2014 , require calories to be listed on menus and menu boards of certain chain restaurants with 20 or more locations , and on certain vending machines .
