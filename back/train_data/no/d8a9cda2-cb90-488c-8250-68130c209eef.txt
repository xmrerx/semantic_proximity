washington ( reuters ) - michigan governor rick snyder will testify at a house oversight committee hearing on march 17 on the flint , michigan , drinking water crisis , the panel said on thursday .
snyder , a republican , has publicly apologized for the crisis in which thousands of children are believed to have ingested dangerous amounts of lead from the city ’ s water .
snyder has also said missteps by the federal environmental protection agency helped lead to the crisis in flint , a predominantly african-american city of 100,000 about 60 miles ( 100 km ) northwest of detroit .
under direction of a state-appointed city manager in 2014 , flint changed its water supply from detroit ’ s to the flint river , and the more caustic water helped to leach lead , a neurotoxin , from old pipes into the drinking water .
the former city manager , darnell earley , and the former midwest epa chief , susan hedman , will also testify before the committee at separate hearing on march 15 .
