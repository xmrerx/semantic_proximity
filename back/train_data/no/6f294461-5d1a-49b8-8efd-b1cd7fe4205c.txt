21st century wire says could this be the real reason why trump is so despised by the elite republican establishment ? watch a video of this report here : trump had this to say : wouldn t it be nice if actually we could get along with russia , that we could get along with foreign countries .
the neocon political faction that has dominated the republican party during recent history believes there is little to be gained from cooperation in politics , and prefers confrontation and domination instead ; as they amply demonstrated with their 2003 iraq war.for donald trump to be specifically saying that he wants to get along with russia is unparalleled , as mitt romney , the 2012 republican presidential candidate , said that russia was without question our number one geopolitical foe .a world with an american president that wants to get along might certainly look a lot different to today s. yet , as we are seeing , with the myriad of attacks against trump , certain political and military industrial complex elite interests are not happy about the concept.of course , we must remember that this is still just that a concept .
however good of a concept it is , trump may very well not deliver this goal.still , it certainly is a very different , and somewhat sweeter , change to the tune of american foreign policy rhetoric than we are used to hearing.do you believe trump has the right foreign policy stance , and will he implement it ? get the full story on election 2016 : 21st century wire election files
