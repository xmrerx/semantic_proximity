nairobi ( reuters ) - kenyan police used tear gas to disperse opposition protesters on monday in the capital nairobi and another city as demonstrations against a presidential vote re-run continued despite a government ban .
kenya s supreme court nullified the presidential election result in august , citing procedural irregularities and voiding the victory of president uhuru kenyatta .
the ruling opened the way to a repeat vote on oct. 26 .
but opposition leader raila odinga has refused to take part , saying the re-run should not happen until major reforms are introduced to prevent another failed vote .
the election board has said the polls will go ahead anyway , pitting kenyatta against six other candidates , none of whom polled more than 1 percent in august .
the standoff has spooked investors in the region s most advanced economy and is slowing growth .
last month , kenya lowered its 2017 economic growth forecast to 5.5 percent due to drought and political uncertainty .
on sunday , odinga repeated his call for more protests , which authorities banned in the central business districts of nairobi , the coastal city of mombasa and the opposition stronghold of kisumu in western kenya .
the events in kenya have raised confusion among voters and fears that politically-driven violence might escalate .
at a political rally on monday , kenyatta accused the opposition of seeking to wreak chaos and force a coalition government , allegations the opposition has denied .
at least 33 people died in nairobi during a police crackdown on opposition supporters after the august election , including a child and a pregnant woman , amnesty international and human rights watch said on monday .
the national police disputed the report , saying it was totally misleading and based on falsehoods .
