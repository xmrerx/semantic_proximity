CNN s supposed law enforcement expert, Harry Houck, is promoting a new video with what he no doubt thinks is an absolutely brilliant message.
He wants President Obama to solve violence, and he even has a suggestion for how best to do it.
There is a video floating around social media that calls on Obama to ban niggas, not guns, in order to stop escalating violence in America s cities.
To a racist like Houck, this makes perfect sense.He posted a link to the video on his Twitter account, and said: He knows what he s talking about!
Because the man who made the video, Tommy Sotomayor, is black, and therefore that makes this okay.
Watch the video in all its racist, bigoted glory below:The video appeared on a Facebook page called Uncle Sam s Misguided Children about a week ago, but Houck seems to have just now noticed it, and it s awful message resonated with him, because of course.
One only needs to look at his Twitter feed to see how racist he is.
He s called for Donald Trump, Jr., to be the new mayor of New York City, and he s screamed, Death to political correctness!
there when he hears the word, racism.
He also uses his spot on CNN to say that black people are more predisposed to committing crimes, and that black victims of police brutality have nobody to blame but themselves for it (those who survive, anyway).
He said that on CNN just two weeks ago, in fact, which threw CNN s panel at the time into an uproar.He s even tweeted a link to a white supremacist website.
Yes, Houck is clearly a wonderful law enforcement expert who should definitely be taken seriously.
Not.
In truth, he needs to be removed from the air for promoting racial hatred.Featured image via screen capture
