If I were to tell you that Republicans simply hate regular American citizens, that wouldn t be news.
To suggest that they just wish the poor, criminals, and other less advantaged segments of society would do them a favor and just die already, wouldn t come as a shock either.However, what is a bit shocking is to hear a Republican SAY IT so boldly and in such a smug and self-righteous manner.Maine s Republican governor, Paul LePage, just vetoed a bill that would allow pharmacists to provide anti-overdose drugs for use on victims without a prescription.
If that isn t bad enough, wait till you read his reason why.Pro-life?
Yeah right.LePage proudly announced his support of increased overdose deaths, saying that using anti-overdose drugs serves only to perpetuate the cycle of addiction.
LePage said that the drug, Naxolone, doesn t save lives it only extends them until the next overdose.A governor of a U.S. state just literally said that he would rather his own citizens DIE than be able to get assistance with a drug that could prevent death long enough to get them to a hospital.
HOW THE HELL IS HE STILL IN OFFICE?Why stop there?
Why not just say ALL medical treatment or medicine should be made unavailable because it only extends life?
Got meningitis?
Tough luck, you will only grow old and die anyway some day.
Cancer?
Screw you.
Go die in the corner.It s important to remember too, that there is currently a serious heroin use epidemic going on in northeastern states, Maine in particular.
Having this drug available without a prescription, to be kept in the case of an emergency, could mean the difference between life and death for thousands of people who struggle with addiction.Paul LePage is the perfect personification of all the hate, contempt, greed, and joy in the harm of others that is at the rotten heart of modern American conservatism.
