Remember when liberal media and entertainers, Democrat leaders and even Hillary Clinton got on TV and swore Trump never paid taxes?
The Democrat Party even ran TV ad stating Trump had not paid taxes in 18 years!
Here s a montage showing how many liberals in the media and entertainment industry worked in unison to push a lie about President Trump never paying taxes.
The only variable in this coordinated lie is the number of years they claim he never paid taxes, which ranges from never to 18 years.
Thanks to Rachel Maddow, who illegally showcased President Donald J. Trump s tax 2005 tax return (only 11 years ago) we all know that this coordinated lie was nothing more than a well, a coordinated lie.
Who will be held accountable for this coordinated lie now that Rachel Maddow of MSNBC (one of their own) has foolishly disclosed the truth, that in 2005 President Trump paid over $38 MILLION to the American government in taxes Watch:
