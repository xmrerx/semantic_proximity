london ( reuters ) - britain s electoral commission has opened an investigation to establish whether vote leave limited , the organization behind the official campaign to leave the european union , breached campaign finance rules during the 2016 referendum campaign .
the commission said on monday its decision to open an investigation followed a review of previous assessments conducted in february in march , which had resulted in no further action being taken .
since that time , new information has come to light which , when considered alongside the information obtained previously , has given the commission reasonable grounds to suspect an offense may have been committed , it said in a statement .
