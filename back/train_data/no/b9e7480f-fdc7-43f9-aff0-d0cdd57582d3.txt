beijing ( reuters ) - no free fruit in hotel rooms , no free hair cuts and no prawns on the menu - delegates at this week s communist party congress in china can expect austere treatment in keeping with president xi jinping s pledge to crack down on corruption and extravagance .
part of xi s fight against deep-seated graft has been to ensure officials are not seen abusing their positions and wasting public money , after a series of scandals involving high-living bureaucrats ignited public anger .
wang lilian , who has helped oversee hospitality for delegates at three previous party congresses , told state radio in remarks reported on sunday that this time , things are going to be very different .
delegates will , for example , find their hotels bereft of the large welcoming banners and displays of flowers common in previous years .
but the biggest difference will be with their rooms and food , wang said .
there won t be any more fruit put out in rooms , whereas previously there were for delegates and staff .
there s none of that this time , he said .
the food was also going to be home-style and simple , wang said .
there s no sea cucumber , prawns or the like .
it s all buffet style .
delegates won t get free hair cuts or beauty treatments and there won t be any gift shops .
there s none of these services this time , wang said .
xi himself has lead the way in promoting simple living , with state media widely reporting on the basic food he eats when on trips around the country , and giving extensive coverage to cases where officials are found to have hoarded gold , owned multiple houses or had a fondness for banquets .
xi has warned , like others before him , that if corruption is not tackled it could affect the party s grip on power .
the once-in-five-years congress opens on wednesday with a major speech by xi .
