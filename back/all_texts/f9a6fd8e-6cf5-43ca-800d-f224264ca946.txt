And yet the media wonders why everyone hates them.It s understandable that someone might get frustrated doing their job sometimes, especially a job reporting the news.
After all, most of the news is typically bad news and that will start to take a toll at some point.But that s no excuse for being a racist.In one incredibly stupid racist remark to a co-worker Detroit NBC reporter, Lauren Podell, ended her own career by whining about how many times she has had to report on murders in the African-American community.
I m tired of reporting on these n*****s killing each other in Detroit, she said.Her racist comment became headline news around the office and Podell was forced to resign.WDIV confirmed her resignation in an email to the Huffington Post.I wanted to let you know that Lauren Podell has resigned from WDIV effective immediately.
Lauren asked me to convey the following: During my time at WDIV I have created many friendships that I will continue to cherish .
If you receive any media inquiries please forward them to Jamie or me.
Thanks.Podell s remarks and the fact that the station tried to cover them up has outraged the black community and demonstrations against systemic racism in the media are being planned.It s one thing to have a gripe about your job.
Maybe Podell really is just tired of reporting these kinds of stories.
But the way she went about it was completely offensive, especially considering that many of her colleagues are black.But this demonstrates that there is systemic racism within the media, which explains why the media has treated Black Lives Matter like shit while treating white cops who shoot unarmed black men with kid gloves.This is a teachable moment, and hopefully, other reporters and anchors will learn from it.Featured Image: YouTube
