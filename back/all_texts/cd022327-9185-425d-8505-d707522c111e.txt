Ever since we ve heard the news of Donald Trump and his publicist John Miller, a character he seemingly created to brag about himself, pretty much anyone and everyone has been making fun of him for it, because it s pretty damn hilarious.Making an appearance on The View, comedian and television host Jimmy Kimmel was no exception.
He, alongside the ladies of The View took Trump to task sarcastically and brilliantly bringing the real estate mogul down a few pegs.After Whoopi Goldberg asks Kimmel about the allegations surrounding Trump posing as his own publicist, Kimmel said: If Trump says that wasn t him, we have no choice but to believe him.
He s never lied to us before.
You could see and feel the sarcasm oozing out of the television.Kimmel adds: It s clearly him.
He then suggests that Trump should just admit it was him and say it was a prank call.When asked why Trump would do such a thing and then deny it, Kimmel explained he s probably incredibly embarrassed.
Why would he lie about it?
Listen, if you were calling People magazine and telling them all the women that wanted to have sex with you, I think you would be embarrassed about it too, right?
Kimmel also states that Madonna was allegedly one of the women, and that as vice president this is one of the big questions he will tackle.The worst part about all of this, is that this is clearly is a distraction away from the fact that Trump has no actual policy plans and isn t at all qualified for the job of Commander-in-Chief.
A fact that needs to be discussed far more often.Watch the interview here:What does @JimmyKimmel have to say about Trump denying he s his own publicist?
He s never lied to us before!
