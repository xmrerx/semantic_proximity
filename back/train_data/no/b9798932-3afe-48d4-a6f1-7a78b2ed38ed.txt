manila ( reuters ) - the philippines national police chief said on tuesday that reuters had timed a report on a deadly anti-drug raid to make his officers look bad as president rodrigo duterte mulls returning them to drug-war operations .
police killed three men in a poor manila neighborhood on oct. 11 in what they said was self-defense during a legitimate anti-drug operation .
but security camera footage and eyewitness testimony published by reuters on monday contradicted the police report and suggested they may have executed the three men .
they come out with damaging reports about the pnp when we are about to return , said police chief ronald dela rosa , referring to the philippines national police .
that means our enemies really don t want us to return to the war on drugs , he said , speaking to reporters at the supreme court in manila .
in october , duterte banned the police from leading anti-drug operations , handing the task to the state-run philippine drug enforcement agency .
duterte has hinted that he will soon allow police to resume operations , although his spokesman harry roque said on tuesday the matter remains pending .
police say they have shot dead more than 3,900 drug suspects in self-defense during duterte s 17-month anti-drug campaign that has triggered growing public distrust and criticism .
police said that one of the men they killed during the oct. 11 raid was dealing drugs before they arrived , but the footage showed him chatting with friends .
police said they shot the three men in self-defense after they opened fire on undercover operatives .
residents told reuters the men were unarmed .
joel coronel , the chief of manila police district , which carried out the raid , said it was a high-risk operation against three suspected drug traffickers reported to be armed and dangerous .
so far our reports indicate that we have observed all the rules in police operating procedures , he said .
