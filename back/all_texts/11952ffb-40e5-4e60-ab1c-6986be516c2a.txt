When Nordstrom announced on Thursday that it will no longer be selling this season s merchandise from Ivanka Trump s fashion line over boycotts from the Left, I was truly shocked.
Nordstrom discontinued a line by the daughter of the President of the United States because they Left doesn t agree with his positions on national security.
Let that sink in!Imagine the outrage if Nordstrom agreed to cancel a clothing line by Malia Obama because conservatives didn t approve of the former President Obama.If we had an honest journalist in the mainstream media, they would be exposing the hypocrisy of the Left, who relentless demand we show tolerance for other points of view while behaving like the most intolerant group of people in the world.The end of the relationship between the department-store chain and Trump s brand came after boycott threats from the Grab Your Wallet campaign, which has called on people to stay away from companies that sell both Ivanka and Donald Trump s merchandise, the Seattle Times reported.Nordstrom tweeted that the decision to stop selling Trump s brand was not a political move but one that was based on its sales performance.
A spokesperson for Nordstrom did not say if the decision to stop selling Trump s fashion line was permanent.
