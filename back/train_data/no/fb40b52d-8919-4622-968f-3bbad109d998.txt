we have agreed to establish and begin the ... negotiations to look over this agreement so that the commercial relationship between both nations intensifies and grows , he said .
netanyahu was joined by a business delegation including representatives from communications firm audiocodes ltd , cyber security firm verint systems inc and mer group , which specializes in telecommunications and cyber security .
in central america , pena nieto said israel s assistance could bolster the united states and mexico s efforts in the region , particularly in guatemala , el salvador and honduras .
