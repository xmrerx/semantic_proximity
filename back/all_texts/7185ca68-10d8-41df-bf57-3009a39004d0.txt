On Tuesday, it was announced that Donald Trump has elected to keep James Comey (that nice gentleman who helped swing the election in Trump s favor by sending Republicans a letter falsely indicating that a new investigation into Hillary Clinton was being opened just before the election) as FBI Director.
That s a move The New York Times notes will keep Mr. Comey at the center of the F.B.I.
s investigation into several Trump associates and their potential ties with the Russian government.
Comey demonstrated with his attacks on Hillary that he has absolutely no integrity whatsoever, which makes him exactly the sort of guy Trump would want to keep around.
Also on Tuesday, purely by coincidence of course, news broke that Trump s national security adviser was cleared of any wrongdoing in his frantic communications with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak on the same day President Obama announced sanctions against Russia for their cyberattack on our nation during the election.White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who also says that Trump had the most heavily-witnessed inauguration in history, and for whom Kellyanne Conway created a new term, alternative facts, in an effort to normalize his lies, explained Monday that the two aren t in frequent contact but have spoken recently on a number of issues that were completely innocent, like logistics for a post-inauguration call between Trump and his Russian dictator friend who 17 intelligence agencies say directly interfered with our election on The Donald s behalf.The problem here is that Americans cannot be sure if the presented results are legitimate, as the FBI is headed by someone who went out of his way, breaking precedent and probably the law, to aid Trump in the election with misleading information about Clinton.
This same man was just rewarded for his actions when Trump allowed him to keep his job.
But Trump also has the power to fire him if he isn t satisfied with the results of any of the numerous investigations into his team.In November, Trump said that Comey made a mistake when he announced that Hillary Clinton had committed no crimes and would not be charged, but brought back his reputation when he released the letter that gave right-wing propaganda outlets (and Putin s team of propagandists) much-needed ammo just before the election.So now, we as Americans are presented with a dilemma: Do we accept the words of the FBI, knowing that Trump can fire the person in charge of the investigations, when he is someone who has shown a corrupt desire to interfere in important things like elections in the past?
Or do we demand a full release of investigatory documents and transcripts just to be sure the truth is being told?Probably better to be safe about this.Featured image by Andrew Harrer via Getty Images
