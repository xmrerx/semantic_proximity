ANKARA (Reuters) - Iran’s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif tweeted on Friday that Tehran would never use its military might against any country, except in self-defense, in reaction to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tough approach towards Tehran.
“We will never use our weapons against anyone, except in self-defense.
Let us see if any of those who complain can make the same statement,” he tweeted.
