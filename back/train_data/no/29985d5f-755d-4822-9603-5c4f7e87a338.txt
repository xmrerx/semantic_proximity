havana ( reuters ) - hurricane irma seriously damaged cuba s already dilapidated sugar industry and flooded and flattened an extensive area of sugar cane , state-run media reported on monday .
some 300,000 hectares ( 740,000 acres ) of cane were affected to different degrees , liobel perez , spokesman for azcuba , the state sugar monopoly , was quoted as stating .
he said 40 percent of the country s mills were also damaged , as were warehouses and other parts of the industry s infrastructure .
despite a steep decline in output over the last 15 years , the industry remains one of the country s most important in terms of employment and export earnings .
the sugar harvest was scheduled to begin in november .
the monster storm spent three days traversing most of the island s northern coast , from east to west , with particular force in the sugar-producing provinces of central cuba , before heading north to florida on sunday .
officials have just begun to assess the damage , so the report was preliminary .
cuba produced 1.8 million tonnes of sugar during the 2016-2017 season .
