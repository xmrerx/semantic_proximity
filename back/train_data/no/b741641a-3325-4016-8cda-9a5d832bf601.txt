you don t want to miss a second of judge jeanine s brilliant analysis of hillary vs. trump whether you like him or not , donald trump talks about real issues .
hillary says he paints a dark divisive picture of an america in decline . '
but ask yourselves , are you better off ?
do you feel safer than you were before these two came into power ?
is america more united than it was ?
are race relations better ?
is police esteem anywhere near where it was 8 years ago ?
whether you like him or not , donald trump is hitting all the core issues .
asking all of the right questions starting all the right conversations .
a man who is willing to take on political correctness that is destroying this nation .
