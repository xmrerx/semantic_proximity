When Black Lives Matter supporters use the same tactics as an ISIS terrorist, America has a serious problem.
Black Lives Matter continues to prove, beyond a shadow of a doubt, they re a terrorist organization.After Beyonce s racist halftime Super Bowl 2016 show, this disgusting terrorist type post from an active NFL player shouldn t come as a surprise to anyone NFL Cleveland Browns running back posted this on Instagram this weekend:Because dead cops is cool.
GPUnder the vile picture he posted in ebonics: They give polices all types of weapons and they continuously choose to kill us.
Communist Disney s ESPN had Cowell s back after the outrage he received on social media:Cleveland Browns running back Isaiah Crowell apologized and said his social media reaction to last week s killing of two black men by police was very wrong.
Crowell said he made an extremely poor decision when he posted a drawing that graphically showed a hooded individual putting what looks like a machete into the throat of a police officer.
It was an extremely poor decision and I apologize for that mistake and for offending people, Crowell said in a statement released by the team.
My values and beliefs do not match that image.
The post went up after the police killings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, and before the killing of five Dallas police officers Thursday night.Crowell wrote that he was outraged and upset by the killing of Sterling and Castile, and outraged and saddened by the killing of the five Dallas police officers.
He called last week an emotional and difficult week, but said his post was wrong.
We have to be better as a society, Crowell said.
It s not about color, it s about what s right and wrong.
I was very wrong in posting that image.
Every single life matters, every death as a result of violence should be treated with equal outrage and penalty.
