The elitist media is exposing its bias and dislike for Republican candidate Donald Trump.
Jonah Golberg and Rick Lowry just can t help themselves and have been going after Trump since day one.
Lowry brought the attacks to a new low last night when he threw his journalistic integrity away by personally attacking Trump.
Gosh, you d think these pundits would be more professional and have thicker skin than this.
Trump is leading and it s simply because he s not a main stream candidate with canned answers pandering to anyone and everyone.
Trump told the truth when he said Carly has a horrible track record in business.
Trump is still a strong candidate according to WE THE PEOPLE and that s all that matters in the end.
