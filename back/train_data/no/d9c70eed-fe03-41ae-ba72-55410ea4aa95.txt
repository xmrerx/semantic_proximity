baghdad ( reuters ) - gorran , a main opposition party to iraqi kurdish leader masoud barzani , called on sunday for his resignation , and for a national salvation government to be formed to deal with crisis pitting the kurds and the central iraqi authorities .
gorran , or the change movement , blamed barzani for the disaster facing the kurds after the loss on oct. 16 of the oil-rich city of kirkuk , captured by iraqi forces in retaliation to a kurdish independence referendum held last month despite warnings from baghdad and neighboring iran and turkey .
the kurdistan presidency must be dissolved and a national salvation government be formed to overcome the current situation , said a statement published by the party leadership after meeting in the kurdish city of sulaimaniya .
gorran supports the right of iraq s kurds for self-determination but it opposed holding the referendum on sept. 25 , saying the timing was ill-chosen .
