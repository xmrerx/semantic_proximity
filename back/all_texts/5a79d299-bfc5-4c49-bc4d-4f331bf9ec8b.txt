The results of the disappointing 2016 presidential election aren t even official yet, but Vice President Joe Biden is already making noise about 2020.
Known for bucking the rules and speaking from his gut, the outgoing vice-president hinted that he might be up for another fight four years from now.CNN asked him jokingly if he planned to run for office again.
Yeah, I am.
I m going to run in 2020, Biden responded.When asked for what position, Biden responded, For president.
What the hell, man.
When CNN told Biden it was planning to publish his quotes, the vice president responded, That s okay.
No, I ve enjoyed every minutes of my time here in the Senate.
It s a great feeling to come back.
I love this place.
Biden later clarified, I m not committing not to run.
I m not committing to anything.
I learned a long time ago fate has a strange way of intervening.
Biden is leaving office one of the most popular political figures in America, and that popularity is even higher among Democrats.
Biden is seen by many as a Democrat who excels at speaking to working class families across the racial spectrum, but still has a history of legislative experience as success as a Senator from Delaware and then as a two-term Vice President.Biden would likely be able to tap into existing Democratic donors if he ran, as he has near 100% name recognition domestically and internationally.
Besides First Lady Michelle Obama, he would probably be the public figure to benefit most from an association with President Obama.Biden considered running in the 2016 election, but decided against it after the tragic death of his son Beau Biden.
Since then, President Obama has put Biden in charge of the moon shot effort to find a cure for cancer, while Biden endorsed and heavily campaigned for Secretary Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election.Featured image via Flickr
