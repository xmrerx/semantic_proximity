Tonight s the night of the Golden Globe Awards, and comedian Jimmy Fallon was tapped to emcee the event.
Before he even started his opening monologue, his teleprompter failed, so he ad libbed the whole thing.
And he used the opportunity to take an awesome dig at Donald Trump for it.We all know by now that Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by more than 3 million, but Trump still won thanks to the way the Electoral College works.
Fallon touched on that when he said: This is the Golden Globes, one of the few places left where America still honors the popular vote.
Our manchild of a leader doesn t like things like this very much.
Trump has been railing off and on about the popular vote controversy, despite the fact that his electoral votes secured his win, despite the fact that the electors still voted for him on Dec. 19, and despite the fact that Congress just certified that vote over the protests of several House Democrats and many Americans.
He has been quiet of late about it, but he still seems to be smarting over his popular vote loss.Fallon didn t stop there, though.
He also compared Trump to Game of Thrones King Joffrey, saying: [Game of Thrones] has so many plot twists and shocking moments, a lot of people are wondering what it would be like if King Joffery had lived.
Well, in 12 days we re gonna find out,were carefully tabulated by the accounting firm Ernst and Young and Putin.
