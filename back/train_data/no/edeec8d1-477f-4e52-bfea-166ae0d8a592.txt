( reuters ) - proposals from u.s. republicans to repeal or restrict a popular deduction on federal income tax for state and local tax ( salt ) payments would hit americans in high-tax states .
the 10 states with the highest taxes are represented in the senate by democrats , and by vermont ’ s bernie sanders , an independent who votes with democrats .
a senate tax plan about to be unveiled on thursday was expected to propose ending the salt deduction entirely .
an earlier house plan would sharply curtail the deduction .
if left unchanged , the senate plan ’ s salt provision would make it harder to attract what could be necessary support for the tax bill from democratic senators , as it would disproportionately hurt their constituents .
republicans have a 52-48 majority in the chamber , meaning they can afford to lose only two republican votes and so could be looking for some democratic support for passage .
here are the u.s. states with the highest annual combined state and local income taxes and property taxes , measured as an average per capita , as calculated by the tax foundation , a pro-business washington think tank .
