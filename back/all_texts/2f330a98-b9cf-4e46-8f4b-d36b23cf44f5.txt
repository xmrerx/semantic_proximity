CAIRO (Reuters) - Egyptian Foreign Minister Sameh Shoukry is no longer meeting U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s advisor and son-in-law Jared Kushner on Wednesday, a copy of his schedule sent out to journalists showed.
A Foreign Ministry official told Reuters the meeting had been canceled but did not provide a reason.
Shoukry had been scheduled to meet with a U.S. delegation led by Kushner to discuss the Middle East peace process.
Two U.S sources familiar with the matter told Reuters on Tuesday that U.S. authorities would deny Egypt $95.7 million in aid and delay a further $195 million payment over its failure to make progress on respecting human rights and democratic norms.
