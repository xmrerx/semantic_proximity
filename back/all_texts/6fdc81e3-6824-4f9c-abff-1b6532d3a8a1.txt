CNN has once again set the stage for a democratic politician to attempt a smackdown of President Trump.
In this case, Rep. Keith Ellison (D-MN) felt the need to parrot what his brothers and sisters in arms have been trying to shove down America s throat; that we need to impeach the President.During the Democratic National Committee leadership debate that aired on CNN, Ellison was asked if he agreed with his fellow democratic party members Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA) and Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-TX) who have said Congress should draw up articles of impeachment against President Trump.Ellison: I think Donald Trump has already done a number of things which legitimately raise the question of impeachment.
(applause) I mean on day one, he was in violation of Emoluments Clause of the Constitution.
Ellison is the first Muslim member of Congress and a longtime defender of Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan.
The fact that he is being considered to be a leader in the Democratic National Committee should tell the American people just how out of touch and dangerous, if not downright ignorant, the entire party has become.Not only are they putting in positions of power men and women who subscribe to a system of belief that requires it s devotees to commit atrocities against people of other religions, it is also letting the fantasy that just because a candidate that they disagree with won the election, they should be able to have him forcibly removed from office.There are a plethora of minor of even middling issues that republicans and democrats disagree with one another on, but this problem of we don t like the president so we want to get rid of him flies in the very face of democracy.Many republicans don t agree with democratic policies, but you don t see us attempting to remove every legitimately elected government official who gets in the way of our agenda.
