Gayle King was the first to ask Sanders if it was a good idea for Trump to visit.
Sanders said I don t know as he fumbled over his words.
Well, there s one school of thought they re still in the middle of it, King interjected.Sanders said the focus now was on doing everything that could be done to protect the people of Houston.
Sanders did not mention Trump s visit, which will not include Houston due to the ongoing conditions there, but will include Corpus Christi, where Hurricane Harvey made landfall.
Is it too soon for a presidential visit?
co-host Maurice DuBois again asked.
Too soon for the president to be there?
Probably it is, but let s not get into that, Sanders said.
The focus right now has got to be on doing everything that we can do address the terrible, terrible pain that is taking place in that city.
