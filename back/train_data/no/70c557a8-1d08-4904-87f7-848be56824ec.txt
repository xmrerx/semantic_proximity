brussels ( reuters ) - belgium has received proposals from britain and the united states to replace its ageing fleet of fighter jets , while a french proposal that was not part of the tender process will be looked at separately , belgium s defense minister said .
belgium invited government-led proposals in march for the replacement of its fleet of lockheed martin f-16 planes with 34 new fighters , in a deal that could be worth more than 3.5 billion euros ( $ 4.2 billion ) .
last month , france proposed a wide-ranging military deal with belgium instead of responding to the tender .
the deal goes beyond the terms of the tender whilst including the sale of rafale fighter jets .
while the french offer would be discussed by the government , it could open belgium to criticism that it was not treating candidates equally , vandeput said .
to be very clear , the french offer is not part of the contest , minister steven vandeput told a parliamentary committee on wednesday .
offers from the u.s. for lockheed f-35 lightning ii planes and british offers for the eurofighter typhoon did meet the tender rules , the minister added .
a spokeswoman for the defense ministry said the french proposal was being checked by its legal services and forwarded to the government which would decide at a later stage whether or not to respond .
the rafales are made by france s dassault aviation which declined to comment on thursday .
boeing pulled out of the race last spring .
the french government said that its proposal was in line with belgium s request .
we have made an extended proposal which is legally relevant and we are waiting for a proposal by the belgian government , a spokeswoman for the french defense ministry said .
belgium will make a decision on which jet fighter to pick next year .
the 34 jets are to be delivered from 2023 , at a rate of 4-5 aircraft a year .
