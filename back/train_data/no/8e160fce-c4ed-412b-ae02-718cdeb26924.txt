listen : after creating a video that included a vile , beheaded bloody head of president donald trump , the not-so-funny comedian kathy griffin has watched her career falling apart .
in true liberal form , griffin is blaming donald trump and his children for destroying her life , even though much of the outrage from the trump children and his wife melania was over griffin s stated goal of wanting to beat down trump s 11-year old son barron .
even cnn and cnn s anderson cooper , who once considered himself a friend of griffins have alienated themselves from the isis inspired comedian .
no worries though , the man who loves to impersonate donald trump on snl , and who berated his own 11-year old daughter , actor alec baldwin has kathy griffin s back.the 59-year-old actor , who played president donald trump on last season of saturday night live , took to twitter on friday to defend griffin amid the backlash over her controversial photo shoot .
kathy .baby i ve been there , baldwin wrote before referencing his own political drama in 1998 , when he joked about then-representative henry hyde on late night with conan o brien .
the whole henry hyde thing w conan , where we bring out an oxygen mask at the end ?
a joke , he recalled .
that s what i thought .
that s what we intended .
no one walked out of the studio and said , no , we re serious !
no one .
but all your gutless , weasels in the gop insisted i actually threatened hyde .
they played the victim beautifully .
fox newssorry alec but when you start making jokes about our current president being beheaded and actually create visuals to make your point that s when you cross the line from humor to inhumanity .
not that we care , but you re not doing your flailing career any favors by defending isis kathy .
