president trump is once again proving that he will be running the white house in a vastly different manner than his predecessor.for the past several years barack obama welcomed espn to the white house to fill out the ncaa tournament bracket .
the news called this baracketology .
the sports network reached out to the trump staff , asking if the president would be continuing the tradition , but according to the washington post , the offer was declined .
we expressed our interest to the white house in continuing the presidential bracket .
they have respectfully declined , an espn spokesman said in a statement.unfortunately , this tweet might be correct , baracketology may be the best thing obama did while in office.the best thing barack obama did in his 8 years .
