Donald Trump sure is whining a lot in defense of Russia.
In fact, he appears to have never heard the saying about protesting too much.Ever since the CIA concluded along with 17 other intelligence agencies that Russia meddled in our political process to help Trump win the election, the whiner-in-chief has been pouting like a petulant toddler.Trump first repeatedly denied that it was even Russia that attacked us, insisting that any country could have done it and that it could have even been someone living in their mom s basement.Then he claimed that nobody brought us Russian hacking prior to Election Day even though the media and public officials were definitely talking about it because it was one of the biggest stories on the campaign.
Trump himself even encouraged the Russians to keep committing espionage against this country so that he could benefit from it.Now he s trying to deflect by tweeting about how Russia hacked the DNC and discovered that Hillary Clinton supposedly received debate questions in advance.
Of course, Trump conveniently ignores the fact that he got questions in advance, too.Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate?
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 16, 2016You see, Trump wants the public to focus on Hillary Clinton again instead of the fact that Russia helped him win.
While colluding with the Russians to defeat an opponent in the election is illegal, getting questions in advance is not, it s merely unethical.And Twitter users were quick to pounce.
@realDonaldTrump Donald colluding with the Russians would be a much bigger crime.
In fact it would be a crime; what the DNC did was not.
Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) December 16, 2016@realDonaldTrump The information derived from the attack does not negate or lessen the relevance of the source of the attack.
Cody Johnston (@drmistercody) December 16, 2016@realDonaldTrump She received the question unethically, not illegally.
Cody Johnston (@drmistercody) December 16, 2016@realDonaldTrump Her receiving a debate question does not mean that she would make a bad President, or that you would make a better one.
Cody Johnston (@drmistercody) December 16, 2016@realDonaldTrump Honestly, as the President-elect of the United States, this is one of your worst tweets.
Cody Johnston (@drmistercody) December 16, 2016@realDonaldTrump that is not an argument, you fuckturnip.
It s deflection.
You can t keep crying about Hillary.
You have a month to grow up.
Matt Haig (@matthaig1) December 16, 2016@realDonaldTrump your continued deflection and denial is not helping you look particularly innocent.

@realDonaldTrump That was a fine example of Russian manipulation, selectively stealing and sharing emails to put its buddy in office.
Nicholas Kristof (@NickKristof) December 16, 2016@realDonaldTrump ?YOU WON!
Why are you still campaigning?
Focus.
America comes before your tragically fragile ego.
You work for me not Vlad!
Kevin (@TheKevinDent) December 16, 2016@realDonaldTrump if Jesus was alive & part of the electoral college, he wouldn t vote for you.#Truth ?
(@VeeVee) December 16, 2016@realDonaldTrump an attack on our democratic institutions is an attack on all of us.
This isn t a partisan issue.

(@danielsamuels) December 16, 2016Donald Trump does not deserve to be president of this nation.
He cheated to win and now he is beholden to Vladimir Putin.
That s a direct threat to our country from within and if the Electoral College has any decency it will prevent Trump from taking office by voting against him on December 19th.Featured Image: Wonkette
