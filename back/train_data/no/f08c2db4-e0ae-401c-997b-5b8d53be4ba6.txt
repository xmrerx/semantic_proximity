san francisco ( reuters ) - shares of steel makers rallied on wednesday after a rocky start to u.s.-china economic talks raised expectations that president donald trump would impose tariffs on steel imports .
the s & p 1500 steel index .spcomsteel jumped 2.3 percent to its highest level since early may .
u.s. steel ( x.n ) rose 4.9 percent , ak steel ( aks.n ) gained 3.6 percent and nucor ( nue.n ) climbed 2.2 percent .
in opening remarks at an annual summer dialogue between washington and beijing , u.s. commerce secretary wilbur ross criticized china ’ s $ 347 billion trade surplus with the united states .
ross ’ s comments heightened expectations on wall street that trump would follow through on threats to apply new tariffs to remedy a “ big problem ” of steel dumping from china and others .
“ investors are essentially handicapping a probability that trump will announce a broad-based anti-dumping measure on steel imports , ” said longbow research analyst christopher olin .
honoring a promise made in the 2016 election campaign , in april this year trump initiated a “ section 232 ” review of the steel industry , a provision in the trade expansion act of 1962 allowing for the imposition of tariffs or quotas on imports if national security is threatened .
steel producers in the united states , like u.s. steel corp and ak steel , stand to benefit from protectionist tariffs which would enable them to raise their prices .
but such tariffs would hurt u.s. manufacturers who buy steel .
keybanc capital markets analyst philip gibbs said speculation that the commerce department would soon release its section 232 report was helping steel stocks .
he added that potential u.s. tariffs on steel could be found illegal by the world trade organization .
