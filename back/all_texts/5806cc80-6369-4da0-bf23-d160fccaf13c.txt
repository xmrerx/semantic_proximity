The White House confirmed to FOX Business that Priebus would be heading back to Washington D.C. after the stop in Saudi Arabia, part of the president s visit to the Middle East, and insisted this was always part of the administration s plan.Natalie Strom, assistant press secretary at the White House, told FOX Business, It has always been planned for Reince to return to Washington following the Saudi Arabia portion of the trip.
It s a big week in D.C. for the president s agenda with our budget release coming soon and discussions continuing on tax reform, so he s needed back at home for that.
When asked which other officials would be coming home, Strom said, Only a few senior administration officials are staying on for the whole trip, which is typical for these kinds of trips.
They re attending the stops that most pertain to their responsibilities.
Off the top of my head I know that Secretary [of State] Tillerson and General McMaster won t be on for the entirety.
As FOX Business reported Friday, Priebus s position in the White House is once again in jeopardy as National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney are a few of the candidates under consideration to replace him if the president decides to go that route, according to sources close to the situation.On Friday, the White House did not deny the possibility that Priebus could be replaced.While the administration may believe it s typical for some officials to stay and others to head home, according to experts outside the White House, it s unusual for a chief of staff to head home early on such an important trip.
