madrid ( reuters ) - spanish rescue services pulled three drowned men from the strait of gibraltar after rescuing one man from a half-sunken , rickety boat and another from the open sea , an emergency services spokeswoman said on wednesday .
the men are believed to be from a boat that was carrying migrants attempting to cross into europe , the spokeswoman said .
one of the rescued men said there were six people aboard originally , she said .
the search continues for the sixth person .
conditions in the strait of gibraltar - a narrow strip of water that connects the atlantic ocean to the mediterranean sea - are currently dangerous with bad weather and big waves , she said .
tens of thousands of migrants attempt the treacherous crossing of the mediterranean sea from africa every year in unseaworthy boats , leading to thousands of deaths by drowning .
migrant drownings have topped 3,000 on mediterranean sea routes for the fourth straight year , the international organization for migration said on tuesday .
migrants seeking a better life in europe have sought new routes through spain in an effort to get around european union actions to curb migration in the central and eastern mediterranean .
almost 10,300 people arrived in spain by sea in the first seven months of 2017 , the iom said in september , four times as many as in 2016 .
