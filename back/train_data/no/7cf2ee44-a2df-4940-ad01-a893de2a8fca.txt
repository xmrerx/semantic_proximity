rep. trey gowdy was full of sarcasm ( rightfully so ) during comments about why the dnc didn t turn over its hacked computer server to authorities .
the puzzling thing that raised red flags is that the organization said it never received federal assistance causing people to question whether the dnc had something it didn t want law enforcement to see .
congressman gowdy spoke with fox news martha maccallum about why the dnc did not turn over its server to the dhs or fbi officials who could have helped to prevent future hackings : the dnc was hacked during the 2016 election and emails were published by wikileaks .
jkeh johnson , former dhs secretary , testified yesterday that the dnc didn t need help after the hacks.then this shocker after johnson s testimony , debbie wasserman schultz said that while she was chair of the dnc , she was never contacted by any federal agency , including dhs and the fbi , about the hack.gowdy goes on to refer to his career as a prosecutor by implying that it appeared as though the dnc had something to hide : let me hazard a wild guess : that there may be something else on that server they didn t want law enforcement to see ?
