donald trump has been getting heavy media coverage as of late regarding his taxes and sketchy business dealings , with usa today detailing in a recent analysis decades worth of tax evasion and ongoing court battles with the government.but now abc news has obtained new jersey records that show something even more damaging : in 1978 and 1979 , trump paid zero dollars in federal income taxes , and posted net negative earnings in those years .
remember , this is the guy who s supposed to be the financial guru who will save the american economy.as abc details : trump claimed negative income in both those years : losses of $ 406,379 in 1978 and $ 3,443,560 in 1979 .
in 1975 , 1976 , and 1977 , he claimed $ 76,210 , $ 24,594 , and $ 118,530 in income , respectively , paying $ 18,714 , $ 10,832 , and $ 42,386 in federal taxes , according to the document , the report to the casino control commission.now , were these negative postings and subsequent tax evasions before or after his four bankruptcies and court appearances ? in 1979 , trump lost the $ 3.4 million after losing huge in investments on real-estate holdings in new york city : the division notes that in 1978 and 1979 trump incurred no federal income tax liability .
in 1979 , the lack of such liability is primarily attributable to losses incurred by trump in the operation of rental properties located at third avenue , fifth avenue , east 56th street , east 57th street , east 61st street and east 62nd street , new york city , new york.were these failed investments part of his art of the deal ?
considering trump and his business cronies are notorious for overvaluing their properties , this might explain why he lost big in 1979.so not only did trump screw himself over , he ( once again ) screwed over investors an creditors involved in the process.along with panama paper mentions , multiple instances of tax evasion , overvalued properties and now this , no wonder trump has been using every excuse in the book , including an ongoing audit , to not release his taxes which the head of the irs has now completely debunked .
with all these bombshell reports coming out regarding his taxes , land values , and evasions , how many more years did trump lose an exorbitant amount of money thus paying nothing back to society ?
this is highly suspect and a big clue about why he won t release his returns.but with all this information being public if people just take the time to dig , what is he really hiding that could only be found in the documents he won t release ? featured image via john sommers ii/getty images
