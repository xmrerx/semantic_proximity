there is no debating the fact that tensions between the united states and north korea have reached a boiling point .
but what s still being continuously debated is how to handle these tensions.president trump threatened to use fire and fury against north korea after it was revealed that north korea successfully created a miniaturized nuclear weapon designed to fit inside its missiles .
in an interview with nbc s tim russert in 1999 , then businessman donald trump voiced his support for a pre-emptive military strike against north korea.trump told russert that if he was president , a trump administration would negotiate like crazy to get the best deal possible .
if a deal was not possible , trump said he would order a pre-emptive strike .
he went on to successfully predict that that they re [ north korea ] are going to have those weapons pointed all over the world and specifically at the united states .
he goes further by saying that it only does the u.s. minimal good to discuss the economy and social security without addressing the biggest problem : nuclear proliferation .
he also calls out previous politicians including jimmy carter for not facing this situation head on and negotiating properly.following president trump s warning north korea over further provocations , the hermit kingdom has announced it is considering striking guam .
the north korean military warned it may carry out a preemptive operation once the us shows signs of provocation , and that it is seriously considering a strategy to strike guam with mid-to-long range missiles .
as trump moves forward , this interview serves as evidence that his strategy will hold up against north korea.read more : the gateway pundit
