-h pic.twitter.com/ltvyfzte5z hillary clinton ( @ hillaryclinton ) july 23 , 2016much like his new boss , governor kaine is fond of gifts while acting as a public servant .
unlike hillary , his gifts don t seem to have been from wealthy arab nations who top the list of human rights abusers , or the same wall street donors hillary pretends to be fighting against .
virginia sen. tim kaine took advantage of the state s lax gift laws to receive an $ 18,000 caribbean vacation , $ 5,500 in clothes and a trip to watch george mason university play in the ncaa basketball final four during his years as lieutenant governor and governor , according to disclosures he filed.now a leading contender to be hillary clinton s running mate , kaine reported more than $ 160,000 in gifts from 2001 to 2009 , mostly for travel to and from political events and conferences , according to disclosures compiled by the virginia public access project .
the givers included political supporters , a drug company that soon after bought a facility in virginia , and dominion , the state s biggest provider of electricity .
