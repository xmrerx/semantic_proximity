hillary was speaking to the naacp on 10/30/15 and was promoting the obama program to ban the box .
the program bans federal employers from asking if a potential employee has a criminal record .
this is supposed to give criminals a fair shot at employment .
so hillary is jumping on this because it plays to her base , right ?
she is all for criminal justice reform especially for former presidents ?
get ready for the biggest freudian slip ever !
earlier today i announced that as president i will take steps to ban the box , so former presidents won t have to declare their criminal history at the very start of the hiring process .
did you catch that slip of the tongue ?
well , she didn t , and she didn t correct herself !
