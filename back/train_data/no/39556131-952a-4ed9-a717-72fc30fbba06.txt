paris ( reuters ) - france s hardline cgt union on wednesday said it would not join the far-left party of jean-luc melenchon in sept. 23 protests against labor reform in a sign that opposition to president emmanuel macron s plan is divided .
the union will instead march next week , its leader philippe martinez told paris match magazine .
france s second-largest union the cgt and melenchon s france unbowed party are the main opponents of the plan , which includes a cap on payouts for dismissals adjudged unfair and greater freedom for employers to hire and fire .
the largest and third-largest union , the cfdt and fo , have said they would not take to the streets .
the cgt is independent from political parties , martinez said .
he held a rare meeting with melenchon on wednesday .
opinion polls show voters do not like the reforms overall but back most of its individual measures , including direct negotiations between bosses and their staff in small firms .
many in the conservative republicans party , the biggest opposition bloc in parliament , back the reform .
the cgt can mobilize tens of thousands of activists and its absence could impact turnout for melenchon s rally .
the union lost its position in march as france s biggest .
france unbowed has 17 lawmakers and so can do little to block reforms in the 577-strong parliament but melenchon is popular and attracted 19.6 percent of the votes in the first round of the presidential election in april .
the rally is a key test of the party s capacity to mobilize voters against macron .
forty-five percent of voters say melenchon s party is macron s strongest opponent , more than twice the figure for the republicans or the far-right national front , an ifop-fiducial poll showed on tuesday .
