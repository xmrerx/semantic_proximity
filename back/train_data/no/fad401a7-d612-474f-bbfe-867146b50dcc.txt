we d like to offer a special word of thanks to pamela gellar for shining the light on the truth about americans who are being bullied into submission by muslim terrorists.https : //youtu.be/d2mcrb_wxhythis skit points out the ridiculousness of the argument by the left that we need to draw the free speech line at criticizing islam .
it s okay to criticize christianity or judaism .
there s no need to fear criticizing other faiths , but criticize islam and threats made against your life are apparently justified .
funny we don t remember seeing anything in the first amendment that exempts american citizens from criticizing muhammed or the islam faith
