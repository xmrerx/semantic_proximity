danang , vietnam ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump met philippine president rodrigo duterte for the first time at the asia pacific economic cooperation ( apec ) summit in vietnam on saturday .
the meeting was short but was warm and cordial , duterte s spokesman , harry roque , told reporters .
the leaders were generally pleased to finally meet each other in person , he said .
trump told duterte see you tomorrow , roque said .
both the leaders are in danang , vietnam for the apec summit .
trump will head to manila on sunday for the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) summit on the last leg of his 12-day asian trip .
duterte - sometimes described trump of the east because of his brash and mercurial style - had said on wednesday that he would tell the u.s. president to lay off if he raised the issue of human rights when they met .
more than 3,900 filipinos have been killed in what the police call self-defense in duterte s war on drugs .
critics say executions are taking place with zero accountability , allegations the police reject .
but trump , who has been criticized at home for neglecting rights issues in dealings abroad , in may praised duterte for doing an unbelievable job on the drug problem .
human rights , rule of law and due process were among topics trump and duterte would likely discuss during their bilateral talks , sung kim , u.s. ambassador to manila , had said last month .
