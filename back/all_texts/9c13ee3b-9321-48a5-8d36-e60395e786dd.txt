About a month ago, people started noticing a large black man who always seemed to rush to Hillary s aid during coughing fits, or when she exhibits bizarre behavior.
Hillary attempted to disparage Trump during one of her first appearances before the press since the last time in July where she appeared to have a seizure while being asked about her vice presidential options.Watch this video in slow motion.
Pay particular attention to the expressions on the interviewers faces: On August 6, Mike Cernovich started asking about Hillary s mystery handler:Hillary's Handler?
