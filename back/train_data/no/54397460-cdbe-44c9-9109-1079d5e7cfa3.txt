who is silencing political speech , physically attacking those with divergent views , demanding that every american share one single ideology .
but sadly , the real truth is that these violent agitators have little idea about why they march .
theirs is a movement with no cause , a temper tantrum with no purpose .
they are a generation lost in space .a propaganda arm of the party of disappointment .
if i were wrong , would hillary clinton really be their standard bearer ?
these rioters are being manipulated by big government forces who need them to regain political power
