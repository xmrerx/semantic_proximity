hillary took a jab at saudi arabia during her statement on the terror attack in orlando but now we find out that the saudis are major contributors to her campaign .
it s the height of hypocrisy for clinton to make claims of saudi arabia while taking their millions .
thank goodness for social media and all the resources we have to expose this corrupt and hypocritical hag grifter in what may be the pinnacle of hypocrisy , moments ago hillary clinton , while speaking live on national security and addressing the orlando shooting took some time from her constant bashing of the second amendment and calling for a ban on assault rifles , to say some less than kind words about saudi arabia whom it accused of supporting radical organizations .
this is what she said : the third area that demands attention is preventing radicalization and countering efforts by isis and other international terrorist networks to recruit in the united states and europe .
for starters , it is long past time for the saudis , the qataris and the kuwaitis and others to stop their citizens from funding extremist organizations .
and they should stop supporting radical schools and mosques around the world that have set too many young people on a path towards extremism .
we also have to use all our capabilities to counter jihadist propaganda online .
this is something that i spend a lot of time on at the state department.there is nothing wrong with that statement , as it is the whole truth saudi arabia s involvement in supporting terrorism stretches from sept 11 all the way through to isis however , where there is a big , and potentially law-breaking , problem is what jordan s official news agency , petra news agency , reported on sunday citing the saudi crown price , namely that saudi arabia is a major funder of hillary clinton s campaign to become the next president of the united states.as mee notes , the petra news agency published on sunday what it described as exclusive comments from saudi deputy crown prince mohammed bin salman which included a claim that riyadh has provided 20 percent of the total funding to the prospective democratic candidate s campaign.the report was later deleted and the news agency has not responded to requests for comment from middle east eye .
however , the deletion took place too late , as the washington-based institute for gulf affairs managed to capture the report and has re-published the original arabic petra report , which quoted prince mohammed as having said saudi arabia had provided with full enthusiasm an undisclosed amount of money to clinton.read more and view report : zero hedge
