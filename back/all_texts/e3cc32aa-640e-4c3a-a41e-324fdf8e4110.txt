Donald Trump once again bullied NBC correspondent Katy Tur during a rally and put her safety at risk, prompting Nicole Wallace to blast the Republican nominee in response.During a Florida rally on Wednesday, boos and jeers were aimed at Katy Tur by a crowd of thousands after Trump accused her of not showing the size of the audience on camera as some sort of scheme by the media to rig the election.Here s footage of the rally via YouTube: It is a unique experience to have an entire crowd of people, whether it is an open-air venue, like we were today, or a stadium with 10,000+ people booing you, Tur told Brian Williams after the event.Tur explained that Trump knows he is full of shit because he jokes in private to reporters that he knows how television works and that while one camera is trained on the candidate to get his speech on tape, there are plenty of other cameras filming crowd shots.
This is a schtick that he does to rile up his base, it s to give them an excuse for polls that might not be in his favor, it s to give them an excuse to berate someone other than Donald Trump and to blame somebody for something that doesn t look as good as they want it to look, Tur said.But while Tur braved the storm and stood her ground against Trump, GOP strategist Nicole Wallace reacted with shock that a presidential candidate would engage in such bullying.
It s bullying, it s bullying a woman, Wallace began when asked about her thoughts on Trump attacking Tur.
It s bullying a journalist who covers him.
It s not only odd in politics, it s odd in public life.
It s something that if any of our kids did in school they probably would get kicked out He has normalized cyber-bullying, he has normalized the sort of bullying of a woman in a huge chanting crowd, he has normalized behavior that maybe had its seed in standing up to what a lot of Republicans think is a biased media, but it has taken on a life of its own that is dangerous and sinister.
In the end, it will not help him win it will be part of the reason that he loses.
Here s the video via YouTube:Trump s attack on Tur is especially dangerous because his deplorable supporters are bloodthirsty right now and have threatened Democrats and the media with violence if Trump doesn t win the election.
Tur even had to have Secret Service protection earlier this year because Trump singled her out at a rally and caused his supporters to put her safety in serious jeopardy.
Such behavior by a presidential candidate, or anyone for that matter, is unacceptable.Donald Trump is a bully and America does not need a bully in the White House, especially since he is a thin-skinned bully who would have control of the military and our nuclear arsenal, a dangerous combination since Trump is easily provoked by even the smallest of slights.Featured Image: Screenshot
