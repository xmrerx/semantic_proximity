hillary has a history of pulling out the pandering southern accent when in the south .
i m from the south and find this so offensive as i m sure many others do .
southerners can smell a phony a mile away .
hillary clinton sat down for a chair chat with the chairman of the democratic party of south carolina .
during the interview , as in many of her speeches to people who live in the south , she put on a southern accent that is absent from her speeches to northerners .
we made a mashup of some of the most painfully pandering moments , and ranked the intensity of her accent with cowboy boots ( 1 = lowest , 5 = strongest ) .
