moscow ( reuters ) - russia protested to the united states on wednesday after it said russian flags were stolen from its consulate in san francisco , a charge that washington immediately disputed .
russian staff left the consulate last month after washington ordered moscow to vacate some of its diplomatic properties , part of a series of tit-for-tat actions as relations sour between the two countries .
u.s. officials have since occupied administrative parts of the compound .
russia said last week they had broken into residential areas and it threatened retaliation over what it called an illegal act .
the latest shameful event .
in san francisco ( russian ) flags have been stolen from the building of @ consulrussiasf , the russian embassy to the united states said on its russian-language twitter account .
we demand the american authorities return our state symbols , it said alongside pictures of a bare flagpole on top of the consulate building .
the u.s. state department offered a different account of events .
the flags at the former russian consular properties in san francisco were respectfully lowered and are safely stored within each of the buildings , a state department official said in an email .
the russian embassy in washington was not immediately available for comment .
russian news agencies cited the russian embassy as saying it had lodged a formal protest over the incident .
a strong protest was sent to the american side in relation to russian flags being torn down at our diplomatic properties in san francisco , which are under the control of u.s. authorities , interfax news agency quoted the embassy as saying in a statement .
we consider this as an extremely unfriendly step , the embassy said .
