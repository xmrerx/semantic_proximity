this is pretty scary stuff .
a federal government agency run by an obama crony attempting to penetrate the firewall of a state agency tasked with overseeing the elections ?
what conceivable reason could obama s dhs have for hacking the georgia sec of state s office after the election ? georgia s secretary of state has claimed the department of homeland security tried to breach his office s firewall and has issued a letter to homeland security secretary jeh johnson asking for an explanation.brian kemp issued a letter to johnson on thursday after the state s third-party cybersecurity provider detected an ip address from the agency s southwest d.c. office trying to penetrate the state s firewall .
according to the letter , the attempt was unsuccessful.the attempt took place on nov. 15 , a few days after the presidential election .
the office of the georgia secretary of state is responsible for overseeing the state s elections .
at no time has my office agreed to or permitted dhs to conduct penetration testing or security scans of our network , kemp wrote in the letter , which was also sent to the state s federal representatives and senators .
moreover , your department has not contacted my office since this unsuccessful incident to alert us of any security event that would require testing or scanning of our network .
this is especially odd and concerning since i serve on the election cyber security working group that your office created .
the department of homeland security has received secretary kemp s letter , a dhs spokesperson told cyberscoop .
we are looking into the matter .
dhs takes the trust of our public and private sector partners seriously , and we will respond to secretary kemp directly .
georgia was one of two states that refused cyber-hygiene support and penetration testing from dhs in the lead up to the presidential election .
the department had made a significant push for it after hackers spent months exposing the democratic national committee s internal communications and data.david dove , kemp s chief of staff , told cyberscoop the georgia secretary of state s office got a lot of grief for refusing help from dhs .
we basically said we don t need dhs s help , because of the contract with the third-party provider , dove said.the office of the georgia secretary of state would not reveal who the provider is , only saying the company analyzes more than 180 billion events a day globally across a 5,000+ customer base which includes many fortune 500 companies .
johnson announced shortly after the election that dhs found no evidence of an attack on election day.in the months and weeks leading up to the election fake news sources like the washington post did everything in their power to convince americans that georgia was in play for hillary : the attempt took place on nov. 15 , a few days after the presidential election .

the department had made a significant push for it after hackers spent months exposing the democratic national committee s internal communications and data.in an interview with politico , kemp intimated that the federal government s hacking fears were overblown , saying they now think our whole system is on the verge of disaster because some russian s going to tap into the voting system .

while the majority of states worked with dhs for help in protecting their election systems from hacks , cybersecurity experts were at oddsas to what portions of the country would be targeted for election day attacks.johnson announced shortly after the election that dhs found no evidence of an attack on election day .

leftist news sources like the washington post tried to convince voters that hillary had a shot at winning the solidly red state of georgia : a new atlanta journal-constitution poll of the presidential race in that state puts hillary clinton in a slight lead over donald trump , 44 to 40 .
this is inside-the-margin-of-error stuff , mind you , but only barely .
( it s also a break from the state of the race in the realclearpolitics polling average , which gives trump a four-point lead , though with only a handful of polls included .
) georgia has been shifting a bit politically in recent presidential elections , becoming slightly less republican relative to the rest of the country but it still has been voting more republican than america on the whole .
so in 2012 , when barack obama won by four points , mitt romney won georgia by eight making the state 12 points more republican , just a tick less than it was in 2008.with so many forces , and resources being used against donald j. trump , it s absolutely amazing he won the election
