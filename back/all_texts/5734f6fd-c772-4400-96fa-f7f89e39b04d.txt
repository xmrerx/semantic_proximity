Coming off from her latest record-breaking album and a performance at the GRAMMYs, singer/songwriter extraordinaire Adele decided to take some downtime and enjoy Disneyland with her partner Simon Konecki and son Angelo.Her security detail must have been fierce, and day guided by Disney s wonderful cast members, but as you can see in the picture below, she and her little family seemed to have the time of their lives strolling through the park and clearly buying up a lot of the merchandise.Something else was noticed in the photos, too.
Adele s son appears to be enjoying his fun-filled day at the park dressed as Anna from Disney s mega-hit Frozen, complete with dress and ballet flats.
It seems as if the singer is allowing her son to completely be himself and choose what he wants to like and enjoy.1.
Adele let her son dress up as Anna from Frozen.

Back in 2012 she told TIME magazine that she ll always accept him.
He makes me so proud of myself, and he makes me like myself so much.
I ve never not liked myself.
I don t have hangups like that.
But I m so proud of myself that I made him in my belly I can t wait to know who his best friends are going to be, who his girlfriend or his boyfriend is going to be or what movies he likes Whatever my kid wants to do or be I will always support him no matter what.
And she s clearly holding true to her word.Adele s son Angelo isn t the only little guy who enjoys the amazing fashion of Frozen.
Just last fall, another parent made news on Facebook when he posted a picture of his son in his Halloween costume of choice as Elsa.
Here s the thing about childhood.
It s important to let your kids be kids and have fun, and Adele seems to perfectly be doing just that.Featured image: DailyMail
