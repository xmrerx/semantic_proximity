berlin ( reuters ) - a regional parliament has lifted the immunity of the best known politician in the anti-immigration alternative for germany ( afd ) party , opening the way for prosecutors to pursue possible perjury charges against her .
frauke petry , who is the afd s co-chairwoman , has been dogged by allegations that she lied under oath to a committee of the saxony parliament about how the party s campaign for the 2014 election in the state was financed .
the ending of her immunity from prosecution adds to the right-wing party s problems less than four weeks before a national election .
weakened by infighting , it has bled support over the last year as voters concerns about immigration have eased .
prosecutors have pursued the case against petry , who denies the allegations , for more than a year .
her immunity as a member of the saxony s parliament ended at midnight , a spokesman for the assembly said .
a spokesman for prosecutors in the state capital dresden said they would await written confirmation of that from the parliament s president before any further proceedings could be agreed upon .
the afd is polling between 7 and 10 percent in opinion surveys - well down from a high of 15.5 percent at the end of 2016 but still clearing the 5-percent threshold needed to enter the federal parliament in the sept. 24 national election .
petry cuts an increasingly isolated figure in the afd , which she transformed from an anti-euro party at its founding in 2013 into a group that taps into voters concerns about migration .
the party soared in the polls after chancellor angela merkel s decision in 2015 to open germany s borders to migrants fleeing war and poverty in the middle east and beyond , of whom more than a million have since arrived .
at a party conference in april , petry suffered a humiliating defeat when delegates refused to discuss her plan to shift the party towards the mainstream .
