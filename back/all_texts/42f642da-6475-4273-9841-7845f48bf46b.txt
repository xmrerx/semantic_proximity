MELBOURNE, FL is a town with a population of 76,000.
Trump held an enormous rally there yesterday, and over 15,000 people had to be turned away.Unbelievable evening in Melbourne, Florida w/ 15,000 supporters- and an additional 12,000 who could not get in.
Thank you!

MAGA (@steve0m2) September 28, 2016Hillary Clinton on the other hand had barely 400 people at her rally Tuesday in Raleigh, North Carolina.Since August 1st when both parties conventions concluded, Trump has had more than 312,000 people at his events with thousands turned away due to space limitations.
He has set records for some of these locations in attendance.
However, Hillary has only had 12,000 total at her rallies since August 1st.
