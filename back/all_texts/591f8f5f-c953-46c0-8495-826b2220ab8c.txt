Outspoken conservative Tomi Lahren makes some great points about the failing mainstream media and the failing Democrat party blaming fake news conservative news for Hillary s loss.
To say Facebook favoritism got Donald Trump elected is the most ridiculous thing I ve heard yet.
We already know Facebook is in the business of censoring and de-prioritizing conservative leading posts.
