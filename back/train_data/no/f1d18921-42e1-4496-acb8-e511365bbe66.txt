while in the united states , special investigator robert mueller is in the midst of making the case that russia interfered with our election , there are apparently no questions about it in russia .
a television host for russian state television admitted that they , as in russians , elected trump .
the host isn t happy with the decision , either. # russia s state tv host pours more gas on the fire , saying : so why did we elect such a president ?
audience claps.https : //t.co/se8pzkkxup julia davis ( @ juliadavisnews ) september 1 , 2017it gets worse for trump .
the host compared the reality star to a baby. # russia s state tv : trump is a political infant , who is being severely swaddled .
female host adds : and placed into geopolitical coffin .

they re turning on their pet project and you went along ignorantly , willingly # sad elizabeth ( @ ebishopphoto ) september 1 , 2017did # russians elect # trump ?

popov is drunk .
zakir zakirov ( @ zakir_zakirov ) september 1 , 2017there s a lot of dismay at the fact that russian tv would admit to installing a puppet president , right in front of a potential world audience , but the fact is that they don t care .
they have nothing to lose by the truth coming out , except for trump s loyalty , which they are increasingly seeing as irrelevant , simply because he s such a doofus and completely ineffective .
the worst that will be done to russia is more sanctions.featured image via handout/getty images
