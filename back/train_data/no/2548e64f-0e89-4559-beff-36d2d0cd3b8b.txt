here s the real reason mitt romney came out against trump .
if you can t beat a candidate on the same team fair and square , resort to plan b right ?
ironically , if the gop establishment fought back against obama as hard as they re fighting against trump , he wouldn t likely be the front-runner right now.former speaker of the house john boehner has endorsed current speaker rep. paul ryan ( r-wi ) for president , in the event that no republican candidate achieves a majority on the first ballot at the republican national convention in cleveland in july.politico reports that boehner , speaking at a conference in boca raton , florida , said : if we don t have a nominee who can win on the first ballot , i m for none of the above .
they all had a chance to win .
none of them won .
so i m for none of the above .
i m for paul ryan to be our nominee .
late tuesday evening , as results from primary contests confirmed donald trump s victories in four out of five states , cnbc reported that ryan had not ruled out accepting such a nomination.exclusive : paul ryan wo n't categorically rule out accepting gop nominationif a deadlocked convention turns to him https : //t.co/kuxsywedzg cnbc now ( @ cnbcnow ) march 16 , 2016ryan was welcomed by conservatives as mitt romney s choice for running mate in 2012 .
the pro-life fiscal conservative had led the charge to reform entitlements , and used his policy prowess to point out the deep flaws in obamacare during the intense debates of 2009-10.in the aftermath of that 2012 loss , ryan turned his attention to the task of governing rather than opposing , convinced that republicans shared responsibility with democrats and the president .
as a result , he showed an openness to compromise on immigration and on budget issues that resulted in the erosion of some conservative support .
