tokyo ( reuters ) - japanese prime minister shinzo abe said on sunday the government will proceed with a scheduled sales tax increase in 2019 unless the economy suffers a shock as big as the 2008 collapse of lehman brothers .
he also defended the government s plan to divert some of the proceeds from the scheduled tax hike to 10 percent from 8 percent to child care and education , saying that investing in children will undoubtedly lead to stronger economic growth .
our administration has worked on fiscal reform more than any other administration , abe told a television program as his ruling bloc headed for a big win in sunday s general election .
in order to pay back japan s public debt , you need economic growth , he said .
we d like to proceed with fiscal reform by spurring economic growth and investment , abe said , suggesting his administration will continue to focus on reflating growth rather than fiscal austerity .
abe s ruling bloc was set for a big win in sunday s election , bolstering his chances of becoming the nation s longest-serving premier .
abe twice delayed the sales tax hike to 10 percent after an earlier increase to 8 percent tipped japan into recession .
analysts say increasing the levy is crucial to rein in japan s huge public debt which , at twice the size of its economy , is the biggest among major industrialized nations .
