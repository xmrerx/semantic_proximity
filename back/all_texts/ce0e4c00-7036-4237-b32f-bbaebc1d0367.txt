(Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf said late on Sunday a bill to increase funding in the state will become law, about 24 hours before the 10-day period for him to veto the blueprint runs out.
Pennsylvania lawmakers passed the $31.6 billion spending plan on Thursday, a day before the deadline for the start of fiscal 2017.
The state will still not have a complete revenue plan to pay for the increased spending, so the legislature will have to keep working on the same.
