WATCH: Sobbing woman confronts Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau over the cost of her hydro bill #cdnpoli pic.twitter.com/MPAc7v6noI Globalnews.ca (@globalnews) January 13, 2017Prime Minister Justin Trudeau issued an ultimatum to the provinces in October 2016, announcing his government s plan to set a minimum carbon tax even as environment ministers were meeting in Montreal to discuss options for carbon pricing.Several provinces and territories reacted angrily three environment ministers walked out of the federal-provincial climate talks after Mr. Trudeau s unilateral announcement in the House of Commons.
Saskatchewan Premier Brad Wall said the decision is a betrayal of the co-operative approach the Prime Minister had promised and that the tax would devastate his province s economy.The self-described feminist leader of Canada however seems hell-bent on pushing his radical agenda on his citizens.
Kudos to this brave woman for speaking out against him
