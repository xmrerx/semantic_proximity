LONDON (Reuters) - British police said on Friday that they were treating as a terrorist incident reports of a blast at a west London metro station.
Armed police rushed to reports of a fire on a train at a London underground station with local media reporting there had been an explosion on a packed rush-hour commuter train.
Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, the senior national coordinator for CT policing, has declared it a terrorist incident, the Metropolitan Police said in a statement on Friday.
