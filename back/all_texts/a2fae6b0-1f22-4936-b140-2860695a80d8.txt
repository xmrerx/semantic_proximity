What is up with Sean Hannity lately?
Last night, he asked whether there would be outcry if a theater company put on a play in which an Obama lookalike was killed, completely ignoring or forgetting the fact that that very thing happened in 2012.
Tonight, though, in pushing his point that the Russia investigation is just one huge witch hunt, he made a truly ridiculous comparison to another conspiracy theory.Hannity was trying to defend his lord, hero, and savior, Donald Trump, by complaining about the Russia investigation to Jay Sekulow, part of Trump s legal team.
He asked Sekulow whether he thought the whole Trump-Russia conspiracy was like birtherism.Seriously.
Watch below:Sean Hannity just defended DONALD FREAKING TRUMP by comparing the Russia conspiracies to birther conspiracies Can t make this shit up pic.twitter.com/rrjulSuRaO Andrew Lawrence (@ndrew_lawrence) June 20, 2017Yes, you just watched Sean Hannity try to make the Russia scandal sound as empty and vapid as all of the quests to prove President Obama wasn t a natural-born citizen of the U.S., even though Obama proved them wrong.
The Russia scandal and birtherism aren t comparable at all for a lot of reasons.Hannity even promoted the birther conspiracy on his show, going so far as to tell Obama to show the birth certificate.
Get it over and done with, and asking why the White House wouldn t release it.So he should know all about it.
But since when do facts actually matter to Sean Hannity?Featured image via Rob Kim/Getty Images
