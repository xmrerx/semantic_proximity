Donald Trump s economic proposals would be disastrous for the economy.
That s the conclusion that Germany s economic ministry concluded in an internal memo, first reported on by the German magazine Der Spiegel.According to the memo, if Trump were to be elected president of the United States his economic policies would lead to a shrinking gross domestic product, fewer jobs and higher unemployment.
What s more, the memo says that Trump s economic policies violate both U.S. and international law.
In a more blunt statement, the memo says that Trump s proposals are not feasible and that they do not provide the foundation for a realistic economic policy.
So to summarize, Germany s economics ministry has officially concluded that Trump s proposals would destroy the U.S. economy and are completely divorced from reality.
That s an incredibly strong condemnation from one of the United States strongest allies, and one of the most powerful economies in the world, and according to analysis by the Tax Policy Center, Trump s proposals would reduce income revenue by $2.6 and $5.9 trillion dollars over the next 10 years.
In September, the economics research firm Oxford Economics found that if elected president, Trump s economic proposals would cause the economy to be $1 trillion dollars smaller in the year 2021 than experts are currently expecting.It isn t particularly easy for economists to create a complete prediction of what the future would look like after a Trump administration.
There are many factors, such as his policies regarding immigration, that contribute to the various possible outcomes.
Obviously, it s not yet clear what policies he will put into place when.
That being said, it appears more and more to be a matter of finding out exactly just how bad these possible outcomes are than a matter of whether they re bad or not a Trump presidency would unquestionably be an economic disaster for the United States.Featured image from Alex Wong/Getty Images
