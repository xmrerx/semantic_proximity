TOKYO (Reuters) - A Japan Airlines (JAL) plane made an emergency landing at Tokyo s Haneda International Airport shortly after takeoff on Tuesday following an apparent bird strike, an airline spokesman said.
There were no injuries among any of the 248 people on board, the spokesman said.
Video footage appeared to show flames shooting from one engine of the Boeing 777 soon after takeoff.
A bird strike was believed to be the cause, although it was still being investigated, the spokesman said.
The plane, bound for New York, was carrying 233 passengers and 15 staff.
