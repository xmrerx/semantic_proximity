ankara ( reuters ) - turkey s border with northern iraq remains open , although that does not mean it will remain so , the turkish customs minister said on wednesday , adding the number of trucks passing through had decreased .
bulent tufenkci also said he did not believe that the kurdish independence referendum in northern iraq would have a big impact on turkish trade with baghdad .
president tayyip erdogan has said iraqi kurds would go hungry if his country halts the flow of trucks and oil across the border , warning that turkey could take military and economic measures against its neighbor after the referendum the habur border gate is open for now , we see that the numbers of vehicles passing are decreased , tufenkci said , referring to the main border crossing with northern iraq .
the habur border gate being open for now does not mean that it will remain open , he said in comments broadcast live on television .
turkey , home to the region s largest kurdish population , has been battling a three-decade insurgency in its largely kurdish southeast and fears the referendum , held earlier this week , will inflame separatist tension at home .
we can continue trading with the iraqi central government through iran or via sea or airways , tufenkci said .
turkey has long been northern iraq s main link to the outside world , with a turkish oil pipeline connecting northern iraq to global energy markets .
iraq , including the kurdish region , was turkey s third-largest export market in 2016 , according to imf data .
turkish exports to the country totaled $ 8.6 billion , behind germany and the united kingdom .
