CNN is definitely sick and tired of Donald Trump calling them fake news.
During an interview with Erin Burnett on Friday, Bernie Sanders jokingly referred to CNN as fake news to mock Donald Trump.
Sanders even made sure to let Burnett know that he was just joking and Burnett acknowledged that Sanders was just joking.
Soon after, a technical difficulty arose as Sanders could no longer hear Burnett.
CNN then went to commercial, and Burnett apologized to the audience and to Sanders for the issue and resumed the conversation.Here s the video via CNN.Well, Fox News claimed that CNN cut off Sanders in retaliation for his fake news joke.
And then Donald Trump tweeted about it several minutes later and made the same claim.While on FAKE NEWS @CNN, Bernie Sanders was cut off for using the term fake news to describe the network.
They said technical difficulties!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 12, 2017That s when CNN proceeded to strongly fire back as Brian Stelter set the record straight by linking to the full video of the interview and call Trump out for lying.Untrue.
Sanders was *criticizing Trump* for calling CNN fake news.
You can see for yourself, all 11 minutes, here: https://t.co/qhtlb5Wo6Q https://t.co/AcwOiNHi0j Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 12, 2017Stop me if you ve heard this one before.
But @FoxAndFriends covered the Bernie technical difficulties thing at 6:40.
Trump tweeted at 7:14 https://t.co/AcwOiNHi0j Brian Stelter (@brianstelter) February 12, 2017And then CNN Communications issued a transcript of the interview as further proof that Trump is lying.
@realDonaldTrump False.
Transcript from @ErinBurnett intvu w @SenSanders.
He was not cut off.
Those are the facts.

But if he had simply taken ten minutes to watch the actual interview, he would know that Sanders was only joking, and that CNN did not cut Sanders off.
It really was a technical difficulty and Sanders was able to continue the interview after the issue was fixed.
But Trump didn t bother to do that, and he got his ass handed to him for it.Last week, Trump claimed that CNN host Chris Cuomo failed to ask a guest a specific question, only to get skewered by Cuomo and CNN Communications again for lying.
Had Trump watched the very beginning of the interview, he wouldn t have humiliated himself.. @ChrisCuomo did address that point at the start of his interview.
Those are the facts: https://t.co/JWJEAshv1y CNN Communications (@CNNPR) February 9, 2017Donald Trump won t bother to do simple research before he runs his mouth on Twitter, and that means he probably doesn t bother to do any research before making decisions as president.
That s not only scary, it s stupid.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images
