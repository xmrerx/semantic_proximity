michael conger was arrested by eustis police once on a violation of a probation warrant and jeremy robertson had never been arrested by the marion county sheriff s dept. , they only knew of robertson s whereabouts after a tip came in to inform them that he was in the area and had a criminal history .
based on their past history with this particular sheriff s department , it s easy to see why they had a bone to pick with them or maybe they just caught the f * # k the police fever ?
thanks for placing a bullseye on the backs of our law enforcement officers barack marion county sheriff s deputies seized 22 firearms after receiving a tip that a rocket-propelled grenade launcher and missiles would be used against eustis police , st. mary of the lakes catholic church and a local elk s club.the weapons , along with several containers of black powder , marijuana , powdered and crack cocaine , prescription pills , scales , other drug paraphernalia and two bulletproof vests were found in a marion county shed , authorities said monday.deputies said they received information that the occupants of the shed intended to use the rocket launcher on the eustis police department on monday because of recent run-ins with officers.eustis police chief fred cobb told local 6 , however , that he was blindsided by the threat because his department had little to no contact with two men arrested in the case.https : //youtu.be/ojuoydtnjd4cobb said christopher michael conger was arrested by eustis police on a violation of probation warrant .
cobb said that his department knows about jeremy robertson only because his staff received a tip notifying them that he was in the area and was known to carry drugs and weapons .
it s a reminder for the public that we serve that this is a dangerous profession , cobb said .
even in small-town u.s.a. , eustis , florida .
