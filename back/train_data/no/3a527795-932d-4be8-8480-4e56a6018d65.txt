santiago ( reuters ) - center-left senator alejandro guillier and conservative billionaire sebastian pinera will go head to head in a runoff for chile s presidency on sunday , after securing the top two spots in the nov. 19 first-round vote .
there have been no major polls in the past month , leaving few indications of who will succeed outgoing center-left president michelle bachelet in the world s top copper producer .
below are the main proposals from both candidates : - the former journalist , elected to the senate in 2013 , has promised to deepen the progressive tax , education and labor reforms of ideological ally bachelet .
his spending plan includes investments in housing and infrastructure and carries a price tag of $ 10 billion .
- guillier has pledged to diversify chile s economy away from copper , or add value to exports by processing the metal at home .
he would seek a plebiscite in 2018 to rewrite the dictatorship-era constitution to include more protections for workers and indigenous communities .
- since the first round , guillier and pinera have both endorsed a public option to compete with chile s private pension funds .
once widely praised worldwide , they have been criticized for delivering too-small payouts .
guillier has also recommended a new , mandatory contribution from employers .
- guillier and pinera have both called for repeal of state-run copper producer codelco s mandatory contribution of 10 percent of profits to the military .
guillier has signaled he would seek to maintain the government s strong ties with codelco workers , something that has spared the company from strikes that have hit private miners under bachelet .
- the billionaire businessman , who served as president from 2010 to 2014 , has promised to make chile the first country in latin america to achieve developed nation status in the organization for economic cooperation and development , a paris-based club of wealthy nations .
- pinera , the investor favorite , would cut corporate taxes to increase investment .
he said his policies would double chile s economic growth and eliminate poverty by 2025 .
- pinera s $ 14 billion , four-year spending plan includes an overhaul of bachelet s tax reform , and $ 2.7 billion in new investments in infrastructure and hospitals .
pinera said he would pay for his proposals by cutting unnecessary government spending and simplifying the tax code .
- pinera wants to revitalize and increase competition in chile s private pension system .
his plan includes new subsidies to raise pensions for women and the middle class , as well as incentives to encourage workers to retire later .
- he wants codelco to deploy a realistic investment plan using existing resources and to focus on existing assets rather than new projects .
