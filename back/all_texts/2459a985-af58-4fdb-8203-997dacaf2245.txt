Just what we need another Trump-bashing RINO.
Carpetbagger Mitt Romney is trying yet another run at getting elected for something.
His track record isn t so great but he just announced his run for Senator of Utah.
His first ad released this morning takes a swipe at President Trump s immigration policy to put Americans first.
Notice how he says immigrants .

It s the ILLEGALS who have broken the law that we don t welcome.
Romney used the oldest trick in the political playbook to conflate legal immigrants with illegal aliens.
He should just run as a Democrat Former Massachusetts governor and one-time Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is running for the U.S. Senate in Utah.
