MADRID (Reuters) - A Spanish judge has not yet issued a European arrest warrant for ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and would most likely do so on Friday, a senior court source said on Thursday.
Puigdemont s Belgian lawyer had previously said the warrant had already been issued.
The reason for the differing accounts was not immediately clear.
