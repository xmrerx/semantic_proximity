Donald Trump has absolutely no evidence that President Obama wiretapped him, and former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper knows it.On Saturday, Trump made wild accusations against President Obama after reading a conspiracy theory on Breitbart.Trump says that Obama illegally wiretapped Trump Tower and compared it to Watergate.
On Sunday, Trump demanded that Congress start an investigation against Obama and declared that he would refuse to answer further questions about Russia until they comply.Of course, Trump is clearly trying to distract the media and Congress from investigating the Russia scandal he has been embroiled in for months.While there is plenty of evidence against Trump to justify investigations into his ties to Russia, Trump has offered no proof to back up his accusations against Obama.And if anyone would know about a wiretap against Trump, whether legal or illegal, it would be former National Intelligence Director James Clapper, who served in the position from 2010 until this year.During an interview with Chuck Todd, Clapper flatly denied that President Obama wiretapped Trump.Todd began by asking if he would have been aware of such a wiretap and Clapper shut down the accusation.
I would certainly hope so, Clapper replied.
I will say that the part of the national security apparatus that I oversaw the DNI there was no such wiretap activity mounted against the president the president-elect at that time or as a candidate or against his campaign.
When asked if other agencies would have requested a FISA court order to wiretap Trump Tower, Clapper said that that s exactly what they would do.In the end, Clapper told Todd that he can clearly deny that President Obama ordered a wiretap of Trump Tower because it did not happen.
I can deny it, Clapper said.Here s the video via Twitter.James Clapper: There was no such wire tap activity amounted against Donald Trump.

By not providing any evidence of his claims, Trump is slandering President Obama s good name and there should be consequences for these wild unfounded accusations.If Trump is willing to stoop this low to distract from his Russia scandal, then he must be really desperate.
That means Congress should be investigating Trump, not Obama.Featured image via screenshot
