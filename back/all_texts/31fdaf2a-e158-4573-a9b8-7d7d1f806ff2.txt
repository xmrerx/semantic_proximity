Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill, in a bid to demonize Jeff Sessions as Russian agent, said back in March she had never met nor spoke on the phone with a Russian ambassador ever.
A simple look at her old tweets showed almost immediately that was a lie.I've been on the Armed Services Com for 10 years.No call or meeting w/Russian ambassador.
Ever.
Ambassadors call members of Foreign Rel Com.

Upset about the arbitrary/cruel decision to end all US adoptions,even those in process.
Claire McCaskill (@clairecmc) January 30, 2013On Monday, CNN reported McCaskill not only met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, but she attended a private dinner at his house in 2015.
Information LiberationCNN -In March, Sen. Claire McCaskill was unambiguous.
The Missouri Democrat said she never once met with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak in her 10 years serving on the Senate Armed Services Committee.This is NOT winning.
