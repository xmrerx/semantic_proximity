New Black Panther Entertainer of The Year, Beyonce showed up at the White House dressed like a two-bit hooker for the annual Easter Egg Roll.
I suppose it s a better choice than her militant, bullet laden, Black Panther Super-Bowl get-up but seriously isn t this supposed to be a family event?!
!Beyonce dressed in her Easter breast to crash the White House.The Formation singer busted out a $3,510 Marco de Vincenzo pink-and-white lace dress and sky-high heels for her surprise appearance at the Easter Egg Roll with the First Family on Monday.Beyonce arrived in a black-and-white striped Alice and Olivia power coat that matched Jay-Z s nautical-striped shirt, which he paired with a black blazer.https://twitter.com/BeyonceNation4/status/714499038926802945But tongues wagged after Yonce dropped the jacket.
While Blue Ivy looked like an adorable little Easter Bunny in a fluffy white coat and bunny ears, her famous mother was working a lingerie-inspired outfit that made her look more like a Playboy Bunny.Appalling and tasteless.

Nice see through outfit to wear to a kids function, griped Melody Kolb on Twitter.
She looks ridiculous.
