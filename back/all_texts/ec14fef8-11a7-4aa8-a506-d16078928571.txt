Nobody can accuse former GOP Rep. Joe Walsh of having a clear view of anything.
That s never been more apparent than last night, as Walsh put his response to the news of at least two snipers murdering Dallas police officers into a series of tweets.
He hates President Obama, and now he gets to blame Obama for someone s death.
He didn t stop there, though.
No, merely misplacing blame isn t low enough for this sewer scum.
He said:Then he went on a rant against Obama that he no doubt thinks is rife with patriotism, but in reality is nothing more than racist, projectile word vomit:When Obama goes after cops it opens the door for anti cop rhetoric and action.

Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) July 8, 2016 It s time 4 patriotic Americans to stand up & stand against all the Cop haters from Obama to the thugs on the street.It s way past time.
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) July 8, 2016After he was done with that, and the Internet had long since begun to shred him for issuing threats against Obama, he showed himself for the tiny fraction of a man that he is by deleting the tweet and then trying to backpedal:I wasn t calling for violence, against Obama or anyone.
Obama s words & BLM s deeds have gotten cops killed.
Time for us to defend our cops.
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) July 8, 2016What part of Watch out Obama.
Watch out black lives matter punks.
Real America is coming after you, is not a threat?
Here s hoping the Secret Service and the FBI show up at his doorstep to investigate this.Featured image by Gage Skidmore.
