MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Honduran opposition candidate Salvador Nasralla said his bid for the presidency was a lost cause on Friday after the United States recognized President Juan Orlando Hernandez as winner of the election.
The situation is practically decided, Nasralla said in an interview with TV network France 24.
I no longer have anything to do in politics, but the people, which are 80 percent in my favor, will continue the fight.
The United States backed Hernandez as winner of the Nov. 26 election despite widespread misgivings about the vote count.
