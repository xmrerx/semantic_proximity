Fox News recently aired a panel discussion over one of the right s new favorite videos online.
Conservatives are falling in love with a viral video that shows a woman harass a man at a grocery store for buying food with benefits from the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).The woman accosts the man and angrily states that she is not a bleeding heart f*cking liberal before she says that he must be a Bernie supporter.
This woman embodies all that is wrong with the current generation of conservatism.The man defends himself, saying that he works 60 hours a week but still needs the extra support to help provide for his child.
I put in 50, 60 hour weeks.
Just because you see me doing this right now I m trying to provide for my family.
Jonathan Hoenig, a hedge fund manager who is famous mostly for being a rich a**hole was on the Fox News panel, defended the woman s attack saying: I m proud of this woman.
This is the producers and the looters.
And you know what, she s absolutely right.
You have every right to keep every cent of your money.
It should be pointed out that this all happened at a Walmart.
Walmart costs the U.S. about $6.2 billion dollars a year providing benefits such as SNAP to their employees because they refuse to pay their employees a higher wage.
It s very likely that any Walmart employee who was working at the time of the incident would be using SNAP, or some other form of government assistance.
In Hoenig s mind.
those people are looters as well as everyone else who has ever struggled in their life.That s just a small taste of the hate and ignorance to come out of this particularly horrible Fox News panel.You can watch the Fox News panel segment below.Featured image via video screenshot
