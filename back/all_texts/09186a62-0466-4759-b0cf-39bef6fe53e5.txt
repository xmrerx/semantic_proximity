Last night, at a rally in Melbourne, Florida, Trump was trying to build more fear of brown people in his base of loyalists by referencing a completely imaginary terror attack in Sweden.
Since then, he s received an earful from the former Prime Minister of Sweden, prompted questions from confused Swedes, and social media has been abuzz with mockery of the imaginary attack, too.One would have expected Trump to respond fairly quickly, since he s now formally joined the ranks of Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer when it comes to fake terror attacks, but he didn t. He waited until this afternoon to respond, and it s extremely laughable:My statement as to what s happening in Sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @FoxNews concerning immigrants & Sweden.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 19, 2017Yes, sure, by all means, let s call this debacle Fox News fault and completely ignore the words that actually spewed forth from his mouth: You look at what s happening last night in Sweden.
Sweden!
Who would believe this?
Sweden!
They took in large numbers.
They re having problems that they never thought possible.
Twitter, meanwhile, is positively gleeful in their mockery of the liar of liars for another egregious lie:@realDonaldTrump none of which referred to anything that happened two nights ago.

I will hold myself to provide a more clear and accurate respresentation of my beliefs in future speeches.

Evan Dashevsky (@haldash) February 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump oh I saw it on TV, people told me this instead of being responsible for what comes out of his mouth.
Erick Fernandez (@ErickFernandez) February 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews OK time to have a chat again, so tell President Emperor Bannon you need a smoke break.
This will take a bit.
Kevin (@TheKevinDent) February 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump So you blindly spout whether @FoxNews tells you to?
It s pathetic, not to mention awfully irresponsible, 45.
Mike P Williams (@Mike_P_Williams) February 19, 2017Here s what someone who appears to be in Sweden has to say:@realDonaldTrump @FoxNews There is no migrant crisis in Sweden.
We have free health care, free education, a functioning welfare system.

Ines Helene (@inihelene) February 19, 2017How embarrassing.
You re hopelessly confused.
Sad!
@realDonaldTrump https://t.co/2mRZAjuj6f Charles Johnson (@Green_Footballs) February 19, 2017Um @erichmcelroy is @realDonaldTrump now trying to blame @FoxNews?
I thought we could trust them!
Mark Machado (@MarkMachado) February 19, 2017 Maybe, just as a change of pace and maybe to keep all of us on our toes, he should actually take responsibility for what he says and apologize.
But what are we talking about?
Trump is one of the worst pathological liars in the long, sad history of pathological liars.Featured image by Joe Raedle via Getty Images
