If you haven t noticed by now, Donald Trump has been signing a lot of executive orders, and the scene usually looks something like this:WASHINGTON, DC JANUARY 23: (AFP OUT) U.S. President Donald Trump shows the Executive Order (Photo by Ron Sachs Pool/Getty Images)Most of the pictures are of Trump surrounded by a bunch of men.
One of the orders even reinstated the global gag rule on overseas discussion of abortion by individuals and organizations receiving federal funding.
Needless to say, Trump is no friend to women.
After all, he s admitted to being a sexual predator.
So, in response to all these obscenely male-dominated photos, Sweden just trolled Trump back with an image of their own.Isabella L vin, Sweden s Deputy Prime Minister, who is also Minister for International Development Cooperation and Climate, tweeted out: Just signed referral of Swedish #climate law, binding all future governments to net zero emissions by 2045.
For a safer and better future.
