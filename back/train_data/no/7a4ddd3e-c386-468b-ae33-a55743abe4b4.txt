detroit ( reuters ) - two former michigan representatives forced out of the state legislature last fall for a scheme to cover up their extramarital affair face felony charges of misconduct and related counts , officials said on friday .
todd courser , who resigned from his seat in lapeer county , was charged with three counts of misconduct while in office , each of which carries a five year prison term , as well as a perjury charge , which has a 15-year sentence , according to the michigan attorney general ’ s office .
cindy gamrat , who was removed from her allegan county seat , faces two charges of misconduct while in office .
warrants have been served for both former lawmakers .
“ we are demonstrating to the citizens of michigan that no one is above the law , not even those who walk in the hall of power , ” attorney general bill schuette told reporters .
schuette ’ s office and michigan state police launched an investigation into the two disgraced lawmakers last fall .
schuette said on friday that courser and gamrat both lied to investigators , and that courser asked his staff to send out false emails to cover up the extramarital affair .
courser had devised a plan to distribute an email falsely claiming he had sex with a male prostitute , according to the detroit news .
that claim , courser said , would have blunted the political impact of an actual affair if it had come out .
he was charged with perjury for allegedly lying while giving testimony to a house committee , schuette ’ s office said .
both won seats in 2014 as tea party conservatives and devout christians .
they tried to regain their seats last year , but lost in the republican primary .
courser and gamrat were not immediately available for comment on friday .
