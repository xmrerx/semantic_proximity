Even the most hardened Cruz supporters will be switching their votes when they hear about all of the sick liberals who are willing to leave America if Trump gets elected.
Think of it as a public service Donald Trump said Tuesday that he would be doing a great service to the United States if celebrities, including Lena Dunham and Whoopi Goldberg, follow through with threats to move to Canada if he is elected president, and joked that he would campaign even harder as a result.On Monday, Dunham told attendees at an event in New York that she would 100 percent move to Canada if Trump were elected president, and in fact already had a beautiful and appealing area of Vancouver in mind.
Other celebrities including Miley Cyrus, Samuel L. Jackson and Raven-Symon have similarly vowed to move to Canada in the event Trump wins.
Well, she s a B-actor.
She has no mojo, Trump said of Dunham during a Tuesday interview with Fox and Friends.
I heard Whoopi Goldberg said that too.
That would be a great, great thing for our country.

We ll get rid of Rosie?
I love it, he said.
Now I have to get elected, because I ll be doing a great service to our country.
Now it s much more important.
In fact, I ll immediately get off this call and start campaigning right now.
Other celebrities who have threatened to move to Canada if Trump is elected include George Lopez, Eddie Griffin, Cher, and the Rev.
Al Sharpton.
