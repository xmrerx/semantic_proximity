Katrina Campins gave an excellent explanation of Trump s position on immigration and the press: As an American I feel frustrated because people are losing sight of what Donald Trump is trying to say.
What he s saying is, people should come to this country legally.
And I know about that process very well because my husband is going through it right now and it s extremely expensive.
So there s more incentive for people to come over to this country illegally.
So all he s saying is, let s make the process to come here easier and less expensive so there s more incentive to do that.
When people cross the border who are not supposed to be here, let s make sure they are sent back.
But what the media is doing is twisting and turning everything that he s saying and what s so frustrating as an American is that the point is not getting across.
We re so worried about his fights with Megyn Kelly and Jorge Ramos now, let s talk about the real issues I don t think it s his fault.
I think it s the fact that everything he says gets misconstrued.
Like this immigration thing I m a Hispanic woman and I m not offended for what he s saying.
I understood exactly what he is saying.
No.
And I don t agree that I m in the minority because the last time I was on CNN speaking about this as a Hispanic woman, so many Hispanic women tweeted me and said, Thank you for speaking for the real Hispanic woman.
