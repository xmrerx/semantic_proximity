Which brings me to President Obama.
While I m not calling him a genius, I do think he s extremely intelligent.
I also believe that his tendency to use big picture thinking while drafting policy is something most Republican voters simply can t understand.
Take Obamacare for instance.
It s not a fix health care today law.
In fact, the law itself is made to grow and evolve over time.
My belief is that it s a springboard to true socialized medicine.
But, as it is now, it s a long-term outlook on our health care.
While many Republicans want to look at the now aspect of the Affordable Care Act, they seem unable to grasp the reality that as more Americans get health insurance, giving them access to preventable care, this lowers expenses down the road for everyone.
If people can prevent very costly heart attacks, strokes or other debilitating health issues now, that s an overall savings for practically everyone from consumers to health insurers to doctors who now have more patients.
Quite literally, improving the overall health of Americans will improve the health of this country.
It even makes sense for our economy.
If workers are healthier, because they have access to quality health care, that means there will be fewer people calling in sick to work, showing up sick to work (putting other employees at risk) or relying on government programs because their health conditions (that were preventable) render them unable to work at all.
But to see all of that requires big picture thinking and Republicans seem unable to understand anything beyond the spoon-fed bumper sticker talking points they re given by the GOP and the conservative media.GIMME A BREAK!!!!
