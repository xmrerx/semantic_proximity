Corey Lewandowski is still beating the Trump drum on CNN, including defending Trump s campaign shakeup this late in the game.
There s just one tiny problem he s doing so by comparing this shakeup to John Kerry s shakeup in 2004 and we all remember how that election turned out.The comments came just after now-former campaign chair Paul Manafort resigned from the campaign, which just strengthened all the talk that Trump is past the point of no return and cannot win this election no matter what he does.
Lewandowski tried to counter that by saying: This campaign is not the first campaign to make staff changes.
If you look at John Kerry s campaign, when he was running, he was making changes as late as Labor Day, and don t forget we re still in August No, I understand, but the change in 2004 that John Kerry made helped him actually do significantly better than what he was doing.
So?
Kerry still lost.
There is no getting around that fact.
Kerry lost by about 3 million votes and 35 electoral votes.
Yes, it was a close election, but really?
He still lost and we still got four more years of George W. Bush.
It s hard to imagine that anybody of Lewandowski s age and background doesn t see that.This is the kind of ignorance that s pervading Trump s campaign.
Things have gotten so pathetically bad that there are people saying the polls don t matter because his social media followings are huge and attendance at his rallies is huge.
Tens of millions don t attend his rallies, and it should be patently obvious that his social media following is very heavily biased.Lewandowski is a perfect Trump proxy with his head full of cotton.
The main difference between him and those currently on Trump s staff is that the cotton filling their heads is a little more coarse.
