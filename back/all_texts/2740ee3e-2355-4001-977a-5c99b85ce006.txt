CNN host Don Lemon continues to show his extreme bias when it comes to Democrats vs Republicans.
His most recent show of bias was his interview with a panel that included Ben Ferguson.
When Ferguson brought up the Hillary, Huma, Weiner scandal, Lemon screamed No!
over and over again.
He thinks this is old news but it s a fact that the emails from Weiner s laptop are coming out today.
We took a screenshot of Lemon s smirk at the end of the video (SEE BELOW) showing his irritation at the direction Ferguson took during the interview.EMAILS TO BE RELEASED TODAY THIS ISN T OLD NEWS!.
@StateDept will publish releasable portions of 2800 government docs that @FBI found on Anthony Weiner laptop tomorrow (Dec. 29th).
Again, thanks to @JudicialWatch lawsuits.
Will @RealDonaldTrump DOJ finally take action on Clinton/Abedin misdeeds?
