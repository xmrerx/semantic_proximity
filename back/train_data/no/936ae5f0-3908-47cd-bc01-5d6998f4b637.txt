tokyo ( reuters ) - japanese police said on wednesday they have arrested a couple whose 33-year-old daughter froze to death in a tiny room where they had confined her for years because they believed she had a form of mental illness that made her violent .
western japan s osaka prefectural police department said airi kakimoto s body was found in a state of extreme malnutrition after her parents reported the death on saturday .
she was 145 cm ( 4.76 ft ) tall and weighed just 19 kg ( 42 lb ) .
police said yasutaka kakimoto , 55 , and yukari kakimoto , 53 , had confessed that they fed their daughter only once a day and kept her in a 3-square-metre room for some 15 years .
our daughter was mentally ill and , from age 16 or 17 , she became violent , so we kept her inside the room , police quoted her parents as saying .
people with mental and physical disabilities and their families can still suffer stigma and shame in japan despite some changes in public attitudes .
police said the parents added the small room - fitted with a camera and a double door that could only be unlocked from the outside - to their house and equipped it with a makeshift toilet and tube to a water tank outside .
about 10 surveillance cameras were installed outside the single-storey home , which was surrounded by a 2-metre high fence , police said .
the parents found their daughter dead on dec. 18 but they reported the death saturday .
we wanted to be together with our daughter , police quoted them as saying .
police said the couple were arrested on suspicion of illegally disposing of a body , a step that often precedes more serious charges .
