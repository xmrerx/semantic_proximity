amman ( reuters ) - syria demanded on saturday that turkish troops who had entered northwestern syria leave immediately , saying their presence constituted a flagrant aggression .
a foreign ministry statement carried on state media said the entry of turkish military vehicles into rebel-held northwest syria through the bab al-hawa crossing late on thursday was a violation of international law .
syria condemns in the strongest terms the incursion of units of the turkish army in idlib province , which constitutes a flagrant aggression against the sovereignty and security of syrian territory , the statement said .
turkey says it is operating alongside syrian rebel groups to implement a deal reached last month with russia and iran in the kazakh capital astana to reduce fighting between insurgents .
but syria s statement said : the turkish aggression is not tied in any way with the understandings that were reached between the guarantor states in the astana process , but constitutes a violation of these understandings .
