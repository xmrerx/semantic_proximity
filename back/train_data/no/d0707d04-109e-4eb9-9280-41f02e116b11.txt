fox news host bill hemmer asked congressman michael mccaul ( r-tx ) , if she wins next tuesday , what happens to that investigation ?
mccaul : well that s something i ve been talking about that hasn t been mentioned very much , and that is , this investigation will continue whether she wins or not .
but assuming she wins , and the investigation goes forward , and it looks an indictment is pending , at that point and time under the constitution , the house of representatives would engage in an impeachment trial , they would go to the senate and impeachment proceedings and removal would take place https : //twitter.com/ten_gop/status/793918006359298048
