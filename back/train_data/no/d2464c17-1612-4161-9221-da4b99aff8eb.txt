maybe donald would change his opinion about this important issue if his home was threatened by an overreaching government i think eminent domain for massive projects , for instance you are going to create thousands of jobs and you have somebody who is in the way , and you pay that person far more .
don t forget , eminent domain , they get a lot of money .
and you need a house in a certain location because you are going to build this massive development that is going to employ thousands of people , i think eminent domain is fine .
it s called economic development .
