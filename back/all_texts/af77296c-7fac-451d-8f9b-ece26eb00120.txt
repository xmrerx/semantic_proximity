Poland is acting like they don t quite like fascists or something.
While some have criticized Andrzej Duda for arranging a cheering crowd (complete with a Confederate flag) to make poor besieged snowflake Donald Trump feel safe enough from criticism that he was willing to visit,it was worth it.
It was so worth it.Humiliating Trump is becoming something of a sport among world leaders, whether they are dominating the handshake game, trolling him on Twitter, or even just letting him speak.Shortly into his remarks on Thursday, Trump majorly undersold Hitler and Stalin s invasions of Poland, calling them tough and trouble remarks that baffled literally anyone who has opened a history book and realizes how horrific these events were.To top things off, Trump managed to once again find himself humiliated by a woman a huge blow for the kind of guy who thinks women aren t people.Today s example of how little the rest of the world respects Donald Trump is sponsored by Polish First Lady Agata Kornhauser-Duda, who apparently decided to follow Melania s numerous examples and refuse to touch his hands.Though Trump was able to shake her husband s hand, the First Lady didn t want his greasy, smallish p*ssy-grabbing hands anywhere near her.
As Trump attempts to shake her hand, she walks straight past without even looking at him and warmly greets Melania first.
The most beautiful part is Donald Trump s expression.Our President is a joke and we re still waiting for a punchline that will never come.
It s time to remove him from office so we can begin undoing the damage he has done, is doing, and will do.Watch it below:The latest installment in the @realDonaldTrump handshake saga: Do you think he was snubbed by Poland's First Lady?https://t.co/l5lZ2oMYLq pic.twitter.com/Scm4pUB6e3 Globalnews.ca (@globalnews) July 6, 2017Featured image via screengrab
