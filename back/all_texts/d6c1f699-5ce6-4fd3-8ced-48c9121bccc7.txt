If you pay attention to right-wing media, and some on the left, Hillary Clinton and the Democratic National Committee are not only cheating right-wing socialist sore losers, they are murderers.The legend is that Seth Rich, who was a Democratic staffer, was murdered by Clinton and the DNC because he allegedly leaked the infamous DNC emails to Wikileaks.
Sure, it makes absolutely zero sense that they would try to silence someone who allegedly already said all he wanted to say, but that didn t get past the far-right and the far-left.
The murder was covered up, according to conspiracy theorists, to make it look like a botched robbery where nothing was taken.
Now, it looks like Rich was murdered by a serial killer.
According to Newsweek:The researchers believe there was just one shooter.
That shooter could have been a serial killer or serial murderer, according to the report, which uses the FBI s definition for an offender who kills two or more people in separate events.
With such a sanitized crime scene and no emotional indications, the report says, this is not Offender[ s] first kill.
Investigators brush off the idea that it was a murder for hire because professionals typically do a better job.As for the conspiracy theories, the Profiling Project says those are unfounded, given that Rich did not die immediately at the scene: A professional killer, whose sole job would have been to terminate Seth, did not accomplish their mission prior to escaping.
If this were a professional hit person, they failed, says Doherty, the team member.
Nothing we ve seen supports [the theory of] an assassin.
Of course, conspiracy theorists won t be satisfied.
Hillary Clinton s White House win just had to come from nefarious means.
Oh wait, Clinton isn t in the White House.
Instead, every intelligence agency in this country thinks Trump is in the White House because of at least partially nefarious means and even he isn t being accused of murder.Featured image via Twitter.
