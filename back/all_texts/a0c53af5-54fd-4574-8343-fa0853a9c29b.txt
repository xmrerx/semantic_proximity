Trump supporters are racist and violent.
That means that a Donald Trump rally is a very scary and dangerous place for a black woman to be.
That didn t stop one black woman from braving the hostility and making sure her voice was heard, though.
Shiya Nwanguma, a student at the University of Louisville, said she was attacked by racist Trump supporters when she dared to attend a rally as a protester.
The victim said of her harrowing experience at the Trump rally: I was called a n****r and a c*nt and got kicked out.
They were pushing and shoving at me, cursing at me, yelling at me, called me every name in the book.
They re disgusting and dangerous.
One of the Trump-supporting attackers was allegedly identified as known white supremacist and Traditionalist Worker Party leader Matthew Heimbach.
Protester and victim Chanelle Helm said of her experience with this particular racist: I watched him for hours recruit Trump supporters with five of his buddies.
They later attacked the group I was with.
The neo-Nazis threw punches and kicked us.
Here is video of the violence:// < !

And that is saying something.
Trump and his supporter are inciting violence and hate, and no one is doing anything about it.
