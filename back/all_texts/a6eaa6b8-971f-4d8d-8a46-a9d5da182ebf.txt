For the last year and a half, observers have wondered what Donald Trump would have to say or do in order to shake the confidence of his most diehard supporters.They have stuck with him for almost the entire race, and while there are not enough of them for him to win the election, they provide a definite floor of support for his campaign as well.Congressman Blake Farenthold (R-TX) appeared on MSNBC s All In and gave a jaw-dropping response for the type of behavior he would excuse from Trump.MSNBC s Chris Hayes tested the limits of his allegiance.
In an interview Tuesday night, Hayes asked Farenthold if he would continue to support Trump if a tape came out with Donald Trump saying I really like to rape women.
Farenthold s answer: maybe.The Congressman said I like to rape women could be a form of locker room talk depending on the context.
Hayes went on to ask Farenthold to elaborate on his answer, and he would only go so far as to say such a statement would be bad and that he would consider pulling his support.Here s the video:[ad3media campaign= 1118 ]The answer gives yet another real world example of the cult of personality surrounding Trump and his presidential campaign, and the devotion his small but dedicated supporters have to the former reality TV star.
Trump himself acknowledged this bubble around his campaign some months ago, when he pointed out that he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue in New York City and still retain their support.But this devotion is also a major turnoff to everyone outside of the inner circle of support.
While progressives have expressed frustration that nothing makes these supporters waver, it also comes off as creepy and strange to those looking in from the outside just as happens with most cults, like the Church of Scientology or Heaven s Gate or Jim Jones People s Temple.For a political campaign, it isn t a good look.Featured image via screen capture
