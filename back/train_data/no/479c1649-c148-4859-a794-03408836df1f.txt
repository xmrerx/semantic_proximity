london ( reuters ) - britain will pay not a penny more , not a penny less than what the government thinks its legal obligations are to the european union as the country leaves the bloc , foreign minister boris johnson said on friday .
talking to bbc radio four , johnson said his comment that the eu could go whistle on its demands for payment was in response to being asked whether britain would pay 100 billion euros or pounds , and not a suggestion that the government would not pay .
a financial settlement is set to be one of the most difficult issues to resolve in negotiations to unravel more than 40 years of union , and the eu has said it is one of three areas the two sides must make progress on before starting talks on a future relationship , including trading arrangements .
some of the sums that i ve seen seem to be very high .
of course , we will meet our obligations , johnson said .
we should pay not a penny more , not a penny less of what we think our legal obligations amount to .
