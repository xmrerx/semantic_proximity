WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Congressional Democratic leaders on Wednesday said they would support an effort to tie government financial relief in the aftermath of Hurricane Harvey to a three-month extension of the nation’s debt limit.
“Democrats are prepared to offer our votes for the Harvey aid package, and a short term debt limit increase of three months,” Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi wrote.
“We believe this proposal offers a bipartisan path forward to ensure prompt delivery of Harvey aid as well as avoiding a default.”
