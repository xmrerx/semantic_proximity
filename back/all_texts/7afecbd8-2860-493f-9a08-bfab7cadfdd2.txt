Remember when Chris Christie was a contender for the Republican Party presidential nomination?
Now imagine Chris Christie remembering that while looking glumly into a mirror, and try not to smile.
Despite doing everything politically and humanly possible to try and stay relevant, the Bridgegate scandal and generally shittiness of Christie are preventing him from achieving well, anything.
At this point, his career in politics is toast.In fact, he just set an all-time record for exactly how screwed his career is.
In the entire history of the Quinnipiac poll, no governor of any state has ever had an approval rating as low as Christie does right now.Here s more:Looking at Christie s personal qualities, New Jersey voters say:Garden State voters say 69 24 percent that President-elect Donald Trump should not offer Christie a job in his administration.
Oh how the mighty have fallen.
Remember four years ago, when Republican leaders were pleading with New Jersey Gov.
Chirstopher Christie to run for president and he looked like a sure thing for reelection which he was?
Now the neighbors have handed him the most dubious of honors, the lowest approval rating ever measured for a governor in the states surveyed by the Quinnipiac University Poll, said Assistant Poll Director Maurice Carroll.
The Gov s job approval numbers get worse every time anyone looks.
The last time we looked, May 18, he had a 64 29 percent disapproval rating, Carroll added.
This could be a long final year for Gov.
Christie.
Only 3 percent of New Jersey voters give Christie an A for the job he has been doing as governor.I sincerely doubt anybody has an ounce of pity for him at this point.I ll leave you with this reminder of how pathetic Chris Christie is:Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
