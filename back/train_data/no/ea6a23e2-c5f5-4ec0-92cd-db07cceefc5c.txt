pretoria ( reuters ) - south africa s high court ruled on wednesday that an inquiry into alleged state influence-peddling in president jacob zuma s government should be established as recommended by the anti-graft watchdog in a report released a year ago .
zuma had challenged the right of the report s author to call for a judicial inquiry and the appointment of a judge to head it by the chief justice .
zuma said it was his prerogative to set up such an inquiry .
