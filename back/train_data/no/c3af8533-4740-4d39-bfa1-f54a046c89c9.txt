obama s former ag loretta lynch released a video that s a call to action for democrats .
these people who have been stripped of power after being so close to achieving their goals of fundamentally transforming america into something most americans wouldn t recognize , are serious about starting a civil war in our nation .
if you don t believe me , listen to the words of obama s former ag , who compares the fight against president trump and his supporters to that of the civil war : i know that this is a time of great fear and uncertainty for so many people .
i know it s a time of concern for people , who see our rights being assailed , being trampled on and even being rolled back .
i know that this is difficult , but i remind you that this has never been easy .
we have always had to work to move this country forward to achieve the great ideals of our founding fathers .
( lynch s statement about the founding fathers is quite ironic , considering that she worked hand-in-hand with former president barack obama to destroy the very fabric of our constitution . )
it has been people , individuals who have banded together , ordinary people who simply saw what needed to be done and came together and supported those ideals who have made the difference .
they ve marched , they ve bled and yes , some of them died .
this is hard .
every good thing is .
we have done this before .
we can do this again .
