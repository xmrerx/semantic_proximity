Donald Trump spent Monday pretty much just making an ass of himself on Twitter.
After he attempted to intimidate Sally Yates and tweeted numerous lies about the hearing later in the day, one might assume The Donald would take a break.
Instead, he took one of those aforementioned lies and blasted it across the top of his Twitter profile.The header, as you can see, features the whitest room of people you have ever seen all giving a thumbs up and because he s a narcissist one of his own quotes, which is a lie: Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is no evidence of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.
Naturally, Twitter is having a lot of fun with this:Never really believed there was collusion between Trump & Russia.. until he just put that twitter header up.

(@memattieni) May 9, 2017The amazing-or not-thing is that this is *not* what Clapper said.
The Twitter banner of POTUS is literally (& seriously) a false statement.

(@fmanjoo) May 9, 2017Clapper did not in any way, shape or form, confirm that there is no evidence of collusion, no matter what The Donald s Twitter banner says.
Clapper explained that he was not aware of any evidence demonstrating collusion, but that he was unaware of the FBI investigation into the administration s dealings with Russia until Director James Comey announced its existence publicly in March.
That s a far cry from no evidence.
The real story the one Trump doesn t want you to know is that Sally Yates confirmed under oath that she warned Donald Trump General Mike Flynn was compromised 18 days before Trump did anything about it.
We believed that Gen. Flynn was compromised with respect to the Russian, Yates said.
To state the obvious, you don t want your national security adviser compromised with the Russians.
And she s right.Featured image via screengrab
