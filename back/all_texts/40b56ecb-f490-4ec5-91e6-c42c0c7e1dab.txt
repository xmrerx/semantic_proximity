He s being nominated to sit in Garland s seat, Sharpton said.
President Barack Obama nominated Judge Garland, who has got as much or more qualifications as this nominee, to have been the Supreme Court judge They stalled, they filibustered, they would not even give a hearing to Judge Garland.
It is time for the Democrats now to say since you changed the rules, you re going to have to live by the rules that you applied to President Obama s nominee, and we are not going to allow you to change it, and we will use those rules to block this nominee, Judge Gorsuch.
