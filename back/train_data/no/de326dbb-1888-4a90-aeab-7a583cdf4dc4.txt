mexico city ( reuters ) - twelve people were killed in shootings in the central mexican state of puebla in violence linked to warring gangs of fuel thieves , the state attorney general s office said on tuesday , adding to a mounting death toll from the lucrative trade .
illegal fuel taps and gasoline thefts cost mexico hundreds of millions of dollars each year .
fighting between the fuel thieves , known as huachicoleros , has this year helped push violence in mexico to its highest levels since president enrique pena nieto took office at the end of 2012 .
authorities found the bodies of four men and a woman in the state capital , also named puebla , after they were attacked by unidentified gunmen , state prosecutors said in a statement .
the bodies of two men were also found in the municipality of amozoc de mota just east of the capital , prosecutors said .
in addition , five others were killed in a shootout between suspected fuel thieves in tlaltenango on the northwestern fringe of the city of puebla , state prosecutors said .
all twelve deaths are believed to be the product of disputes between gangs of fuel thieves , and all occurred on monday , a spokesman for the attorney general s office said .
