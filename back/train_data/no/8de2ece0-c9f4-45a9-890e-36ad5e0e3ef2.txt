it s easy to blame the white man that way , you don t have to be accountable for your actions i lived in oakland [ ca ] all my life , and the people that robbed my mama at gun-point , when she was just a hard-working immigrant trying to get ahead honestly , it wasn t white , right-wing extremists , it was black and brown people .
why don t you cheat on your wife and blame her for it ?
my hardworking mom was not robbed by `` white right wingers .
