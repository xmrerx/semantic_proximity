cnn has more than enough representation from the radical side of the democrat aisle this host is yet another who speaks in terms of race and divisiveness .. @ wkamaubell : `` bye nazis ! ''

do you think bell needs to go ?
we do ! what about the white people ?
cnn host w. kamau bell spoke at the no hate in the bay rally in berkeley , california , over the weekend that featured antifa violence.the rally was organized in opposition to a patriot prayer event led by founder joey gibson , who has vehemently denounced neo-nazis and white supremacists .
the black-clad antifa protesters chased the small number of patriot prayer attendees out of the park and threatened and attacked right-wingers and journalists.bell , a comedian who hosts the cnn program united shades of america , spoke at the rally and said , when the nazis leave , as they have left you have to stand up for the brown people , the black people , the lgbt people , the immigrants everybody everyday !
bell never denounced the antifa violence in any of his tweets about the rally .
we re guessing he s still with the violent group via : dc
