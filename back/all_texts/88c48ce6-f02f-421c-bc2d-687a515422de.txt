If you ve never watched Donald Trump read off a teleprompter, you re really not missing out on anything.
Part of what makes Trump, well, Trump, is the fact that he s so off the cuff and could literally say anything at any moment.However, when his campaign team and the Republican party rallies around him to actually appear to be a serious candidate and deliver actually policy messages, you ll see Trump awkwardly use the teleprompter.
He reads from it like a teenager reading Shakespeare during English class in high school.
He knows that the words he s saying mean something, but he himself actually has no idea what he s saying.So, because he s just reading without any concept of the topic he s talking about there are bound to be missteps, awkward moments, and things he just says absolutely incorrectly, be it a name, city, or the actual word cities.
In fact, during Trump s recent economic speech in Detroit, Michigan, he talks about cutting regulations, because really, who needs safe products?
He also wants to bring jobs and wealth back into titties like Detroit.
Yes, titties, not cities.Now, this slip of the tongue on any other candidate can easily be look past, but not for Trump, a man who s built his career around, well, titties.
So, it s easy to say that we now know what s truly on Trump s mind, and it s not U.S. economic growth.Watch the moment here:Featured image via video screen capture Crooks and Liars
