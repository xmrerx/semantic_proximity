new york ( reuters ) - the chances of a contested republican presidential convention slid to their lowest in more than three weeks on wednesday after donald trump swept to a critical victory in new york ’ s primary , according to predictit , an online market for placing bets on u.s. and world politics .
with trump netting most of the state ’ s 95 delegates and further solidifying his front-runner status , the probability of a contested , or brokered , republican convention dropped to 50 percent wednesday morning , down 2 points from tuesday ’ s closing level , according to data from predictit , which is run by victoria university in wellington , new zealand .
that is the lowest level since march 28 and some 29 percentage points below its peak in early april , after rival ted cruz crushed trump in the wisconsin primary and went to win all 14 wyoming delegates last weekend .
ohio governor john kasich , who came in second in new york , remains a long-shot candidate .
tuesday ’ s outcome in new york could provide a critical turning point for trump ’ s momentum .
in fact , the chances of his clinching the republican nomination have been increasing steadily .
by wednesday morning , the probability reached 63 percent , after an early april slump to 36 percent .
to win the nomination outright , trump must line up 1,237 delegates before the republican party ’ s convention in july .
if he fails to do so , party leaders may face the prospect of negotiating a compromise candidate there .
the next test comes on april 26 , when five northeastern states hold their primaries .
