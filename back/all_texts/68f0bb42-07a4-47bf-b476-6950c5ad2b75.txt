After the release of the videotape showing Trump not only use derogatory language about women, but also profess to be a sexual predator, we re starting to notice the Trump campaign in a bit of tailspin.Trump s getting so desperate, in fact, that he just dragged out some women who allege they re victims of sexual abuse from Bill Clinton.
What people need to remember is that, no matter if any of those allegations are true, Bill is not who is running for president.
Trump is acting out of fear because he knows he s about to have his orange ass handed to him.Hillary s Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri released the official statement from the Clinton campaign regarding Trump s desperation:The statement read: We re not surprised to see Donald Trump continue his destructive race to the bottom.
Hillary Clinton understands the opportunity in this town hall is to talk to voters on stage and in the audience about the issues that matter to them, and this stunt doesn t change that.
If Donald Trump doesn t see that, that s his loss.
As always, she s prepared to handle whatever Donald Trump throws her way.
However, it was what Clinton tweeted next that shows us exactly why she will be the next President of the United States.
Instead of jumping back at all the crazy that is Donald Trump, she instead tweets this:Remember.
