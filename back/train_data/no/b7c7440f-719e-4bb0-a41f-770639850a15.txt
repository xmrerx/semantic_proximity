montreal ( reuters ) - a young montreal couple tried to use christmas lights and sandpaper to make a homemade bomb , a prosecutor told a canadian court on wednesday in opening statements in the terrorism trial of the former college students .
the items and a handwritten bomb-making recipe copied from a propaganda magazine published by al qaeda militants were found after the royal canadian mounted police searched a condo rented by el mahdi jamali and sabrine djermane in 2015 , prosecutor lyne decarie said in quebec superior court in montreal .
it is not clear how the lights would have been used to make a bomb .
jamali , 20 , and djermane , 21 , have pleaded not guilty to charges of trying to leave canada to join a terrorist group , possessing an explosive substance , facilitating a terrorist activity , and committing an offense for a terrorist group .
the 2015 arrest of the couple , teenagers at the time , came at a time when international security forces reported that waves of young people , including college students from montreal , were heading to syria to join islamic state militants .
decarie said investigators found other materials , jihadist propaganda and evidence that the couple had watched a video by a canadian fighter for the islamic state .
new luggage and clothes , along with passport applications were discovered during the search .
the pair reiterated their not-guilty pleas before decarie began her remarks and then listened from a high-security prisoners box that was enclosed in thick glass .
rcmp began investigating the couple after receiving a tip , decarie said , and arrested them days later .
the prosecutor said she would call family and friends of the accused as well as police experts in terrorism and explosives as witnesses in the trial , which is expected to last 10 weeks .
