sarah palin , kid rock , and ted nugent visited the white house on wednesday .
no , that s not a setup for a beverly hillbillies remake .
in fact , the clampetts would have likely been embarrassed by this motley trio.rock and nugent brought their wives along , but palin came sans todd.there aren t a lot of specifics in the news about the visit , but nugent and rock , in pure redneck style , wore their signature hats for the visit .
palin , who we thought we banned from the white house in 2008 , chose an off the shoulder blouse that conservatives would have had a conniption over if it was michelle obama.to add insult to injury , they decided to pose in front of the portrait of hillary clinton simply to mock her .
klassy .. @ potus invited @ sarahpalinusa to dinner and told her to bring some friends pic.twitter.com/okk6wvwpha jake tapper ( @ jaketapper ) april 20 , 2017remember when the right became filled with rage when president obama wore a tan suit or put his feet up on his desk ? a few years later , and all white house decorum seems to have left the building.twitter , naturally , had fun with the visit .
