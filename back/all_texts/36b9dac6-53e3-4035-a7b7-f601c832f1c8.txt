Donald Trump Jr. tried in vain to brush off his dad s boasts of being able to sexually assault women, arguing that when men talk, these kinds of remarks are just a fact of life.
During an interview with KIRO radio 97.3 on Friday, Junior said that men always say such lewd things about women as grab em by the pussy and it is just an inevitability of life.
Obviously he s not happy about that, but I think we probably all know guys who have had conversations with other guys that go a little bit in that direction, that s a fact of life, Trump Jr. said.
I think he s able to relate to ordinary Americans because in many cases he is still very much like that.
He does do that.
He hasn t spent his whole life sitting there polishing every statement he s ever made, every conversation he s ever had, he added.Trump Jr. started to say that his father speaks from the heart and then cut himself off, apparently realizing that this argument wasn t exactly helping the situation.
He finally admitted that yes, his father s comments were a mistake, but explained that all men who aren t politicians talk like this because the only reason you don t brag about sexual assault is to con people into voting for you.
He speaks from the heart, that one is obviously one that we don t want to that was a mistake, he recognizes that, he realizes it but he s able to make a mistake because he hasn t spent his whole life just trying to be a politician.
Trump s campaign has been in a tailspin following the release of the 2005 Access Hollywood tape that featured Donald bragging about being able to sexually assault any woman he pleases thanks to his celebrity status.
During the second presidential debate, he claimed that he had never actually done these kinds of things to a woman.
But in the days that followed, at least ten women have stepped forward to accuse Trump of doing to them exactly what he described on the bombshell tape.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images
