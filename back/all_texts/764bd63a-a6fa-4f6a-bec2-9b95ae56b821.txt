Donald Trump kicked off his Monday morning by tweeting something so stupid that it was necessary to check multiple times if it was a parody account.
Apparently, The Emperor has been told he is wearing the finest of clothing for so long that he is completely unaware he stands naked (in the figurative, not the claw your eyes out to make the awful visage disappear manner) and looking pretty stupid before us.According to The Donald, any and all negative polls are fake news and don t at all reflect the actual feelings of the millions of people who are protesting him in the streets and the millions more who are gathering to denounce him online.
Sorry, people want border security and extreme vetting, Trump says.Any negative polls are fake news, just like the CNN, ABC, NBC polls in the election.

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017Trump, of course, is referencing his Muslim ban, which stopped people from seven Muslim-majority countries from entering our country (including a baby who needed heart surgery, for a time).
The ban was met by widespread condemnation before a judge ultimately shut it down at least for now.
Contrary to The Donald s assertion, most Americans actually oppose the ban.
Politico reports:Fifty-three percent opposed the order, according to a CNN/ORC poll, with 46 percent arguing that it makes the U.S. less safe from terrorism and 49 percent saying it harms American values by preventing those seeking asylum from entering the U.S.Fifty-one percent expressed disapproval with the ban in a CBS News survey, in which 57 percent of respondents said the ban goes against the country s founding principles.
I call my own shots, largely based on an accumulation of data, and everyone knows it, Trump, who posted a completely fake story on his timeline to support the ban and whose propaganda minister completely invented a massacre in an effort to sway public opinion in The Donald s direction.
Some FAKE NEWS media, in order to marginalize, lies!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 6, 2017Trump does indeed call his own shots (the ones President Steve Bannon doesn t call for him, anyway), but none of them are based in reality.
Thanks to his cozy relationship with Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, who helped Trump win the election through an aggressive propaganda campaign and hacks of his political opponents (something Trump specifically requested during his campaign) and the numerous horrific actions he has taken since assuming office, Trump has managed to become the most hated President in history and Americans happily let him know it daily.Lol fake news, fake judge, fake voting, right, @realDonaldTrump?

Well, America doesn't like you so we will call you the fake president.

The mad king who denies any negative opinion of himself.

You're failing.
GET TO WORK.

The US already has border security and extreme vetting.
Emma Kennedy (@EmmaKennedy) February 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump Any negative polls?
For the rest of time?
Is this how it works now?
If the data isn t in your favor, it s fake?
#resist MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) February 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump this is exactly something that a leader like the Vladimir Putin would be saying right now.
Impeach Donald Trump (@Impeach_D_Trump) February 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump this is literally dictator language nick brennan (@nfbrennan) February 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump Be honest.
Did you plagiarize this from 'Fascism For Dummies"?
pourmecoffee (@pourmecoffee) February 6, 2017@realDonaldTrump You're like America's drunk, angry, controlling father.
But you don't drink, which makes this all the more disturbing elan gale (@theyearofelan) February 6, 2017But despite reality s uncomfortable bias against him, Trump is convinced that anyone who tells him he is not wearing any clothing is like his tailor Steve Bannon tells him unfit for their position and must be removed.
This isn t limited to his administration.
Ultimately, this includes you.
It includes me.
It includes Muslims, women, Hispanics, African-Americans, and anyone else who largely opposes him.Trump is growing more unhinged before our eyes.
It is up to our elected leaders to do their jobs and make sure he is not in a position to act on it for much longer for the good of our nation.Featured image via Getty Images (Joe Raedle)/screengrab
