21st century wire says this week a us presidential executive order temporarily restricted travelers and refugees from syria , iraq , iran , libya , somalia , sudan , and yemen from entering america .
in response to the controversial order , a wave of anti-trump flash mob protests emerged seemingly out of nowhere at new york s jfk airport and other airports across the nation .
welcome to the brave new world of digital activism , driven by some of the world wealthiest men engineering crisis george soros tied to protests over trump s recent executive order concerning immigration .
( photo illustration 21wire s shawn helton ) while the airport angst appeared to be an organic effort to reject trump s executive order on immigration , it was revealed that the heavily organized protests were found to be tied to social movement billionaire financier george soros .
participating groups included the american civil liberties union ( aclu ) , the national immigration law center , the urban jusric center , and make the road advocacy group , to name only a few are all funded by soros front organizations led by his open society foundation.the airport protests erupted just a week after a string of multi-million dollar soros-linked/democratic party-affiliated ngo s organized what was dubbed a women s march on washington dc .
the soros-backed women s march was full of hollywood celebrities in addition to a bevy of other speakers that included planned parenthood president cecile richards , activist gloria steinem , filmmaker michael moore , as well as the convicted felon donna hylton , who took part in kidnapping and torturing a 62-year-old real-estate broker named thomas vigliarole , in a botched ransom plot from 1985.the recent airport protests and mainstream media reportage regarding the immigration based executive order prompted a response from president donald trump over the past 24 hours : below will take a closer look at the main outline of the immigration based executive order , as another wave of soros-backed political opposition has been triggered into action ( image source : abcnews.com ) here are the key provisions of the immigration order outlined by the trump administration : whether or not someone supports the new us immigration order , it is strange that the list does not include other countries linked to state-sponsored terror such as saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , qatar and pakistan .
from a security standpoint , by leaving out these terrorist-linked and terrorist sponsor countries trump s executive order makes little sense.in a press release from february of 2016 , the department of homeland security ( dhs ) outlined travel orders similar to trump s immigration eo based on the terrorist travel prevention act of 2015 .
here s a passage of the dhs release discussing travel restrictions concerning the exact countries included in the trump order : the department of homeland security today announced that it is continuing its implementation of the visa waiver program improvement and terrorist travel prevention act of 2015 with the addition of libya , somalia , and yemen as three countries of concern , limiting visa waiver program travel for certain individuals who have traveled to these countries .
pursuant to the act , the secretary of homeland security had sixty days to determine whether additional countries or areas of concern should be subject to the travel or dual nationality restrictions under the act .
after careful consideration , and in consultation with the director of national intelligence and the secretary of state , the secretary of homeland security has determined that libya , somalia , and yemen be included as countries of concern , specifically for individuals who have traveled to these countries since march 1 , 2011 .
at this time , the restriction on visa waiver program travel will not apply to dual nationals of these three countries .
dhs continues to consult with the department of state and the office of the director of national intelligence to develop further criteria to determine whether other countries would be added to this list .
last month , the united states began implementing changes under the act .
the three additional countries designated today join iran , iraq , sudan and syria as countries subject to restrictions for visa waiver program travel for certain individuals .
under the new law , the secretary of homeland security may waive these restrictions if he determines that such a waiver is in the law enforcement or national security interests of the united states .
such waivers will be granted only on a case-by-case basis .
as a general matter , categories of travelers who may be eligible for a waiver include individuals who traveled to these countries on behalf of international organizations , regional organizations , and sub-national governments on official duty ; on behalf of a humanitarian ngo on official duty ; or as a journalist for reporting purposes .
additionally , under the obama administration , during the syrian refugee resettlement program us entrance for iraqi refugees was halted for 6 months in 2011.interestingly , several soros-linked organizations led the charge following the detention of immigrant travelers at airports in america over this past weekend .
the aclu , and the immigration-advocacy group make the road , both soros linked entities , were heavily involved in organizing political opposition concerning the trump immigration order.in 2014 , it was disclosed that george soros s open society foundations granted $ 50 million dollars to the aclu .
additionally , a law suit filed by aclu associated lawyers and the national immigration law center led to a stay of president trump s executive orders over the past 48 hours.breitbart recently reported that the the national immigration law center has received numerous open society grants earmarked for general support .
rt reported the following on january 30th : three more federal judges , along with a district judge , have issued rulings barring authorities from deporting people detained at us airports following president donald trump s executive order restricting entry to travelers from seven countries with muslim-majorities .
whether in the flesh , social media or through mainstream tv , the populace is subject to various forms of hyperreal propaganda around the global in many ways this is being used to push certain political regime changes and party objectives through the use of deceptive color revolutions and their many incarnations.in a book from 2011 written by susanne elizabeth shawyer entitled radical street theatre and the yippie legacy : a performance history of the youth international party , 1967 1968 , we gain a clearer perspective of the term smart mobs and the nature of these cross-platform gatherings : the potential for ideological uses of flash mobs soon became clear by autumn 2003 .
because of its original apolitical nature and network organization , the flash mob was easily appropriated for other means beyond random fun .
flash mobs were soon used for political or commercial end by those seeking to capitalize on the trendy cultural capital of flash mobs .
adding to that , shawyer cites author social science critic howard rheingold , who penned a book entitled smart mobs : the next social revolution in 2003 and continued to outline the nature of smart mobs : a smart mob may be composed of strangers who have no relationship to each other beyond their mutual connection to the network , yet this connection creates a virtual community and provides the opportunity for collective action .
when looking at the smart mob phenomena concerning the recent anti-trump protests in america , we can see how a large block of people can become useful in spreading political or cultural memes.in addition , the blending of socially engineered political agitator mobs and color revolutions is becoming more and more imperceptible as any group-think meme can cause a sudden flash gathering for the cause of the day.controversial filmmaker michael moore took to social media to rouse the masses , while acknowledging that the soros-backed ngo moveon.org mobilized a protest directly outside of the white house .
debra heine pj mediathe flurry of anguished news stories and protests surrounding president trump s executive action temporarily suspending immigrants and non-immigrants from countries of particular concern appears to be part of a coordinated pr effort financed by left-wing billionaire george soros.rather than a complete muslim ban as promised during the campaign , trump s executive order contains moderate refugee restrictions , similar to those that have been implemented by president obama .
if reports are true that restrictions are being applied even to green-card holders , that is an unfortunate misapplication of the law that will likely soon be corrected.protesters quickly materialized saturday at jfk airport , where some refugees were being temporarily detained.who are these people ?
make the road is a ny-based far-left non-profit funded in part by george soros.according to breitbart s aaron klein , the signatories to the lawsuit filed saturday to block trump s executive order included immigration lawyers from groups financed by soros.at least one case quickly prompted a legal challenge as lawyers representing two iraqi refugees held at kennedy international airport in new york filed a motion early saturday seeking to have their clients released .
they also filed a motion for class certification , in an effort to represent all refugees and other immigrants who they said were being unlawfully detained at ports of entry.the suit was filed by lawyers from the international refugee assistance project , the national immigration law center , the jerome n. frank legal services organization at yale law school , the american civil liberties union ( aclu ) , and the international refugee assistance project ( formerly iraqi refugee assistance project ) at the urban justice center.the aclu is massively funded by soros s open society foundations , including with a $ 50 million grant in 2014.the national immigration law center has received numerous open society grants earmarked for general support.the urban justice center is also the recipient of an open society grant.taryn higashi , executive director of the center s international refugee assistance project , which is listed on the trump lawsuit , currently serves on the advisory board of the international migration initiative of soros s open society foundations.reportedly , open-borders advocate soros has provided some $ 76 million for immigrant issues over the past decade , as soros-funded immigrant rights groups helped influence president obama s immigration policy.pj media continues here .. read more trump news at : 21st century wire trump filessupport 21wire subscribe & become a member @ 21wire.tv
