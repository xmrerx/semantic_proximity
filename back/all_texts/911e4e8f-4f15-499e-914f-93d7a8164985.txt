In a sit-down interview with Fox and Friends, Brian Kilmeade asked President Trump what he thought of Nancy Pelosi s comments yesterday on the cusp of his first major speech tonight.
Kilmeade told Trump that Pelosi said, Basically he s done nothing.
President Trump responded, Well I ve been watching Nancy s statements and I think she s incompetent actually, you know, if you look at what s going on with uh, the Democrats and the party, it s getting smaller and smaller.
We re soon going to have a one-party system.
I actually think a two-party system is healthy and good.
She s done a terrible job and I don t think she s a good spokesman.
"I think she's incompetent, actually, you know, if you look at what's going on with the Democrats and the party."
