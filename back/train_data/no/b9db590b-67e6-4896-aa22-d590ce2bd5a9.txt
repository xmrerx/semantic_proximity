johannesburg ( reuters ) - south africa s president jacob zuma has sought leave to appeal a court ruling ordering him to set up a judicial inquiry into influence-peddling in his government , local television channel enca reported on friday .
the high court ruled on dec. 13 that zuma must set up a judicial inquiry into influence-peddling within 30 days and that he should pay costs for an earlier legal challenge .
zuma s spokesman could not immediately comment when contacted by reuters .
zuma was seeking leave to appeal the high court ruling on 20 grounds , including that he should pay legal costs , enca reported .
the influence-peddling inquiry was recommended in a report released a year ago by south africa s public protector , whose job is to uphold standards in public life .
zuma also sought to block the release of the report , entitled state of capture , which focused on allegations that zuma s friends , the businessmen and brothers ajay , atul and rajesh gupta , had influenced the appointment of ministers .
zuma and the guptas have denied all accusations of wrongdoing .
the 75-year-old president has faced and denied numerous corruption allegations since taking office in 2009 and has survived several votes of no-confidence in parliament .
