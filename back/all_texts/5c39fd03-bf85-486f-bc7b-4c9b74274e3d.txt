Donald Trump has brought more corruption into the White House than anyone during his short time as President of the United States, and the sad thing about it is that the Republican Party is more than happy to defend him or look the other way whenever he f*cks up.Earlier today, as the testimony of former FBI Director James Comey threatened to derail Trump, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan defended one of Trump s most inappropriate incidents.
According to Ryan, Trump s disastrous request for Comey to be loyal to him should be totally excusable because Trump is just new to this.
Proving that Ryan is just as spineless as we all thought he was, this comment greatly differed from what he said yesterday about Trump s request, when the House Speaker called the request for loyalty inappropriate.
Ryan had said: Yeah, no.
I mean, obviously, I don t think that is.
But today, Ryan was more than happy to make excuses for Trump, who hasn t learned a damn thing since he s been in office.
Ryan is fine with passing off all of Trump s incompetencies as a simple the president s new at this , which was his response to the private conversations between Trump and Comey.
Ryan said: He s new to government, and so he probably wasn t steeped in the long-running protocols that establish the relationships between DOJ, FBI and White Houses.
He s just new to this.
That defense is honestly revolting, and the entire GOP should be ashamed of itself.
They helped elect an idiot who has no idea how the government works, and hasn t even bothered to learn since becoming president.
New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, another Republican and Trump defender, also blamed Trump s actions on innocent naivety.
He said:Trump is now very publicly learning about the way people react to what he considers to be normal New York City conversation.
