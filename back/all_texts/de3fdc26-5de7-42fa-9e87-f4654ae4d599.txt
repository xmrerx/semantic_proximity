One day after actress Debra Messing revealed that she regretted going on Megyn Kelly s new NBC morning show, the embattled host managed to draw the ire of an even bigger Hollywood star.Megyn sat down with Oscar-winning screen icon Jane Fonda on Wednesday, and in an ill-advised and poorly conceived move, decided to ask the 79-year-old actress to detail the plastic surgery she has had done over the years.The nasty exchange on day 2 of Megyn Kelly s new job at NBC couldn t have taken place between two more self-serving and arrogant women.Watch: You, you ve been an example to everyone, on how to age beautifully and with strength.
And unapologetically, began Megyn, nervously drawing out her question.
You admit you had work done.
I think it s to your credit.
You look amazing.
Have you why did you say ..
I read you felt you re not proud to admit you had work done, why not?
At that moment a steely Fonda stared Megyn straight in the eyes and very firmly asked: We really want to talk about that now?
