brussels ( reuters ) - european union leaders will agree this week to start preparing internally for talks with britain on a post-brexit transition , according to a new draft summit statement that spells out conditions which london must meet before negotiations start .
the draft [ l8n1mr56r ] , seen by reuters on monday , was circulated by summit chair donald tusk to the 27 other member governments for discussion by ministers on tuesday , ahead of a summit with british prime minister theresa may on thursday and friday .
following objections from heavyweight powers germany and france to a first draft last week , the text somewhat hardens up the requirement that london meet conditions set by the eu and softens any suggestion that it is a foregone conclusion that leaders will agree to launch trade talks in december .
however , it retains an instruction for eu officials to start internal preparatory discussions on how the eu would negotiate a transition and future trade relationship .
that , officials say , could save weeks of delay if a december summit does indeed give a green light to a second phase of talks .
