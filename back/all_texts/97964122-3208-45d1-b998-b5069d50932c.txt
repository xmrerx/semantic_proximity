WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Budget Committee voted along party lines on Tuesday to send a Republican tax bill to the full Senate for a vote.
The 12-to-11 vote “moves us one step closer to a simpler, fairer, and more transparent tax system,” Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi said in a statement.
The full Senate is expected to begin debating the tax bill and vote on it sometime this week.
The Republican-controlled House of Representatives has already passed its version of a package of tax cuts.
