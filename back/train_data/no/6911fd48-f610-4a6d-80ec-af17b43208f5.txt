dubai ( reuters ) - the united arab emirates is ending the mission of north korea s non-resident ambassador and terminating its own envoy s services in pyongyang , its foreign ministry said in a statement on thursday carried by state news agency wam .
the uae will also stop issuing new visas or company licences to north korean citizens , wam said .
several thousand north korean workers reside in the u.s-allied gulf region , mainly working on construction sites .
the measures ... come within the context of ( the uae s ) obligation as a responsible member of the international community to strengthen the international will and to stop the proliferation of nuclear weapons and missile programs , the foreign ministry said .
u.s. president donald trump urged united nations member states last month to turn up the pressure on north korea to give up its nuclear weapons , using his maiden speech to the world body to address what he has said is the top global challenge .
north korea s nuclear tests and missile launches have stirred global tensions and prompted several rounds of international sanctions at the u.n. security council .
in washington , the u.s. state department welcomed the uae s decision .
very happy to hear that , state department spokesman heather nauert told reporters .
there are many countries that are taking those steps that we have asked ( them ) to take .
the uae announcement follows similar moves by the uae s gulf arab neighbors qatar and kuwait , which last month downgraded their ties with pyongyang and ceased issuing new visas to north korean citizens .
