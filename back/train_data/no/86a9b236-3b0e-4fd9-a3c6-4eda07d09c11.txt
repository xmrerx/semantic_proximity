new york ( reuters ) - japan s emperor hirohito did not veto his advisers decision to declare war on the united states in 1941 because he feared triggering an internal conflict that would destroy his country , he said in an account dictated to an adviser .
set for auction in new york on wednesday , the handwritten document throws light on japan s role in world war two , as it records events dating from the 1920s , such as hirohito s resolve not to oppose future cabinet decisions , even if he disagreed .
he realized that if he wanted to be in power , he had to do what they wanted , tom lamb , director of the books and manuscripts department at auction house bonhams , told reuters .
and that is an interesting fact , since , throughout the late 1930s and through the 1940s , military decisions were made , which he could not contest , he said .
the auctioneers have put an estimate of $ 100,000 to $ 150,000 on the manuscript , which consists of two browning twine-bound notebooks written in pen and pencil by terasaki hidenari , an interpreter and adviser to the emperor , in 1946 .
the memoir concludes with the emperor s statement that if he had vetoed the decision to go to war , it would have resulted in a civil conflict that would have been even worse and japan would have been destroyed , the auction house said on its website .
known in japanese as dokuhakuroku , or the emperor s monologue , the remarks may offer insight into the role the monarch played in the war campaign .
this is a topic academics say has never been fully pursued in japan , largely due to u.s. occupation authorities decision to retain the emperor as a symbol of a newly democratic nation .
the americans needed emperor hirohito to bind the country together , which he did , lamb added .
the whole of japan changed from a rather military pre-war style to a postwar economic powerhouse , and obviously the emperor was part of that .
