After dropping out of the Republican presidential race, Dr. Ben Carson made the quick shift to endorse Donald Trump.
He insists that Trump is the best person for the job, besides himself of course, because he s an outsider who will supposedly get us away from the status quo.
However, upon his recent visit to The Daily Show, Carson just made a perfect case against voting for Trump.Daily Show host Trevor Noah wasted absolutely no time in getting to the pressing question of why Carson chose to endorse Trump, saying the neurosurgeon must think he can only be president for four years, so it can t be that bad.
Carson s response was actually a far worse reason that Noah s joke, he said: What I actually said is that would be the worst-case scenario.
Which left the audience not knowing whether to laugh or cry, and the sound that emanated from the crowd indicated it was probably a hybrid of the two.Yet, after discussing the supposed two different versions of Trump that exist, Carson said something that could make people stop and think twice before casting their ballot for Trump, because it s clear that Carson s vision of and for America is very different from that of the Republican front-runner s. He said: We are the child of every other nation, so we should have the welfare of every other nation at heart and conduct ourselves in a very different way.
And if we can learn from them and we can conduct ourselves in a way that demonstrates compassion towards others, I believe that it can be a dawning of a new world.
To which Noah responded as we all likely would with, I hope Donald Trump is watching this show, because that is certainly a message of inclusiveness that needs to be heard, and a far step away from the divisive, xenophobic rhetoric that Trump has been touting daily.It looks as though Carson may want to rethink who he s throwing his support behind.Watch the whole segment here:Featured image via video screen capture
