President Obama had scathing words for the lawmakers who voted to overturn his presidential veto on a bill that will allow victims of terrorists to sue foreign nationals.The Justice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act (JASTA) will allow the families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia, the country where many of the terrorists were from.
The bill passed Congress with a unanimous vote, but on Friday, Obama used his veto pen to strike the law down.However, the Senate voted 97-1 to overturn the president s veto and Congress voted in favor of the veto override 348-77, meaning the bill has now become law despite Obama s objections.This is the first time in Obama s presidency that lawmakers have voted to override his veto.
According to White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, it is the single most embarrassing thing the Senate has done.
Speaking to CNN s Jake Tapper, President Obama said their decision to override the veto was a mistake.
I think it was a mistake, and I understand why it happened.
Obviously all of us still carry the scars and trauma of 9/11, the president said, noting that there is a long list of resources available to help support the victims of this tragedy.Obama voiced his objections to the bill yet again, explaining that it will do away with sovereign immunity.
which win turn, put Americans abroad in danger of finding themselves facing private lawsuits in countries around the world.
It s a dangerous precedent and it s an example why sometimes you have to do what s hard, Obama said.
And frankly I wish Congress here had done what s hard.
I didn t expect it, because if you re perceived as voting against 9/11 families right before an election, not surprisingly, that s a vote for people to take.
But it would have been the right thing to do.
