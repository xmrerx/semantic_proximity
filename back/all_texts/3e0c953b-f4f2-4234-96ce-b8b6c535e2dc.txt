WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday that he will ask the Republican-controlled Congress to further speed up its efforts to overhaul the U.S. tax code, citing the potential impact of Hurricane Irma as a reason to hasten reforms.
I think now with what s happened with the hurricane, I m going to ask for a speedup.
I wanted a speedup anyway, but now we need it even more so, the president said at the outset of a Cabinet meeting at Camp David.
The White House released a video of his remarks.
Trump urged Congress in a Friday tweet not to wait until the end of September for tax legislation.
