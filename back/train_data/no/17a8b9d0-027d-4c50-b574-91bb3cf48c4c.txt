what s with the cultish attitude coming from our epa chief ?
this is so creepy and orwellian but the big push on climate change has even sucked in the pope .
epa administrator gina mccarthy told an audience tuesday gathered at a white house conference normal people , not climate deniers will win the debate on global warming.mccarthy s remarks came as she was talking about the reasons why the epa put out a report on the negative health impacts global warming will have on public health .
she said the agency puts out such reports to educate the public , not answer critiques from global warming skeptics .
i am doing that not to push back on climate deniers , mccarthy told doctors , health professionals and others gathered at a white house summit .
you can have fun doing that if you want , but i ve batted my head against the wall too many times and if the science already hasn t changed their mind it never will .
mccarthy then remarked how normal people , and not skeptics would eventually win the global warming debate .
implicit in her remarks is the contention that skeptics are somehow not normal people .
but in any democracy , it s not them that carries the day , mccarthy said .
it is normal human beings that haven t put their stake into politics above science .
it s normal human beings that want us to do the right thing , and we will if you help us .
