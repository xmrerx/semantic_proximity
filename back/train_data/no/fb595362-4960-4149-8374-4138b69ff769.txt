washington ( reuters ) - an ideologically divided u.s. supreme court on tuesday handed a win to republicans in texas by putting on hold rulings that said electoral districts drawn by state lawmakers discriminated against minority voters .
on a 5-4 vote , with the court ’ s conservatives in the majority and the liberal justices dissenting , the court in a brief order blocked two different lower court decisions that found fault with both congressional districts and state legislative districts drawn by the republican-controlled state legislature .
in august , a federal court in texas struck down two republican-drawn congressional districts saying they were discriminatory and ordering new maps to be drawn ahead of elections in 2018 .
the court said the 27th and 35th congressional districts were drawn in violation of the u.s. voting rights act .
texas has 36 districts , with republicans holding 25 seats in the u.s. house of representatives and democrats 11 .
the august decision and a similar ruling on the state legislative districts will both remain on hold , meaning no new districts will be drawn in the interim while the high court considers texas ’ appeal in the cases .
voting rights advocates say the republican lawmakers drew up the districts to undermine the influence of racial minority voters , who typically show more support for democrats than republicans .
