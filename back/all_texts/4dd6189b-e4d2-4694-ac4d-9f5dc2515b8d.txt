Kellyanne Conway went at it with Anderson Cooper and came out on top when she basically schooled Cooper on the chain of command in government.
The facts make no sense to him because he s in denial.
Conway said Trump s decision to fire James Comey had nothing to do with the FBI s investigation into Russian interference in the presidential election.
She goes on to explain to Cooper that the letter recommending that Comey be fired was sent to President Trump.
Was Trump supposed to then deny the Assistant Attorney General s decision?
It s good to note that the Assistant AG was just confirmed by over 90% of the Senate.
He s a bipartisan choice and a well respected man who came into his position under AG Jeff Sessions just two weeks ago.
The letter sent to Trump summarized the numerous things that prove the case for the recommendation of firing Comey.
TRUMP DID NOT DO THIS ALONE But you have the fake news media beating the RUSSIA, RUSSIA, RUSSIA drums over and over.Watch how Kellyanne Conway runs circles around Anderson Cooper while Cooper just keeps coming back to the Russia scenario: It s not a cover up.
The president makes it very clear in his letter.
Comey assured him he s not under investigation.
I think you re looking at wrong set of facts here.
You re going back to the campaign.
This man is president of the United States.
He acted decisively today.
You want this to be about Russia when this is about restoring public confidence in the FBI The FBI director reports to deputy attorney general, the deputy attorney general reports to the attorney general and the attorney general reports to the president of the United States.
This has nothing to do with Russia.
It has everything to do with whether the current FBI director has the president s confidence and can faithfully and capably execute his duties.
