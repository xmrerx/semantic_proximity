the # nevertrump movement from sane republicans who know what an absolute disaster a donald trump presidency would be for both their party and this nation and world is all but dead .
the spineless morons at the top of the gop leadership , including house speaker paul ryan and the # 2 republican mitch mcconnell , along with many others , have lined up behind the orange monster like obedient toy soldiers , despite the fact that trump becomes more outrageous and embarrassing by the day .
however , there is one veteran republican who is still staunchly # nevertrump longtime gop consultant rick wilson.wilson took to his twitter account to slam his own party s leadership over their endorsement of trump , and it was absolutely glorious .
he even gave trump a new name cheeto jesus and ripped his colleagues a new one in the best way possible.1/ how the actual fuck does anyone at the rnc have standing to act shocked that trump is not doing the basics of campaigning ?
rick wilson ( @ therickwilson ) june 16 , 20162/ you ca n't elide over his utter dipshittery .
no matter how much you try to act surprised , you own this .
you 're covered in his stench .
rick wilson ( @ therickwilson ) june 16 , 20163/ history will be so cruel to you .
rick wilson ( @ therickwilson ) june 16 , 20164/ your off the record sniping and grumbling is no substitute for moral courage .
that 's so dc .
rick wilson ( @ therickwilson ) june 16 , 20165/ you wo n't escape the stain .
it 's like a big , visible `` no ragrets '' chest tat that will mark your careers forever .
rick wilson ( @ therickwilson ) june 16 , 20166/ go public .
man up .
show courage .
say what 's in your hearts ; he 's insane .
he 's poison .
he 's doomed .
he 's killing the party .
rick wilson ( @ therickwilson ) june 16 , 20167/ none of you are good enough to spin the unspinnable ratfuck that is trump .
none of you can say , `` i was just following orders . ''
rick wilson ( @ therickwilson ) june 16 , 20168/ this weekend , people were lined up hundreds deep to give blood to the victims of orlando .
your cheeto jesus was praising himself .
rick wilson ( @ therickwilson ) june 16 , 20169/ there is no better trump .
there is not presidential trump .
he is a vile stain on the this republic .
rick wilson ( @ therickwilson ) june 16 , 201610/ your resumes will always read `` worked for a batshit crazy crypto-fascist who destroyed the gop '' rick wilson ( @ therickwilson ) june 16 , 2016and there you have it .
trump continues to cause massive division within the rnc and the gop at large , despite rnc chairman reince priebus s claims to the contrary .
rick wilson is right .
go ahead , gop leadership .
stay on the trump train .
but remember you lie down with cheeto jesus , and his stain lies with you forever .
either do the right thing , or listen to the sounds of the death knells for all of your careers.featured image via andrew burton/getty images
