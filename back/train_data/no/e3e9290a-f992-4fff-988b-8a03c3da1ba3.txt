tokyo ( reuters ) - typhoon lan with heavy rains and destructive winds is expected to hit southern japan on sunday when the nation holds a national election , forcing officials in okinawa to stage voting a day early on some remote islands .
the category 1 typhoon , located east of the philippines on friday morning and moving north , is expected to gain strength as it comes some 200 km ( 125 miles ) east of japan s southern island of okinawa by sunday , the japan meteorological agency said .
it will likely rain very heavily in the nansei island chain ( in southern japan ) , in the pacific side of western and eastern japan from the 21st to 23rd .
there is a chance it will rain violently in some regions , the agency said in a statement .
according to the tropical storm risk web site , the typhoon will likely strengthen to category 3 , but weaken again by the time it brushes past tokyo on monday .
local authorities in okinawa have decided to move the voting date to saturday for some remote islands .
tomoaki iwai , political science professor at nihon university , said the adverse weather is likely to hurt the standing of a new party led by popular tokyo governor yuriko koike , the party of hope .
voters with no party affiliation tend not to go and vote ( under the bad weather ) .
so , parties that are dependent on the general mood of the voters at a given time , like the party of hope , are set to suffer , iwai said .
he said some supporters of prime minister shinzo abe s liberal democratic party ( ldp ) may opt not to brave the weather and vote as well , believing , based on recent media polls , the ruling party has got the election in the bag .
the ldp-led coalition is on track to roughly match the two-thirds super majority it held in parliament s lower house before dissolution , helped by divisions in the opposition camp and jitters over north korea s nuclear and missile programs , media forecasts have said .
