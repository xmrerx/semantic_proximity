you remember that running saturday night live joke about sarah palin being able to see russia from her house ( the real quote is actually fairly similar ) ?
well , it just got a lot closer to reality when sarah palin offered to go all eagle-eye on russian hackers from her home in the crystal meth capital of alaska .
russia s getting out of hand ?
so says the defeated , palin tweeted sunday evening .
not to worry remember i can keep an eye on them from here .

https : //t.co/jqbcdv5o3w sarah palin ( @ sarahpalinusa ) december 12 , 2016palin included a link to a young conservatives article that claims the liberal media is jumping to conclusions by correctly pointing out that a cia investigation found that russia interfered with our election with the explicit goal of getting donald trump elected because the fbi who also interfered on trump s behalf drew a different conclusion in a completely separate investigation.naturally , twitter flocked to this latest opportunity to participate in something that should be an olympic sport tearing sarah palin apart piece by piece on social media : @ sarahpalinusa if you 're ok with russian espionage because it helped your guy win , then do n't say you 're a patriot dudediligence ( @ dudediligence ) december 12 , 2016 @ sarahpalinusa anyone who condones russia interfering with our elections is not patriotic & should be banished from this country .
bbwoof ( @ bbwoof ) december 12 , 2016 @ sarahpalinusa the bag may say chips , but they 're still paint chips , quit eating them ethan livermore ( @ ethanmlivermore ) december 12 , 2016 @ sarahpalinusa try keeping an eye on track before he blackens his wife 's .
tim ( @ timmywait ) december 12 , 2016 @ sarahpalinusa really ?
i will sleep so much easier knowing that .
# nevertrump linda ( @ lindagaines ) december 12 , 2016 @ sarahpalinusa delete your account .
phyllis kurtenbach ( @ pflorian1 ) december 12 , 2016 @ sarahpalinusa not the defeated , but 17 govt agencys & several @ gop congressmen .
you on the other hand are just a traitor like mcconnell shiva ( @ shivabeach ) december 12 , 2016 @ sarahpalinusa dont you think you would be better off keeping an eye on the rope that keeps bristols legs together ?
shiva ( @ shivabeach ) december 12 , 2016 @ sarahpalinusa no sarah , not the defeated .
so say the patriots .
i 'm disappointed you would dismiss this so cynically .
alice ( @ aphoenixalice ) december 12 , 2016 @ sarahpalinusa you obviously either are a part of trump 's treason or you ca n't keep an eye on the russians from your house .
# treasontrump laura ( @ lauras_living ) december 12 , 2016palin s former running mate john mccain doesn t take the matter as lightly as does the half-term , half-wit former governor or alaska .
on sunday , he called for a select committee to investigate russia s interference in our election .
it s clear the russians interfered , mccain said .
now , whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were trying to elect a certain candidate , i think that s a subject of investigation .
palin is an idiot , but she is a consistent source of entertainment .
unfortunately , too many think like she does.featured image via getty images ( drew angerer ) /screengrab
