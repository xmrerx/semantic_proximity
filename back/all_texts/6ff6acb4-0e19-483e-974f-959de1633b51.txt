As Hillary does her best to deflect and stonewall the release of her e-mails, we find out that even an employee of Clinton s server company knew something shady was going on.
Hillary wants all of this to just go away and is spinning the e-mail scandal like it s just another right wing conspiracy .
The e-mails from the server employee prove otherwise An employee of the computer company that maintained Hillary Rodham Clinton s email server was questioned if he was part of a coverup, according to documents released Tuesday.
This whole thing really is covering up some shady s t, the employee said in an Aug. 19 company email obtained by Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), chair of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
The concerns by the Colorado-based Platte River Networks employee were aired after the Clinton camp ordered a reduction in the data stored during each server backup.
The limits were ordered after the State Department contacted the former secretary of state in summer 2014 to inquire about her private email records.
In October, the department sent a formal request to turn over documents.
The employee was so suspicious that he sent an email to a colleague asking for a copy of the email from Clinton Executive Service Corp. to document their directive to limit the number of emails stored.Via: NYP
