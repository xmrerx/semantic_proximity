During a private speech to journalists, Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull let his inner comedian shine with a hilarious impersonation of Donald Trump.
Not only does he nail the dialogue, he perfectly executes the portrayal down to Donald s awkward and childlike arrogance.
The Donald and I, we are winning and winning in the polls, he said Wednesday in a leaked video.
We are winning so much, we are winning, we are winning like we have never won before.
The Journalists in attendance had agreed not to report or share the brilliant mockery they witnessed that night, but an editor from Nine Network couldn t help but share this gem with the world.
I have this Russian guy.
Believe me, it s true, it is true, added Turnbull, alluding to the Russian scandal playing out in the White House.In the wake of the backlash from the leaked video, Turnbull told Melbourne Talk Radio that his mockery was a light-hearted jest and a good-humored roast.
He thinks people should lighten up about it.You can pretty much guarantee Trump won t be lightening up about this genius comedy act making fun of him in the best way possible.
When respected world leaders are trying their hand at stand-up comedy to make fun of Trump, he s probably not going to take it lightly.Check out this amazing piece of comedy that is sure to go down in history as one of the great Trump portrayals:Featured image via screen capture
