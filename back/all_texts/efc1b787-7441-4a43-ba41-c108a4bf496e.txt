I wanted everybody to feel close together as a whole family right then and there, Stowers told Fox affiliate WVNS.
A bunch of guys I work with have past military experience and I knew that song would hit them real hard and make them feel comfortable.
They could ve had a bad day at that time, and that song would put them over the edge and make them feel better about themselves.
