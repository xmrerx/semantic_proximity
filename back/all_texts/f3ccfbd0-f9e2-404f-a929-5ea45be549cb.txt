The decision of actress Mila Kunis to make monthly donations to abortion business Planned Parenthood in pro-life Vice President Mike Pence s name has generated a call for a boycott of Jim Beam on Twitter.Jim Beam global brand spokesperson Kunis told Conan O Brien Thursday that she donates to Planned Parenthood in Pence s name to protest his pro-life policies.
O Brien asked Kunis to explain her prank: I apologize if I m offending anybody.
It s not so much a prank as much as I disagreed with some of the stuff that Pence was doing and was trying to do.
And so as a reminder that there are women out there in the world that may or may not agree with his platform, I put him on a list of recurring donations that are made in his name to Planned Parenthood.Every month, to his office, he gets a little letter that says like, An anonymous donation has been made in your name.
I don t look at it as a prank, this is like, I strongly disagree, and this is my little way of doing it.
It s a peaceful protest.
Breitbart NewsThe new face of Jim Beam, the iconic bourbon brand, might not be quite what you expect.
While a rough-around-the-edges cowboy or country rock star might seem to fit the bill Jim Beam has used Kid Rock at times in the past its newest spokesperson is the petite and beautiful Mila Kunis.The 30-year-old actress, who says she is a big fan of bourbon in general, is featured in two new 30-second Beam ads, as well as five other videos ranging in length from 15 seconds to more than three minutes.
