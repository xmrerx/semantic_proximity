Donald Trump is only one day into his Republican National Convention, and it s already not looking good for him.
Not only did several delegates and a fundraiser walk out or resign from his convention, but he also got dissed by House Speaker Paul Ryan all in a matter of a few hours.According to The Hill, Ryan didn t mince his words when discussing Trump at a Wall Street Journal lunch in Cleveland, stating that the business mogul was not my kind of conservative.
Ryan said: He s not my kind of conservative, but I come from a different part and wing of the party.
I think he is a conservative.
There are different kinds of conservatives, that s for darn sure.
This is just another comment in a long list of critical remarks Ryan has made about Trump.
Ryan has made a point to distance himself from Trump s hateful rhetoric as much as possible even when trying to get the GOP to stand behind the candidate.
Previously, Ryan has slammed Trump for his textbook racist comments about Judge Gonzalo Curiel s Mexican heritage, tweeting anti-Semitic images and proposing an all-out ban on Muslims.Over and over, Ryan has made it clear that he disagrees with Trump s views so much that basically the only reason why he is (reluctantly) endorsing the disgraced candidate is that he thinks anything is better than handing the election over to a Democrat.
In doing so, Ryan showed America that to him, furthering the Republican party s intolerant values and laws were more important than saving the country from an untrustworthy, dangerously unqualified reality TV star.
At the same lunch, Ryan said: What I do know for sure is if we disunify, then we hand the left the country by default for another four years.
I just don t want to be a party to that.
I don t want to be complicit to that.
So, instead, Speaker Ryan wants to be complicit to handing the country to an unqualified bigot.
