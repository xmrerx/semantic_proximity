Maybe you re a little confused, like me, about when exactly the American flag took the place of the First Amendment to the Constitution.
After all, I have a sister older than the current American flag.
But conservatives sure do like symbols, and their assumption that everyone else does as much as they do is probably why the outrage over NFL players taking a knee, or sitting, or otherwise not properly respecting American symbolism has captured the zeitgeist in the country this football season.But what does respect for the flag actually mean, and is there a double standard?
One Twitter user had a pretty spectacular take on whether there just might be a little hypocrisy at play in all of the criticism of those ungrateful black multi-millionaires who dare to protest in a way that s unacceptable to white people.
HennyWise is a third generation veteran of the armed forces, and his outline of ways that America completely ignores the disrespect that doesn t bother them or even makes them happy is a primer on the United States Flag Code.
Setting aside the fact that a significant number of sports fans may in fact be getting a beer at concessions during the national anthem and display of the colors, there are a number of regulations that Americans don t seem to mind breaking:Let s jump right in US Flag Code: Chapter 10.176C The flag should never be carried flat or horizontally, but always aloft and free.

That s considered a conduct violation, not disrespectful.

Also this:#TakeTheKnee pic.twitter.com/x9WC5cmJCv HSquared (@BlondeWarship) September 23, 2017The Flag Code also specifies that:The flag should never have placed on it, or attached to it, any mark, insignia, letter, word, number, figure, or drawing of any kind.That makes the Blue Lives Matter flag an even more direct form of disrespect than a violation of most of the other regulations would be considered.But will conservatives care?
