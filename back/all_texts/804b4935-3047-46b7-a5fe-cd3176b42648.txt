ROME (Reuters) - Italy s parliament will be dissolved between Christmas and the New Year with national elections likely set for March 4, a parliamentary source in contact with the president s office said on Wednesday.
The source said the vote could also be held on March 11, with a final decision due to be taken shortly.
A national election must be held by May, but most political parties are keen to hold elections as soon as possible.
While the centre-right is seen winning most seats at the forthcoming ballot, opinion polls suggest it will not win an absolute majority, making a hung parliament the most likely outcome.
