ottawa ( reuters ) - a planned meeting of foreign ministers to discuss the north korean crisis is not scheduled to take place before the christmas break in late december , a canadian official said on tuesday .
foreign minister chrystia freeland announced canada would co-host the meeting with the united states on canadian soil .
at least a dozen foreign ministers will be involved , said the official , who asked to remain anonymous given the sensitivity of the situation .
u.s secretary of state rex tillerson , condemning a north korean missile test earlier in the day , said the meeting would include south korea , japan and other affected nations , to discuss how the global community can counter north korea s threat to international peace .
freeland had been discussing north korea with counterparts in recent months , including those from the united states , south korea , japan , australia and china , said the canadian official .
canada was a good choice to host a meeting because it was less directly involved in the crisis than the united states , japan , south korea or china , said the official .
there are fewer implications to us convening a constructive conversation , added the official , saying no decisions on a venue or who would be invited had been made .
