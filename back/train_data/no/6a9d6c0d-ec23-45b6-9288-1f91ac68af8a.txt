ted nugent hits the nail on the head ted nugent and david crosby are in the midst of a social-media spat over nugent s claim that political correctness is keeping him out of the rock and roll hall of fame .
crosby has dismissed the motor city madman s work as not good enough , while nugent called the former byrds star a bloated chemical repository in response.nugent fired the first shot last week when he accused hall of fame boss jann wenner of hating the second amendment and the nra , of which nugent is a board member .
that s the only reason i m not in , nugent said .
and until they get their heads out of their ass , i m more than happy to do what i do and do it with all the vim and vigor that i do it every night .
however , asked if he d like to be inducted , he replied , hell , yes .
crosby got involved on monday , when he was asked via twitter whether he agreed with nugent s assessment , and replied : no , the a hole just isn t good enough .
when it was later suggested that the classic track cat scratch fever alone might earn nugent an induction , crosby said : nope .
no the asshole just is n't good enough https : //t.co/tij4rjax4s david crosby ( @ thedavidcrosby ) august 14 , 2017nugent fired back on tuesday , taking to facebook to say : everybody knows that david crosby is an evil rotten soulless punk that has criminally poisoned his bloated carcass his entire vapid life .
i couldn t be more proud that such an uncaring dirtbag hates me , while he competes with michael moore to see who can go the longest without hygiene .
let s all pray he can form a syllable before his borrowed liver fails .
i laugh at his pathetic slovenliness .
