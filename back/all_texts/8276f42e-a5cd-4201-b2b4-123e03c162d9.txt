Just when you thought things couldn t get weirder, Carly Fiorina bursts into song.It all happened during the Ted Cruz rally where he named Fiorina his vice presidential choice if he were to somehow magically secure enough delegates for the GOP nomination.The entire publicity stunt of adding Fiorina just reeks of desperation from the Cruz campaign.
It s very reminiscent of what President McCain John McCain did in 2008 to try to appeal to voters in a last-ditched effort to try to become president, and we all know how that turned out.Nonetheless, Fiorina accepted his request to run on his imaginary ticket, so she spoke to the crowd at his latest rally in Indiana.She spoke in fluent conservative-speak, saying things like: A President Ted Cruz will restore power back where it belongs in the hands of citizens, and This is the fight of our time, and I believe Ted Cruz is the man to lead that fight.
Along with a boatload of other malarkey.Then, as if from out of nowhere, she started singing about Ted Cruz s daughters.
Now, some may think, aww, that sounds delightful, but those people clearly don t know Carly Fiorina.
It was a mixture of weird and very creepy, and most definitely cringeworthy, to the point where you couldn t wait until the moment was over.This move by Cruz is definitely odd and sort of unprecedented, but it will be interesting to see how it works out for him.Watch the strange serenade here:WATCH: @CarlyFiorina bursts into song after @tedcruz names her his running mate https://t.co/2RAbmQaqkV https://t.co/xRcCJ51mvN MSNBC (@MSNBC) April 27, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
