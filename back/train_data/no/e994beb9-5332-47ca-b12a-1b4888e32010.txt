not long ago , rep. jason chaffetz ( r-utah ) , said that poor people should have to choose between having an iphone and healthcare .
never mind that an iphone costs something like $ 600 while a poor person would be lucky to spend only $ 600 a month on health insurance , especially under the republican plans.now , while we are still recovering from sticker shock over the congressional budget office scoring of the senate bill , which will cost us a lot more and cause 22 million people to lose insurance , chaffetz has the nerve to complain that his $ 173,000 annual salary just isn t enough .
he thinks he and his fellow members of congress need an extra $ 30,000 , tax free , because housing is expensive and four times the average american salary is far too much of a sacrifice.twitter , was having none of it : he doesn t even deserve it plus he s leaving so he gets nothing chaffetz calls for $ 2,500 legislator housing stipend https : //t.co/ychfxddecu jbaby56 ( @ jbaby56 ) june 27 , 2017maybe if @ jasoninthehouse didn t buy the newest iphone , he could afford to house his family .
https : //t.co/s0u56xkkb7 matt y ( @ yantastico ) june 27 , 2017can t help but compare chaffetz s call for $ 2500 legislator housing stipend to his remarks re : health care + iphones https : //t.co/fm9nmnxevk pic.twitter.com/abbw6yyuxx kyle griffin ( @ kylegriffin1 ) june 27 , 2017chaffetz has some nerve saying congress deserves a housing stipend while everyone else in america pays 50 % or more of their income on rent .
jerry bird ( @ bostonjerry ) june 27 , 2017jason chaffetz wants a housing stipend for congress , because i guess it s only called welfare when you re black.https : //t.co/mffgvlyb2y jack moore ( @ jackpmoore ) june 27 , 2017put aside how you feel about chaffetz , i know really great leaders who didn t run for congress because of housing $ https : //t.co/fzejk0uzyk yashar ali ( @ yashar ) june 27 , 2017when we get a housing stipend , you do too , chaffetz .
and by we , i mean the whole of the people of the united states .
https : //t.co/n0dphpnorw ltrotsky 21stcentury ( @ ltrotsky21 ) june 27 , 2017just what people making $ 174k plus annually need must be to cover those higher premiums under # deathcare https : //t.co/xog8dvecty rc dewinter ( @ rcdewinter ) june 27 , 2017if we were not living in a post-reagan time , a time when for the last 40 years , americans have been told that we have to tighten our belts while we wait for the riches to finally trickle down upon us , this might not be as ridiculous a request .
personally , i like the idea of people who have the education and intelligence to be worth a lot of money representing us , but chaffetz is not one of those people .
besides , it s been a very long time since republicans actually worked for the people .
once they start doing that , perhaps we d be willing to give them a raise.featured image via chip somodevilla/getty images .
