America has a very ugly history with regards to slavery and racism, and that disgusting legacy continues today.
Racist white people want to gloss over all of that, though, and pretend that there s no racism, that it s all over, and they also want to tell a white-washed version of history.
Case in point David Barton.Barton appeared on a recent edition of Glenn Beck s program, and made the appallingly racist statement that white people don t get enough credit for the things they have done for black people.
He told Beck: I love the fact that in these early paintings you have, there s black and white together.
But, my gosh, why not teach the good.
As if that weren t bad enough he went on to say: So much of the credit that blacks owed was for whites having gone to bat and doing things for them.
That blacks were not able to free themselves, whites did.
Barton then insists that it is inaccurate portrayals of history that have blacks against whites now, and kept repeating so-called examples of how black people should be grateful to white folks.Mr.
Barton, did you happen to forget that white people owned black people, that they actually owned other human beings, all because of the color of their skin?
It s ignorant, offensive statements like this that cause division.
You might not like history, how ugly it is, but that doesn t make it any less true.
Also, if true history is not taught, we are doomed to repeat it.
Get an education, Mr. Barton.
You definitely need it.Watch this appallingly racist exchange below:Featured image via screen capture from Right Wing Watch
