on friday , donald trump was so angry about the more than half the country that feels it is probably not a good idea for his administration to be in bed with russia that he was completely unable to type coherently when unleashing his unpresidential ravings on twitter .
specifically , he found himself unable to spell the word hereby .
trump informed the american public that he the president * wants to hear by launch investigations into his political enemies because they have been in photographs taken during public , scheduled meetings with some of the same russian folks with whom members of his administration have been busted having secret , off-the-books meetings .
after half the world pointed out he had spelled it incorrectly , he gave it another go , changing it to hearby still wrong , but closer.then he unironically tweeted about education we must fix our education system for our kids to make america great again .
wonderful day at saint andrew in orlando .
