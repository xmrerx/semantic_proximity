(Reuters) - The European Union will soon ask Britain to take responsibility for solving the Irish border problems, according to documents leaked to the Guardian.
Michel Barnier, the European Union s chief negotiator, will ask Britain to work out solutions that avoid the creation of a hard border with Ireland, the newspaper also reported.
The news comes after the Guardian earlier reported, based on a draft memo it reviewed, that Britain is considering measures to restrict immigration for all but the highest-skilled EU workers.
The British government declined to comment on the report while the European Union was not immediately available for comment.
