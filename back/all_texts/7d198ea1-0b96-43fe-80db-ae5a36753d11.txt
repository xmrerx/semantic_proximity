WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders on Wednesday backed President Barack Obama’s Supreme Court pick and called on Republican Senate leaders to consider his nominee.
Sanders, a U.S. senator who represents Vermont, in a statement said refusing to consider Judge Merrick Garland would be “unprecedented.”
