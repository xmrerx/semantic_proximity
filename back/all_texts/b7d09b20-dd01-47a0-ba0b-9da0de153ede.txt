In the coming days, a creationist conspiracy theorist who thinks President Obama is a gay prostitute, could be in a position to rewrite school textbooks and decide what is taught in class.Mary Lou Bruner has promised voters that, if elected to the State Board of Education in Texas, she will promote conservative curriculum standards aligned with Texas values.
The problem is, a quick look at what Bruner considers Texas Values make the proposition of putting her in a place to shape young minds utterly terrifying.Among Bruner s regular Facebook rants, she has claimed that:These are just the highlights.
Statements that, in any right-thinking world would preclude a person from being elected to a position of authority within the State education system.
Sadly, this is not the case in Texas.Far from being some outsider, no-chance candidate, she has been endorsed by none other than the Former Chairman of the Texas State Board of Education Gail Lowe, and a raft of others.
She won 48 percent of the vote in the GOP primary on Tuesday, putting her well-above her opponents.
She ll now face a run-off election, and she ll likely win.Bruner has every chance of being allowed a say in what goes in our children s textbooks and what they are taught in class.
This racist, anti-gay, anti-science conspiracy theorist might very soon have a central role in shaping the minds of young Americans.
If that doesn t care you, nothing will.Featured Image via Campaign Website
