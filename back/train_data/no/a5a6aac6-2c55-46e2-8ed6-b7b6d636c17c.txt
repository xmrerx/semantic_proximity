given how vile trump s treatment of women is , it s an absolute wonder that any woman at all can tolerate voting for him .
yet , there are women all over twitter who not only can vote for him , but will do it enthusiastically .
do they know something that women on the left don t ?
sadly , it doesn t seem so .
in fact , they seem impossibly ignorant about issues that directly affect them.the hashtag , # womenwhovotetrump , seems to be a bit of a counter to # whywomendontreport , in which women bared the pain of their harassment and assaults to the whole world .
misogynists worked their asses off shaming those women , too .
# womenwhovotetrump , however , seems to be nothing but attacks on hillary and shaming victims of sexual assault .
these aren t just impossibly tone-deaf , they re outright cruel. # womenwhovotetrump know how to say no when it needs to be said .

( @ chrgdup1973 ) october 14 , 2016 # womenwhovotetrump understand a 550 % increase of muslim # rapefugees is far more of a threat to them than an 11 year old video tape .
rapefugee watch ( @ rapefugeewatch ) october 14 , 2016 # womenwhovotetrump don t need to constantly play the victim and claim that society is against them .
we self empower .
# trump2016 deplorable dani ( @ nimblenavgater ) october 14 , 2016 # womenwhovotetrump aren t weak , perpetual victims like those on the left .
andieiam ( @ andieiamwhoiam ) october 14 , 2016 # womenwhovotetrump are sexier marisa leocadi ( @ marisaaleocadi ) october 15 , 2016so all women s experiences are like this woman s , apparently : because you don t wait 37yrs to go after a man who sexually assaulted you .
i know , i am a victim. # womenwhovotetrump @ realdonaldtrump leslie ( @ leslie91780 ) october 15 , 2016 # womenwhovotetrump are the most educated on the issues & refuse 2 vote 4 a woman simply because she s a woman .
jobs , security , fair trade .
susan ( @ mssusanferguson ) october 14 , 2016the funny thing about it is that most of the women tweeting under that hashtag can only talk about how much they hate hillary .
very few have actually given an explanation of what makes trump so good .
they re sufferers of hillary derangement syndrome , and have no idea what could happen to them under a president trump : in other words , just going to work and getting through the day could suddenly become much more difficult if trump is elected , simply because the president sets a major example for the rest of the country.we won t stoop to calling these women stupid .
rather , they re badly misinformed and unable to see that they re misinformed .
by voting for trump out of hatred for hillary , they re trying to open a pandora s box from which women might take decades to recover.featured image via joe raedle/getty images
