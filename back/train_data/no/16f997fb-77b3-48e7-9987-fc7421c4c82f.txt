near ramallah , west bank ( reuters ) - i went to the road just outside ramallah , as on previous days , because that is one of the places in the west bank where palestinians have been protesting against u.s. president donald trump s recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital .
the 100-metre stretch leads from the city limits of ramallah to the jewish settlement of beit el , and has a filling station and a traffic circle .
earlier on friday , which palestinians were calling a day of rage , i had tried working at the kalandia crossing point into the west bank , but the israelis had thrown tear gas and i knew this would make taking good photographs difficult .
outside beit el , a group of paramilitary israeli police had driven back hundreds of palestinians who were throwing rocks and burning tyres .
i was photographing the protesters , and did not see another palestinian who apparently emerged close to the israeli squad from a hiding place near the traffic circle .
i heard the israeli police shooting , and turned around .
on instinct , i started taking pictures , all the time trying to keep well out of the line of fire .
when the palestinian fell , i could see that he was holding a knife , and wearing what looked like a suicide bomb vest .
israeli police said he had managed to stab and wound one of their number before being shot .
palestinian medics later said the attacker was dead , and that his bomb belt had been fake .
