Donald Trump is a flaming racist, and he has made no secret of that.
After all, he has a history of calling Mexican immigrants rapists, of calling for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States, and of telling his imbecile supporters to beat up black protesters.
Well, if all of that wasn t enough to convince you of the racism of the Trump campaign and of the man himself, this ought to be.Donald Trump took his hate parade of a campaign to South Carolina to Clemson University, to be precise.
A professor at the historic South Carolina university, Chenjerai Kumanyika was at the rally with his friend, A.D. Carson.
They listened, first, to (amazingly) gospel television preacher Mark Burris give a prayer/speech, which included the words: Father God, in the name of Jesus, we re truly thankful for the life of Donald J. Trump.
We re thankful that you have created a man through the spirit of the Holy Spirit to give him the boldness to say what other people will not say, to do what other people will not do After that, Kumanyika and Carson stood listening to the events of the evening, when they were approached by police officers who told them they had to leave.
There was no apparent reason for this, so Kumanyika asked why they were being tossed out.
I m leaving, I m not arguing with you, he said.
I just want to know why.
Once they had exited the event, one cop was kind enough to tell the men why they had been thrown out.
The Trump campaign or the Trump people said that you are no longer welcome.
Yes, you read that right.
The campaign simply said that they were not welcome there.
No explanation for that, as they were not protesting or causing a ruckus.
Just standing there.
The professor said of the incident: I stood peacefully observing Trump s speech.
I remained quiet and calm the entire time I was there and never spoke to anyone other than A.D.
Eventually, several police officers dressed in military gear grabbed my arm and told me to leave the venue immediately.
Again, no protests, just observing like everyone else there.
The difference?
They re black.
That s the only conceivable reason.Luckily, the entire exchange was caught on camera and posted to social media.
