berlin ( reuters ) - police in germany on tuesday arrested five people suspected of smuggling nigerian men into the country through fake marriages , the german federal police said in a statement .
four hundred police officers raided 41 apartments and rooms believed to be linked to the gang in berlin and other german cities , it said .
the gang s suspected leaders - four women and a man , ranging in age from 46 to 65 - were arrested .
germany s newspaper bild reported that a german federal police investigation conducted together with portuguese authorities and europol had found at least 70 men were brought in illegally through arranged marriages with portuguese women .
europol , the european union s law enforcement agency , served as a host for operational meetings between the portuguese and german investigators , the police said .
clients had paid up to 13,000 euros ( $ 15,550 ) for fake certificates , with part of the sum going to women who would fly from portugal to join their husbands at the german immigration office to apply for an eu residency permit .
similar cases were detected in june when the police found that more than 700 german men in berlin had married pregnant asylum seekers from vietnam , africa and eastern europe for money so the mothers would obtain a residency permit and for the future babies to be born as german citizens .
the german interior ministry estimates there are about 5,000 such cases per year nationwide .
