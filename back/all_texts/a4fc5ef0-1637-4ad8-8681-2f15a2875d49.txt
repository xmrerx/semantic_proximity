NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. envoy to the United Nations said Monday the United States plans to circulate a new resolution on North Korea this week and wants a vote next week by the Security Council.
Ambassador Nikki Haley urged the United Nations to impose the strongest possible measures to deter North Korea from further steps on its nuclear program.
She said the United States would engage in negotiations this week on the resolution and said North Korea has slapped everybody in the face with its latest nuclear test.
