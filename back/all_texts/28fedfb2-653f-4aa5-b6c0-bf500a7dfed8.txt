Frustrated staffers for Marco Rubio s beleaguered presidential campaign lashed out on Tuesday morning at protesters making fun of the junior senator s habit of repeating himself in a robotic fashion.Protestors from the Democratic group American Bridge came to a Manchester, New Hampshire event for the Rubio campaign dressed in cardboard boxes designed to look like robots.
One was labeled Rubio Talking Point 3000.
After they appeared, staffers pounced.
They attacked the men in robot costumes, ripping at least one to shreds.Rubio staff begin shoving me pic.twitter.com/oJDy0Miihc evale72 (@evale72) February 9, 2016On ground after they shoved me over pic.twitter.com/H7Ema1rhPB evale72 (@evale72) February 9, 2016Kevin after they ripped his costume off pic.twitter.com/vzhOiQXsEV evale72 (@evale72) February 9, 2016Here is video of the attack as well:Eddie Vale, vice president of American Bridge, wrote Rubio told press at Manchester precinct for 20 minutes.
After their staff pushed and shoved us he retreated to bus after like 2 mins.
Rubio s campaign has been under fire since the Republican debate on Saturday night, where Gov.
Chris Christie pointed out that in order to substitute for his lack of experience, Rubio had memorized mini-speeches that he leaned on as a crutch.Since then, the candidate has had to defend this habit, which has even been criticized by some figures on Fox News.Suddenly the candidate that has been promoted by some as the Republican establishment s answer to Donald Trump s insurgent campaign has been exposed with a flaw that is relatively easy for political opponents to exploit.The Marcobot idea is beginning to spread, and it is eroding Rubio s campaign that so far has been so heavily focused on his confidence and polish, allowing him to quickly play in the big leagues of American politics.Obviously his backers are feeling the heat as well, spilling over into a thuggish display at this campaign event.
What once appeared to be a strong path to the nomination now appears to have some robot-sized obstacles in the way.Much like Dukakis in the tank, or the Dean Scream, Marcbot is on the loose can the young senator contain it, or will he be destroyed by it?Featured image via Twitter
