paris ( reuters ) - a french prosecutor said on sunday that a man arrested last week after a police raid on a flat near paris had a direct connection with islamic state .
police discovered a stash of explosives in the raid last wednesday in villejuif , south of paris , and found tatp , a product often used by suicide bombers .
a second cache of explosive materials was discovered in a nearby town the following day .
two men who were arrested were put into formal investigation on sunday and placed in detention , the paris prosecutor , francois molins , told a news conference .
a third suspect was released with no charges .
analysis from the material seized showed one of the suspects had been in direct contact in august 2016 with rachid kassim via facebook , molins said .
kassim , believed to be a senior islamic state militant , was targeted by the u.s. military in a strike near the city of mosul , iraq , earlier this year .
tatp has been used by militants in several attacks in western europe in recent years , including manchester in may , brussels in 2016 and paris in 2015 .
more than 230 people have been killed by islamist-inspired attackers in the past three years in france , which along with the united states and other countries are bombing islamic state bases in iraq and syria .
