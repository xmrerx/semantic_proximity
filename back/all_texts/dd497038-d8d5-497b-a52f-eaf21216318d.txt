What a joke!
Hillary decides to go on SNL and make it one big campaign commercial bashing Republicans and promoting herself.
Not one mention of the e-mail scandal!
That s pretty interesting and shows she s thin-skinned and SNL did everything to put her in the best light.
Reminds me of the Palin bashing but I doubt Americans are buying this unfunny attempt at bashing candidates.The front-runner for the Democratic nomination appeared on the season opener of Saturday Night Live as a wise bartender named Val who pours a drink or two for, ahem, Hillary Clinton (played by SNL regular Kate McKinnon).Most political candidates play themselves on SNL, often for just a cameo in a sketch or to declare the show s famous tag line, Live from New York it s Saturday night!
Seldom do they go all-out thespian and play a character in a sketch.
So, Hillary, Clinton asks McKinnon, what brings you here tonight?
Well, I needed to blow off some steam, McKinnon says.
I ve had a hard couple of 22 years.
Asked what she does for a living, McKinnon says in imitation of Clinton s earnest monotone: First, I am a grandmother.
Second, I am a human, entrusted with this one green Earth.
Oh, Clinton says, you re a politician.
And just who is Val?
Clinton deadpans, I m just an ordinary citizen who believes the Keystone pipeline will destroy our environment.
Republicans didn t fare nearly as well as SNL began its 41st season.
The opening sketch made fun of Trump and his wife, Melania, and a faux commercial pitched a pill that cures people of thinking they can be president specifically low-polling GOP candidates Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee and Jim Gilmore.
