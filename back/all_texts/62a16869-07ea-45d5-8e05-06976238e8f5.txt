Fox News Channel s top-rated host, Bill O Reilly, is once again attracting controversy to the conservative network for racially charged comments.
On the April 11 edition of The O Reilly Factor, during an interview with Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump, O Reilly decided to make some bizarre remarks.Discussing Trump s poor showing with black voters and his attempts to appeal to that demographic, O Reilly let loose:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOLp3bdurYBILL O REILLY: But how are you going to get jobs for them?
Many of them are ill-educated and have tattoos on their foreheads, and I hate to be generalized about it, but it s true.
If you look at all the educational statistics, how are you going to get jobs for people who aren t qualified for jobs?The implication that blacks are ill-educated and have tattoos on their foreheads adds to the well-worn history of racist comments on Fox News, particularly from O Reilly himself.At a 2003 benefit for at-risk black children, O Reilly said, I hope they re not in the parking lot stealing our hubcaps.
In 2007, when visiting the New York City restaurant Sylvia s, which is in a predominantly black neighborhood, O Reilly said he was surprised it was like every other restaurant, and that shockingly when he went inside, nobody was screaming, M-Fer, I want more iced tea.
He has also used the term wetback to refer to immigrants.O Reilly has also attacked groups like Black Lives Matter, who he claimed, basically hate their country.
Overall, Fox News has been home to multiple incidents of race-baiting over its long history, which reflect the values of network founder and president Roger Ailes.
Ailes was part of Richard Nixon s campaign to ride racial resentment to the White House, and he later had involvement in the creation of the infamous Willie Horton ad that was used to attack Democratic presidential candidate Michael Dukakis in 1988.O Reilly is just toeing the party line.Featured image via YouTube
