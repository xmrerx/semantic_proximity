i m not blaming you representative lewis .
but you ve been there .
you ve done nothing .
last year , you did a sit in for hillary clinton .
for hillary clinton !
you did a sit in on the floor .
it was for her .
it wasn t for guns .
it wasn t for the pulse nightclub .
that s you guys tried to exploit .
but it was for hillary clinton , to set her up to win .
and now that she lost , your token ass is sad .
