If police radar had been engaged, however, it would have clocked Hillary s signature black conversion van hitting 92 mph in a driving rainstorm on Interstate 89, where the top speed limit is 65, writes Daily Mail U.S.
Political Editor David Martasko.Later in the day, the van later hit 73 in a 55 mph zone on its way to Claremont, New Hampshire.
