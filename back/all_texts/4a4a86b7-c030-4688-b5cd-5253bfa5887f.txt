FBI director James Comey wanted to go public with information about Russia s interference in the 2016 election as early as last summer but was reportedly barred from doing so by the Obama administration.According to Newsweek sources, Comey presented a draft op-ed to top administration officials during a White House meeting in June or July.
He had a draft of it or an outline, the source said.
He held up a piece of paper in a meeting and said, I want to go forward, what do people think of this?
Former Secretary of State John Kerry, former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and ex national security adviser Susan Rice were among those in the meeting.Comey s idea was rejected because White House officials thought the message would have more impact coming from multiple agencies and not just him.
An op-ed doesn t have the same stature, it comes from one person, the source said.A second source told Newsweek the op-ed, which Comey would have likely sought to publish in the New York Times, contained the same information as the intelligence report made public on January 6 that said Russian President Vladimir Putin tried to influence the presidential election.Comey s op-ed was rejected around the same time he publicly revealed details about the investigation in Hillary Clinton s emails.
The FBI director revealed before the House Intelligence Committee last week that the agency is investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election.He told the Intelligence Committee the Russians were very noisy and unusually loud in their hacking of US Democratic party computers.
It was almost as if they didn t care if we found out, he added.Watch FBI Director Jame Comey confirm his investigation into alleged Russian interference in our elections:
