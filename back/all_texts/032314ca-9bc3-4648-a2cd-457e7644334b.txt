NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s repeat presidential election must be held within the 60 days stipulated in the constitution after the Supreme Court nullified the result of a vote held last month, President Uhuru Kenyatta said on Thursday.
Kenyatta also accused the court of reaching its decision without scrutinizing and verifying the forms used to tally the Aug. 8 vote and said the decision could thrust the country into judicial chaos.
The Kenyan election board said earlier that it had now rescheduled the election for Oct. 26 after a French firm providing the technology for the polls said it would not be ready in time for Oct. 17, the previous date set for the re-run.
