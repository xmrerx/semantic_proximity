#BasketOfDeplorables pic.twitter.com/EOIhfmyWXt Asa J (@asamjulian) October 1, 2016Now she s offended half of the Democrat base with this latest video that has been uncovered.An audio recording has surfaced, revealing Hillary Clinton speaking critically about young voters supporting Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT), saying they ve bought into a false promise.
It s a false promise, Clinton says in the recording, referencing Sanders political revolution.
But I don t think you tell idealistic people particularly young people that they ve bought into a false promise.
The audio, which was released by the Washington Free Beacon, comes just three weeks after Clinton faced backlash for calling millions of Americans supporting Donald Trump deplorables.
The recording, which is from a fundraising event in February, catches the Democratic nominee calling Sanders supporters children of the Great Recession that are living in their parents basement.
There is a strain of, on the one hand, the kind of populist, nationalist, xenophobic, discriminatory kind of approach that we hear too much of from the Republican candidates, Clinton states.Watch:Via: Breitbart News
