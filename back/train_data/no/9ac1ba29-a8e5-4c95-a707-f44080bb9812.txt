mere months after being on the receiving end of one of the most stunning losses in presidential election history , former hillary clinton campaign manager robby mook said there s a chance the former secretary of state could run again in 2020.in an appearance monday on msnbc , mook was asked by host greta van susteren what are the odds that clinton will run for office again .
i m going to let her answer for that , mook replied .
i think what happens right now , we ve got to get to the bottom of what happened in 2016 , then we can start worrying about the next cycle .
but we ve got to make sure that this can not happen again in two years or four years to anybody else .
mook also refused to rule out a clinton comeback in 2020 when asked tuesday by veteran news anchor dan rather .
i have no idea , mook said .
you genuinely would have to ask her .
