Someone we haven t heard a lot from during the course of this year s election cycle is Melania Trump, wife of presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
However, wait no longer, because Maya Rudolph on her new show Maya & Marty just gave us what we can only assume to be a pretty accurate representation of the wannabe First Lady.Rudolph s Melania introduces us to the world of edible diamonds, which are pretty much just regular diamonds that you eat.
Alongside Melania on this new venture is Heidi Cruz, wife of Senator Ted Cruz, played by the brilliant Kate McKinnon from SNL.The two ladies get together and discuss the presidential race while munching on some of the diamonds.
Heidi starts by saying, Ted would be very upset to know that I m here, so shhh but truthfully, you know I m quite fond of you Also saying, l love being compared to you.
With Melania saying, it s so funny because my face is so perfect, and yours is so loose and fun, it s like a broken balloon.
The satirized comparison obviously going back to when the two real-life women were compared on Twitter.It s doubtful these women would ever be friends in real life, but watching Rudolph and McKinnon together is worth every second of viewing.Check the hilarious sketch out here:Featured image via video screen capture
