? van hollen responds to camerota s question of whether obamacare is hurting people : let s start with that question the president poses one more time , if obamacare is hurting people , why shouldn t it hurt the insurance companies and why should congress not be paying what the public pays ? '
camerota said .
what is the answer to that ?
well , first of all , obamacare is not hurting people , van hollen responded .
in fact , what would have really hurt people was if we would have passed trumpcare .
van hollen began to explain how the gop replacement would have failed , but was cut off by camerota .
right , but you know not everyone is delighted with obamacare and people have grave reservations about it , camerota said .
alisyn , nobody has said it s perfect , van hollen said .
we ve said from the very beginning , we need to improve the exchanges .
the senator then went on to list what needs to be improved and how it can be done .
the first order of business is for the president to stop trying to sabotage the exchanges .
there are a couple of things totally within the power of the trump administration , van hollen said .
