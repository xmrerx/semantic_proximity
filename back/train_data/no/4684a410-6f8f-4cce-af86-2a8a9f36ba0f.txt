taipei ( reuters ) - taiwan will allow visa-free entry for visitors from the philippines in hopes that the southeast asian nation will reciprocate the gesture , a spokesman for the self-ruled island s cabinet said on thursday .
taiwan does not have formal diplomatic relations with the philippines , which recognizes the one china policy under which manila acknowledges the chinese position that there is only one china and taiwan is part of it .
china considers taiwan a renegade province to be taken back by force , if necessary .
whether the visa-free policy takes effect in october or november is to be decided by the foreign ministry , said hsu kong-yung , the spokesman of taiwan s executive yuan , or cabinet .
after we open up the visa-free arrangements , in view of equal mutual benefits , we also hope they will make visa-free arrangements with taiwan , he told a news conference .

the government is continuing this year with a pilot scheme with brunei and thailand kicked off last year .
it is also considering visa-free arrangements with indonesia and vietnam , according to a government document seen by reuters .
