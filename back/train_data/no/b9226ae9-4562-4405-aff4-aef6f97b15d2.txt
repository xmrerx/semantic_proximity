sputnik radio s new program trend storm is hosted by american geopolitical analyst and writer andrew korybko .
this week , andrew explores what s really driving the media uproar and political protests surrounding president trump s executive order on immigration andrew korybko trend stormus president donald trump s controversial executive order to temporarily limit the entrance of select foreign nationals to the us is becoming a larger-than-life scandal of epic proportions.following through on yet another of his campaign promises , america s new leader has banned people from seven countries from entering the us , building off of the list of supposedly terrorist-prone countries that his predecessor first identified .
the immediacy of the order caught many people off guard , and there was confusion about whether it would apply to permanent residents ( green card-holders ) , already-vetted refugees , and individuals in transit .
almost immediately after the announcement was made last friday , thousands of people across the us flocked to their local airports to protest the measure .
in doing so , they defied what are ordinarily strict security measures , which during regular times would prohibit such large-scale gatherings at locations considered essential to the nation s infrastructure.the protesters claimed that trump had banned muslims from entering the us , and the hashtag # muslimban instantly started trending on twitter .
in defense of the motion , trump and his surrogates said that most majority-muslim countries were untouched by the temporary border restrictions , pointing out that indonesia the world s most populous muslim country isn t on the list , for example .
moreover , in a cynical retort to the critics , they reminded the public that obama had earlier suspended the us refugee program for iraqi nationals for half a year back in 2011 , though no such protests erupted at that time .
nevertheless , it s hard for the trump administration to shake the social media stigma that this is a muslim ban , no matter how convincingly they may argue that it amounts to nothing more than a brief review period for high-risk countries prior to the implementation of what s being called extreme vetting .
this is because the mainstream us media is very sympathetic to what trump and his spokespeople have termed the political opposition , namely , the democratic party.the perception management and narrative-building that these two institutions are known for was seen vividly and on full display during the presidential campaign , but it s gotten even more intense since trump s election .
just like back then , however , it doesn t seem to be doing its intended job , since a reuters poll released on tuesday found that 49 % of americans are in favor of the president s action , while 41 % are against it.patrick henningsen , founder and executive editor of 21stcenturywire.com and the host of the sunday wire show , and don debar , host of a syndicated daily radio newscast cpr news heard across the us , commented on the issue .
