americans better start fighting back against these people who are shutting down our public roads by hitting these thugs where it really hurts in their wallets .
otherwise , we will continue to see increased violence that is being blamed on pro-trump supporters in the media anti-trump activists who protested his planned appearance in arizona today by blocking a limited access highway and creating a traffic nightmare with cars backed up for miles [ n.y. daily news ] could be sued in class action law suits for massive damages modeled after suits filed against those who similarly illegally blocked traffic at the george washington bridge , and judgments against other illegal protesters , says public interest law professor john banzhaf.with the mainstream media continuing to blame trump supporters for the efforts of their opponents to shut down their free speech rights , it may be time to adopt the tactics the left favors to get its way : lawsuits .
that s the suggestion of john banzhaf , a george washington university law professor who defies categorization politically but is often labeled a gadfly .
he explains : anti-trumpers block highway ; face class actions for damagessuits filed re blocked gw bridge provide precedenthttps : //t.co/ln17fgakcw john banzhaf ( @ profbanzhaf ) march 19 , 2016why and how to sue anti-trump protesters and other disruptors '' sue the disruptors '' more effective than criminal lawhttps : //t.co/9mmizte5wq john banzhaf ( @ profbanzhaf ) march 21 , 2016as banzhaf had predicted and later helped inspire , two different class action law suits seeking millions in civil damages were brought by persons stuck in the massive traffic jams at nyc s gw bridge which were illegally caused by former aides to governor chris christie.suing protesters suing the bastards may be the most effective way to help deter illegal protests , says banzhaf , noting that slap-on-the-wrist criminal fines usually aren t very effective , especially since it sometimes also helps give illegal protesters a soap box to air their grievances in criminal trials.the lead protester who chained her neck to a pickup truck was george soros paid operative , jacinta gonzalez from new orleans.but the tide may already be turning , says banzhaf , citing these examples.when other groups see that the sea shepherd conservation society has been forced to pay $ 2.55 million to japanese companies for illegally using acid and smoke bombs to disrupt their whaling , they may think twice before blocking traffic to advance their agenda , says banzhaf , who has promoted the idea and the very slogan of suing the bastards when the law is broken.in another example , a student who illegally chained himself to some construction equipment because he opposed an oil pipeline was forced to pay out big bucks for his criminal conduct.as npr reported it , he was apparently ready to accept a relatively painless conviction for trespass , but not to pay the pipeline company $ 39,000 in restitution.similarly , eleven protesters who allegedly engaged in illegal activities at the mall of american are facing restitution claims from the city of bloomington.in these and many similar situations , protesters are often willing to accept a small misdemeanor fine and conviction for a chance to focus attention on their cause , especially if it means they get to have a criminal trial which generates even more publicity for them and for their grievance , argues banzhaf.while most of these actions against criminal protesters have been brought by businesses , there s no reason why similar legal actions can not also be brought by any person falsely imprisoned on that arizona highway as was the case with one of the two gw-bridge suits.using the threat of legal actions is a far better and more american way of deterring illegal protests than engaging in physical violence against them , as some trump supporters have apparently already done , says banzhaf.via : prlog
