JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe should end his attempts to remain in office after the military seized power this week as he has no regional diplomatic support to stay in power, Botswana President Ian Khama said on Friday.
The military intervention, which political sources say could pave the way to a national unity government after 37 years of Mugabe rule, also presented an opportunity to put Zimbabwe on a path to peace and prosperity , Khama told Reuters.
I don t think anyone should be President for that amount of time.
We are Presidents, we are not monarchs.
It s just common sense, Khama said.
