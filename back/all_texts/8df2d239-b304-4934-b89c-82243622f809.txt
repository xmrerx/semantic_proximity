Finding out Donald Trump was his own publicist in the 1990s, but yet now denies it, is pretty much a gift wrapped in one of those giant Lexus car bows to comedy writers everywhere.
He s making the job almost too easy because the content writes itself.With a new take on the whole thing was the team over at Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.
They absolutely pummeled Trump and his alter ego John Miller during Sunday night s broadcast.After they played the clip of Miller speaking of all the women who want to have sex with Trump, including Madonna, Oliver said: Much like his candidacy, that claim is sad but not implausible.
Remember, there were rumors that in the 90s, Madonna got together with Vanilla Ice, Jose Canseco, and Willem Dafoe.
And what is Donald Trump if not the authenticity of a Vanilla Ice, the likability of Jose Canseco and the terrifying facial expressions of Willem Dafoe?
Very, VERY true.Oliver also points out that Trump himself stated in the 1990s that the person on the call wasn t John Miller, but rather himself, and he claimed that it was all a joke.
Which would be fine, and the issue would be settled if not for the fact that Trump has now reversed that claim and stated the person on the call now isn t him.So, to settle this issue once and for all, Oliver has now extended an invitation for John Miller to appear on Last Week Tonight to be interviewed.
Not Trump, Miller.
Although, the chances of Miller showing up aren t very likely considering he doesn t exist.Watch the whole segment here:Featured image via video screen capture
