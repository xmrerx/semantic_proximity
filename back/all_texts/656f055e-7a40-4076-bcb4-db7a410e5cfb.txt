WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former FBI Director James Comey had requested additional funding and personnel for the agencyâ€™s probe into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election just days before he was fired, the New York Times reported on Wednesday.
Comey, fired by President Donald Trump on Tuesday, had asked Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein last week for a significant boost in resources and later briefed U.S. lawmakers on the request, the New York Times said, citing three unnamed officials.
