Remember that time Sarah Palin and pretty much her entire family got into a drunken brawl at a snowmobile company owner s birthday party?
Well, she s not the only vapid right-wing lady who can throw a punch at random people at a party.
Fox Business Network correspondent Charles Gasparino wrote on Facebook Monday that he personally witnessed something, well, something pretty hilarious at a private inaugural ball.Gasparino says he was hanging out with Scott Baio when the two were accosted by anarchist thugs.
According to Gasparino, one of the anarchists moved toward them and he assaulted the man, shoving him.
After Gasparino shoved him, the man allegedly told the pair touch me again u little prick and I ll smack u you know, because most people don t appreciate being randomly shoved.
It is unclear if it was said with the same terrible spelling.
Gasparino says he told the man to GFY when his producer intervened and crisis was averted.
It is unclear if Gasparino realizes he admitted to assaulting a guy simply for moving in his direction (allegedly), but what he says next is far more interesting:Part two was even more insane: inside the ball we see a fight between two guys in tuxes and then suddenly out of nowhere came trump adviser Kellyanne Conway who began throwing some mean punches at one of the guys.
Whole thing lasted a few mins no one was hurt except maybe the dude she smacked.
Now I know why trump hired her.
Btw I exaggerate none of this-cgLet s get this straight: Conway lost control of her own people, whom she could not keep from duking it out at a major political event celebrating her boss s big win, then decided to join in the fray and just beat the living hell out of one of them.Hell of a team Trump s building, huh?You can read the full post below:Featured image via Getty Images (Mark Wilson)
