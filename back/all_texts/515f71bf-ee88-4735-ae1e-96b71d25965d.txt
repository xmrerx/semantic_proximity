Beyonc is reportedly set to join Democratic Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton on Friday in Ohio, as the final days in race for the Presidency begin.According to a source for CBS News, the singer will be joining her husband Jay-Z at Cleveland State University for a get-out-the-vote concert, although the Clinton campaign has not provided a comment on the report.
Ohio is a key battleground state in the 2016 U.S. Presidential election, where a recent poll put Clinton s opponent Donald Trump ahead by two points.With a line up of performers including Katy Perry and John Legend, CBS News reported that Friday s concert is an attempt to win over the area s young and African-American voters, as well as encourage Ohio residents to vote early ahead of Tuesday s election day.Via: CBS
