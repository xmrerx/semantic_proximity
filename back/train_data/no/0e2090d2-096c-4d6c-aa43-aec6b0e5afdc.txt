dubai ( reuters ) - iran rejected on sunday a call by french president emmanuel macron for talks on tehran s ballistic missiles , saying they were defensive and unrelated to a nuclear agreement with world powers .
on thursday , macron said during a visit to dubai that he was very concerned by iran s ballistic missile program , mentioning a missile fired from yemen and intercepted by saudi arabia earlier this month .
he raised the prospect of possible sanctions with regard to those activities .
there are negotiations we need to start on iran s ballistic missiles , macron said .
but iranian foreign ministry spokesman bahram qassemi rejected that possibility .
france is fully aware of our country s firm position that iran s defense affairs are not negotiable , he said .
we have told french officials repeatedly that the nuclear deal is not negotiable and other issues will not be allowed to be added to it , qassemi said , according to a statement on the ministry s website .
the united states accused iran on tuesday of supplying yemen s houthi rebels with a missile that was fired into saudi arabia in july and called for the united nations to hold tehran accountable for violating two u.n. security council resolutions .
saudi arabia and its allies accuse iran of supplying missiles and other weapons to the houthis , saying the arms were not present in yemen before conflict broke out there in 2015 .
iran denies the charges and blames the conflict on riyadh .
the united states has imposed unilateral sanctions on iran , saying its missile tests violate a u.n. resolution that calls on tehran not to undertake activities related to missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons .
iran says its missile program is defensive and it has no plans to build nuclear-capable missiles .
