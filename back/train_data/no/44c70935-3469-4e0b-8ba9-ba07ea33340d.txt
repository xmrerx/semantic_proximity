washington ( reuters ) - the white house named a new adviser to president barack obama on climate and energy at the national security council , a spokesman said on wednesday .
the adviser , john morton , was previously the chief operating officer at the overseas private investment corporation .
he replaces paul bodnar , who helped push for cooperation between the united states and china on climate and for a global agreement at climate talks in paris last year .
morton , who began his career at the world bank , takes the job after the supreme court this month put a hold on obama ’ s clean power plan to cut emissions from power plants , a major part of the president ’ s strategy to fight climate change .
the death of supreme court justice antonin scalia four days later may have opened a path for the rule ’ s survival .
but the administration ’ s plan could face other legal hurdles from republicans and fossil fuel interests during obama ’ s last year in office .
