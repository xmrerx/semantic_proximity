One courageous Navy vet has had enough of the disrespectful NFL players who kneel during the national anthem.
Although it would be a great honor for the vet to receive an award, he put standing up for and defending our flag before being recognized for his service.
Good for him A disabled Navy veteran said he declined to accept an award at a New Orleans Saints game due to the controversy over players protesting during the national anthem.The Saints organization was going to honor retired Cmdr.
John Wells, the executive director of Military Veterans Advocacy, with the Peoples Health Champion award during last week s game in New Orleans, according to The Advocate.On Wednesday he told the organization he was unable to accept the award at the Mercedes-Benz Superdome because of the anthem protests.
Saints players have been seen kneeling before the anthem and some continue to do so during the national anthem.
Although I am touched and honored to be selected for such an award, the ongoing controversy with NFL players disrespect for the national flag forces me to decline to participate in the presentation, Wells said.
I am unable, in good conscience, to enter an NFL stadium while this discourtesy prevails.
Since this award is tainted with the dishonorable actions of the NFL and its players, I cannot accept it.
Wells served in the Navy from 1972 to 1994 and afterward became an attorney concentrating in military and veterans law, according to the New Orleans Times-Picayune.
He was set to receive the award given by Medicare to senior citizens who have made significant accomplishments.The Saints said in a statement Thursday that they were disappointed by Wells decision.
