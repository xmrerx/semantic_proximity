why would president trump want america to enforce a travel ban on refugees from terror hotbed nations ?
why wouldn t we want to import so many nice , trustworthy people with so many common values and similar customs ? at first sight the picture appears to show a mother cradling her young child as she flees an islamic state-held area of mosul.but a closer look reveals she is holding a trigger. , which she will pull seconds later.an iraqi tv station captured the moment before a suspected female islamic state of iraq and the levant ( isil ) suicide bomber blew herself and the baby up near iraqi troops.she had apparently tried to detonate an explosives vest hidden under her hijab as she passed the soldiers , but it failed to go off until she had walked some distance away , a cameraman for al-mawsleya tv said.she was killed along with her child , while two soldiers and several civilians were injured.the station had been filming the battle between iraqi troops and isil fighters and did not realise what they had caught on camera until they reviewed their footage later.the jihadists have used everything in their arsenal to fend off the troops in the final throes of the nine month-long offensive.isil s use of female suicide bombers in battle , while not new , is exceedingly rare and demonstrates the group s desperation.more than 20 female suicide bombers hiding among civilians are believed to have detonated explosives in the last two weeks.one general claimed they were even using their own children as human shields .
the women are fighting with their children right beside them , lieutenant general sami al-aridi said .
it s making us hesitant to use air strikes , to advance .
if it weren t for this we could be finished in just a few hours .
preventing the attacks has proved difficult .
iraq s socially conservative culture means soldiers do not ask women to lift up their clothes to check for explosives as they do men .
