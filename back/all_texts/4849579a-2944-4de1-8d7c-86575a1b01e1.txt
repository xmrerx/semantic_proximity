Newsflash Hillary WAR is not aesthetically pleasing!
Is this the kind of President America would like to have making decisions that impact our national security?
If she took away the ability for these 4 brave men to defend themselves, how does anyone honestly believe she is capable of acting as our Commander In Chief?House Republicans released their final report on the Benghazi terrorist attacks Tuesday morning.
The report concludes what we already knew.
that Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton DID NOTHING to save US lives in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.FOX News reported on Tuesday the State Department withheld the requested weapons from agents on the ground because they were not aesthetically pleasing.
Adam Housley: When we talk about those with reactions I spoke with including one special agent who was on the ground that night who says to me in Benghazi, quote, the report continues to show how ridiculous the STate Department makes it to give support to a special agent on the ground when he says he needs support.
There were about 10 of us who continually asked for more weapons and more security in Benghazi and were routinely denied.
And we reported on that because the State Department told him it wasn t aesthetically pleasing to have a belt-fed machine gun, for example.WATCH:Via: Gateway Pundit
