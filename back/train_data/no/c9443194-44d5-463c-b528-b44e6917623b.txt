ordinary citizens ( many of them are proud veterans ) are filling a breach left by our federal government us navy veteran tim keown has been standing guard outside a recruitment center in kentucky for a week now.tim made the decision to guard the local recruitment center after an islamic terrorist murdered five servicemen in chattanooga last week .
keown also helped organize other armed guards at recruitment centers across the country.citizen guards protect a recruitment office after the chattanooga terrorist attack.the pentagon released a statement on friday asking citizens not to stand guard at the unprotected recruiting offices .
but the pentagon has no plans on changing policy that forbids servicemen and women from carrying weapons at the centers .
evidently , five dead servicemen is not enough to force change in pentagon policy.tim keown says his group will remain outside the recruitment offices until the us soldiers and marines are protected : if our government is not going to protect these men and women , who is ?
who s going to protect these gentlemen and women if we don t ?
all i m asking is why can t recruiters arm themselves and protect themselves ?
