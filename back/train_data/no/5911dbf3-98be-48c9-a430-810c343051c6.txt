athens ( reuters ) - greek police clashed with hooded youths in athens on friday after thousands marched to mark a bloody 1973 student uprising that helped topple the military junta which then ruled the country .
more than 10,000 people marched peacefully to the embassy of the united states , which some greeks accuse of having supported the seven-year military dictatorship .
about 5,000 police were deployed in the streets of central athens .
at the tail-end of the demonstration , hooded youths hurled stones and petrol bombs at police in the exarchia district in central athens , often the setting for such clashes .
police used teargas to disperse them .
earlier on friday , greeks laid flowers at the athens polytechnic university to honor those killed during the revolt .
the junta collapsed less than a year later .
the annual protest often becomes a focal point for protests against government policies and austerity measures mandated by the country s international lenders in exchange for bailout funds .
the crisis that broke out in 2010 has left hundreds of thousands of people unemployed .
protesters held banners reading : we will live freely and no pensioner will be fired !
after seven years of belt-tightening greeks hope that they will emerge from lenders supervision in august 2018 , when the country s third international bailout expires .
many of them accuse a political elite of driving the country to bankruptcy .
