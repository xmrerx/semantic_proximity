inclusiveness !
that is the reason given in the statement by he ole miss athletic department another southern tradition bites the dust !
at what point do southerners say , enough !
the traditions of the southern colleges like ole miss are being stopped for fear of hurting people s feelings for not being included ?
this is the south and this is the reason so many people from everywhere choose to go to one of the southern colleges !
these colleges are full of tradition .
would we go to any other part of america and demand that they stop a tradition like singing dixie ?
this is ridiculous !
so why are they still called the rebels ?
ole miss band will no longer play dixie before football games.ole miss athletics department issued a statement saying it was time for the university to create new traditions.dixie a song that was the unofficial anthem of the confederate states of america during the civil war has been a staple of pride of the south s lineup for nearly seven decades .
recently the band stopped playing the song during games , but had continued to perform it in the grove on game days.the athletic department released the following statement about the change : the newly expanded and renovated vaught-hemingway stadium will further highlight our best traditions and create new ones that give the ole miss rebels the best home field advantage in college football .
because the pride of the south is such a large part of our overall experience and tradition , the athletics department asked them to create a new and modern pregame show that does not include dixie and is more inclusive for all fans .
