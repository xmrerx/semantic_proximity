Hillary was speaking to the NAACP on 10/30/15 and was promoting the Obama program to Ban the Box .
The program bans federal employers from asking if a potential employee has a criminal record.
This is supposed to give criminals a fair shot at employment.
So Hillary is jumping on this because it plays to her base, right?
She is all for criminal justice reform ESPECIALLY for Former Presidents?
Get ready for the biggest Freudian slip ever!
Earlier today I announced that as president I will take steps to ban the box, so former presidents won t have to declare their criminal history at the very start of the hiring process.
DID YOU CATCH THAT SLIP OF THE TONGUE?
WELL, SHE DIDN T, AND SHE DIDN T CORRECT HERSELF!
