Remember when illegal aliens, students, and residents of Berkeley took to the streets to march in solidarity, and publicly affirm that President Donald Trump is Not my President!
?
It s really not surprising to see ILLEGAL ALIENS boldly chanting He s not my President!
after our former president promised them unconstitutional citizenship rights.
Should anyone really take an illegal alien seriously who shouts that President Trump is not my President, when in fact, their president is actually in another country?
But then again, what difference does law and order make to students and non-citizens who are used to living under a president, like Barack Obama who openly defied both?Conservative Twitter user Brooks Brown hit the nail on the head with his tweet to Dreamers standing on our soil belching that Trump s NOT MY PRESIDENT' by reminding them that their dreams have gladly come true.
