berlin ( reuters ) - the european union would not simply carry on as before should britain vote to leave the bloc , germany ’ s foreign minister said on thursday , pointing to northern ireland as one potential trouble spot .
frank-walter steinmeier said he hoped britain would vote to stay in the 28-member bloc in a referendum on june 23 .
“ should the british decide otherwise , then the european union won ’ t just carry on as 28 minus one , ” steinmeier told a conference on europe in his ministry .
as an example of one area where old troubles could flare up , he pointed to northern ireland and its border with eu member ireland , which is open and where the situation is largely calm .
“ at the moment that the united kingdom leaves ( the eu ) , we have a border again between ireland and northern ireland .
that has at least the potential to allow completely calmed conflicts to flare up again , ” steinmeier said .
a 1998 peace deal , brokered after more than 3,600 had died , has largely ended the conflict that pitted mostly catholics , who wanted a united ireland , against unionists , mostly protestants , who wanted it to remain part of the united kingdom .
