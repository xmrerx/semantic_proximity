moscow ( reuters ) - a russian court on monday rejected a request to release classified documents about swedish world war two hero raoul wallenberg , whose fate remains a mystery seven decades after his reported death , russian news agencies reported .
wallenberg , a former swedish diplomat , helped save thousands of hungarian jews during world war two before being captured by soviet forces in 1945 .
a russian report claimed he died in 1947 in the lubyanka prison in central moscow run by the soviet security service , but no definitive proof of his fate has been put forward .
relatives of wallenberg filed a lawsuit against russia s federal security service ( fsb ) , seeking access to uncensored documents which they said could provide clues to wallenberg s fate .
but a moscow court rejected that lawsuit out of hand on monday , saying the documents could not be released because they contained personal information about other individuals , russian news agencies reported .
wallenberg s relatives were cited as saying they would appeal .
