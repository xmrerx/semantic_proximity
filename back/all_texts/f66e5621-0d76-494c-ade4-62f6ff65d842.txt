Mark Cuban is much richer than Donald Trump.
He is also sane enough to see that Donald Trump is a lunatic who would destroy the country.
That is why Cuban has endorsed Hillary Clinton.
He also devoted his Saturday afternoon campaigning for her in his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.While taking the stage in front of more than 5,000 people, Cuban immediately lit into Trump, even going so far as to call the real estate tycoon turned wannabe politician a jagoff, which is apparently a local term to describe an incompetent jackass like Trump.
Cuban said: You know what we call a person like that, you know, the screamers, the yellers, the people who try to intimidate you?
You know what we call a person like that in Pittsburgh?
A jag-off.
Is there any bigger jag-off in the world than Donald Trump?
This, of course was greeted with cheers from Cuban s hometown crowd.
In an interview with CNN, Cuban said that he was doing all he can to get Clinton elected because he is afraid of Donald Trump.
Cuban said: Initially, I really hoped he would be something different, that as a businessperson, I thought there was an opportunity there.
But then he went off the reservation and went bats crazy.
Cuban isn t the only prominent American who thinks Trump is nuts.
The Democratic National Convention stage was littered with Republicans and Independents who want Hillary elected in order to save the world from Trump.
This list includes former New York City mayor and billionaire Michael Bloomberg, and former Reagan White House Official Doug Elmets.Other Republicans really need to listen to Cuban, Bloomberg, Elmets, and other people who are trying to save this great nation from this dangerously unqualified demagogue.
Swallow your pride, forget about politics, and think of the bigger picture, folks.
The future of the country and the world depend on electing Hillary Clinton and defeating Donald Trump.Watch the video of Cuban s stump speech below:Featured image via video screen capture
