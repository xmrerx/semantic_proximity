a federal judge has ordered michigan election officials to begin a massive hand recount of 4.8 million ballots cast in the presidential election at noon monday.u.s .
district judge mark goldsmith issued a ruling just after midnight monday in favor of green party presidential candidate jill stein , who sought to let election officials bypass a two-business-day waiting period that would have delayed start of the recount until wednesday morning.the manual recount process was scheduled to begin wednesday as specified by state law , and in a rare sunday hearing in federal court , goldsmith questioned the harm posed by waiting.stein s lawyer mark brewer argued the case was aimed at ensuring the integrity of michigan s voting system and that the required waiting period violated stein s rights to due process and equal protection .
he pushed for the recount of 4.8 million ballots to start immediately , which he said would be monday morning .
there are questions raised throughout the country about the integrity of the election system , brewer told the judge in front of a courtroom filled with about two dozen people , including state republican party chair ronna romney mcdaniel .
it s not just rhetoric .
the hearing ended sunday afternoon , with a staffer for the judge saying goldsmith would issue a written opinion but he did not give a timeline.the deadline to finalize the vote total for the electoral college is dec. 13 .
chris thomas , the state elections director , testified sunday that he could not guarantee that the recount could be finished by that deadline , calling the task doable but difficult .
