In case you missed this earlier today A woman was hit by an anarchist and then dragged by her American flag.
She ran to find the attacker and came upon a group of Black Lives Matter girls who taunted her.
It s sickening to watch but shows just hoe hateful these people are.
She explains in the second video down FOX NEWS: Woman waving American flag hit, dragged by Antifa at #BostonFreeSpeechRally.

They were absent from the area but you can bet if this was a left leaning person the media would have been all over this woman.
Shame on them!
