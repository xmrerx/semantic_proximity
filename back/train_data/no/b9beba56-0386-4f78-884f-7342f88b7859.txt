so the moderator of the democratic debate met with the campaigns of the candidates but didn t give away any questions ?
really ?
and we re supposed to believe this ?
a pre-interview took place to discuss the issues at play in the race .
isn t that giving the questions away ? i d call that a strategy session because we shouldn t forget that ben rhodes and david rhodes are brothers this saturday s second democratic debate will be a much smaller affair than the first .
with only three candidates on stage , cbs news plans to delve deep into the issues with each candidate and have taken advantage of the smaller pool by doing some intense research .
moderator john dickerson and his team met with each of the campaigns for more than an hour to discuss the major issues at play in the race , sources on the campaigns said , describing the pre-interview as informational in nature .
dickerson is not giving candidates previews of his questions for the debate .
prior to the cnn debate , the campaigns said moderator anderson cooper did not reach out directly to them before the candidates took the stage .
dickerson and his team were very interested in getting to better know the senator s stand on a wide spectrum of issues , what he would do about income inequality in this country , said bernie sanders spokesman michael briggs .
he said they discussed issues where there are real differences between the candidates including gun control , the death penalty and raising taxes on the middle class .
john dickerson s a smart , impressive guy who cares a lot about the issues , briggs said .
i m sure we ll see a smart , issues-oriented debate .
