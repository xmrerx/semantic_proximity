Rachel Maddow has a well-earned reputation as one of the smartest people on cable news.
Tina Fey has a well-earned reputation as one of the smartest comedians in the country.
So what happens when you put them against each other to see who s the biggest Know It All?
To answer that very question, Jimmy Fallon, host of The Tonight Show, had both Fey and Maddow on to compete in a fast-paced trivia game.
I literally had no idea who was going to win (although I was rooting for Maddow).
You ll have to see the outcome for yourself:Nooooooooo!
Rachel got trumped (pun intended) by goat cheese!
Well played, Ms. Fey well played.
The only thing missing was a mic to drop.Honestly, the part I loved about this the most was watching two smart people put their brains on display.
That s something we don t see as often as we used to.
These days, being too smart will make people mad at you.
They ll denounce you as a know it all as if knowing stuff is a bad thing!
But it wasn t always like that.
As The Newsroom s Will McAvoy said, We aspired to intelligence, we didn t belittle it.
It didn t makes us feel inferior.
Reality TV used to be quiz shows with some of the smartest people in the country held up as idols.
Now we idolize the vapid and obnoxious on The Real Housewives of Who The Hell Cares and Honey Boo Boo.
We used to aspire to be better than ourselves, now we just aspire to better than someone else.
But with a little luck and more strong and smart role models like Fey and Maddow, maybe we can inspire a new generation to better themselves instead of tearing others down.Featured image via screencap.
