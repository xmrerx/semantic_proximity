President Barack Obama only has a few short weeks left in the White House, and it s never been more clear how absolutely fed up he is with the obstruction he faced from the Republican Party over the last 8 years.In a recent exit interview on The Axe Files, Obama said what no one in the GOP wants to admit especially not President-elect Donald Trump.
Obama said, without any apology, that he would have beaten Trump if he d run for a third term in the 2016 election.
Considering that Obama has a soaring approval rating and Trump has the lowest approval rating in modern history, this is certainly a devastating blow to Trump and the GOP.In a conversation with his former senior adviser David Axelrod, Obama stated that most of America is still a very progressive nation, and if the Constitution had allowed him to run again, he could have won over the majority without issue.
Obama said: I know that in conversations that I ve had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say, The vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one.
Obama also didn t make any attempt to mince words when calling out specific Republicans such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who Obama said acted very cynically toward him during his presidency.
Obama also hit back at Fox News and other GOPers who provided a backlash to this vision.
Obama said of McConnell and other obstructing Republicans: His insight was that we just have to say no to that then that will puncture the balloon, that all this talk about hope and change and no red state and blue state is is proven to be a mirage, a fantasy.
And if we can if we can puncture that vision, then we have a chance to win back seats in the House and win back seats in the Senate In the wake of the election and Trump winning, a lot of people have suggested that somehow, [my vision] really was a fantasy.
What I would argue is, is that the culture actually did shift, that the majority does buy into the notion of a one America that is tolerant and diverse and open and full of energy and dynamism.
Obama also complimented Hillary Clinton, stating that she d performed wonderfully under really tough circumstances and lamented that the former Secretary of State had faced a double standard that other candidates had not.You can listen to Obama s full interview here.Featured image via Mark Wilson and Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images
