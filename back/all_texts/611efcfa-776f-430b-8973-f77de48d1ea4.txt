A huge rally of 10,000 Chicagoans didn t get to hear their candidate speak tonight because the left apparently thinks free speech goes one way.
About 5,000-7,000 Trump supporters had filled the pavilion on the UIC campus with many more in line when all heck broke loose.
The left is fuming tonight and decided to show up in force at a Trump rally in Chicago.
Even lefty radical Bill Ayers decided to show up.
The left is upset because they can t control the movement that is Trump.
