On Monday, Donald Trump unveiled his much anticipated and long waited economic plan that was, as everyone could guess, wasn t much of a plan.After being advised for a week from an elite billionaire team of advisors (including six guys named Steve), Trump had little to show for his efforts.In what cleverly disguised as a plan to benefit the middle and low class who have been left behind, one didn t have to look too hard to see what it was: a gift bag of benefits for the rich and the most powerful corporations.And there is one person who is the perfect watchdog to pick apart Trump and his absurdities, the person who truly gets under his skin: Elizabeth Warren.Taking to Twitter, Warren knocked some truth into what is being hailed as Trump s comeback in the campaign:.
@realDonaldTrump s econ plan was written by rich corporate insider advisors to make the economy even greater for rich corporate insiders.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) August 8, 2016 Cut regulations massively, @realDonaldTrump?
No rules & no accountability means people get ripped off & markets blow up.
Remember 2008?
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) August 8, 2016A moratorium on agency regulations means stopping new rules on shady payday lenders & too-big-to-fail banks, @realDonaldTrump.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) August 8, 2016 W/o rules, @realDonaldTrump, too many huge banks juiced profits by cheating ppl on mortgages, credit cards, etc, then crashed our economy.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) August 8, 2016Cheating customers & gaming the system might be your business, @realDonaldTrump, but it s not the way America is going to do business.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) August 8, 2016 And taxes?
@realDonaldTrump wants billionaires & giant corps to pay EVEN LESS so there s less money for ed, infrastructure & research.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) August 8, 2016Even @realDonaldTrump s childcare plan gives billionaires w/ a nanny a tax break while millions of low-income households get nothing.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) August 8, 2016 .
@realDonaldTrump s economics plan is all about helping rich guys like Donald Trump get richer & leaving everyone else behind.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) August 8, 2016The American people aren t dumb, @realDonaldTrump.
We don t trust you with our nuclear codes AND we don t trust you with our economy.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) August 8, 2016Classic Elizabeth Warren, being the lioness in the Senate who looks out for the average Joe.The fact that any Republican can call for a moratorium on the regulations that protect consumers (to make sure the crash of 2008 wouldn t happen again) is insulting to every American.From George W. Bush s push to privatize Social Security, to Paul Ryan s Medicare budget, to Trump s new economic plan, Republicans have been trying to dupe, cheat and weaken the American middle class.Luckily we have politicians like Hillary Clinton and Elizabeth Warren who will call out the economic fallacies being peddled by the extreme right.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
