An Aug. 8, 2015, email exchange between Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and communications aide Jennifer Palmieri revealed the two discussing whether to call Hillary and sober her up some.
Should I call her and talk this through or better leave with you?
Podesta asked at 2 p.m.
I m worried she ll get on with Cheryl [Mills] and we ll end up in a bad place.
It took Palmieri two hours to respond to Podesta s question.
I think you should call her and sober her up some, she said.Via: GP
