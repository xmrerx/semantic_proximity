donald trump and the republican congress are busy trying to shred healthcare for the rest of us , but one republican lawmaker is using obamacare to get major surgery before he leaves office.utah rep. jason chaffetz has been outspoken about the republican effort to kill the affordable care act .
he s been salivating at doing so for years .
he calls it a failed program that has done nothing but hurt the american people.but while he s busy trying to repeal the landmark healthcare law , he has no problem using it himself.earlier this month , chaffetz announced that he would not seek re-election after his current term expires .
however , he s going to make sure he sucks as much healthcare out of american taxpayers as he can before he officially leaves.chaffetz posted a message to facebook on wednesday night informing his constituents that he will be getting major surgery on his foot and will be taking the next 3-4 weeks offchaffetz seriously expects us to understand and give a damn about his situation .
the problem is that he lacks sympathy and empathy when it comes to ordinary americans who can t afford such surgeries and the amount of recovery time required.and if republicans succeed at killing the affordable care act , americans will be at serious risk of not having health insurance to cover such medical procedures.chaffetz , on the other hand , is using his gold level health insurance under the affordable care act to cover his surgery .
so he is literally using the affordable care act to make sure his healthcare needs are met , and after he has no further use for it he ll vote to kill the law for everyone else.americans were not happy about this hypocrisy , so they stormed chaffetz s twitter page and hammered him for it .
@ jasoninthehouse and you re going to use this as a teachable moment as to why coverage for pre-existing conditions and paid health leave is important , yes ?
