the former secretary of state is under federal investigation for potentially violating the espionage act by allowing people without a security clearance to access classified information .
the fact that hillary was sharing an email network with a private foundation means that people without a security clearance almost certainly had physical access to her server while she was working at the state department.here s what we know : the servers have the same ip addresshillary s clintonemail.com server and the foundation-run presidentclinton.com email server have exactly the same ip address , and the same ssl certificate ( which an organization purchases for an email server to verify its trustworthiness ) .mail.clintonemail.com and mail.presidentclinton.com both have an ip address of 64.94.172.146 , according to an ssl certificate checker.the two servers both have that same ip address , 64.94.172.146 , according to dns records .
( here are records for hillary s server , and here are records for bill s server ) .both servers have the same ip address , according to another independent internet records database , robtex.net.the fact that both of these email servers have the same ip address means that they were operating on the same network , and sharing physical space .
a computer expert tells breitbart news that the servers were probably operating on the same machine .
it is also possible that they were operating on different machines on the same network , which still means that the machines would have to be close enough to exist in the same physical location.president clinton s server was created in 2002 , while hillary s was created in 2009 , which means that hillary s server was simply added to bill s foundation-run server network.they had the same ip address when she was secretary of statehillary s server and bill s foundation-run server also shared a different ip address during her tenure as secretary of state.from september 8 , 2009 until june 24 , 2011 , bill clinton s foundation-run mail.presidentclinton.com server had an ip address of 24.187.234.187 , according to dns records.hillary s mail.clintonemail.com server had the same exact ip address , 24.187.234.187 , from the dates may 21 , 2010 until october 21 , 2010 , according to dns records.their shared ip address can be traced to midtown manhattana geographical search for the ip address that both servers shared at registration traces to midtown manhattan , according to three different databases : infosniper.net , which locates a midtown latitude/longitude point , ip-tracker.org , which also gives a midtown latitude/longitude point , and whatsmyip.org.clinton foundation headquarters are currently located at 1271 6th avenue in midtown .
