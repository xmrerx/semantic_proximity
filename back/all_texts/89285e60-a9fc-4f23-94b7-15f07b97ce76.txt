MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia s foreign ministry said on Thursday it regrets the decision by the U.S. leadership to quit UNESCO, adding the move would disrupt a number of important projects planned by the United Nation s cultural and educational agency.
We share the concern by many countries that the activity of UNESCO has been too politicized lately, the ministry said in a statement.
We hope the new director general will spare no effort to change the current situation and focus on exclusively humanitarian issues, which would allow us to continue beneficial cooperation in UNESCO s fields of competence with all countries, including the United States.
