new york ( reuters ) - nearly half of american adults said the republican healthcare reform measure is “ not an improvement ” over obamacare , according to a reuters/ipsos opinion poll released on friday .
the republican bill , the american health care act ( ahca ) , which is up for a vote in the house of representatives later on friday , is expected to cut the federal deficit while greatly increasing the number of americans without health insurance .
democratic leaders are unified against the bill while some conservative republicans have criticized it for not doing enough to dismantle the affordable care act , the measure familiarly known as obamacare which was passed in 2010 and was the signature domestic achievement of former president barack obama .
according to the march 13-23 poll , 49 percent of american adults said the ahca was “ not an improvement ” over obamacare , which helped about 20 million people get insurance coverage .
another 33 percent said the republican bill was “ an improvement ” over obamacare , and the remaining 18 percent did not know .
the responses were largely split along party lines .
some 19 percent of democrats and 53 percent of republicans said the ahca was better than obamacare , while 73 percent of democrats and 22 percent of republicans said it was not an improvement .
the reuters/ipsos poll was conducted online in english in all 50 states .
it first asked if people were familiar with the republican reform .
those who said they were familiar were then asked whether they thought it was an improvement .
altogether , some 1,741 people responded to both questions .
this includes 673 republicans and 829 democrats .
the poll has a credibility interval , a measure of accuracy , of 3 percentage points for the entire group and 4 percentage points for the responses from democrats and the republicans .
