21st century wire says as republican , ted cruz and democrat , hillary clinton both snatched narrow victories at the iowa caucuses this week , other big brand names didn t turn out so well.nonetheless , old john ellis , or jeb bush , is still hanging in there going into the upcoming new hampshire primary .
although jeb managed to get only 2.8 % of the iowa gop caucus vote , he still has sufficient funds in his political war chest to carry on .
despite the fact that he appears to be more intelligent and compos mentis than his brother george , he still struggles to gain mass appeal.as campaign moments go , however , this has got to be one of the saddest , most doleful moments we ve seen yet .
during one of jeb s many staged , meet jeb town hall-style meetings , where segments are filmed in order to extract outtakes for use in an endless series of campaign ads , jeb finished a good speaking stretch before sheepishly turning to a mostly disinterested audience , quietly begging them to clap for the cameras.you have to see it to believe it .
