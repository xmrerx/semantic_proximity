Senator Jeanne Shaheen justifies leaking phone conversations of President Trump!
She says that Trump s tweeting is a problem and that it s a serious situation .
She s on the Foreign Relations Committee!MSNBC s Chris Matthews asked Shaheen what she thought of officials leaking the conversations: My experience is that when people feel like they need to leak something like that, it s because they have concerns about what s going on and I think that s one of the challenges.
When we have a president who tries to make national security policy or foreign policy through tweeting, then we have a problem, and my guess is that s why people are leaking this kind of information, because they want the public to know how serious this situation is.
What in the world is this woman talking about?
Under no circumstances is this ok!
Shaheen is on the Foreign Relations Committee!
Her website says: As a member of the U.S. Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, Senator Shaheen is committed to helping build strong international alliances to bolster America s national security and boost our economy.How will it help international alliances if the world leaders are fearful of leaks if they call President Trump?
