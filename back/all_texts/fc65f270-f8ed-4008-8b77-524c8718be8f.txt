Since the start of Donald Trump s presidential campaign, he s gone after pretty much every minority group there is.
Along with his obvious and seemingly deliberate racism, he s also declared that he will deport all undocumented immigrants, mainly the ones he can tell by skin color.
In other words, Latinos and Muslims.
His words have been horrendous and have reached far and wide all across the United States.His words have even reached a young third grader, who seems to be taking an ESL (English as a Second Language) course, and their teacher in Ohio posted a letter the child wrote concerning Donald Trump to Facebook for all the world to see.
Why?
Because it s AMAZING.The letter reads, in its original grammar: I have a dream 2016!I have a dream that Donald Trump will not be president.
But if he does all Asians, Africans and Mexicans have to go back to their contry.
Without them the U.S.A. population will go down to 12,0000 people only.
Most enginners are Indian then their won t be no tecnolegy!
Without tecnolgy theirs no NETFLIX.
Without netflix theirs no chill.
Is that a world you what live in NO.

They are a young child after all and hopefully they won t know the grown up meaning to that phrase til much later in life.However, the point is still made that if we as a nation degrade, look down upon, or worse deport minorities, we ll be doing ourselves a great disservice.
The United States of America is a nation of immigrants, it s kind of our thing.
It makes us who we are, and we can cultivate the best and brightest to build a better future.So to answer the question again, no, we don t want to live in a world with Donald Trump as president.
