cairo ( reuters ) - an egyptian court on saturday sentenced ousted president mohammed mursi of the muslim brotherhood to 25 years in prison in a final ruling over a case accusing him of spying for qatar , judicial sources said .
mursi , democratically elected after egypt s 2011 revolution , was overthrown in mid-2013 by then-general abdel fattah al-sisi , now the president , following mass protests against his rule .
he was immediately arrested .
egypt s court of cassation reduced mursi s sentence in the qatar case to 25 years in its final ruling , from an original 40 years .
mursi is already serving a 20-year sentence after being convicted for the killing of protesters during demonstrations in 2012 .
since toppling mursi , sisi has clamped down on dissent .
mass trials have been held for thousands of muslim brotherhood supporters , and hundreds have received death sentences or lengthy prison terms .
in 2014 , egypt charged mursi and nine others with endangering national security by leaking state secrets and sensitive documents to qatar .
egypt s relations with doha were already troubled by qatar s backing of mursi .
egypt is one of four arab nations in a saudi-led bloc that cut relations with the gulf state on june 5 , accusing it of backing militant groups and cooperating with their arch-foe iran , allegations doha denies .
