Kids Just Want To Use Words That s racist, that s sexist.
They don t even know what they re talking about Like Chris Rock and Larry the Cable Guy, Jerry Seinfeld avoids doing shows on college campuses.
And while talking with ESPN s Colin Cowherd on Thursday, the comedian revealed why: College kids today are too politically correct.
I hear that all the time, Seinfeld said on The Herd with Colin Cowherd.
I don t play colleges, but I hear a lot of people tell me, Don t go near colleges.
They re so PC.
Seinfeld says teens and college-aged kids don t understand what it means to throw around certain politically-correct terms.
They just want to use these words: That s racist; That s sexist; That s prejudice, he said.
They don t know what the f k they re talking about.
The funnyman went on to recount a conversation he and his wife had with their 14-year-old daughter, which he believes proved his point.
My wife says to her, Well, you know, in the next couple years, I think maybe you re going to want to be hanging around the city more on the weekends, so you can see boys, Seinfeld recalled.
You know what my daughter says?
She says, That s sexist.

received after his controversial appearance on Saturday Night Live last month, further proving Seinfeld s point.
Louis great gift is that he doesn t worry, he just does his thing, he said.
And Seinfeld s not scared to make his point, either: If I wanted to say something, I would say it.
But for now, Seinfeld will stick to covering the topics he can feels he can make humorous, PC or not.
I talk about the subjects I talk about because for some reason I can make them funny, he said.
The ones I can t make funny, you don t hear.
