if ivanka trump really cares about the lgbtq community she would not have supported her dad in the 2016 election.but she did , and that means any show of support she makes is meaningless.tone deaf as usual , ivanka still posted a couple tweets on thursday night in a weak effort to honor lgbtq americans.logging back on after shavuot , wishing everyone a joyful # pride2017 .
this month we celebrate and honor the # lgbtq community .
ivanka trump ( @ ivankatrump ) june 2 , 2017and in order to prove her support , she claimed that she has lgbtq friends.i am proud to support my lgbtq friends and the lgbtq americans who have made immense contributions to our society and economy .
ivanka trump ( @ ivankatrump ) june 2 , 2017it s kinda like when a racist republican claims they are not racist because they claim to have black friends.again , ivanka supported her dad for president despite the fact that he picked anti-gay conservative mike pence as his vice-president .
and let s not forget that trump s education secretary betsy devos is also virulently anti-gay as are many other trump officials.the fact is that trump s administration represents the single greatest threat to the lives and freedom of lgbtq americans .
and that s exactly why twitter users handed ivanka her ass for daring to claim she supports them.then why d you support anti-gay mike pence ?
mrs panstreppon ( @ mrspanstreppon ) june 2 , 2017like you can t just say how progressive you are and be employed by those who are advocating for the exact opposite things .
gabe ( @ bdylan234 ) june 2 , 2017is it me ?
or is @ ivankatrump vying for the most tone-deaf out-of-touch individual who ever lived award ?

your words mean nothing to us .

christina applegate ( @ 1capplegate ) june 2 , 2017bitchhhch please https : //t.co/pfnpoovtvv pic.twitter.com/ee3ywa2pd5 lifeisbeautiful ( @ daisyrubinsmom ) june 2 , 2017actions speak louder than words tyler # chosenfamily ( @ tyleroakley ) june 2 , 2017i m sorry , but if you had any lgbtq friends before your father got into office , i suspect a vanishingly small proportion are still there .
tom coates ( @ tomcoates ) june 2 , 2017you send out two tweets about # pride2017 and your father didn t send out a single one ! ! !

https : //t.co/eturrss8re matt ortega ( @ mattortega ) june 2 , 2017where were you on this ? lgbt advocates say trump s new executive order makes them vulnerable to discrimination https : //t.co/y0z7gk5bd7 matt ortega ( @ mattortega ) june 2 , 2017just like when ivanka claims to support women , she is once again being a hypocrite who says one thing while supporting the man who is making their lives a living hell .
