nairobi ( reuters ) - a presidential election due to take place in kenya on thursday has no legitimacy because of a high court ruling that the appointment of constituency-level electoral officers was illegal , an opposition lawyer said on wednesday .
it would be illegal and unconstitutional for them to move ahead with the election , lawyer james orengo told media outside the supreme court , after that court said it could not hear a petition to delay the election because not enough judges were available .
the high court ruling was earlier on wednesday , but only the supreme court has the power to delay elections .
