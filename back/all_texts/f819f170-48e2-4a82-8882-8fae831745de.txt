Every nameless, beaten down, forgotten working stiff who used to be part of what we called the middle class , loves Trump.
The human hand grenade they can legally throw into the system that stole their lives from them.
And on November 8th, election day, although they ve lost their jobs, although they ve been foreclosed on by the bank, next came the divorce and now the wife and kids are gone, the cars been re-po d, they haven t had a vacation in years and they re stuck with the shitty Obamacare Bronze Plan where they can t even get a f*cking percocet.
They ve essentially lost all that they ve had except one thing.
The one thing that doesn t cost them a cent, and it s guaranteed to them by the American Constitution the right to vote!They might be penniless they might be homeless it doesn t matter because it s equalized on that day.
The millionaire has the same number of votes as the person who doesnt have a job .ONE!
So on November 8th, the dispossessed will walk into the voting booth, be handed a ballot, close the curtain and take that lever, or felt pen or touch screen and put a big F*CKING X next to the name of the man who has threatened to upend and overturn the very system that has ruined their lives Donald J. Trump.
