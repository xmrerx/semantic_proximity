mexico city ( reuters ) - mexico s senate on friday named the country s new top prosecutor for election-related crimes , after the official previously in the post was fired amid a graft scandal involving a close former aide of president enrique pena nieto .
hector marcos diaz , a lawyer and academic with a long career in mexico s electoral bodies , was approved as the newest prosecutor for electoral crimes with 92 senators votes , the senate said in a statement .
the previous incumbent , santiago nieto , was fired by mexico s acting attorney general in october on the grounds that he broke a code of conduct for officials .
nieto had given a newspaper interview in which he accused emilio lozoya , the former boss of state oil firm pemex and a senior member of the president s 2012 campaign team , of writing to him to ask that he be declared innocent of funneling cash from brazilian construction firm odebrecht into pena nieto s campaign .
odebrecht is at the heart of a brazilian bribery and kickback probe , known as lava jato or car wash , that has reverberated across latin america .
the ruling institutional revolutionary party ( pri ) has been trying to shake a reputation for graft that threatens to undermine the party s efforts to stay in power in next july s presidential election .
the firing of nieto was widely seen as a setback to those efforts .
the pri has overseen the arrest of various former state governors , but lozoya poses a more difficult challenge , given his proximity to the president .
both pena nieto and lozoya have denied involvement in any wrongdoing related to the 2012 campaign .
