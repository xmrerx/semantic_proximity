rabat ( reuters ) - fifteen people were killed and five more injured when a stampede broke out in a southwestern moroccan town on sunday as food aid was being distributed in a market , the interior ministry said .
a hospital source put the death toll at 18 , adding that most victims were women who had been scrambling for food handed out by a rich man in the small coastal town of sidi boulaalam .
a local journalist said the donor had organised similar handouts before , but this year some 1,000 people arrived , storming an iron barrier under which several women were crushed .
king mohammed ordered that the victims families be given any assistance they needed and the wounded treated at his cost , the ministry said in a statement , adding that a criminal investigation had been opened .
last month , the king dismissed the ministers of education , planning and housing and health after an economic agency found imbalances in implementing a development plan to fight poverty in the northern rif region .
the rif saw numerous protests after a fishmonger was accidentally crushed to death in a garbage truck in october 2016 after a confrontation with police , and he became a symbol of the effects of corruption and official abuse .
in july , the king pardoned dozens of people arrested in the protests and accused local officials of stoking public anger by being too slow to implement development projects .
