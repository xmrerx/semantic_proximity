beirut ( reuters ) - the head of the syrian opposition s high negotiations committee ( hnc ) resigned on monday , nearly two years after he was picked to chair the saudi-backed umbrella group that brings together the armed and political opposition to president bashar al-assad .
riyad hijab , a former syrian prime minister under assad , did not explain his reasons for stepping down in a statement posted on social media .
the hnc has been the main representative of the syrian opposition since its formation at a meeting in saudi arabia in december , 2015 , and has taken part in u.n.-led diplomacy aimed at ending the conflict that erupted in 2011 .
the war has been going assad s way since russia sent its air force to support him militarily in 2015 .
the damascus government has been steadily regaining control of territory , thanks also to the support of iran-backed forces such as lebanon s hezbollah .
saudi arabia is due to host an expanded conference for the syrian opposition this month , aiming to unify its position ahead of more u.n.-backed peace talks , the saudi state news agency spa reported last week .
previous rounds of geneva peace talks have failed to make headway towards a resolution of the war .
