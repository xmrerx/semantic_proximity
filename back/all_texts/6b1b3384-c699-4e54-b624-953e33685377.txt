Former Democratic National Committee chairman Howard Dean hinted that President Donald Trump would not make it through his first term Friday on MSNBC s Morning Joe.
Discussing Sen. Jeff Flake s (R., Ariz.) remarks that Trump could be inviting a 2020 Republican primary challenger with his conduct in office, Dean suggested Trump could no longer be president by then anyway.Watch: Who knows if Trump is going to be around in 2020?
Of his own volition, I think it s unlikely he ll be impeached, even if the Democrats take over [the House], although [Robert] Mueller could unearth some stuff that could lead to that, Dean said.
I think this is unpredictable.
