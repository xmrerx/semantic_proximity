upon raiding the farm , security forces were surprised by gunshots in their direction which were dealt with , resulting in the killing of nine , the ministry said .
it said it was still trying to determine the identity of the suspects .
weapons and ammunition were found at the farm .
in a separate raid in cairo on a terrorist hideout , police arrested nine other suspected militants on sunday , the ministry said in the same statement .
those arrested all have ties with the outlawed muslim brotherhood , it said .
security forces have battled islamist militants in the mainly desert region stretching from the suez canal eastwards to the gaza strip and israel , since 2013 .
