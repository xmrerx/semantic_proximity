Trevor Noah, host of Comedy Central s The Daily Show, is about to experience his first viewing of a time-honored American tradition: The State of the Union Address.
To help him along in this endeavor, he called in one of his correspondents, Roy Wood Jr., who tried to help Noah to know what to expect.However, there was only one thing Wood seemed certain of: Obama is leaving office and he s gonna say and do whatever the f*ck he wants.
Wood told Noah: More of a preview of the exhibits in the Obama presidential library the Affordable Care Act, the climate change deal, how he taught not one but two Portuguese water dogs to fist-bump.
But what I do know for sure about this year s speech?
Obama has no more f*cks to give.
Wood referenced the twitter photo, tweeted out from President Obama s official account while hammering this most important point home.This is it President Obama's final #SOTU.

That s the same face I make when I m about to leave my job.
He then went on to point out to Trevor Noah just what the SOTU actually is, and how the president is supposed to, no matter what, assure the American people that things are going great, no matter what is actually happening.
You know Trevor, when America asks you if it looks fat in its jeans, it s not really looking for an honest answer.
Just say America has a bangin a*s and be done with it.
And he s exactly right.
And after all President Obama has been through, all the right-wing hate and obstruction, yet still managed to accomplish so much, he deserves to have a bit of fun.So, go for it, Mr. President.
