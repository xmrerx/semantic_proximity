Donald Trump is once again the White House leaker he keeps whining about.Ever since taking office, Trump has refused to open an investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 Election, and has insisted that such a thing never happened despite evidence to the contrary.It has been going on like this for months.But on Thursday morning, Trump slipped up on Twitter by trying to blame President Obama for the Russian interference.By the way, if Russia was working so hard on the 2016 Election, it all took place during the Obama Admin.
Why didn t they stop them?
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2017Trump basically just confirmed that Russia meddled with the election that put him in office.
He s just trying to pin the blame on the Obama Administration because special prosecutor Robert Mueller is closing in on him.In the very next tweet, Trump once again insisted the whole thing is a hoax and then continued making excuses.
Why did Democratic National Committee turn down the DHS offer to protect against hacks (long prior to election).
It s all a big Dem HOAX!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2017 Why did the DNC REFUSE to turn over its Server to the FBI, and still hasn t?
It s all a big Dem scam and excuse for losing the election!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 22, 2017Twitter users were not amused.Russia attacked the heart of democracy and you re using it as an opportunity to attack Obama.
Mark Pygas (@MarkPygas) June 22, 2017That s like blaming Pearl Harbour on FDR instead of the Japanese Empire.
Mark Pygas (@MarkPygas) June 22, 2017Jeh Johnson said yesterday they waited because a certain candidate was saying #Election2016 was rigged?
kim (@kim) June 22, 2017The FBI just confirmed that NOT ONLY did Russia interfere in 2016 (duh), the 2018 elections are ALREADY being manipulated by Russia.
Jules Suzdaltsev (@jules_su) June 22, 2017In October before the election Obama warned the Russians that the law of armed conflict applies to cyberspace https://t.co/9qjg462LpS pic.twitter.com/iBASxoKqjk Robert Maguire (@RobertMaguire_) June 22, 2017They didn t make any public statements though.
After all, Trump was already out there saying the election was rigged pic.twitter.com/KESz9Bbow4 Robert Maguire (@RobertMaguire_) June 22, 2017In short, if Trump had lost on election night he would have blamed Obama for interfering with Russian meddling.
Trump was clearly setting up for that by repeatedly claiming that the election was rigged.It s time for Trump to be impeached and thrown behind bars along with the rest of his pathetic family of criminals.
Trump just admitted that Russia interfered.
By all rights he should resign because he didn t win fair and square.
But he won t and that means he needs to be forcibly removed.Featured Image: Joe Raedle/Getty Images
