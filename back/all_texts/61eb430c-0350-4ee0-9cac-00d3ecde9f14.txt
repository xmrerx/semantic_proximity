Former President Barack Obama embarked on an Asia trip this week, and Fox Business Lou Dobbs went off on Obama tonight for comments aimed at President Trump.
Our favorite comment goes to Steve Forbes who said, He doesn t get that he doesn t matter anymore.
Ouch!
Please see the video below of Nigel Evans who says what we d like to say to Obama.THE OBAMAS ARE TAKING OVER FOR THE CLINTONS THEY NEVER GO AWAY!Obama is obviously thinking he still matters He rudely took swipes at President Trump:While in India, Obama offered this advice: Think before you speak, think before you tweet.
He also invoked his own social media follower numbers compared to other people who use it more often.
Dobbs slammed Obama for his criticisms of his predecessor, and guest Steve Forbes said Obama doesn t realize he doesn t matter anymore.
Dobbs then said this: I think U.S.
Marshals should follow him, and any time he wants to go follow the President like he is, and behave I mean, this is just bad manners.
It s boorish, it s absurd, he doesn t realize how foolish he looks.
I mean, he should be brought back by the Marshals.
Isn t there some law that says presidents shouldn t be attacking sitting presidents?
OBAMA SHOULD TAKE ADVICE FROM BRITISH MP NIGEL EVANS: When we stand up in this country and attack Donald Trump in an unseemly way we re actually attacking the American people.
Conservative MP Nigel Evans tells those opposing Trump s state visit to get over it because he s the President of the United States .When you attack President Trump, you attack America
