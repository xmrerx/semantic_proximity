just what america needs another president who makes up laws to fit his radical agenda , with no regard for the actual laws the rest of america must abide by democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders ripped into maricopa county sheriff joe arpaio at a rally in northern arizona on thursday , after facing criticism from the clinton campaign for an encounter sanders wife had with the immigration-hardliner sheriff.the u.s. senator from vermont said arpaio s arrests of undocumented immigrants , often separating families , were outrageous and unconscionable .
it s easy for bullies like sheriff arpaio to pick on people who have no power , sanders said .
if i am elected president the president of the united states does have power .
so watch out , joe .
