You can probably expect Donald Trump to continue his seemingly endless string of tweets about the fake news from a baker s dozen intelligence agencies that says that he and his friends may have been involved in some rather unethical actions involving a certain Russian dictator, Trump s campaign staff, and possibly a whole mess of Russian lady pee.McClatchy DC reports that the FBI and five other law enforcement agencies, including the CIA, the National Security Agency, the Justice Department, the Treasury Department s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, and representatives of the Director of National Intelligence, are investigating whether the Kremlin took efforts to secure victory for The Donald.
And apparently, Israeli spies were correct when they said that things were a lot worse than some nice escorts draining the swamp on Trump s bed.
McClatchy s report says:Investigators are examining how money may have moved from the Kremlin to covertly help Trump win, the two sources said.
One of the allegations involves whether a system for routinely paying thousands of Russian-American pensioners may have been used to pay some email hackers in the United States or to supply money to intermediaries who would then pay the hackers, the two sources said.The informal, inter-agency working group began to explore possible Russian interference last spring, long before the FBI received information from a former British spy hired to develop politically damaging and unverified research about Trump, according to the sources, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the inquiry.Trump, who will be handed the nuclear launch codes and all of our country s secrets on Friday, has spent quite a bit of time praising, quoting, and agreeing with Vladimir Putin while attacking the intelligence agencies who are doing their jobs and attempting to bring a criminal him to justice.
For his part, Trump has called the allegations against him a political witch hunt and a complete and total fabrication, and Americans who care about whether he colluded with the Kremlin stupid people and fools.
Trump may have screamed that Hillary Clinton should be locked up, but it may be that he is the one who will end up behind bars.Featured image by Scott Olson via Getty Images
