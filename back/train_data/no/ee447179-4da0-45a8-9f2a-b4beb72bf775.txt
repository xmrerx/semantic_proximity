( reuters ) - a somali national has been convicted in an ontario court for his role in the 2008 kidnapping of canadian amanda lindhout , who was held captive in somalia for 460 days and released only after her family paid a ransom , canadian media reported on wednesday .
ali omar ader , 40 , was found guilty of one charge of hostage-taking for his role as negotiator for the kidnappers , in a decision handed down on wednesday in ontario superior court in ottawa .
lindhout , a freelance journalist , was taken hostage in somalia on aug. 23 , 2008 , along with australian photographer nigel brennan , while working on a story .
they were released for ransom in november 2009 .
ader was lured to canada from somalia in 2015 and arrested in ottawa as part of a sting operation by the royal canadian mounted police in which an officer posed as a publisher interested in a book ader was writing on somalia , according to court documents .
prosecutors argued that ader had been the main spokesman for the hostage-takers , negotiating first with lindhout s mother and later with a private consultant hired by the families of lindhout and brennan .
according to court documents , he referred to himself as a commander and repeatedly threatened that the hostages would be harmed or killed unless the ransom was paid .
during his trial , ader said that he too had been kidnapped by the group holding lindhout captive , and was forced to act as their spokesman , as he spoke some english .
in his ruling , justice robert smith said ader s claims were completely unbelievable , numerous canadian media outlets reported .
reuters has not read the ruling .
ader faces up to life in prison .
sentencing in the case is not expected until next year .
lindhout has said she was repeatedly sexually and physically assaulted during her captivity , and both she and brennan have said they were tortured and starved .
in 2013 , lindhout recounted her experience in the book a house in the sky .
