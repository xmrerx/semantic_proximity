It s mind baffling that Donald Trump still hasn t learned not to make stupid comments on Twitter, especially since people like model Chrissy Teigen are always sure to fire back with some seriously epic burns.During the campaign, Teigen was an outspoken supporter of Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton and made sure to shoot Trump down on Twitter whenever she could.
Now that Trump is in the White House, Teigen has decided to turn it up even more and The Donald isn t going to like it.
Following General Michael Flynn s resignation last night, Trump took to Twitter this morning to whine about the illegal leaks coming out of Washington and he s going to wish he hadn t.It was a tweet that seriously lacked self-awareness, considering that just last weekend Trump held an impromptu national security meeting with Japanese Prime Minister Shinz Abe right in front of dinner party guests.
While Teigen didn t bother pointing that out, she made sure to remind Trump that everyone hates him.
She fired back: This is what happens when your staff hates you.
Beyonce s staff are more leakproof than yours.
Ouch!
Twitter loved Teigen for pointing this out, because Beyonc s team has been known to be tight-lipped, having somehow kept a wedding, pregnancy and major albums completely secret in the past.Teigen is right Trump appointed several untrustworthy, unqualified people and now he s suffering for it.
It is insane that just three weeks into his presidency, one of his administration members is resigning.
The chaos and confusion (as well as overwhelming disapproval from the American people) has been unprecedented, and Trump seems to only make things worse for himself every time he complains about it on Twitter.
There will always be people like Teigen who aren t afraid to hit back and expose Trump for the moron he is and we should be thankful for them.Featured image via Michael Buckner and Joe Raedle / Getty Images
