Only but a few years ago, during far simpler times, Donald Trump s biggest accomplishment in politics was his amplification of the birther conspiracy.
The right-wing conspiracy alleges that President Obama is not qualified to be the president of the United States because he was not born on U.S. soil.
It s a ridiculous conspiracy that resulted in the Tea Party demanding that President Obama release his birth certificate to the public.Trump has been all but silent on the matter since he began his campaign.
Now that he is currently the second likeliest person in the world to replace Mr. Obama, people are eager to hear if Trump still believes in the conspiracy theory.On Friday, Trump made a stop in Philadelphia, where he was set to pander to the African-American community.WPVI news anchor Matt O Donnell questioned Trump on his past views regarding President Obama and the birther movement.
You don t talk about the birth certificate anymore, says O Donnell.
Do you regret even bringing it up?
Trump responds by saying, I don t talk about it anymore.
I don t talk about it anymore.
O Donnell then presses Trump.
Do you regret bringing it up back then?
I told you, I don t talk about it anymore, Trump says.That appears to be as close to an answer as the public gets concerning Trump s thoughts on the matter.
It seems as if Trump knows just exactly how absurd the affair was, yet cannot admit as much, due to not wanting to alienate his conspiracy theory minded, Tea Party base.You can watch the interview below: Featured image from video screenshot
