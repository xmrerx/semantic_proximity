These protesters are only helping to catapult Donald Trump to the Oval Office.
The more America gets to see who is against Donald Trump, they more they want him to win.
They would have been better off keeping themselves busy, doing what they do best at this time of year finding ways to register dead voters and steal the vote.
They made a bad decision to allow the curtain to come back and expose themselves to America.
This may possibly be the worst PR move in the history of the Democrat Party.
