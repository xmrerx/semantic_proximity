seoul ( reuters ) - the south korean president s office said on sunday that it will begin a review on the country s 64-year-old law to ban abortion .
the announcement came after more than 230,000 south koreans filed a petition calling for the abolishment of the law .
south korea criminalized abortion in 1953 when its leaders wanted to boost the population and build an army powerful enough to fend off its rival north korea .
but in 1973 , with population growth strong , the country drew up exceptions to the abortion law , such as where the mother s health is at risk , the baby is to be born with severe birth defects or the pregnancy was caused by a sexual crime .
many public health experts in south korea pushed for changes in the abortion law but faced opposition from a strong pro-life lobby in a country with one of asia s largest percentages of christians and a government trying to boost one of the world s lowest fertility rates .
the president s office said the government will conduct research next year on the country s abortion cases for the first time since 2010 .
based on the outcome from the research , we expect to move relevant discussions one step forward , cho kuk , the senior presidential secretary for civil affairs , said in a statement .
cho said south korea s constitutional court , which in 2012 upheld the anti-abortion law , will again review the legislation .
according to the most recent figures , an estimated 16,900 abortions were performed in 2010 , and only 6 percent of them were done legally , he said .
