Donald Trump may be realizing that there s something to the sage advice of not working with family.
On Tuesday, Trump joked that his son-in-law Jared Kushner is becoming more famous than him.
For Kushner, who is becoming an albatross around the neck of the administration, that joke could be the kiss of political death.Trump has made a similar joke before.
Then it was directed toward FBI Director James Comey.
Months later, Comey was gone.
Jared has actually become much more famous than me I m a little upset at that, Trump said, prompting the room to erupt in laughter.House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.)
turned to Kushner and said, That s a badge of honor.
Kushner smiled but did not respond, according to a reporter in the room.Source: The HillThe joke came after Kushner made the cover of Time Magazine.
It doesn t matter that the portrayal wasn t completely flattering or that Kushner s implications in the Russian election scandal are front and center in the article.
What matters to Trump is that Kushner, who s perhaps best known as a man of few words, is beginning to eclipse Trump in the media.
Except that he s not.
Most news stories are still about Trump and not Kushner.Trump doesn t see that, though.
When a member of his administration, any member of his administration, becomes a focus of the media, that means at least a little attention is being taken off of him.
Trump can t deal with that.Two days after his inauguration, Trump joked that James Comey had become more famous than me.
Then as now, Trump still dominated most headlines, but for Trump, it wasn t enough.
Comey was soon gone.Trump s White House advisors are a hodgepodge of people whose only qualifications are their ability to boost Trump s ego.
Once they ve outlived that purpose, they ve outlived their usefulness to Trump, even if they are family.Featured image via Olivier Douliery-Pool/Getty Images
