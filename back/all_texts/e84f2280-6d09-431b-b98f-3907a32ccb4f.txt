Whenever we have a terror attack in America, the media goes to great lengths to make sure no one assumes of the killer was a Muslim.
Meanwhile, the media has gone out of their way to convince Americans that all Hispanics hate Trump.
Isn t it interesting how quickly they print a story about the murderer of two Muslim men who witnesses describe as a tall Hispanic man and then blame Trump?
An imam and his assistant were shot and killed in broad daylight as they walked home from a mosque in Queens.Police said a gunman walked up to religious leader, Maulama Akonjee, 55, on Saturday afternoon as he and his assistant, Thara Uddin, 64, were leaving the Al-Furqan Jame Masjid Mosque in Ozone Park.Both men were rushed to Jamaica hospital, where Akonjee, a married father-of-three, was pronounced dead.His assistant died about fours later.Imam Akonjee was described as a revered religious leader.
He came to Queens from Bangladesh a little less than two years ago, according to the New York Daily News.After the shooting a crowd of angry Muslim men gathered at the scene insisting it was a hate crime, saying the two men were specifically targeted.
That s not what America is about, local resident Khairul Islam told the newspaper.
We blame Donald Trump for this Trump and his drama has created Islamophobia.
Did it ever occur to these angry Muslims that Islamaphobia is rooted in the idea that almost every time we have a terror attack on our soil at the hands of a radical Muslim, we rarely see a Muslim who will speak out against it?
Police said they received multiple 911 calls of two males being shot at the corner of Liberty Avenue and 79 Street around 1.50pm.Both men suffered gunshot wounds to the back of the head and were rushed to the hospital in critical condition.Witnesses said the shooter was tall and Hispanic.They said the man was carrying a large handgun and wearing a dark blue shirt and short pants.
