You just can t make this up!
CNN fires black Democrat operative/Chairman for getting caught giving debate question she got from CNN to Hillary prior to the debate.
We re just wondering out loud, (since we know its the first logical conclusion the Left would come to) if CNN s management are just a bunch of ugly racists ?Hillary supporters should be asking themselves why their candidate didn t out Brazile when she cheated the system?
Update: Politico reports that in yet another statement, CNN spokeswoman Lauren Pratapas said that on Oct. 14, the network accepted Brazile s resignation.Here is the Wikileaks email:In a tweet, Brazile thanked CNN and her former colleagues there.

Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 31, 2016As we detailed earlier, it seems DNC Chair Donna Brazile is hoping for rescue by a higher power as the net narrows around her lies and obfuscation.
Following more examples of Brazile passing debate questions to the Clinton Campaign, CNN spokesperson Lauren Pratapas said in a statement that:CNN never gave Brazile access to any questions, prep material, attendee list, background information or meetings in advance of a town hall or debate.
We are completely uncomfortable with what we have learned about her interactions with the Clinton campaign while she was a CNN contributor.
While there has been no official statement from the DNC, here is Donna Brazile s latest tweet Please God, let this end soon Donna Brazile (@donnabrazile) October 30, 2016 Zero Hedge
