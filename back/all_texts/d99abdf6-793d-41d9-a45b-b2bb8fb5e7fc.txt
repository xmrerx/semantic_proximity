A woman confronted notorious coward, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, inside a DC Apple store, and found herself the victim of a rather racist attack as a result.
Twitter user ShreeC saw Spicer shopping (apparently, he doesn t need to choose between health care and an iPhone) and could not resist the urge to confront him.
How does it feel to work for a fascist?
Have you helped with the Russia stuff?
Are you a criminal as well?
she asked Spicy.
Have you committed treason too, just like the President?
Spicer didn t have an answer to those questions, but he did have some remarks that could only be interpreted as being about her skin color, telling the woman who is a U.S. citizen that America is such a great country that allows you to be here.
Asking @PressSec questions in Apple Store since he doesn't like the press.

But Spicer decided that since this woman s skin color was on the darker side of beige, she doesn t belong and is blessed that we tolerate her at all because that is the mindset of the Trump administration.This brave woman walked up to the Joseph Goebbels of our time and confronted him, forcing him to reveal who he truly is.
She may not have gotten any answers, but she did something much better she made him take off his mask.We see you, Sean.
