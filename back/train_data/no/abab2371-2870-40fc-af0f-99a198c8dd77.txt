bangkok ( reuters ) - a thai criminal court has issued a second arrest warrant for former prime minister yingluck shinawatra , who fled the country weeks ago before she was sentenced to jail in absentia , police said on thursday .
the warrant , issued on wednesday , was for violating the immigration law , deputy police chief srivara ransibrahmanakul told reporters .
yingluck fled abroad in august fearing that the military government , set up after a coup in 2014 , would seek a harsh sentence .
it remains unclear how she left the country .
last week , the supreme court convicted and sentenced yingluck in absentia to five years in jail for mismanaging a rice subsidy scheme that cost the country billions of dollars .
throughout her trial , yingluck said she was innocent and not responsible for the day-to-day running of the scheme , arguing that she was a victim of political persecution .
prime minister prayuth chan-ocha , the army chief who led the 2014 coup against yingluck s government , recently said thailand would pursue her through diplomatic channels and police cooperation , using interpol .
foreign ministry spokeswoman busadee santipitaks told reporters on thursday the ministry was working on revoking yingluck s thai passport .
she added that the ministry had no information on whether yingluck was seeking political asylum .
last week , thai police raided yingluck s home in eastern bangkok , armed with a search warrant .
the military government said last week she was in dubai .
but a source in the united arab emirates said yingluck left dubai for london on sept. 11 , without giving details .
