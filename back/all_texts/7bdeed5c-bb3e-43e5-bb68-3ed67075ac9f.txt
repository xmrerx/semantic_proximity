Republicans treated President Obama like shit and he never attacked them like Donald Trump is attacking Democrats.Despite all his calls for unity and bipartisanship, Trump single-handedly sabotaged that message on Thursday morning by personally and publicly insulting Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Twitter.Trump referred to Schumer as a clown and then whined about Obamacare and how Democrats and Republicans need to come together to fix it.The Democrats, lead by head clown Chuck Schumer, know how bad ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in.
Instead of working to fix it, they.. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 do the typical political thing and BLAME.
The fact is ObamaCare was a lie from the beginning.
Keep you doctor, keep your plan!
It is .
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017 time for Republicans & Democrats to get together and come up with a healthcare plan that really works much less expensive & FAR BETTER!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 5, 2017When Trump says fix it what he really means is he wants Democrats to help Republicans repeal it.
And that is not going to happen.
Because while the Affordable Care Act has some minor issues that can be easily fixed, repealing the law altogether as a solution would strip millions of Americans, including conservatives, of their healthcare.The uninsured rate would skyrocket to previous highs and insurance companies would once again be allowed to discriminate against people with pre-existing conditions, the elderly, and women.Even Bernie Sanders concedes that Obamacare needs to be tweaked but he wants to actually fix it, not repeal it.Trump s petty attack on Schumer, however, proves that he doesn t give a damn about unity.
He would rather bully people.Twitter users didn t appreciate Trump s attack, and they immediately made him regret it.
@realDonaldTrump GOP, lead by head clown Trump, know how good ObamaCare is and what a mess they are in.

@realDonaldTrump Oh no.
Oh, honey.
If you want people to come together, don t go on the Internet and call the opposition leader a clown.

@realDonaldTrump Would it help the morning tantrums if we put in a call to Dr. Bornstein about something for the racey thoughts and panic?
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 5, 2017@realDonaldTrump You call for unity but then refer to a prominent Democrat as head clown.
That s not presidential, it s just immature.

MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) January 5, 2017@mskristinawong @realDonaldTrump Pretty brave of him 2 be calling any1 else a clown considering his own nickname is #fuckfacevonclownstick ARandomPersonOnline (@Rand0mpers0n235) January 5, 2017@realDonaldTrump As opposed to Republicans who have absolutely no idea what they will do once it is repealed.
Kevin M. Levin (@KevinLevin) January 5, 2017The fact is that Democrats have been more than willing to work with Republicans to find common ground.
The problem is that Republicans don t want compromise and have moved too far to the extreme right to make compromise possible.
They want their way or no way at all and it has been that way for the last eight years.
And Donald Trump is only making things worse.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images
