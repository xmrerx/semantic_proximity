Sarah Palin, Kid Rock, and Ted Nugent visited the White House on Wednesday.
No, that s not a setup for a Beverly Hillbillies remake.
In fact, the Clampetts would have likely been embarrassed by this motley trio.Rock and Nugent brought their wives along, but Palin came sans Todd.There aren t a lot of specifics in the news about the visit, but Nugent and Rock, in pure redneck style, wore their signature hats for the visit.
Palin, who we thought we banned from the White House in 2008, chose an off the shoulder blouse that conservatives would have had a conniption over if it was Michelle Obama.To add insult to injury, they decided to pose in front of the portrait of Hillary Clinton simply to mock her.
Klassy..@POTUS invited @SarahPalinUSA to dinner and told her to bring some friends pic.twitter.com/Okk6wVWpha Jake Tapper (@jaketapper) April 20, 2017Remember when the right became filled with rage when President Obama wore a tan suit or put his feet up on his desk?A few years later, and all White House decorum seems to have left the building.Twitter, naturally, had fun with the visit.
@jaketapper @POTUS @SarahPalinUSA Trump is a poor man s rich guy.
Disgusting.

It speaks volumes.

And remember when HC was ridiculed for a slight v-neck?!
