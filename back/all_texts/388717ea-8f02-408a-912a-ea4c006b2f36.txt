Women make up over 50 percent of this country, but are grossly underrepresented in just about everything.
In the United States Congress, more than 80 percent of those representing the people are men 80 percent in the Senate, 81 percent in the House.On the Supreme Court, only three of the nine Justices are women.And yes, even in the progressive Obama Administration, only 13 out of the 47 individuals who have served in his cabinet have been women 28 percent.It is no secret that Washington D.C. is still a hard place for a woman to find her voice.
Even though it s been proven statistically that when women take charge of the operations and debates in D.C., stuff gets done quicker in a more bipartisan manner.
Still, women aren t taken seriously.But Hillary Clinton, while shattering that glass ceiling herself, wants to shatter it in all aspects of D.C., starting with her cabinet, should she win the presidency.In an MSNBC town hall Monday night, Clinton told viewers that she intends to have her cabinet reflect the demographics of America:Well, I am going to have a Cabinet that looks like America, and 50 percent of America is women.
Whether it s in a vice president or members of a Cabinet or in the White House staff, I want as broad a set of experiences that I can possibly draw together, because I m someone who likes to listen to people who come at problems from different perspectives.While Donald Trump accuses her of playing the woman card, Clinton is setting in motion a push to make women more equally represented in American society, something Trump would never consider.Should Clinton win, she not only is responsible for her cabinet, but also her appointments to the Supreme Court, which could produce two vacancies in the next four years.But it s this particular election that could be a driving force for women in Congress.
Democrats have the opportunity to get out and elect women, from California to Maryland, from New York to Florida.If women are fifty percent of our population, then they deserve equal representation at every level, and Clinton seems to definitely be on board with making sure that happens if she were to become president.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
