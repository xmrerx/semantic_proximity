As if you needed another reason NOT to drink overpriced coffee!
This is something that s really gross but you need to be aware of it Ewwwww!Fecal bacteria has been found in ice from three of the biggest UK coffee chains, according to an investigation by the BBC.

The bacteria found are opportunistic pathogens - the source of human disease.
These should not be present at any level never mind the significant numbers found.
At Costa Coffee, seven out of 10 samples of ice tested were found to be contaminated with bacteria found in fecal matter.Meanwhile at both Starbucks and Caffe Nero, three out of 10 samples contained faecal bacteria.All three chains are currently taking action, with Costa saying: We were disappointed with the findings, especially as these stores are all rated very good with a the top hygiene rating of five.
Following these results we took immediate action to review our food safety procedures and have updated our ice-handling guidelines and are in the process of introducing new ice equipment storage across our estate.
