Fox News resident doctor, if, indeed, he can be called that, weighed in on the ancient, but immature reference that Trump made to the size of his penis after Marco Rubio made a crack about his tiny hands during a debate in Detroit, Michigan.
Keith Ablow, who really has some questionable things to say on the air, let loose with the following verbal rubbish heap: When the small hands issue was raised during the debate that supposedly got the Clinton campaign very excited, they thought Man, he s off his game he wasn t off his game at all.
Freud would have been standing up, like applauding.
Standing ovation.
Ablow the Blowhard went on with: To be able to address such an intensely personal issue and say, Listen, there s no problem in that department, to me, that showed an incredible degree of psychological strength.
Or it showed an incredible immaturity something that s only been solidified as this election cycle has gone on.
Trump could have, and really should have, just ignored the jab about his hands.
Instead, he said: Look at those hands.
Are they small hands?
And he referred to my hands if they are small, something else must be small.I guarantee you there is no problem.
I guarantee you.
Because self defense.
He missed a golden opportunity to make Rubio look like an immature, tasteless idiot.
As is so common with Trump, though, he slipped into insecure teenage-boy mode and bragged about his penis size, which is literally relevant to nothing.
He proved he had even less class than Rubio when he did that.Watch Ablow s psychological gobbledy-gook below:Featured image by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
