Ever since he began his run for President, Donald Trump and his poorly educated (his words, not mine) followers have boasted that the 2016 GOP nominee has self-funded and will continue to self-fund his campaign (though he has accepted donations the entire time, and has in actuality been loaning his campaign money).
I don t think it is fair to say that a person is self-funding if a significant share of those contributions come from someone other than the candidate, Rick Hasen, an expert in election and campaign finance law at the University of California Irvine, said of Trump s claims that he is self-funding his efforts.
Nor do I think a candidate who loans money to his campaign, but who expects to be paid back by the campaign, is fairly characterized as self-funding.
While it may not have been fair before, new developments reveal it to be an outright lie, not that Trump supporters will care.
On Saturday morning, the Trump campaign sent out an emergency email begging his vapid followers to give him a whopping $100,000 by the end of the day.
Right now we re facing an emergency goal of $100,000 to help get our ads on the air.
We need your contribution by 11:59 P.M. tonight, the email reads.
Crooked Hillary is about to invade your TV with ads attacking Mr. Trump.
But we re preparing to fight back.
Trump is desperate.
With his poll numbers in a free-fall, with a civil war brewing in the GOP, and with Trump finally facing the reality that he will lose in November if he makes it to November, the facade is falling away.
All that is left is the truth that Donald Trump is a conman whose worth as a candidate matches his worth as a human being.
Both, of course, are severely lacking.Featured image via Getty Images/Branden Camp
