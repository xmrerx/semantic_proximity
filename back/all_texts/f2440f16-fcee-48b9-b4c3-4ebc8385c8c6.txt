(Reuters) - The mayor of Phoenix on Wednesday called on President Donald Trump to postpone a rally he was scheduled to hold on Tuesday in the city, saying it was too soon after a violent white supremacist rally in Virginia.
“I am disappointed that President Trump has chosen to hold a campaign rally as our nation is still healing from the tragic events in Charlottesville,” Mayor Greg Stanton said in a statement posted on Twitter.
“It is my hope that more sound judgment prevails and that he delays his visit,” Stanton said.
