This story is a perfect example of why Barack and Hillary are in such a big hurry to bring foreigners into our country.
It doesn t matter if American citizens are on the hook to support them and their extended families for decades to come.
What matters is how they vote, and it s pretty clear by this discovery about this Muslim immigrant, he not only supports Hillary, he s been ILLEGALLY voting in the last 3 elections!The Cascade Mall shooting suspect, Arcan Cetin, may face an additional investigation related to his voting record and citizenship status.Federal sources confirm to KING 5 that Cetin was not a U.S. citizen, meaning legally he cannot vote.
However, state records show Cetin registered to vote in 2014 and participated in three election cycles, including the May presidential primary.Cetin, who immigrated to the United States from Turkey as a child, is considered a permanent resident or green card holder.
While a permanent resident can apply for U.S. citizenship after a certain period of time, sources tell KING his status had not changed from green card holder to U.S. citizen.
