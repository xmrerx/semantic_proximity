washington ( reuters ) - france wants to take action to tackle iran s missile program and destabilizing behavior but believes scrapping the 2015 nuclear deal would help hardliners and be a step towards future war , france s defense minister said on friday .
we need the jcpoa .
scrapping it would be a gift to iran s hardiners , and a first step towards future wars , florence parly said in a speech at a washington think tank , referring to the nuclear deal known as the joint comprehensive plan of action .
but we should also be very serious about the destabilizing ballistic and regional activities .
we are working on it .
parly is the first french minister to visit the united states since president donald trump s refusal to certify the 2015 iran nuclear deal .
she held talks with her american counterpart james mattis and white house national security adviser h.r .
mcmaster .
while trump did not pull the united states out of the agreement , he gave the u.s. congress 60 days to decide whether to re-impose economic sanctions on tehran that were lifted under the pact agreed between iran and six world powers .
that has alarmed its european allies , who fear the deal will slowly unravel .
the issue is now in congress .
france has no desire to be embroiled in u.s. domestic politics , but our position on the agreement is clear .
