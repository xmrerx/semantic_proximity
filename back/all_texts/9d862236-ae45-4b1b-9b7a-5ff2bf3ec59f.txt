This is just too rich!
The Democrats threw tons of money into this race and then the Republican candidate body-slammed an obnoxious reporter.
It seemed like the Dems really couldn t lose this one.
Bernie s socialist candidate would win in Montana.
The Democrats were sure they could run leftists and win in red states NOT SO FAST!Republican businessman Greg Gianforte won Montana s sole House district in a special election Thursday, keeping a seat in Republican hands despite facing assault charges for allegedly attacking a reporter who d asked him about the GOP s health-care bill:The best ever quote from the body-slamming incident is when Gianforte spoke for all Americans: I m sick and tired of this!
After he won he commented on the incident in his victory speech I shouldn t have treated that reporter that way, he told supporters at his rally here.Please check out Gianforte s twitter page!
It s full of great photos of things he s done.
He makes his own sausage and even gave his wife a sausage maker for Christmas.
He posts photos of his wild game dinners that look amazing.
This guy is a blast!
