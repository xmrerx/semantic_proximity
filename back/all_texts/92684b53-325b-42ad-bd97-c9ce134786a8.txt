The driver pushed his way through the crowd, with some of the demonstrators even riding on the hood for a distance.In his defense, he did initially pick a spot that was mostly covered by a banner to try and break through.
The genius protestors then all gathered in front of him and went for a little ride on the hood.
At one point one of the pedestrians even tried punching the driver.Apparently, the driver had a job and responsibilities to attend to, unlike his pedestrian counterparts.
