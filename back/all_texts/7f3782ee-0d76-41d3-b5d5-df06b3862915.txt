Donald Trump s slow and visibly painful meltdown over his administration (and campaign) getting caught colluding with the Russian government continued Thursday, with The Donald once again attacking the media for reporting it.
Leaking, and even illegal classified leaking, has been a big problem in Washington for years.
Failing @nytimes (and others) must apologize!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2017The New York Times was instrumental in bringing much of the information we know so far about the Trump administration s criminal dealings with Russia to light.
Naturally, the LOSERS on Twitter were quick to BIGLY Point out that he s full of Bannon:.
@realDonaldTrump Remember when you said that @nytimes was "very nice"?
https://t.co/B7ymYb33Yb Simon Hedlin (@simonhedlin) February 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump @nytimes Just as soon as you apologize for your *light treason* Jules Suzdaltsev (@jules_su) February 16, 2017.
@jules_su true: pic.twitter.com/Rj66MLFOA4 Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) February 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump ALSO, are you now verifying everything the Times reported about your Russia contacts?
Evan Dashevsky (@haldash) February 16, 2017.
@realDonaldTrump No, you should apologize for your collusion with the Russians!
Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) February 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump @nytimes You are blaming a check engine light for a blown motor.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) February 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump @nytimes do you think the press apologized for watergate leaks??
Impeach Donald Trump (@Impeach_D_Trump) February 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump @nytimes I'm confused.
Why should the press apologize for reporting facts from solid sources?
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) February 16, 2017@realdonaldtrump Facts > your lies.

We'll find it!
Ben Berkon (@BenBerkon) February 16, 2017But Trump wasn t done.
He vowed that he will catch those responsible for exposing the corruption in his administration:The spotlight has finally been put on the low-life leakers!
They will be caught!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2017And, of course, The Donald slammed the fake news media for writing stories using sources.
FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and "sources," is far more effective than the discredited Democrats but they are fading fast!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2017Ultimately, Trump says, this whole Russia thing the one that has been confirmed by 17 U.S. intelligence agencies is just fake news made up by the Democrats to explain away Hillary Clinton s massive popular vote win (and Trump s victory-by-technicality):The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story RUSSIA.
Fake news!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2017Pay attention to the way he is acting.
When Trump wakes up and rambles incoherently, it means that he is worried.
It means that he is lying.He also thinks he will get away with it.
It is up to us to make sure he doesn t. Never stop leaking.
Never stop telling the truth.
Never stop resisting.
