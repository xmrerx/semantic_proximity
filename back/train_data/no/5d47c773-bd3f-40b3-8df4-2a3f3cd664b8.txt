istanbul ( reuters ) - a turkish court has ordered a german citizen who was detained in southern turkey last week to be released but banned him from leaving the country , the news agency dogan reported on thursday .
the released man and his german partner were detained while on holiday in antalya , a popular tourist destination .
the partner had already been freed after questioning , dogan said .
a spokeswoman for germany s foreign ministry confirmed the man had been freed .
he is banned from leaving the country , she said .
dogan said the couple had been held as part of investigations into a network of supporters of u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen , who is blamed by turkish authorities for a failed military coup last year , and kurdish militants in syria .
gulen has denied any link to the failed coup .
thursday s release means 10 german citizens remain in turkish detention on political charges .
the arrests have raised tensions between ankara and berlin and led chancellor angela merkel to call for a review of relations and of turkey s eu accession talks .
the detainees include dual german-turkish citizen deniz yucel , who has been held for more than 200 days .
