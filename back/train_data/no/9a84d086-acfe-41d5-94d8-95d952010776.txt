beirut ( reuters ) - the syrian army and its allies seized an oil pumping station in eastern syria from islamic state , paving the way for an advance towards the jihadists last remaining syrian stronghold , a hezbollah-run news service reported on thursday .
the t2 pumping station is considered a launch pad for the army and its allies to advance towards the town of albu kamal ... which is considered the last remaining stronghold of the daesh organization in syria , the report said .
