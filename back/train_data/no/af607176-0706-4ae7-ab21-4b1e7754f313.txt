( reuters ) - british singer adele made clear on monday that she has not given permission for anyone to use her music for political campaigns .
adele ’ s spokesman issued a statement after republican u.s. presidential contender donald trump played adele ’ s 2011 hit song “ rolling in the deep ” at rallies in iowa , and mike huckabee released a youtube parody last week of her 2015 single “ hello. ” “ adele has not given permission for her music to be used for any political campaigning , ” the singer ’ s spokesman said in an email .
the spokesman did not say whether adele , whose new album “ 25 ” was the biggest seller in the united states last year , was contemplating legal steps to prevent the unauthorized use of her music .
adele is far from the only pop or rock star to have seen politicians co-opt their music for political purposes .
rock band r.e.m .
lashed out in september at trump for using its hit song , “ it ’ s the end of the world ” at a rally , and frankie sullivan complained about the use of the band ’ s 1982 hit “ eye of the tiger , ” at a news conference in september featuring kim davis , a county clerk in kentucky briefly jailed for refusing to issue gay marriage licenses .
