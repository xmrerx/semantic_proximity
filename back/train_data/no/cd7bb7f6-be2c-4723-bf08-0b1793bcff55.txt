toronto ( reuters ) - a regional latin american grouping on thursday agreed more steps may be needed to further isolate venezuela , where president nicolas maduro has been accused of stamping on rights and democracy , said canadian foreign minister chrystia freeland .
she spoke to reporters after a toronto meeting of the lima group , which also includes canada .
the group has already condemned what it calls recent anti-democratic acts by venezuela s government .
if necessary we must put added pressure on the maduro regime by taking concrete steps to further isolate it from the international community , she said .
freeland added that canada was mulling a second round of sanctions against venezuelan officials .
other countries should consider doing so as well , she said .
last month ottawa said it would impose targeted sanctions against 40 venezuelan senior officials to punish them for anti-democratic behavior .
the lima group has around 15 members , including brazil , argentina , peru and mexico .
it is next due to meet in chile in january 2018 .
last week the group criticized a nationwide election held in venezuela , when the ruling socialist party took 18 of 23 governorships in a nationwide vote despite widespread anger over economic hardship , that has left millions suffering food shortages , a currency collapse and soaring inflation .
opposition protests this year have led to 125 deaths , thousands of arrests and injuries , and widespread damage to property and infrastructure .
the opposition is starting to fragment and the lima group meeting on thursday called on groups to work together .
it s a very important point .
the people of venezuela , in their struggle to reestablish democracy in their country ... deserve an opposition which is united and can represent them effectively , said freeland .
