LONDON (Reuters) - British customs authorities will be able to cope even if the government is unable to reach a deal with the European Union to smooth Britain s departure from the bloc, finance minister Philip Hammond said on Tuesday.
(Customs agency) HMRC is preparing for all eventualities, including for a no-deal scenario, Hammond told the economic affairs committee of Britain s upper legislative chamber.
We recognize that the timescales are very challenging, and in a no-deal scenario, not everything we would want to put in place will be in place on day one.
But we will have a working system in place on day one, I have that assurance from HMRC.
Hammond said the government was seeking the smoothest possible customs arrangements as part of a negotiated exit from the EU, which is due to take place in March 2019.
