hillary doesn t care about anyone but hillary i m not voting for clinton.it has nothing to do with her views .
it really doesn t even matter about all the laws she broke.it s because she actually talked to me once .
almost a sentence .
but first , some background.being a k9 handler in the military i got to do a few details involving distinguished visitors .
mostly generals , dod officials , and secretaries of defense .
i was lucky enough to pull two awesome details .
george w bush , and obama.gw looked at me , said man , who d you piss off high fived me , and continued on .
i was climbing down from a catwalk i stood on for 4 hours with nothing but dust and a radio to keep me company .
the radio died early on .
it was pretty sweet.obama , as he was walking out to his plane in turkey , said what the hell kind of dog is that ? !
in reference to suli.one of my last details was for hillary when she was secretary of state .
she was in turkey for whatever reason .
i helped with sweeps of her dv quarters and staff vehicles .
her words to me ?
get that fucking dog away from me .
then she turns to her security detail and berates them up and down about why that animal was in her quarters .
for the next 20 minutes while i sit there waiting to be released she lays into her detail , slamming the door in their faces when she s done .
the detail lead walks over apologizes and releases me .
i apologize to him for getting him in trouble .
his words happens every day , brother hillary doesn t care about anyone but hillary.here is the actual facebook post :
