It was just a simple tweet but Stephen King s latest post about Donald Trump turned into something so much more with help from his devoted fans.With Halloween just around the corner, horror author Stephen King wrote out a couple lines from what he calls his newest horror story, and it s all about the Republican nominee.
My newest horror story, King began.
Once upon a time there was a man named Donald Trump, and he ran for president.
Some people wanted him to win.

So they responded by helping him find some inspiration by making suggestions and using covers, scenes, and characters from King s books and films.

Martin Heavy Head (@mheavyhead) October 21, 2016@StephenKing can it be a Langoliers crossover where the sane people wake up and find the deplorables gone?
Vanessa Carmona (@CollaredGreens) October 21, 2016@CollaredGreens @StephenKing I always figured the presidential candidate who triggered WWIII in The Dead Zone was a prediction of Trump!
