2016 may go down as the year that news died, at least in their souls.
Sure, it s been happening for a long time, but now, writing about Donald Trump s Twitter wars has become more important than actual news and unfortunately, it takes a comedian to tell the truth.Seth Meyers, in one of this best rants ever, criticized the media s constant coverage of Trump s tweets, and in particular, the Twitter war against Meryl Streep, calling them distractions from the real scandal: the Russian hacking scandal.
Whether these tweets are calculated distractions or just the ramblings of an unhinged narcissist, Meyers explained, it s clear Trump would much rather talk about his feud with Meryl Streep than, say, the fact that intelligence officials believe Russia hacked the Democratic National Committee and the Clinton campaign to help Trump win the election.
Source: SlateHere s the entire video, definitely worth a listen:While we can t know whether Trump s childish Twitter feed is a distraction or just the real, unfiltered Donald Trump, it doesn t matter.
The fact is, it s serving as a distraction.
Trump and his handlers are pushing the news cycles into overdrive, leaving the media chasing the latest headline, which is way too often Trump s latest tweets, rather than examining things of national importance.If it weren t for the downfall of the mainstream media, you know, the same mainstream media that treated unfounded allegations against Hillary Clinton as if they held the same weight (or more) as the fact that Donald Trump has been accused of rape or that he didn t provide his tax returns or that he very clearly seems to be a puppet of Russia, we likely wouldn t have a President-Elect Donald Trump.
Meyers is right.
It s time the media does its job.
Too bad it will be left to the comedians.Featured image via video screen capture
