moscow ( reuters ) - russia accused the united states on wednesday of allowing islamic state to operate under its nose in syria , saying washington was letting the militant group move about freely in an area abutting a u.s. military base .
the allegations , made by russia s defense ministry , center on a u.s. military base at tanf , a strategic syrian highway border crossing with iraq in the south of the country .
russia says the u.s. base is illegal and that it and the area around it have become a black hole where militants operate unhindered .
the united states says the tanf facility is a temporary base used to train partner forces to fight against islamic state .
pentagon spokesman colonel robert manning on tuesday said washington remained committed to killing off islamic state and denying it safe havens and the ability to carry out strikes .
but major-general igor konashenkov , a spokesman for the russian defense ministry , said moscow wanted to know how around 300 islamic state militants in pickup trucks had passed through the u.s.-controlled area and tried to block the highway between damascus and deir al-zor used to supply syrian forces .
he said the u.s. had not yet given an explanation .
we suggest the american side also explain about another incidence of their selective blindness towards militants operating under their nose , konashenkov said in a statement .
he said about 600 militants based in a refugee camp in the u.s. controlled area had driven en masse to a former customs post called tafas on the syrian-jordanian border earlier this month and seized food and medical supplies meant for locals .
you don t need to be an expert to now forecast an attempt to rupture the peace agreement in the southern de-escalation zone , said konashenkov .
we issue a warning .
all responsibility for sabotaging the peace process will lay exclusively with the american side .
