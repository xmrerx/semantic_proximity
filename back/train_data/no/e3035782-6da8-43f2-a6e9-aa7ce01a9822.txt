johannesburg ( reuters ) - south africa s national prosecuting authority ( npa ) has given president jacob zuma until nov. 30 to make submissions before it decides whether to reinstate 783 corruption charges filed against him before he became president , it said on friday .
the supreme court of appeal last friday upheld a high court ruling to reinstate the charges against zuma .
they were set aside in april 2009 by the then-head of the npa , paving the way for zuma to run for president later that year .
the ruling by the appeals court amplified calls for zuma , 75 , to step down before his term as president ends in 2019 .
a spokesman for zuma was not immediately available .
zuma has faced a series of corruption allegations , most recently over leaked emails that suggest his friends the influential gupta family may have used their influence to secure state contracts for their companies .
zuma and the guptas deny wrongdoing .
following last friday s ruling , the npa was required to make a decision on the charges , which relate to a 30 billion rand ( $ 2 billion ) government arms deal arranged in the 1990s .
zuma requested the npa to give him a chance to make representations before deciding whether to proceed against him .
on friday , the npa accepted that request but said any further submissions by zuma should be on issues not previously considered by authorities .
the npa also asked anti-corruption officials to report on the availability of the witnesses in the case by nov. 30 .
mmusi maimane , leader of the main opposition party , the democratic alliance , welcomed the npa s action but said in a statement : we are of the belief that jacob zuma is being afforded special treatment .... any other person would be hauled before a court and charged .
it was unclear how long the npa would take to decide on whether to charge zuma after receiving his submissions .
it was also unclear what would happen to the charges if the npa decides not to proceed .
