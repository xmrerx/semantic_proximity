duesseldorf , germany ( reuters ) - author dogan akhanli flew back to germany on thursday after he was briefly detained in spain at turkey s request , and lambasted ankara for launching a failed manhunt .
turkey issued an interpol warrant for the turkish-german writer , a critic of president tayyip erdogan s government , in august .
akhanli was quickly released .
but the move inflamed a row between germany and turkey , both nato members .
his lawyer at the time said the detention was part of a turkish crackdown on dissidents .
as akhanli embraced loved ones at duesseldorf airport , a man shouted at him in turkish : this country can not save you .
the author told reporters : i would say turkey s manhunt has failed , that might be why this man is so annoyed and feels the need to threaten me .
denouncing despotism in turkey , he said reports that prominent activist and businessman osman kavala was arrested on wednesday in istanbul showed that if this country arrests even him , then really nobody is safe there .
akhanli , detained in the 1980s and 1990s in turkey for opposition activities , including running a leftist newspaper , fled turkey in 1991 and has lived and worked in the german city of cologne since 1995 .
ties between ankara and berlin have been increasingly strained in the aftermath of last year s failed coup in turkey as turkish authorities sacked or suspended 150,000 people and detained more than 50,000 , including other german nationals .
