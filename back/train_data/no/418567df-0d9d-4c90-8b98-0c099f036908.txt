hillary has been pandering like crazy during this election season .
she pulled out a southern accent in south carolina and then claimed to carry hot sauce in her purse .
yes , she wants you to know she s just like you take a look at this short instagram video and tell me this woman isn t the biggest phony you ve ever seen !
gag ! prince fans aren t happy to see their pop-star s death used for political gain.during a campaign rally in dunmore , pennsylvania , hillary clinton walked out to prince s iconic let s go crazy anthem , following his death earlier in the week.you think of him as being almost eternal , clinton said to a philadelphia radio station after learning of his passing .
i mean , he was a bigger-than-life personality .
he was not only a songwriter and a singer but literally a one-man band .
he was such a great showman .
i just was so , so sad .
but , longtime prince fans quickly took to twitter to show their disdain for clinton using a prince song in order to gain political points possibly , or make it seem as though she , herself , was an avid prince fan .
