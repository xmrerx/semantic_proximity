trump s hastily organized white house easter egg roll went from bad to worse after he almost managed to botch the national anthem on camera.after avoiding the children s event on the white house lawn for several hours so he could finish watching fox and friends ( yes , really ) , trump revealed that he wasn t prepared to handle even the basic responsibilities he was given for the event .
in contrast to former president obama , trump declined to read to the children , so melania had to instead .
for some time trump lingered on a railed balcony , separated from the gathered families on the lawn.when it came time to do the national anthem , trump seemingly forgot that it is customary to place one s hand over one s heart .
while a member of the military band sang , melania and barron noticed that the president of the united states was just standing casually with arms at his sides .
melania can be seen nudging trump s arm , and he finally realizes his mistake .
* national anthem begins * melania & barron place hands over heart * melania nudges trump to do the same * * trump raises hand * pic.twitter.com/x59uyng7rw steve kopack ( @ stevekopack ) april 17 , 2017it s possible that trump s heart wasn t in the event because he had already thrown a private egg roll the night before for dues-paying members of mar-a-lago .
unlike the egg roll on the white house lawn , the one at mar-a-lago consisted of only rich families.and this ~color~ from pool reporter @ jordanfabian : pic.twitter.com/ov0l3j8lxf chris geidner ( @ chrisgeidner ) april 16 , 2017from pictures shared by excited attendees , trump was much more willing to rub elbows with these families.vips come first pic.twitter.com/75hlnsifk2 southpaw ( @ nycsouthpaw ) april 16 , 2017in other news , this delightful clip of president obama s 2015 egg roll has been going viral again .
