moscow ( reuters ) - a spokesman for russia s defence ministry said on wednesday that a series of attacks launched by islamic state in syria on government forces had come from an area near the border with jordan where a u.s. military mission was located .
the spokesman , major-general igor konashenkov , said in a statement the attackers had the precise coordinates of the syrian government forces , which could only have been obtained through aerial reconnaissance .
if the united states views such operations as unforeseen coincidences , then the russian air force in syria is prepared to begin the complete destruction of all such coincidences in the zones under their control , he said .
the main obstacle to completing the defeat of islamic state in syria is not the military capability of the terrorists but the support for them , and flirtation with them , by the united states , konashenkov said .
