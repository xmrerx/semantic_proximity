in today s distorted world of human rights , truth takes a back seat to ideology , and false claims especially those that support radical ideologies persist even after they have been exposed .
alan dershowitzharvard law professor alan dershowitz , a high-profile democrat for decades , said in an op-ed published friday that he will leave the party if rep. keith ellison ( d-minn. ) is elected chairman this weekend .
my loyalty to my country and my principles and my heritage exceeds any loyalty to my party , dershowitz , who supported hillary clinton in 2016 , wrote in the hill newspaper.when the jews were being persecuted by the nazis in 1944 we passed the war refugee act , which focused on rescuing jews , a religious group .
but if the religious group is the subject of the persecution based on their religion , it s perfectly ok for a first amendment-bound society to emphasize their rescue , just as it is perfectly ok to emphasize the fact that many , if not all of the perpetrators of islamic terrorism , come from countries with a history of supporting terrorism .
alan dershowitzdershowitz recounted ellison s history of controversial statements and actions many deemed anti-semitic , including the congressman s history with louis farrakhan s nation of islam movement .
a prominent lawyer told me that while he was a law student , ellison approached her and said he could not respect her because she was a jew and because she was a woman who should not be at a law school , dershowitz claims in the column.dershowitz slammed ellison for disavowing farrakhan at the same time he was first running for office in minneapolis , adding that his recent claims of support for israel coincide with his bid to lead the democratic national committee.calling the dnc election a momentous choice , dershowitz said the party could either go the direction of british parliamentarian jeremy corbyn , who led a far-left shift in the labour party , or try to recapture the rust belt democrats who switched their allegiance to president trump last november .
i hope they choose wisely , dershowitz said of the dnc s voting members , if they do not , i have made my choice .
