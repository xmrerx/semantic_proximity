Reality show star turned president Donald Trump has a limited vocabulary.
French translators have noticed that, too, and say they are having a tough time translating Trump s speeches into the language of Moli re.
Trump is not a great orator, which is something we ve all be subjected to.
Words like, sad!
are used in his tweets as if that s a complete sentence.
Trump said bigly when he really meant big league.
Or maybe he didn t mean big league.
We ll never really know.
After Trump gives a speech, his supporters inevitably jump in to explain to the rest of us what he really meant.Translator B reng re Viennot told the LA Review of Books, you have to be able to get into someone s mind to translate the speaker but when he (Trump) speaks he seems not to know quite where he s going.
He seems to hang onto a word in the question, or to a word that pops into his mind, repeating it over and over again, said Viennot.
He shapes his thought around it and, sometimes, succeeds in giving part of an answer often the same answer: namely, that he won the election.
Trump seems to go from point A (the question) to point B (himself, most of the time) with no real logic, she continued.
It s as if he had thematic clouds in his head that he would pick from with no need of a logical thread to link them.
Trump s vocabulary is limited, his syntax is broken; he repeats the same phrases over and over, forcing the translator to follow suit, she said.She continued to say that reading Trump in French, which is a very structured and logical language, reveals the poor quality of his language and, consequently, of his thought.
As the Independent notes, Trump once referred to swatches of land, when he really he meant swathes of land.
