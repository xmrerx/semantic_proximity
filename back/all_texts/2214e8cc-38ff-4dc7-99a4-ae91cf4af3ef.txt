While many in the United States have come to the logical decision that Donald Trump is stark raving mad, there are still those who apparently have made him their choice for president.
One of those people was just in the audience for a taping of ABC s The View and was questioned by host Joy Behar after the show.When the woman who supports Trump (yes, woman) is asked why, she refuses to say why which if I may add is very Trumpian, because Trump always makes claims with nothing to back it up either he then explains that she voted for President Obama, but said that it was the biggest mistake of her life.
Then she said she works in a hospital and hates Obamacare, even though moments later she said she s been unemployed for a year.
She somehow thinks that Trump would actually be better for healthcare and the unemployed.
When asked if maybe she should support Bernie Sanders, who wants to provided single payer and a better safety net, she adamantly refused.Now, not to speak ill of a woman who clearly doesn t understand how the parties operate and who stands for what, but it seems she wants to go back to a system that will harm her more than help her.
And I think a lot of the blame for her misunderstanding comes down to misinformation and even lack of information being spread by not only candidates, but the media.This woman wants change.
Sure.
That s great.
However, what she wants she s not going to find in Trump.Watch the back and forth here: Watch what happens when @JoyVBehar questions an audience member s support for Donald Trump: https://t.co/kQ9dGmHJ1O The View (@TheView) May 12, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
