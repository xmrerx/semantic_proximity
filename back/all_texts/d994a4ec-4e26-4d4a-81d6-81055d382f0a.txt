Ami Horowitz went to a New York conference on white privilege and asked the attendees to explain their whiteness.
Somebody told him, We re all racist.
But he then went to a black neighborhood in Harlem to ask people there if they were consumed with the same concern over white privilege.
They all felt that to be so consumed would be to admit that they couldn t accomplish their own dreams and goals, and they definitely don t think that is the case.So why are the white people so obsessed with white privilege?
