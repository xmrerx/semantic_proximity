Michigan s former Democratic governor, Jennifer Granholm, gave Rick Snyder some sharp advice on Saturday.During an interview over the phone, Granholm told The Detroit News that she believes Michigan s governor, Rick Snyder, should move to the troubled city of Flint, Michigan.
Further, Granholm says: I think who s ever going to fix this problem should move to Flint and live in one of those houses so that they can understand the urgency with which the citizens of Flint are operating, that they feel it so deeply because every single day they have to deal with water that has been poisoned.
Granholm has yet to demand that Snyder resigns over the Flint water crisis.
She does very carefully say that someone needs to get the job of fixing Flint s water system fixed, even if Snyder is not the person to do it.
I would want to see pedal to the metal, hair on fire action in Flint.
And I think (Snyder), right now, can do that.
But if not, then I think somebody should come in who can look at as the emergency that it is and move heaven and earth to get those pipes replaced.
Many politicians and celebrities have either called for Snyder to resign or for his arrest.
Democratic presidential primary candidate Bernie Sanders,has called for Snyder to resign immediately.
With the Michigan primary only days away, Sanders has reiterated this call during campaign events in the state.
During a recent campaign event at Macomb Community College in Warren, MI, Sanders told the crowd: I think the governor should do the right thing and resign.
So far, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has been very critical of the Snyder administration.
Though, she has yet to call for him to resign.The topic is sure to come up during the presidential debate that will be held on Sunday night in Flint.
