DUBAI (Reuters) - Yemen s Houthi group has buried the body of former Yemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh in Sanaa, allowing only a handful of relatives to attend, sources from his General People s Congress (GPC) party said on Sunday.
Saleh, 75, was killed by the Iran-aligned Houthis on Monday, after he had called for a new page in ties with a Saudi-led coalition that his supporters together with the Houthis had fought for nearly three years.
A GPC source, who has asked not to be identified, said the Houthis allowed less than 10 people from Saleh s relatives to attend the night-time burial in the capital Sanaa, but gave no details on the exact location.
GPC Secretary-General Aref al-Zouka, who was killed with Saleh, was buried on Saturday in his native al-Saeed district of Shabwa province in southern Yemen after the Houthis handed over his body to tribal leaders, media and GPC officials said.
Relatives said on Thursday that Saleh s family had refused conditions demanded by the Houthis for handing over the body.
Some said they wanted to bury the body in the courtyard of a mosque he had built near the presidential compound in southern Sanaa.
Saleh ruled Yemen for 33 years before being forced to step down in 2012 in a Gulf-brokered transition plan following months of Arab Spring protests demanding democracy.
He remained in politics as the head of the GPC, Yemen s largest political party, and in 2015 he joined forces with the Iran-aligned Houthis after they captured the capital Sanaa in a move that precipitated Saudi-led military intervention on the side of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi.
