kuala lumpur ( reuters ) - malaysia s royals made a rare intervention into public affairs on tuesday , calling for unity and religious harmony after what they described as excessive actions in the name of islam .
members of minorities have expressed concern in recent months about what they see as intolerance in malaysia , which is 60 percent muslim with sizable buddhist , christian and hindu communities .
in a statement issued on tuesday and reported by state news agency bernama , the nine sultans who serve as hereditary titular heads of individual malaysian states said people must respect the constitutional principle that malaysia is a multi-ethnic and multi-confessional country .
it is feared that the excessive actions of certain individuals of late can undermine the harmonious relations among the people of various races and religions , said the statement signed by the keeper of the rulers seal , syed danial syed ahmad , according to the bernama report .
the rulers feel that the issue of harmony has deep implication if any action is associated with and undertaken in the name of islam .
the comments , which come ahead of a gathering of the conference of rulers starting on wednesday , are unusual as the sultans largely assume a ceremonial role and rarely speak on the functioning of the state or society .
the statement referred to the opening of muslim-only launderettes reported to have appeared in southern johor state and northern perlis state .
other instances which have made headlines in malaysia in recent months , although they were not referred to directly in the royals statement , include bans on beer festivals and censorship of films and music .
unity among malaysia s multi-ethnic and multi-religious people is key to ensuring the country s ongoing stability , the statement said .
