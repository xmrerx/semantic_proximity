Half of the eight mayoral hopefuls on Detroit s primary ballot next week have been convicted of felony crimes involving drugs, assault or weapons, a Detroit News analysis shows.Three were charged with gun crimes and two for assault with intent to commit murder.
Some of the offenses date back decades, the earliest to 1977.
The most recent was in 2008.Political consultant Greg Bowens said there are candidates with past hardships in every election cycle.
It s not something unique to Detroit or the political arena in general, he said.
Black marks on your record show you have lived a little and have overcome some challenges, said Bowens, a former press secretary to Detroit Mayor Dennis Archer and NAACP activist.
They (candidates) deserve the opportunity to be heard, but they also deserve to have the kind of scrutiny that comes along with trying to get an important elected position.
Tuesday s Detroit mayoral primary election is the first since the city exited bankruptcy in 2014.
The field of eight will be narrowed to two who will face off in the fall.Under state election law, convicted felons can vote and run for office as long as they are not incarcerated or guilty of certain fraud-related offenses, or crimes involving a breach of the public trust.
The Detroit News reviewed the backgrounds of all the mayoral contenders.
