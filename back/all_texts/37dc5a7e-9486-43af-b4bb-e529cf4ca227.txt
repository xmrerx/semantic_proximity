BEIRUT (Reuters) - Hezbollah s parliamentary bloc called on Saudi Arabia on Thursday to stop interfering in Lebanese affairs after Lebanon s prime minister quit in a weekend broadcast from the kingdom.
Hezbollah MP Hassan Fadlallah said the bloc supports the approach of Lebanon s president, who has refused to decide on whether to accept the shock resignation until Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri returns home.
