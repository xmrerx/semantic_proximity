ankara ( reuters ) - iran may abandon the nuclear deal it reached with six major powers if the united states decides to withdraw from it , iranian foreign minister told qatar s al jazeera tv in new york .
u.s. president donald trump has called the 2015 deal an embarrassment .
the deal is supported by the other major powers that negotiated it with iran and its collapse could trigger a regional arms race and worsen tensions in the middle east .
if washington decides to pull out of the deal , iran has the option of withdrawal and other options , al jazeera tv wrote on its twitter feed , quoting mohammad javad zarif .
washington will be in a better position if it remains committed to the deal , the network quoted zarif as saying .
al jazeera deleted an earlier tweet citing zarif as saying that if washington withdrew from the deal iran would do so too , rather than just having the option to do so , after an iranian official said zarif had been misquoted .
trump is considering whether the accord serves u.s. security interests .
he faces a mid-october deadline for certifying that iran is complying with the pact .
a state department official said washington would not comment on every statement by an iranian official .
we are fully committed to addressing the totality of iranian threats and malign activities , the official said .
iranian authorities had repeatedly said tehran would not be the first to violate the agreement , under which tehran agreed to restrict its nuclear program in return for lifting most international sanctions that had crippled its economy .
the prospect that washington could renege on the deal has worried some of the u.s. allies that helped negotiate it .
french president emmanuel macron said last week that there was no alternative to the nuclear accord .
if trump , who has called the accord the worst deal ever negotiated , does not recertify it by oct. 16 , congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions suspended under the accord .
