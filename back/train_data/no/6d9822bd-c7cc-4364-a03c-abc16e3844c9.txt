nancy pelosi had another strange moment during her weekly press conference as she was confused about what time of day it was , struggled to recall her latest accusations against russia just six minutes later , and again awkwardly stopped speaking mid-sentence and stared at reporters before resuming classic pelosi as pelosi approached the podium on thursday , she muttered to herself on the hot mic , it s afternoon .
it is afternoon .
good afternoon everyone .
she then immediately got confused about what time of day it was .
thank you for being here .
i m honored this morning , or now afternoon she said .
she went on to refer to her democratic colleague as the chairman of a committee , before correcting herself and calling him the ranking member .
going off script proved to be a disaster.while denouncing republican attempts to replace obamacare , pelosi said , and what does that mean ?
higher costs , fewer benefits , uh , terrible age tax undermining medicare , uh , uh , stealing from medicare and maid-icaid , as i should have said , mispronouncing the word.a statement about medicaid left the listener to wonder what other things pelosi thinks are covered by the program .
as they do this , they re making an assault on medicaid , which is , again , very dangerous to children and other living ch things , she said .
and other living things ?
haha !
pelosi then criticized republicans on the hacking by russia : they hacked our democracy .
twenty-one state , local election systems were per penetrated .
six minutes later , she struggled to remember the accusation oy vey !
we re finding out things that we didn t even know before .
for example , was it how many states have been compromised in all of this ?
twenty-one , thompson muttered under his breath.pelosi muttered twenty-one .
twenty twenty-one states all we can say about this is term limits now ! read more : american mirror
