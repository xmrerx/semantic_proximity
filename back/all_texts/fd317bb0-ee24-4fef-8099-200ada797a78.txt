HARARE (Reuters) - Retired army chief Constantino Chiwenga and veteran politician Kembo Mohadi will be sworn in as Zimbabwe s vice presidents on Thursday, state-run Zimbabwe Broadcasting Corporation said on Wednesday.
The pair, appointed by President Emmerson Mnangagwa, were elevated to similar positions in the ruling ZANU-PF party on Saturday.
Chiwenga retired from the military this month.
His appointment was expected as a reward for leading a de facto coup in November that ended Robert Mugabe s 37-year rule and brought Mnangagwa to power.
It also adds to signs of a consolidation of power for the army since it turned against the 93-year-old Mugabe.
Mnangagwa has appointed several senior military officers to his cabinet and the ruling party s top decision-making body, the Politburo.
Mnangagwa is under pressure from opposition parties and the public to implement political reforms.
