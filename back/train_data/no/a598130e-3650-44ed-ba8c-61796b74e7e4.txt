dhaka ( reuters ) - a truck carrying relief supplies for rohingya muslim refugees skidded off a hilly road in bangladesh and plunged into a paddy field on thursday , killing nine people and injuring 10 , police and aid workers said .
the accident happened in a district near the myanmar border where refugees have been arriving since late last month to escape a myanmar military offensive against insurgents that the united nations has described as ethnic cleansing .
six died on the spot while three died on the way to hospital , a. k. m. jahangir , a senior official with the red crescent relief group , told reuters .
some of the injured were in critical condition , he added .
the dead and injured were laborers , traveling in the truck to help distribute the aid supplies .
about 422,000 refugees from myanmar have poured into bangladesh since aug. 25 , when attacks by rohingya militants on security posts triggered the myanmar army offensive in response .
buddhist-majority myanmar denies ethnic cleansing , saying its security forces are tackling rohingya terrorists .
