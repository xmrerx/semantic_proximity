Two completely peaceful protesters were attacked and forcefully escorted from a Donald Trump rally on Monday after loyal supporters realized their signs were pro-Obama and anti-Trump.The rally in Lowell, Massachusetts was packed, and the footage captured shows two men wearing glasses sitting amongst the supporters.
The men aren t doing anything to attract attention to themselves other than holding bright yellow signs, one that reads America is already great and another that says God bless President Obama.
Eventually, Trump s fans find out that they re on the opposite side of the voting spectrum.Upon this discovery, a few of Trump s loyal and aggressive minions attempt to start a verbal altercation with the protesters.
One man behind the protesters is seen telling them, Shut your mouth!
while a man in front of them motions to the signs and says, You re at a Trump rally?
Ditch those!
Ditch em!
When that didn t have the desired effect, the Trump lovers took it a step further.
The supporters grabbed the signs out of the non-confrontational protesters hands and ripped them to pieces as many other nearby supporters began to scream and chant Trump s name.
It wasn t long before security surrounded the two men and escorted them out of the rally.
Trump can be heard talking over the noise and saying Friend or foe, I don t know as he notices the commotion.You can watch a video of the incident below, which was posted by YouTube user Harrison Walsh:Featured image is a screenshot
