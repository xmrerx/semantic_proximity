Donald Trump has a major issue with Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).
This was apparent during his entire presidential campaign, when he basically had a meltdown every time Warren dared to criticize him or call him out on his bullsh*t. Trump had every reason to fear Warren she was one of his most outspoken critics, and it made Americans love and respect her even more.
She has a huge following and was highly influential in her role in the anti-Trump movement, so it was surprising to many that she attended Trump s inauguration.
But now, we know why she went.Several Democrats couldn t bear to see Trump get sworn in, and we can t blame them.
Warren, however, made it a point to show up despite the fact that Trump insulted her many times, nicknaming her Pocahontas .
On Bill Maher s Real Time, Warren told Maher just what she was thinking by going to an inauguration that she clearly did not want to see happen.
She said: I went to Trump s inauguration.
I watched.
I wanted to see it.
I wanted it burned into my eyes.
My view on this was that if there were ever going to be a moment when I was like, Uhh, I m too tired to get up, all I ve got to do is close my eyes and I m like, Oh God, I m up!
I m up!
I m up!
I m ready!
I m back in the fight.
Warren shared the sentiments of most Americans when she said that the day after Trump s inauguration was when the world changed but she encouraged Americans to stay positive.
While Trump had been sworn in, the historic Women s March also took place that weekend.
Warren said that Trump s election helped Americans find their voices and passion: It will be about the day we made our voices heard.
It s clear that watching Trump s inauguration helped light a fire inside Warren, and she s using it as fuel to keep fighting Trump and the GOP.
This is going to terrify Trump, and she knows it.
