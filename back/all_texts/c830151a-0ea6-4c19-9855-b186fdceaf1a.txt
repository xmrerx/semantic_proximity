A huge number of federal employees wouldn t be able to stand their jobs if Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump won the next presidential election.
According to a survey done by the Government Business Council, a quarter of government employees find Trump so unbearably repulsive that they would actually quit.The breakdown revealed that 14% of workers surveyed would definitely jump ship, and 11% stated that they d consider leaving their jobs resulting in a potential 25% of federal employees terminating their positions.
It could be disastrous, when you imagine all the government agencies such as the post office and our VA system which are normally understaffed to begin with trying to function with 25% fewer people.
The results of Trump s presidency could be damaging on every level.When broken down by party, 42% of Democrats said they d consider leaving, compared to just 8% of Republicans.
The survey also revealed that regardless of their political party, almost 60% of federal employees admitted they d be embarrassed to call Trump their boss.
This was much higher than any of the Democratic candidates such as Hillary Clinton (49%) and Bernie Sanders (37%).To make matters even more embarrassing for the GOP, survey participants were also asked how they felt about their current boss, President Barack Obama and the majority (56%) of Democratic employees said they would be honored to support him for a third term (if he was permitted one).So while Donald Trump might continue to be popular in the polls, this study reveals that many Americans are still level-headed and quite humiliated by the idea that he might be given the chance to lead this country.
You can t get a much clearer sign than 1 in 4 people quitting their jobs to demonstrate just how vile the idea of Trump in the White House is.This poll was conducted at the end of January, and used data from 688 federal employees with a margin of error give or take four percentage points.
Of those surveyed, 42% called themselves Republicans, 31% identified as Democrats, while 8% said they did not know and 19% wouldn t state their party.Featured image via Gage Skidmore
