Get this, previously deported mentally ill illegal aliens are being sent back to the U.S. thanks to a judge s decision: Federal Judge Dolly M. Gee s ruling will let immigrants with serious mental disabilities request to have their cases reopened in hopes of returning to the U.S.
The ruling covers immigrants deported from California, Arizona and Washington between Nov. 21, 2011 and Jan. 27 this year.
So it s not enough that we have the invasion of Central Americans and now Muslim refugees now the mentally ill get another shot at coming here too!
What kind of insanity (no pun intended) is this?Is it any surprise that the ACLU brought this case?
Doesn t the ACLU have an obligation to look out for LEGAL and law abiding Americans first?
The government identified 900 immigrants who could benefit from the ruling, though there could be more and it s unclear how many would qualify to have their cases reopened, Iguina said.Now dig deep for this little tid bit of info: Under the agreement, the federal government said it will help those with reopened cases return to the U.S. and pay for some transportation costs.
Doesn t this just make you want to stop paying taxes altogether?
Why should we pay for these people to come back over our border when they broke the law the first time?
