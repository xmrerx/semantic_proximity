MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev said on Thursday allegations that Russian athletes used doping during the 2014 Sochi Olympics were political manipulations in a new anti-Russian campaign.
That (Sochi Olympics) was a brilliant victory and no foreign forces can make us believe the opposite ...
This angle has become a cornerstone of the political campaign against Russia, Medvedev said in an interview with Russian television channels broadcast live.
The International Olympic Committee is re-testing all Russian athletes samples from the event after Grigory Rodchenkov, the former head of Moscow s discredited anti-doping laboratory, blew the whistle on what he said was a state-sponsored doping programme.
