democratic sen. chris murphy ( conn. ) said wednesday on msnbc s morning joe that republican efforts to repeal obamacare are based on the gop s hatred of barack obama .
msnbc contributor eddie glaude asked murphy what he believes the animating commitment behind the gop health care bill is and what it would take for him to work in a bipartisan way with republicans to fix the country s health care system .
at this point , i think it s clear the animating commitment is a hatred of barack obama , murphy said .
the policy has been pushed to the wayside here .
they don t seem tremendously interested in actually crafting something that insures more people or reduces rates .
they just want to fulfill this commitment that they made to repeal obamacare .
murphy went on to say that he has made it very clear he wants to compromise with republicans on health care .
they want , as far as i can tell , flexibility of benefit design .
they want something that has some cheaper premiums , less regulations in these exchanges .
i m willing to talk to them about that , murphy said .
i m willing to give them some flexibility of benefit design if they re willing to give us some security on these exchanges that donald trump won t unwind them .
