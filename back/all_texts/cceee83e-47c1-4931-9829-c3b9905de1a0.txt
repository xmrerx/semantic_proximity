At this point, it s hard to tell what the Trump administration will say next to attempt to deflect from anything at all involving The Donald and Russia.On Friday, White House spokesmoron Kellyanne Conway showed up on CNN to say that Democrats are just as bad as Trump s Russian allies who hacked and interfered with our election because they had the audacity to speak out against him.
The president has said previously that he would be concerned about anybody interfering with our democracy, she said.
We saw a lot of people interfering with our democracy by saying he couldn t win here at home.
Trump may be concerned with that form of interference because fascists are typically concerned with criticism, but he has shown absolutely zero problems with Vladimir Putin s propaganda and hacking efforts meant to install Trump in the Oval Office.Allisyn Camerota asked Conway what Trump plans to do to stop Russia from further interfering in our election, but she well, she had nothing.
Alisyn, I realize we just like to say the word Russia, Russia to mislead the voters, Conway said.
And I know that CNN is aiding and abetting this nonsense as well, but you ve asked me this question three times now And you re not answering it, Kellyanne!
Camerota said.The reason Conway refuses to answer is that Trump and his minions are totally OK with that kind of interference.
But criticism from an opposing political party?
They just can t handle it.Watch it below:Featured image via screengrab
