kampala ( reuters ) - uganda on wednesday denied its foreign minister had engaged in corrupt activities with a hong kong man who has been charged with bribery and other violations by u.s. authorities .
chi ping patrick ho , 68 , who heads the china energy fund committee ( cefc ) , a charity based in hong kong and the u.s. state of virginia , was charged with violating the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act .
ho was accused of among other issues of being involved with bribes and promises of other benefits to sam kutesa , uganda s foreign affairs minister , in exchange for promises of business contracts for an unnamed chinese firm .
kutesa is also a former president of the u.n. general assembly .
the ugandan foreign ministry said the interaction and engagement that kutesa had with ho was in fulfilment of his official functions as president of the u.n. general assembly .
it is therefore erroneous to insinuate or infer that hon .
sam kutesa , from references made to him and cefc ... is linked to the bribery allegations , a statement said .
ho s attorney has declined to comment to reuters on the charges .
