There must be something in the water in Washington how idiotic are these people?
The Senate Armed Services Committee has asked for copies of Defense Secretary Ash Carter s personal emails after Carter acknowledged in a statement that he had used a personal email.
The statement followed a New York Times article saying it had obtained 72 of Carter s work-related emails that he sent or received from a personal email account.
The Times said it was given the emails in response to a Freedom of Information Act request.
After reviewing his email practices earlier this year, the secretary believes that his previous, occasional use of personal email for work-related business, even for routine administrative issues and backed up to his official account, was a mistake, the statement from spokesman Peter Cook said.
As a result, he stopped such use of his personal email and further limited his use of email altogether.
With all the public attention surrounding the improper use of personal email by other Administration officials, it is hard to believe that Secretary Carter would exercise the same error in judgment, Sen. John McCain, an Arizona Republican and committee chairman, said in a statement..
The Senate Armed Services Committee has requested copies of the emails and will be conducting a review to ensure that sensitive information was not compromised.
It s a mistake, and it s entirely my own, Carter said, adding that I stopped when it was clear the practice was against policy.
Just listen to our Defense Secretary apologize for using his personal e-mail for Defense Department business:
