It s beginning to get to the point where one can wonder if Donald Trump is deliberately self-destructing on purpose, because maybe he really doesn t actually want to be president, just beloved by millions in a quest to prove his own self-worth and popularity.Besides the fact that Trump is saying horrific things daily, things so bad that his own party is turning on him, the people whom he sends out to represent him on varying media outlets are clearly a few sandwiches short of a picnic.Take, for instance, Katrina Pierson.
A woman who thinks President Obama started the war in Afghanistan, because clearly he has a time machine and could go back to 2001 to get the ball rolling.
Not to mention the fact that there has been ongoing tension within Afghanistan that we ve been dealing with for decades.Now, Pierson has literally used the word literally to make a point about something that literally never happened.While being interviewed on Fox Business, Pierson said reporters literally beat Trump supporters.
Really?
They literally did that?
Really?
Hmm .
Methinks she s a tad hyperbolic to try to make a point, and if anyone is inciting violence, it s Trump and his supporters.
Literally.Watch her literal idiocy here:Trump campaign spokeswoman Katrina Pierson says reporters literally beat Trump supporters pic.twitter.com/tV8vtIBcgV Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) August 15, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
