Trump s disgusting brand of misogyny was laid bare for all to see during the election cycle and it should have sunk him, because he literally bragged about sexually assaulting women by kissing them without waiting, and also saying women would let him grab them by the pussy, because he was famous.
If you thought that his being elected would have toned that down, you thought wrong.
And he doesn t seem to care who s around when he gets lewd and disgusting like that.Last month, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe met with Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.
These kinds of meetings often require translators, and in this case, the translator was a woman.
And Trump couldn t stop thinking about her.
From Vanity Fair: [V]intage Trump is not going anywhere anytime soon.
A couple of weeks earlier, during a visit by the Japanese prime minister, Shinz Abe, the president told an acquaintance that he was obsessed with the translator s breasts although he expressed this in his own, fragrant fashion.
Seriously, he said, practically right in front of another world leader, that he was obsessed with a woman s breasts.
Was his mind even on the meeting or was he just staring at her breasts the whole time?Those comments, which Trump and his loyal subjects dismissed as mere locker room talk, led to men assaulting women on subways and sidewalks, literally yelling, Grab her by the pussy!
Trump normalized objectifying and assaulting women because hey, if he can do it, then why can t everyone?And he s still at it!
Now the question is, how often does this happen while he s meeting with diplomats and world leaders?
What about the foreign press?
Does he do this all the time, and nobody says anything?
He s not just a joke, he s a vile, disgusting pig of a joke.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images
