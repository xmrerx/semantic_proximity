comey lied and has been caught in his lie what next ?
foia request him again .
he said there were no tarmac documents but now it turns out there were .
hundreds of documents were just recently turned over oops !
it s also absurd that there were never , as james comey said , any documents .
he signed a letter saying under penalty of perjury there are no documents relating to the tarmac meeting .
now we know that there are hundreds of them .
so there are three possibilities here .
either comey lied or he didn t understand the request either they ve lost the documents and they ve suddenly been found or they lied when they said there were no documents .
or they didn t understand the request but the request by the way is standard boiler plate that every lawyer is familiar with .
