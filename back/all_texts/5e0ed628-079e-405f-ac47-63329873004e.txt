The good news is, now that Obama s released all the criminals from jail, there should be plenty of room for Hillary, Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch, Lois Lerner, Barack Obama and his tax cheat buddy, Al Sharpton Even though he s just a presidential hopeful, Donald Trump has wasted no time telling America his top pick is for attorney general.
And, if you were somehow involved in the Benghazi scandal or Hillary Clinton s email debacle, you d better watch out.In a Tuesday tweet, Trump said that he would pick South Carolina representative and chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi Trey Gowdy as his attorney general, were he to be elected president.
@HillaryClinton s toast.
Dems had better get the B Team off the bench.
@TGowdySC (Trey Gowdy s Twitter username) for Attorney General under President Trump, Trump tweeted.Rep.
Gowdy, whose tenacious manner with liberals and Obama administration officials has earned him the nickname The Bulldog, has been a conservative favorite for quite some time now.
In fact, before the 2014 Republican sweep of Congress, political action group the Tea Party Leadership Fund endorsed Gowdy to take over John Boehner s position as speaker of the House.While Gowdy didn t get that job, it might be even more satisfying seeing the South Carolina bulldog at Eric Holder s old desk, prosecuting all of those Democrats let slide during the Obama administration.Via: Conservative Tribune
