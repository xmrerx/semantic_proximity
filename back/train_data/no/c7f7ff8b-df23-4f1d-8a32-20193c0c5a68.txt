washington ( reuters ) - u.s. house speaker paul ryan invited indian prime minister narendra modi on thursday to address a joint meeting of congress when he visits washington in june , an unusual show of warmth for a foreign leader .
“ this address presents a special opportunity to hear from the elected leader of the world ’ s most populous democracy on how our two nations can work together to promote our shared values and to increase prosperity , ” the republican leader of the house of representatives said in a statement .
the invitation is a sharp turnaround for modi , who was once barred from the united states over massacres of muslims .
opportunities to address the house and senate are considered a great honor .
there have only been two in the past year : pope francis , on sept. 24 , and japanese prime minister shinzo abe , on april 29 , 2015 .
when modi ’ s bharatiya janata party and its allies swept india ’ s elections in 2014 , there were initially questions about whether he would qualify for a visa .
president barack obama quickly dismissed the issue by inviting him to the white house when he called to congratulate him on his victory .
in 2002 , when modi had just become gujarat ’ s chief minister , more than 1,000 people , mostly muslims , were killed in sectarian riots in the state .
the administration of president george w. bush denied modi a visa in 2005 under a 1998 u.s. law barring entry to foreigners who have committed “ particularly severe violations of religious freedom. ” modi denied any wrongdoing .
india ’ s supreme court ruled in 2010 he had no case to answer .
washington sees its relationship with india as critical , partly to counterbalance china ’ s rising power .
obama has called it “ one of the defining partnerships of the 21st century . ”
