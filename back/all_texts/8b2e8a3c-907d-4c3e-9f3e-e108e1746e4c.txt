WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Vice President Mike Pence canceled a planned trip to two U.S. states on Friday to work with President Donald Trump as the House of Representatives sought to vote on Republicansâ€™ healthcare bill, a spokesman for Pence said.
Pence had planned to travel to Little Rock, Arkansas, and Memphis, Tennessee, according to the spokesman.
The change came as House Republican leaders scrambled to gain enough support for the legislation ahead of a vote later on Friday.
