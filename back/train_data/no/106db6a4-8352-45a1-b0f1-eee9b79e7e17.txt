from tmzivanka trump just had a bumpy start to her xmas holiday an out-of-control passenger on her flight began verbally berating her and jeering at her 3 kids.ivanka was on a jetblue flight leaving jfk thursday morning with her family when a passenger started screaming , your father is ruining the country .
the guy went on , why is she on our flight ?
she should be flying private .
the guy had his kid in his arms as he went on the tirade .
a passenger on the flight tells tmz ivanka ignored the guy and tried distracting her kids with crayons .
jetblue personnel escorted the unruly passenger off the flight .
as he was removed he screamed , you re kicking me off for expressing my opinion ? !
except the obnoxious passenger tweeted an hour earlier that he was harassing ivanka trump : the husband of the unruly passenger tweeted an hour before the plane took off , ivanka and jared at jfk t5 , flying commercial .
my husband chasing them down to harass them .
: btw ivanka , her family and bunch of cousins were all in coach.jetblue later released a statement , saying , the decision to remove a customer from a flight is not taken lightly .
if the crew determines that a customer is causing conflict on the aircraft , the customer will be asked to deplane , especially if the crew feels the situation runs the risk of escalation during flight .
our team worked to re-accommodate the party on the next available flight .
a passenger sitting in front of trump entourage made it clear that he felt the flight crew made the right call .
he said the irritated passenger could be seen visibly shaking .
the secret service was on the plane but stayed out of the disturbance.the intolerant left proved yet again that they are unhinged losers !
