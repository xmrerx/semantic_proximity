Leonardo DiCaprio took in Best Actor at the 88th Annual Academy Awards Sunday night for his role in The Revenant.

2015 was the hottest year in recorded history.
Our production team needed to go to the southern tip of this planet just to be able to find snow.
Climate change is real, it is happening right now.
It is the most urgent threat facing our entire species, and we need to work collectively together, and stop procrastinating.
We need to support leaders around the world who do not speak for the big polluters or the big corporations.

Lady Gaga later delivered the performance of a lifetime with her song Till it happens to you, from the documentary The Hunting Ground, which explores rape on college campuses in the U.S., drawing tears and a standing ovation from the audience.The acclaimed actor then received his own standing ovation as the winner for best actor and made his speech as Vice President Joe Biden looked on.Many Republicans have rejected the notion of climate change, preferring instead to cater to big businesses and corporations who have polluted the earth and set temperatures to record levels.
Climate change is one of many pressing issues that separate Republicans and Democrats and it makes this election year vital for future policies on climate change.
