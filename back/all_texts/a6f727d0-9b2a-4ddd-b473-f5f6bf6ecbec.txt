Not paying taxes and being in debt appears to be a Trump family tradition.Like her father, Ivanka Trump apparently has a problem paying her taxes and it turns out she owes thousands.Her business has taken a lot of major hits recently as retailers drop her products due to poor sales and boycotts.
After Nordstrom s dropped her products, Donald Trump lashed out at them on Twitter and Kellyanne Conway resorted to peddling Ivanka s products on Fox News, which violated ethics rules and put Ivanka in an even worse position.Now the state of New York has slapped her jewelry store with a lien for failing to pay taxes.Ivanka Trump owns Trump Fine Jewelry, a store operated in Trump Tower in New York that sells items starting at $1,000 and as high as $20,000.And just like her father, Ivanka doesn t think she should have to pay her taxes either.In January, New York filed a lien against Ivanka s jewelry business for owing $5,000 in unpaid taxes, an amount that is still not paid off.One would think that a person as wealthy as Ivanka would just pay her taxes and move on but Ivanka seems to just want to move on without paying what she owes as if she is somehow entitled to not pay taxes just because her daddy is in the White House.But that s not how it works.
If a person owes taxes they are obligated under the law to pay them.And this isn t the first time Ivanka has tried to escape paying her debts.
Just last year, she was ordered to pay over $3 million to KGK Jewelry for failing to pay them for services rendered.
Again, her father has a history of failing to pay contractors for doing jobs.One has to wonder how much debt Donald Trump owes to his own creditors.
After all, Trump often does business with banks overseas because American banks refuse to give him loans since he is a credit risk.
Only Trump s taxes would give us definitive knowledge of Trump s finances.But now we know that his daughter definitely does not pay her taxes.
And she must have learned it from someone, and there s no one better at failing to pay taxes than Donald Trump.Featured image via Joe Scarnici/Getty Images
