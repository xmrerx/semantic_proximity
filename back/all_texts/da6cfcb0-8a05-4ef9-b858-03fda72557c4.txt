Hillary has to be one of the worst candidates to ever get this far in a presidential race.
She has no idea what the American people truly want.
Like every good progressive, she only knows what she believes is good for Americans.
And what Hillary believes are Donald s weaknesses with voters, are actually his strengths.
Enjoy:Very nice of Hillary Clinton to run a pro-Trump ad, too?

It s just that they know so many things that aren t so.
