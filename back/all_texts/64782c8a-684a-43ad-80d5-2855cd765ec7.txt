Donald Trump can t let it go.
A broken and antiquated system that exists solely to benefit slave-owning states by increasing the value of their residents votes while devaluing everyone else s the Electoral College allowed him to become President despite his opponent trouncing him in the popular vote, and he still isn t satisfied because he failed to travel back in time and vanquish his true nemesis: President Obama.Ever since he recently claimed that he could have beaten the President if he ran against him, Trump has been the subject of mockery but on Tuesday, his delusion came to a head when he claimed he had actually beaten Obama, who could not and did not run in 2016.
President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost, Twitler tweeted.
The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 27, 2016Now sure, he actually ended up with a historic popular vote loss among people who have become President while Obama enjoyed a record-shattering popular vote win while also managing to win via the Electoral College, but The Donald is confident that he could beat Obama in a head-to-head matchup.
Naturally, the mockery intensified to match this new level of stupidity:.
@realDonaldTrump Honey honey shhhh.
It's over.
You did it, baby.
You have to be President now.
Stop catastrophizing into imaginary spirals.

No, that's an insult to children.
Children love life, & are full of wonder & happiness.
That's not you.
Larry Sullivan (@larrysullivan) December 27, 2016Good God @realDonaldTrump.
It's over you won (sort of).
Have a nice conjugal cuddle with your "charity" funded portrait, and move on.
Steve Blum (@blumspew) December 27, 2016 @realDonaldTrump Oh dear, it must be time for your pills, grandpa Trump.
Obama didn't run in 2016, remember?
It was Hillary.
HILL-LA-REE!
RJ Palacio (@RJPalacio) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump President Obama campaigned in 2008 and 2012, and unlike you, he won the electoral college AND the popular vote.
#resist Nicky Jay (@BrooklynSun76) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump you are a bit of a goose.
Obama is far more popular than Hillary and wasn't the candidate, if you hadn't noticed.
Stephen Mayne (@MayneReport) December 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump Obama wasn't running.
I'm honestly not sure you realize that.
You may have legit mental issues.
Get checked out.

(@LisaBBFF) December 27, 2016At this point, Trump should be working on unifying the country (as though that is possible with him in charge).
Unfortunately, it seems that he is more focused on being a Twitter troll than on being President.
Even more unfortunately, our country will suffer for it.Featured image via Getty Images (Ethan Miller)/screengrab
