erbil , iraq ( reuters ) - iraqi forces launched an offensive on saturday to capture rawa , the last remaining town under islamic-state control , leaving the group s self-proclaimed caliphate on the verge of complete defeat .
the capture of the town would mark the end of islamic state s era of territorial rule over a so-called caliphate that it proclaimed in 2014 across vast swathes of iraq and syria .
syria s army declared victory over the militants on thursday , after seizing the last substantial town on the border with iraq .
the army and its allies were still fighting islamic state in desert areas near albu kamal , the last town the militant group had held in syria .
two iraqi infantry divisions and sunni tribal forces are participating in the offensive to recapture the small town of rawa and its surrounding areas along the border with syria , the joint operations command said in a statement .
last week , iraqi forces recaptured the larger town of al-qaim , in what prime minister haider al-abadi called record time , leaving just a few small pockets of land in islamic state s hands .
iraq has been carrying out its final campaign to crush the islamic state caliphate while also mounting a military offensive in the north against the kurds who held an independence referendum in september .
