Criminal charges are coming down the line for Flint, Michigan officials involved in the devastating lead poisoning of the city s water supply.
The Detroit Free Press reports that the state attorney general is about to make a major move.Michigan Attorney General Bill Schuette will announce criminal charges today in connection with his ongoing investigation of the Flint drinking water crisis, three sources familiar with the investigation told the Free Press on Tuesday.Officials believe the city got artificially low lead readings because they didn t test the homes most at risk those with lead service lines or other features putting them at high risk for lead.
Among those to be charged is a City of Flint official who signed a document saying the homes Flint used to test tap water under the federal Lead and Copper Rule all had lead service lines a statement investigators allege was false.Flint a majority black city of over 100,000 had its water poisoned when an emergency manager put in place by Republican Governor Rick Snyder made the decision to switch the city s water supply to the Flint River in order to save money.
Thanks to a system of corroded pipes, the water was poisoned with lead and piped into homes as drinking water.As a result, tests of Flint children have shown an increase in blood lead levels from 2.5% of kids to possibly as much as 5%.
Lead poisoning can cause many physical ailments as it attacks the body, as well as brain damage resulting in serious learning disabilities and other disorders.Governor Snyder and his subordinates first down played concerns about lead poisoning when Flint residents began complaining about the quality of their water.
Then as national media outlets began covering the issue, Snyder hired crisis managers and began to issue apologies while failing to seriously take blame for his decision.Now someone is going to be arrested, but it is an open question if the investigation will go to an even higher level, to the decision makers at top.Featured image via Flickr
