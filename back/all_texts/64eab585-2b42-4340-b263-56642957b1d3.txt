Former CIA Agent Phil Mudd is a jackwagon!
He threatened Congressman Trey Gowdy after hearing video of questioning from Gowdy to Ex-CIA Director John Brennan.
Mudd made the threat that Gowdy should have his a** kicked .
Who says something like that on National TV?https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=qLw5q_d1PxUNotice how the anchors on CNN say nothing back to Mudd to knock it off.
They probably loved the threat.In case you missed it: Trey Gowdy asked a pointed question of former CIA Director Brennan: Did you have evidence of a connection between the Trump campaign and Russian state actors?
Brennan replied: As I said, Mr. Gowdy, I don t do evidence.
BOOM!
