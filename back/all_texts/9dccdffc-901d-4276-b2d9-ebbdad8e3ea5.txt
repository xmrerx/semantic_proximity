Another positive step towards restoring our freedoms A federal court has decided that the National Security Agency s (NSA) bulk, warrantless collection of millions of Americans phone records is illegal.The decision from the Second Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday represents the second major court victory for opponents of the NSA, after a lower court decision called the program nearly unconstitutional six months ago.The phone records program exceeds the scope of what Congress has authorized, Judge Gerard Lynch wrote on behalf of the three-judge panel.
The court did not examine the constitutionality of the surveillance program.Via: The Hill
