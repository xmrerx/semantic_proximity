Donald Trump just got taken to the woodshed for whining about Saturday Night Live instead of focusing on important things like foreign policy and national security.As we all know, Alec Baldwin once again perfectly impersonated Trump in a cold-open depicting Trump wasting time on Twitter instead of paying attention and learning what he needs to know before taking over the White House in January so he doesn t burn the world down.That led to Trump doing exactly what Baldwin mocked him for doing.
Rather than letting it go, Trump whined about Baldwin and SNL.Just tried watching Saturday Night Live unwatchable!
Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can t get any worse.
Sad Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016And that was the last straw for Twitter user Danielle Muscato.Sick and tired of Trump posting petty complaints on Twitter instead of focusing on the presidency, Muscato gave Trump the biting lecture he deserves.
And it was EPIC!Jesus fucking Christ, @realDonaldTrump.
You are the president-elect.
Pick your fucking battles, man.
You re embarrassing yourself.
Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump Baldwin s impression isn t Sad.

You know that actual lives are at stake, right?
You re pathetic.
Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump This is not a joke, Donald.
Don t you have anything better to do?
Are you so narcissistic that a PARODY is your priority?
Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump Do you know how many trans people were murdered since Election Day?
Do you know how many veterans killed themselves?
Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump Do you know how many children went to bed tonight without enough food to eat?
Do you even care?
What is *wrong* with you?!
Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump No, of course you don t know those things.
You don t even know what a blind trust, and you call yourself a businessman.
Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump You re pathetic.
You ran for prez for attention.
You are a fake,a fraud.
You never wanted to win anyway; we can all see it.
Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump You are not fooling anyone.
You re scared, and overwhelmed, and you have absolutely no idea what you re doing.
And it shows Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump You think we re all too polite, too aghast, to call you out.
I see through you, Donny.
I m calling you out.
You re a joke.
Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump With every fiber of my being, I am disgusted by you.
And you know what the real secret is?
You re disgusted by you, too.
Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump That s why you surround yourself with gold, and beautiful women that you objectify.
You know you re a loser, so you try to Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump make yourself feel better, feel successful, authoritative, with things, and money.
You are an impostor.
You are a fraud.
Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump I m ashamed of you.
The world is ashamed.
You spout NONSENSE, millions of illegal voters?!
Even you don t believe it absurd Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump Do you think we re stupid?
You think we don t know what you re doing?
Trying to control the narrative, get your followers.. Danielle Muscato (@DanielleMuscato) December 4, 2016And it didn t end there.
Here are screenshots of the rest.This is the kind of talking to that Trump has probably never received in his entire spoiled life.
But it s what a spoiled brat needs to hear at least once.
So he better listen up before he makes an ass out of himself even more than he already has.
Because the world is watching and right now he is just a joke.
And a bad joke at that.Featured Image: Drew Angerer/Getty Images
