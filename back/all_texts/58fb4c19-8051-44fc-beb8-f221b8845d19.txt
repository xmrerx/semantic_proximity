Donald Trump regularly takes a beating on Twitter, the home of his poorly-spelled, nonsensical ravings.
But since he s the President, he s above pettiness and respects dissenting opinions and facts, right?
Wrong.While The Donald s pea-brained followers regularly call anyone who has a problem with their racism and hatred snowflakes (a term that ironically refers to someone who was opposed to the abolition of slavery, something Trump fans want to bring back) it seems that the term now applies to Donald Trump in two ways the original meaning, and the new one thrown around by idiots who think it sounds clever (see below):Trump s feelings apparently were hurt by comedy writer Bess Kalb, who found that the leader of the free world had blocked her:OH.
MY.
EFFING.
GOD.The President of the United States just blocked me on Twitter because I hurt his feelings.

Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 29, 2017Naturally, Kalb is devastated (not really):I'd like to summarize my feelings about this in one radical feminist sculpture: pic.twitter.com/qMTDy9VieE Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 29, 2017It is mortifying, yet unsurprising to me that the leader of the free world could be so wounded by the gentle ribbing of a comedy writer.
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 29, 2017And if I could talk to him now I d tell him: Donald, sticks and stones may break your bones but articles of impeachment will harm you.
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 29, 2017But what could have so damaged Trump that he would block Kalb?
This.For the official record, here's the straw that broke the camel's back.
Kalb out.

She poked fun at his embarrassing trips abroad, his efforts to avoid serving in the military, and of course the idea of President Pence (shudder) taking over.Kalb took a moment to put this all into perspective, noting that our president took more time to address a girl making fun of him on Twitter than the domestic terrorist who fatally stabbed 2 heroes.
Today our president took more time to address a girl making fun of him on Twitter than the domestic terrorist who fatally stabbed 2 heroes.
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) May 29, 2017Of course others on Twitter share Kalb s feeling of devastation mainly because she s seemingly always there to mock The Donald and this block represents a huge hole in their lives:@th3j35t3r @bessbell I feel bad, I have been openly insulting him and nothing.
