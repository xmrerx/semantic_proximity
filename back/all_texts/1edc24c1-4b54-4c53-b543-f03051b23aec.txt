When Keurig decided to side with Soros against Sean Hannity and Roy Moore s right to defend himself against serious, and shady sex allegations, they released a genie that they re not going to be able to put back in the bottle Three days ago, a Twitter user by the name of Angelo Carusone tried to shame Keurig for adverising on the Sean Hannity Show after Sean interviewed the Repbulican Alabama Senate candidate, Roy Moore, allowing him to tell his side of the story, after 4 women came forward 4 decades later to announce that he sexually abused them when they were teens.
The stories of at least 2 of his accusers have been unraveling after non-mainstream media uncovered that one of the anti-Trump accusers worked for Hillary and openly promoted Moore s Democrat opponent on her Facebook page.
The mother of another accuser is challenging the truth behind the Washington Post s hit story as well.Curiously, the person who sent the tweet that Keurig responded to is none other than Angelo Carusone, the president of GEORGE SOROS Media Matters of America.
Here is Carusone s tweet to Keurig.Angelo, thank you for your concern and for bringing this to our attention.
We worked with our media partner and FOX news to stop our ad from airing during the Sean Hannity Show.
Keurig (@Keurig) November 11, 2017Hannity followers were quick to defend the Fox News host, while calling for a boycott against Keurig:Throwing my Keurig unit and all the coffee in the trash was the first thing I did today after getting back to London where I base.
@seanhannity made it very clear he was NOT defending Moore and his exclusive interview was not to clear him BUT to interrogate him thoroughly.
Jenifer Stevens (@JeniferStevens) November 12, 2017Twitter users like Kaya, slammed Keurig for thir decision to pull their advertising from the Sean Hannity show:Well good luck with the people.
We don t support companies who play politics @Keurig Should have stayed neutral!
@seanhannity has an army behind him.

#SundayFunday #StandWithHannitypic.twitter.com/2hTpojmF35 gh -or- c (@NiaMAGA3X) November 12, 2017Keurig CEO Bob Gamgort apologized to his employees on Monday for ostensibly taking sides in a Media Matters-led boycott of Sean Hannity s advertisers.Media Matters president Angelo Carusone spent his weekend tweeting at Hannity s advertisers and falsely accusing the Fox News host of defending sexual predators.
Hannity has said repeatedly that Senate candidate Roy Moore has no place in politics if the allegations that he is a predator are true.In a memo leaked to Erik Wemple of The Washington Post, Keurig s Gamgort apologized to his employees for the way the situation was handled.
The decision to publicly communicate our programming decision via our Twitter account was highly unusual, Gamgort wrote.
This gave the appearance of taking sides in an emotionally charged debate that escalated on Twitter and beyond over the weekend, which was not our intent.
Gamgort assured the employees that it was outside of protocol for Keurig to announce the ad pulls on Twitter and would make sure this never happens again.
I apologize for any negativity you experienced as a result of this situation and assure you that we will learn and improve going forward, he stated.
