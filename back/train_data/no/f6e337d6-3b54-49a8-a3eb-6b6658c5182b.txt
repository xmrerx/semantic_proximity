tegucigalpa ( reuters ) - hondurans voted on sunday in a presidential election that many expect to result in a second term for the current u.s.-friendly leader , eight years after he supported a coup against a former president who also floated the idea of reelection .
based on recent polls , juan orlando hernandez , of the center-right national party , looks set to profit from a 2015 supreme court decision that overturned a constitutional ban on reelection .
he is running against television host salvador nasralla , who helms a broad left-right coalition called the opposition alliance against the dictatorship .
below are the candidates main proposals : juan orlando hernandez - a former head of congress who studied at the state university of new york and honduras military academy , hernandez , 49 , enjoys a good rapport with white house chief of staff john kelly and is seen as a reliable u.s. ally in central america .
- hernandez has managed to lower the murder rate and raise growth while expanding his influence into the furthest reaches of the honduran government .
- critics say hernandez , who was born in a humble , rural family of 17 siblings , has stifled dissent and is seeking to consolidate power .
u.s. government officials say they want him to revitalize stalled legislation to place a cap on presidential term limits and assuage fears he will not cede power .
- with his slogan change has begun and should continue , hernandez says he will keep up his militarized fight against the gangs that have turned the central american nation into one of the world s most violent .
- hernandez says his honduras 20/20 plan will help lure investment in textiles , call centers and car manufacturing and lift growth .
he wants to push ahead with special economic zones , a project that has so far yielded few concrete results .
he says his policies will create 600,000 new jobs in the next four years .
salvador nasralla - a colorful 64-year-old sports and talent tv show host descended from lebanese immigrants , nasralla promises to put an end to years of violence , poverty and graft .
- nasralla s opposition alliance against the dictatorship coalition includes the liberty and refoundation party , or libre .
it is controlled by ousted former president manuel zelaya , who many believe is the true force behind the coalition .
- a non-traditional political figure who has benefited from his entertainment background to build support among those disenchanted by business-as-usual honduran politics , nasralla trailed hernandez by 15 points in a september poll , the last permitted before the election .
- nasralla says he will ask the united nations to install an anti-graft body , similar to one operating in guatemala , to probe and bring charges in corruption cases .
he would maintain the military police created by hernandez but wants to start a community police force to work in violent slums .
he would also continue firing corrupt national police officers , while hiring up to 25,000 new officers .
- plans for the economy are vague , but the coalition has proposed lowering the sales tax and slashing a hernandez-imposed corporate levy that has enraged the private sector .
- the alliance has proposed a referendum on how the current constitution should be rewritten , either by congress or by a new national assembly .
it also wants a referendum on stripping the powers of the supreme court , which it accuses of being pliant to hernandez .
