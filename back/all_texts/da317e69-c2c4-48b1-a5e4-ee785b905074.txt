Mega music star Adele took some time during a concert in Denmark to offer some words about American music queen Beyonce and her album Lemonade.
Adele had nothing but good things to say about Beyonce , calling her the sickest artist around.
But, she went a step further in a statement that has earned the ire of conservative Christians.
Here s what Adele said: She is Jesus f***ing Christ.
It s unbelievable.
I ve been listening to her for 17 years, and she s still making music that blows my mind.

Here s what she said: I m not late on this I ve just been speechless.
Beyonce is the most inspiring person I ve ever had the pleasure of worshipping.
Her talent, beauty, grace and work ethic are all in a league of their own.
I appreciate you so much!
Thank god for Beyonc .
Although the comparison was harmless, many people felt a personal affront and made their feelings known on Twitter.
One person went so far as to pray for Adele s soul when she meets Jesus.
Others accused the star of losing her mind (see below).In the end, it s simply one musician expressing admiration for another.
@shaykimberlyy ikr Satan (@allhailsatan_) May 8, 2016Adele calling Beyonc Jesus Christ makes me kinda not like her anymore Alexvnder (@alexanderdaname) May 7, 2016@Adele Comparing @Beyonce to Jesus Christ is very offensive on every level.
It is just plain evil.
You need to apologize quickly.

No one is surprised, but their freakouts are downright pathetic these days.
