copenhagen ( reuters ) - denmark , part of the nato-led military mission in afghanistan , said monday it will send an additional 55 soldiers to the country to boost security efforts after a car bomber attacked a danish convoy last week .
the soldiers will assist the 97 danish soldiers already in afghanistan protecting advisers traveling to and from the afghan military academy near kabul , denmark s ministry of defense said on monday .
if the afghan government loses control , afghanistan will once again become a haven for terrorist groups and we risk another wave of refugees to europe and denmark , foreign minister anders samuelsen said in a statement .
the 55 danish soldiers will be stationed in kabul at the beginning of 2018 .
