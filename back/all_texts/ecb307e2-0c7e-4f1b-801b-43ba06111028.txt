WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on Tuesday defended his campaign for a referendum on constitutional reforms, saying that such an overhaul would help simplify the nation’s bureaucracy, offer greater stability and help make Europe stronger.
“I’ll do everything I can,” to help the Dec. 4 referendum pass, Renzi said, speaking in Italian through an interpreter at the White House at a news conference with U.S. President Barack Obama.
“This is something to simplify things in our country.”
