beijing ( reuters ) - a second prototype of china s home-built c919 passenger jet took off for a test flight in shanghai on sunday , state television reported , another step forward in the country s ambitions to muscle in to the global jet market .
a total of six prototypes will eventually conduct test flights , china central television reported , with engine tests to be a particular focus .
the aim was to conduct another long-distance test flight in late january , chief engineer wang wei was quoted as saying .
more than 1,000 tests would be carried out .
the narrow-body aircraft , which will compete with boeing s 737 and the airbus a320 , is a symbol of china s ambitions to penetrate the global passenger jet market , estimated to be worth $ 2 trillion over the next 20 years .
the c919 made its maiden flight on may 5 after numerous delays .
analysts have questioned the long periods between previous test flights .
it completed its first long-distance flight on nov. 10 , flying for 2 hours and 23 minutes from shanghai to the central chinese city of xi an , covering more than 1,300 km ( 800 miles ) and reaching an altitude of 7,800 meters ( 25,590 feet ) .
