The EU has opened the floodgates to Muslims from the Middle East and Africa who have no interest in assimilating.
Did anyone really believe they would be able to maintain their history and their culture?
Remember when people dreamed about going on a European vacation?Austrians fear parts of Vienna are becoming no-go areas after a father was attacked by a Sharia patrol when he told them to stop threatening his wife and daughter for not being correctly dressed.As various factions of migrants stake claims to territory in the city, it has been reported that the self-styled Sharia patrols have been visiting clubs and bars in the Millennium City area to make sure Chechen women were properly dressed and acting appropriately.However, when one Austrian man tried to step in to stop the patrol from hassling his Chechen wife and daughter, he ended up being hospitalised.It came as violence escalated across Vienna at the weekend, with more than 50 young men from the Afghan and Chechen communities clashing in the city centre.The gang had attacked each other with planks of wood, iron bars and knives.
Two of those injured are in intensive care and their condition is described as critical.Police say that the row which involved around 40 people from Afghanistan attacking 10 from Chechnya had centred around a social media row on Facebook.Six of the alleged asylum seekers from Afghanistan have been arrested.
The rest have escaped.Local couple Thomas and Manuela Sonntagfruh, standing on the bloodstained ground after the carnage at the weekend, said: It is quite common that young people might argue, but something like this just isn t normal.
The latest incident follows on from mass punch-ups not only in other parts of Vienna, but also in the cities of Linz, Graz, Sankt Polten and in Salzburg.
