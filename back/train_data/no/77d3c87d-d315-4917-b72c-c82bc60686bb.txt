beirut ( reuters ) - lebanese prime minister saad al-hariri said on thursday gulf arab countries were planning no action against lebanon after a political crisis last month thrust it onto the front line of rivalry between saudi arabia and iran .
hariri has been a political ally of saudi arabia but his coalition government includes lebanon s powerful shi ite muslim hezbollah group , an ally of shi ite iran and sworn enemy of sunni muslim riyadh .
last month s political crisis , sparked when hariri announced his resignation while in saudi arabia , raised fear in lebanon that riyadh and its gulf allies would take economic action against the tiny mediterranean country .
in an interview broadcast from riyadh before he returned to lebanon and rescinded his resignation , hariri warned of possible gulf sanctions on lebanon and of a threat to the livelihood of lebanese workers in gulf states .
his remarks on thursday seemed aimed at reassuring that no such action was in the cards .
this is not going to happen .
i assure you we have the best relationship with saudi arabia , we have a very good relationship with the uae , and most of the gulf , he said at a business conference .
the gulf has a problem with one political party in lebanon and does not have a problem with the whole of lebanon , hariri added , alluding to hezbollah .
