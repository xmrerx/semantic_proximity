as we all know , donald trump does not like to read books .
hell , he really doesn t read anything at all unless it s something that strokes his ego .
but he finally found the perfect book and he humiliated himself by telling the world about it.in a morning twitter rant on monday , trump promoted a book that is literally filled with mostly blank pages .
and conservatives are actually spending their money on it.a great book for your reading enjoyment : reasons to vote for democrats by michael j. knowles .
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) april 17 , 2017if you preview the book on amazon , all you ll find for content is blank pages .
the word count clocks in at 1,235 words over an entire 266 pages .
basically , it s a waste of paper , ink , and brain cells that only someone like donald trump and his conservative fans appreciate .
you know , because reading something of substance is hard.here s just a couple screenshot of the pages within the book .
it goes on and on like that throughout and it s easy to see why trump likes to read it .
because there s nothing to really read at all.keep in mind , trump s tweet of admiration for this piece of right-wing trash comes only a few days after his daughter ivanka tweeted about the importance of reading.this # nationallibraryweek , we honor our libraries and librarians for opening our eyes to the world of knowledge , learning and reading !
ivanka trump ( @ ivankatrump ) april 14 , 2017clearly , her dad doesn t pay attention to her posts.twitter users were unimpressed by trump s book choice and proceeded to humiliate him for it .
