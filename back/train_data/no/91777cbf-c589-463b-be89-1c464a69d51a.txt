geneva ( reuters ) - the u.n. human rights council is expected to hold a special session on killings , rapes and other crimes committed against muslim rohingya in myanmar that have driven more than 600,000 into bangladesh since august , u.n. sources said on monday .
there will be a special session on december 5 , a senior united nations source told reuters .
council spokesman rolando gomez could not confirm the date but said : there are moves to convene a special session to address the human rights situation in the country .
at least 16 of the 47 member states must request holding a special session of the council , which are rare .
bangladesh and muslim-majority countries were expected to back the call .
in march , the council already set up a fact-finding team .
the investigators reported after their first mission to bangladesh last month that rohingya refugees fleeing myanmar had testified that a consistent , methodical pattern of killings , torture , rape and arson is taking place .
the latest rohingya exodus from rakhine state to bangladesh s southern tip began at the end of august , when rohingya militants attacked security posts and the myanmar army launched a counter-offensive .
u.n. high commissioner for human rights zeid ra ad al-hussein has described the army s crackdown in rakhine state as a textbook example of ethnic cleansing .
the military has denied the accusations of murder , rape , torture and forced displacement .
amnesty international and other activist groups , in an open letter sent last week to member states , said that a special session was imperative to launch decisive action and ensure international scrutiny and monitoring of the situation .
pope francis arrived in myanmar on monday on a diplomatically delicate visit for the leader of the roman catholic church to the majority-buddhist country .
