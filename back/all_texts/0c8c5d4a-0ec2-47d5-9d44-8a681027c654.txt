Every year GLAAD holds their media awards ceremony to recognize and honor media for their fair, accurate and inclusive representations of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community and the issues that affect their lives.
This year, GLAAD honored Robert De Niro with the Excellence in Media Award.It was during his speech, however, that De Niro took a moment to take a sarcastic jab at those who think middle-aged white men have it bad, and of course, make fun of Donald Trump while he was at it.
He said: You think you ve got it bad, LBGT community?
I don t think you know what it s like to be really discriminated against I recently turned on the television news and saw this odd guy with little hands, and he was raving.
Turns out, the ones being discriminated against are straight, middle-aged white men It makes sense.
I ve been losing parts right and left to what used to be called diversity actors.
One that really hurts, seeing the role of Dr. Dre in Straight Outta Compton going to Corey Hawkins.
And I can t remember the last time I got a Teen Choice Award.
It s not easy being a straight, white man.
Of course, he s joking.
Being a straight, white man is pretty much winning the lottery when it comes to genetics.
Straight, white men start from a point of being respected where most others seem to need to prove themselves.
And, of course, he s clearly referencing Donald Trump with his odd guy with little hands who was raving and claiming he s being discriminated against.
It s funny because it s true, and it s also funny because he just got his ass handed to him by Robert De Niro.Watch the whole speech here:VIDEO: Robert De Niro accepts the Excellence In Media Award at the #glaadawards https://t.co/FMBl01Q1VY GLAAD (@glaad) May 15, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
