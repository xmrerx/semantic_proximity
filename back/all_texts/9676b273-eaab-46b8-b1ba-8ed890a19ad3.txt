Robert Mueller, the man selected in May by the Justice Department to head the investigation into Russia s interference in the 2016 presidential election, probably thought the job was relatively secure when he initially accepted the position, but now Donald Trump s attorneys most likely have Mueller second-guessing his decision.In an interview on Sunday, Jay Sekulow, one of Trump s attorneys, alluded to the fact that he wouldn t completely rule out the possibility that the president may fire Mueller from leading the investigation into Trump s campaign.
Why would he fire Mueller?
Simply because he can.ABC s George Stephanopoulos was interviewing Sekulow on the program This Week on Sunday and the topic of the investigation came up.
Stephanopoulos asked Sekulow if the president would give any assurance that he would not interfere in the investigation into Russian ties or order U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions, a man that many believe has already committed perjury on more than one occasion since he was sworn in for the position in early February, to fire Mueller.
Sekulow s response wasn t particularly convincing.
Look, the President of the United States, as we all know, is a unitary executive, Sekulow said during the interview.
But the president is going to seek the advice of his counsel and inside the government as well as outside.
And I m not going to speculate on what he will, or will not, do.
So, not only did Sekulow not give any assurance that Trump would pledge not to meddle in the investigation or have Mueller fired, he completely avoided acknowledging both points.
In fact, Sekulow went on to add that he can t imagine the issue of firing the head of the investigation would arise, but that, again, is an issue that the president with his advisers would discuss if there was a basis.
