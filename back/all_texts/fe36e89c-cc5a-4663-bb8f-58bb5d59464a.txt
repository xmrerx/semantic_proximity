Thank God a hero with a gun emerged in Sutherland, Texas, and was able to prevent an even worse tragedy at the hands of a mentally unstable man, who should ve been behind bars, or in a maximum security mental institution.Fox News Because of the right to use modern weaponry for the defense of life, liberty and property is natural, we should not need a government permission slip before exercising it, any more than we need one to exercise other natural rights, such as speech, press, assembly, travel, and privacy.Yet since the Progressive era 100 years ago ushered in by Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and enabled by nearly every president since the government has taken the position that it can care for us better than we can care for ourselves.
So it has severely curtailed our rights and left us reliant on the government itself for protection.The modern-day massacres are proof beyond a doubt that the government cannot protect us.Daily Caller Mike Jordan, a Texas man whose son witnessed the church shooting in Sutherland, Texas that took the lives of 26 and injured several more, wore a pretty edgy t-shirt during an appearance on Fox News Monday night.Jordan, who was interviewed by Laura Ingraham about the role guns played in the shooting that left 26 dead, wore a shirt that said, Buy a gun.
Annoy a liberal.
Jordan said that his son usually carries but left his firearm at home on Sunday when the shooting took place.
A small town like this, you know, people go to church, they disarm, leave their guns in the car, because you don t expect something like this to happen, Jordan explained.
What if this was the day he didn t leave that firearm at home?
What if he did take it with him?
If you have one person on the inside that is armed to return fire, it may not have stopped people from dying but it would have been a distraction, it would have gotten that guy s attention, he said.
