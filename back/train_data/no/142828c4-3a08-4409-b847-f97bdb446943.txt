cairo ( reuters ) - egypt s security forces killed 10 suspected militants on sunday in a shootout during a raid on two apartments in central cairo , the interior ministry said .
nine policemen , including four officers , were injured during the two raids , it said in a statement .
an insurgency led by islamic state in egypt s rugged sinai peninsula has killed hundreds of soldiers and policemen since the egyptian military overthrew president mohamed mursi of the muslim brotherhood in mid-2013 , but attacks have increasingly moved to the mainland in recent months .
authorities received information about militants fleeing north sinai to hideouts in cairo , where they were preparing to carry out attacks on more centrally located provinces , the ministry statement said .
the police suffered their injuries after a suspected militant detonated an explosive device to block them from entering the building and during an exchange of fire that followed , security sources said .
one of the security sources said authorities suspect the individuals to be members of hasm , a group which has claimed several attacks around the egyptian capital targeting judges and policemen since last year .
egypt accuses hasm of being a militant wing of the muslim brotherhood , an islamist group it outlawed in 2013 .
the muslim brotherhood denies this .
