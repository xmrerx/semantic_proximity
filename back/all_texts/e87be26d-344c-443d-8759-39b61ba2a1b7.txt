Judge Jeanine Pirro SLAMS Hillary Clinton after Clinton blamed WikiLeaks and Jim Comey s letter on October 28th for losing the election to President Trump.Judge Jeanine called Clinton a loser and told her to go back into the woods Hillary, snap out of it, Pirro said.
I m tired of going through this with you.
You re a two-time loser who lost because you were a lousy candidate, you didn t have a message, you lied every time you opened your mouth; you didn t know what states to campaign in, you put our national security at risk with your amateur email setup, you were in a foundation that was nothing more than an organized criminal enterprise parading as a charity, four men died under your watch as you lied about a video, and there were a billion dollars missing from the State Department when you left.
And I could go on and on, but I just don t have the time.
So, stop with the poor me nonsense.
We ve had it with you Clintons always claiming victimhood.
The two of you haven t followed the rules since the day you both showed up in your bell bottoms in Arkansas.
Be careful, Hillary.
Be very, very careful.
You pulled the wool over Jim Comey s eyes once, and you actually got the president to say you re a nice lady.
Don t be so sure you re going to get away with your new game, given your illegal, ill-advised, and incompetent instincts.You re a loser, Hillary.
Face it.
Face it, and get back in the woods!
