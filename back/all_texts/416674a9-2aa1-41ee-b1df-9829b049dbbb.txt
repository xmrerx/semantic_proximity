On Wednesday, Democrats took a powerful stance against the GOP s refusal to vote on gun control measures by staging a sit-in.
While Republican politicians called a recess and took a lunch break, Dems stayed put on the floor and fought for the safety of America s citizens.Hours after the sit-in, House Speaker Paul Ryan weighed in on the event in an interview with CNN, and his comments were just as disappointing as they were disgusting.
His response to a sit-in, which follows the deaths of almost 50 innocent Americans that lost their lives in a tragic mass shooting in Orlando a week ago, was this brutal sentence: This is nothing more than a publicity stunt.
Seriously a genuine attempt to get Congress to support gun control measures that will protect American citizens from senseless gun violence like mass shootings is considered a publicity stunt by a leading Republican.
The Speaker of the House added that the Democrats involved in the sit-in were trying to rob Americans of their rights, insisting that we should not be focusing on gun control and that the real threat is terrorism.
In saying this, Ryan has completely ignored the fact that there have been several mass shootings in the United States that have zero connection to terrorism and were caused by individuals that never should have been able to get their hands on a gun so effortlessly.To prove just how backwards Ryan s logic is, he accused the hard-working Democrats fighting for gun control legislation of doing the sit-in for attention instead of creating solutions (clearly, he forgot that his GOP colleagues were EATING LUNCH while this was happening which definitely doesn t solve anything).
When Wolf Blitzer asked Ryan if it was the NRA that was the major obstacle standing in the way of gun control legislation, Ryan said, No, the Constitution is because Americans have a guaranteed Second Amendment right to firearms.You can watch Ryan s horrific comments below:The entire interview is infuriating, but truly proves that the GOP cares more about guns than Americans right to safety.Featured image via Allison Shelley / Getty Images
