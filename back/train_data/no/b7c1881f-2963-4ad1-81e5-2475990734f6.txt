ljubljana ( reuters ) - macedonia s prime minister said on monday he hoped skopje and athens could soon reach a solution to a decades-long dispute over the former yugoslav republic s name .
athens argues that the use of the name macedonia implies territorial claim over greece s own northerly region with the same name and has been blocking skopje s efforts to join nato and european union over the issue .
but prime minister zoran zaev said he expected the two sides to move fast to find a solution .
november 21 , 20 there will be a first meeting with ( u.n. mediator ) matthew nimetz and i hope we will find a solution rather than postpone it , zaev said after meeting his slovenian counterpart miro cerar .
he said he expects macedonia to start accession talks with the eu next year .
the meeting in november will be the first with the u.n. mediator since zaev took over in june .
the macedonia name dispute has dragged on for almost 26 years with no clear progress .
athens has previously insisted that skopje use a compound name such as new or upper macedonia .
the former prime minister , nationalist nikola gruevski , built his almost decade-long rule on nationalism and had refused to meet greek demands .
macedonia , a small ex-yugoslav republic of about 2 million people , declared independence in 1991 and avoided the violence that accompanied the breakup of yugoslavia .
it was later rocked by an insurgency among its large ethnic albanian minority that almost tore the country apart in 2001 .
