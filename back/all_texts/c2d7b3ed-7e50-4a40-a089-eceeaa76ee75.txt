HARARE (Reuters) - A U.S. citizen accused of attempting to subvert President Robert Mugabe s government was released from Zimbabwe s maximum security jail on Friday, a day after the High Court ordered her to be freed on bail, Reuters witnesses said.
Judge Clement Phiri ruled on Thursday that there was a patent absence of facts in the state s case against 25-year-old Martha O Donovan, whose arrest last week centered on accusations she insulted 93-year-old Mugabe in a Twitter post.
She denies the accusation.
Reuters witnesses saw O Donovan leaving prison in a United States embassy vehicle.
O Donovan and her lawyers did not speak to reporters waiting outside Chikurubi Maximum Prison on the outskirts of Harare.
State prosecutors accuse O Donovan of writing a Twitter post in October calling Mugabe a selfish and sick man .
The government has since last year been targeting activists and government critics who use social media to speak out against Mugabe, cash shortages in banks and a foreign currency crunch that has caused a sharp rise in prices.
Amnesty International said it feared O Donovan would not be the last to be arrested in the government s clamp down on social media platforms .
Activist pastor Evan Mawarire, whose #ThisFlag movement last year organized the biggest stay-at-home demonstration in a decade, is on trial on a charge of subversion.
He faces a separate trial for a similar offence.
