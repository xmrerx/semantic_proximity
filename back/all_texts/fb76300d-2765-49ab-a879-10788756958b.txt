LONDON (Reuters) - British police said on Monday that a cordon in Victoria Square in the northern English town of Bolton had been lifted after a package at the site was found to be not suspicious.
Greater Manchester Police had earlier evacuated the square as a precautionary measure while they investigated reports of a suspicious package.
