( reuters ) - german chancellor angela merkel s conservatives and the social democrats ( spd ) have agreed to exploratory talks on forming a new government starting on jan. 7 , both parties said on wednesday after informal discussions .
the decision , 87 days after a national election that returned a fragmented parliament and complicated coalition arithmetic , brightens prospects for a renewal of the grand coalition that governed germany over the past four years .
a repeat coalition is merkel s best chance of securing a fourth term as chancellor after talks on forming a three-way alliance with two smaller parties broke down , leaving europe s largest economy in an unprecedented state of uncertainty .
it was a good discussion in a trusting atmosphere , the parties said in a joint statement after leaders met on wednesday .
they agreed to hold four days of talks from jan. 7 , with the aim of deciding by jan. 12 whether to open formal coalition negotiations .
even in the most optimistic case , germany will have smashed 2013 s post-world war two record of needing 86 days to form a new government after an election .
the hiatus highlights that germany , long europe s bastion of stability , is not immune to the political fragmentation that has swept the continent .
the conservatives and social democrats have identified 15 policy areas for exploration , including education , the welfare state and employment law , where the spd is keen to carve out a distinctive left-wing identity for itself after a disastrous election showing blamed in part on merkel s dominant stature .
the spd s membership , which tends to be more radical than the party leadership , will have to ratify any decision to repeat a coalition with merkel , who has been in power for 12 years .
