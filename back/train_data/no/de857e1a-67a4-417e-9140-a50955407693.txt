ottawa ( reuters ) - canada imposed sanctions on friday against 30 russian officials whom it said were complicit in the 2009 prison death of sergei magnitsky , an anti-corruption lawyer who was jailed after alleging a massive tax fraud .
the measures which freeze the assets of the officials and bar them from visiting canada were enacted through a new law giving the government the right to penalize those it says are guilty of human rights violations , the foreign ministry said in a statement .
among those targeted are alexander bastrykin , russia s top investigator and a close aide to russian president vladimir putin .
the united states blacklisted him in january 2017 , citing magnitsky s death .
today s announcement sends a clear message that canada will take action against individuals who have profited from acts of significant corruption or who have been involved in gross violations of human rights , said foreign minister chrystia freeland .
moscow said last month it would retaliate if canada banned individuals under the new law .
the russian embassy in ottawa later issued a statement denouncing the sanctions as absolutely pointless and reprehensible .
canada has repeatedly condemned moscow over russia s 2014 annexation of ukraine s crimea region and imposed sanctions along with other western nations .
the united states adopted a law in 2012 freezing any u.s. assets of russian investigators and prosecutors said to have been involved in the detention of magnitsky .
in retaliation , moscow barred americans from adopting russian children .
in addition to penalizing the 30 russians , canada also imposed sanctions on 19 officials from venezuela and three from south sudan .
