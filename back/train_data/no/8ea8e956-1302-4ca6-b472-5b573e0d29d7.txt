what a funny guy !
i m sure every woman on that campaign plane that he violated with his repulsive , narcissistic , denigrating behavior was really impressed .
thank god trump didn t do that .
it would have been career ending .
for obama however , it was just all fun and games , and apparently not even worth cnn s time to release the tape until his two terms were up as donald trump weathers a storm of controversy over randy comments he made to tv celebrity reporter billy bush in 2005 , new video to emerge from the 2008 presidential campaign shows now-president obama appearing to behave just as salaciously .
aboard a campaign flight , then-senator obama is talking on a cellphone as he arises from his seat ; nearby a female reporter catches a glance of something that makes her uncomfortable , sending her skirmishing to the back of the plane.obama , rather than downplay the awkward display , instead plays it up , positioning himself so the gathered reporters have little choice but to take in his chauvinistic performance.meanwhile , a female voice can be heard ordering everyone to sit down , ostensibly so they can get a better look .
the gathered female reporters laugh at the scene , further encouraging obama s bawdy behavior.the video , originally shot by cnn cameras , emerged tuesday ontwitter , where it spread quickly.via : grabian
