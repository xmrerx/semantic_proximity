It s one thing to call a person stupid, it s another to prove it, and that s exactly what Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA) just did to Donald Trump in one simple tweet.You see, Takano is a former British literature teacher, knows a thing or two about the English language and can spellcheck you in real time.
That s bad news for a guy like Trump who often takes to Twitter in anger-fueled rants and doesn t take the time to proofread his tweets, or even let spellcheck do it for him.In Trump s latest grouping of tweets, he really, really messed up.
In fact, following a tweet that said, We must fix our education system, he tweeted I hear by demand and then, I hearby demand and then finally, I hereby demand.

Maybe.
Undoubtedly, Trump won t say it was him because, according to him, he s seemingly never wrong.Nevertheless, Takano s tweet is absolutely hilarious.
