History is once again being made thanks to President Obama.
On Wednesday, Obama nominated Abid Riaz Qureshi to serve as a judge on the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, filling the vacancy left by Judge Rosemary Collyer (who took senior status).Qureshi s nomination makes him the first Muslim to be nominated for a federal judgeship and, if confirmed, the first Muslim federal judge in American history.With a commitment to serve the American people with integrity and a steadfast commitment to justice, as President Obama said, Qureshi is a graduate of Cornell University and Harvard University and currently works at the law firm Latham & Watkins LLP.
Qureshi specializes in healthcare fraud and securities violations.Not only is Qureshi a partner at Latham & Watkins (a position he s held since 2006), he is the global chair of the firm s Pro Bono Committee, and serves on the Legal Ethics Committee of the District of Columbia Bar.An accomplished lawyer, who happens to be Muslim, will not get his day in the Senate (should the obstructionist Republicans allow it) and make history.And of course conservatives are going to be furious when they find out that gasp Muslims can serve in public office!
Fortunately to sanity and justice, the United States Constitution has a No Religious Test clause under Article VI: ;but no religious test shall ever be required as a qualification to any office or public trust under the United States.So say the Founders, who seemed to be very cordial and accepting of Muslims.The United States Constitution has this clause to ward off hateful bigots who think their religion is the only one that matters, and President Obama is taking full advantage of it, and rightfully so.
Qureshi isn t qualified because he s a Muslim, he s just a qualified attorney who happens to be Muslim.Here s to hoping history will once again be made, and Republicans will give this man a fair hearing and a speedy up-and-down vote.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images
