luxembourg ( reuters ) - britain must commit to paying what it owes to the european union before talks can begin about a future relationship with the bloc after brexit , european commission president jean-claude juncker said on friday .
the british are discovering , as we are , day after day new problems .
that s the reason why this process will take longer than initially thought , juncker said in a speech to students in his native luxembourg .
we can not find for the time being a real compromise as far as the remaining financial commitments of the uk are concerned .
as we are not able to do this we will not be able to say in the european council in october that now we can move to the second phase of negotiations , juncker said .
they have to pay , they have to pay , not in an impossible way .
i m not in a revenge mood .
i m not hating the british .
the eu has told britain that a summit next week will conclude that insufficient progress has been made in talks for brussels to open negotiations on a future trade deal .
london has been hoping and pressing for this to happen at the summit .
