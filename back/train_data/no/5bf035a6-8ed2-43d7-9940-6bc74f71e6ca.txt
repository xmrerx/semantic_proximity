( reuters ) - the u.s. geological survey said on saturday it could not conclusively confirm whether a magnitude 3.5 earthquake detected in north korea was manmade or natural .
usgs put the epicenter of the quake 22 km ( 14 miles ) east-northeast of sungjibaegam , north korea , near the country s main nuclear test site .
chinese earthquake officials earlier said the tremor was a suspected explosion , while south korean officials and ctbto , the nuclear proliferation watchdog , both said they believed it was a natural quake .
the depth is poorly constrained and has been held to 5 km by the seismologist , usgs said .
the air force technical applications center ( aftac ) is the sole organization in the u.s. federal government whose mission is to detect and report technical data from foreign nuclear explosions .
