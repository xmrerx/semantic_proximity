WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States top military officer said on Tuesday that despite an escalation in rhetoric between the United States and North Korea, he had not seen Pyongyang change it s military posture.
While the political space is clearly very charged right now, we haven t seen a change in the posture of North Korean forces and we watch that very closely, Marine General Joseph Dunford, chairman of the military s Joint Chiefs of Staff, told a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing for his reappointment.
What we haven t seen is military activity that would be reflective of the charged political environment.
