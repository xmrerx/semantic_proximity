donald trump could have just shut up and let the storm pass .
but he didn t and he got taken to the woodshed for it.as we all know by now , the republican nominee posted a anti-hillary meme on twitter that included the star of david .
the meme has been traced to a white supremacist board on the internet that serves as a meeting place for neo-nazis.after much national outrage , trump removed the meme and replaced it with the same meme except a circle was substituted in place of the star.trump should have simply kept quiet and moved on to let the outcry die down .
eventually , everyone else probably would have moved on as well .
but trump just refused to let it go and took to twitter to defend the meme on monday morning by blaming the media for the outrage.dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the star of david rather than a sheriff s star , or plain star !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) july 4 , 2016two days after removing the original meme amid charges of anti-semitism , trump is now claiming that the star was simply a plain old sheriff s star .
and twitter did not buy that bullshit at all .
.
