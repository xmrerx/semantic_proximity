With everything going on at Donald Trump rallies lately, it was only a matter of time before Saturday Night Live took notice and included it in one of their sketches.
However, they took it one step further and perfectly wove Dr. Ben Carson s endorsement of Trump into this past Saturday s cold open.Jay Pharoah appears as Carson and says: Donald and I are very different.
We re like night and day.
Ebony and orangey.
But he backs The Donald nonetheless and leaves the stage only to moments later reappear with a Trump steak over one of his eyes.
This is when Darrell Hammond as Trump says to the crowd: Guys, what did I say?
Not this one.
This is one of the good ones!
Clearly insinuating that Carson was beat up because he was black and his supporters mistook him as one of the many protesters getting beat up recently at Trump rallies.The racism and violence coming out of the Trump campaign is utterly abhorrent.
Trump himself is not only condoning it, but offering to pay legal fees, and encouraging it.
Kudos to Saturday Night Live for this hilarious satirical spin.
However, the reality of what s going on is no laughing matter at all.
