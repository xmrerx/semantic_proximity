washington ( reuters ) - ketanji brown jackson , a federal trial judge in washington , is being considered to fill the vacancy on the u.s. supreme court , the national law journal reported on friday , citing a lawyer who was contacted as part of the vetting process .
the unidentified lawyer was contacted this week and was asked about jackson ’ s tenure on the u.s. district court for the district of columbia in the context of her being a potential nominee for the supreme court , the journal said .
the lawyer described the conversation , which lasted less than 30 minutes , as a “ preliminary inquiry , ” the journal reported .
the white house did not respond immediately to a request for comment on the journal story .
president barack obama is expected to announce a nominee in the next several weeks to replace justice antonin scalia , who died on feb. 13 .
scalia ’ s death left the court with four liberals and four conservatives , and republican leaders in the senate have vowed to block anyone obama nominates .
the senate must confirm the nominee .
nevada governor brian sandoval , a moderate republican , took himself out of consideration for appointment to the supreme court this week after his name surfaced as a possible nominee .
if nominated and confirmed jackson , 45 , would be the first african-american woman on the supreme court .
she was confirmed to the federal district court in washington in march 2013 .
during her confirmation hearing , she received support from u.s. house of representatives speaker paul ryan , who is related to her by marriage , the journal reported .
jackson ’ s husband , patrick jackson , is the twin brother of ryan ’ s brother-in-law william jackson .
jackson served as a federal public defender in washington and then at a law firm .
in 2010 , she was appointed to the u.s .
