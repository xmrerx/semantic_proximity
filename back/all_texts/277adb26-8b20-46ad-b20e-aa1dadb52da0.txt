Trump continued his attacks on the FAKE NEWS media on Monday night, leveling yet another attack on the Amazon Washington Post over a story they published regarding one of the many things The Donald did to support Russia and in doing so, he appears to have confirmed the existence of a secret CIA program.The story in question claimed that Trump had ended a secret CIA program to train Syrian rebels to fight against dictator Bashar al-Assad.
According to the Post, Vladimir Putin had long wanted to see the program shut down, and doing so reflects Trump s interest in finding ways to work with Russia, which saw the anti-Assad program as an assault on its interests.
The Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad, Trump tweeted.The Amazon Washington Post fabricated the facts on my ending massive, dangerous, and wasteful payments to Syrian rebels fighting Assad .. Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017Trump, of course, didn t dispute the existence of the program just some of the facts surrounding his decision to end it.
Then it was right back to attacking the FAKE NEWS, apparently unaware that he had just revealed classified information:So many stories about me in the @washingtonpost are Fake News.
They are as bad as ratings challenged @CNN.
Lobbyist for Amazon and taxes?
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 25, 2017Is Fake News Washington Post being used as a lobbyist weapon against Congress to keep Politicians from looking into Amazon no-tax monopoly?
