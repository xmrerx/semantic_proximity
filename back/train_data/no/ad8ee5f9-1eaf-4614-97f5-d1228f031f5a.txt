islamabad ( reuters ) - pakistan s supreme court cleared opposition leader imran khan on friday of accusations of failing to declare assets , but barred his party s secretary general from parliament .
the top court dismissed a petition to disqualify the cricket hero as an mp , months after his rival , former prime minister nawaz sharif , was removed from parliament by the court on similar charges .
no dishonesty or omission can be attributed to ( khan ) .
this petition has no merits and is hereby dismissed , chief justice saqib nisar told the court .
the ruling on khan was hailed as a vindication by his opposition party , pakistan tehreek-e-insaf ( pti ) , which will face off against sharif s ruling pakistan muslim league-nawaz in elections next year .
khan had led the legal drive that led to sharif being disqualified in july over unreported income and the opening of a criminal corruption case against the former prime minister .
a lawmaker from sharif s ruling party filed a separate complaint late last year alleging khan and pti secretary general jahangir tareen owned offshore companies and had not disclosed their assets .
the supreme court disqualified tareen .
the respondent is declared not to be an honest person .
he ceased to be member of the parliament .
the respondent is disqualified , nisar said of tareen .
pti spokesman naeem ul haq said the party was disappointed with that judgment .
tareen himself was not immediately available for comment .
i gave 60 documents to the supreme court ... nawaz sharif , took 300 billion rupees out of this country which he has to answer for ... and for that he produced only one document , khan said at a press briefing after the verdict was announced .
a senior pml-n leader , miftah ismial , told reuters the party questioned details of the court s ruling , but accepted it as final .
