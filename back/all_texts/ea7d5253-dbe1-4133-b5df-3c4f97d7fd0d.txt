GENEVA (Reuters) - The top United Nations human rights official called on Spanish authorities on Monday to investigate thoroughly and impartially violence linked to Catalonia s independence referendum, and to hold talks to resolve the secession issue.
Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights, voiced concern at Sunday s violence in which hundreds were injured, saying police responses needed to be at all times ...proportionate and necessary.
I firmly believe that the current situation should be resolved through political dialogue, with full respect for democratic freedoms, Zeid said in a statement issued by his Geneva office.
