new york ( reuters ) - the probability that republican front-runner donald trump will win his party ’ s presidential nomination dropped sharply in the past week while the likelihood of a brokered convention to potentially choose another candidate rose , according to online predictions market predictit .
trump ’ s probability of winning the nomination fell to 44 percent on friday from 67 percent a week ago , according to the website , which is run by victoria university in wellington , new zealand .
for republican rival ted cruz , a u.s .
senator from texas , it rose to 34 percent from 14 percent during the same period .
the probability that the republicans will have a brokered convention to decide the nominee for the nov. 8 election jumped to 69 percent from 43 percent a week ago , according to predictit , an online predictions market where users place money on who they think will win the election .
many users are from the united states .
celebrity businessman trump is facing pressure to take a more serious approach to his presidential campaign from supporters worried that a string of recent missteps and controversial comments may do lasting damage .
a cruz win in tuesday ’ s primary in wisconsin would make it harder for trump to reach the 1,237 delegates needed to clinch the nomination before the republican national convention in july .
if trump does not win enough delegates , then the party faces the prospect of holding a contested , or brokered , convention in which party leaders try to negotiate nominating a compromise candidate .
