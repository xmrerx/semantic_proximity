It s easy to blame the White man that way, you don t have to be accountable for your actions I lived in Oakland [CA] all my life, and the people that robbed my mama at gun-point, when she was just a hard-working immigrant trying to get ahead honestly, it wasn t White, right-wing extremists, it was black and brown people.
Why don t you cheat on your wife and blame her for it?
My hardworking mom was not robbed by "White Right wingers.
