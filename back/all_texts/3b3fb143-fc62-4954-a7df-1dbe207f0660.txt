BERLIN (Reuters) - German parties must be more willing to compromise and take responsibility to form a coalition government because Europe and the world need Berlin as a strong and reliable ally, Parliamentary President Wolfgang Schaeuble said on Tuesday.
Speaking to lawmakers in the Bundestag lower house of parliament after efforts to form a three-way alliance failed, Schaeuble said: Europe needs a Germany that is capable of acting.
The reactions from abroad show that Europe and many other countries in the world are waiting for us.
Schaeuble, a veteran conservative and former finance minister, added: The challenges are huge and just as we ourselves need strong partners, our neighbors also want a reliable partner at their side.
