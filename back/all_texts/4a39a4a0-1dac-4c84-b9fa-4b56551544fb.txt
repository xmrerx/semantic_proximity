Wednesday morning, Donald Trump brought the world to tears (of laughter) by complaining that too much negative covfefe has been directed at him.While the world including the dictionary has no f*cking clue what covefefe is, White House Propaganda Minister Sean Spicer says that Trump knew what he meant.Spicer told reporters at an off-camera press briefing that Trump doesn t make mistakes and he damn sure didn t misspell whatever he was trying to spell when he tweeted about covefefe.Asked if people should be concerned that the president posted somewhat of an incoherent tweet last night, Spicer said no.
The tweet, which stayed up for hours after The Donald sent it out, definitely had meaning to Trump and a few people, Spicer says.
The president and a small group of people know exactly what he meant, he explained.And reporters just laughed at him.
They attempted to get Spicer to let everyone else in on the meaning, but he quickly moved on to other issues because he was backed into a corner.Whatever it means, reporters definitely tossed plenty of covfefe Spicer s way.Listen to it below:Featured image via screengrab
