After the split vote in the Iowa caucus race between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders there has been talk of voter fraud by the Clinton camp.
The video below was posted to CSPAN with a headline that s pretty intriguing.
Please watch the video and tell us what you think A description is below as well:Hillary Clinton arose the winner, but not until a coin-toss gave her one delegate s vote, and a fracas resulted in more delegates for her in precinct #43 in Polk County.An anonymous user uploaded the video to CSPAN, along with the subheadline: Caucus chair and Clinton precinct captain do not conduct actual count of Clinton supporters and deliberately mislead caucus.
After the final totals are announced for Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, three Sanders supporters approach the administrators of the caucus and dispute the tally.They got the big eye roll for asking to recount:View post on imgur.comReddit user cosmicjesus3 broke the accusation down:So basically in the caucus they have to hand count everyone depending on what side they re sitting on.
Well when it came time to do the second count the numbers were off.
The first vote breakdown was like thisFIRST VOTE: 215 Sanders 210 Clinton 26 O Malley 8 Undecided 459 TOTALAnd this is the SECOND Vote: 232 Clinton 224 Sanders 456 TotalSo somehow they lost 3 people but Clinton s vote went up by 14.So basically what had happened was Hillary s team didn t take the time to do a full recount instead she just added the new people who joined the second vote.
Which clearly wasn t an accurate count.
