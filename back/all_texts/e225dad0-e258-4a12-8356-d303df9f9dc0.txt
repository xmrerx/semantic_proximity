Bernie Sanders recently received a major shout-out from one of the most ignored blocs of primary voters in the United States.
Hundreds of people marched through the streets of London on Tuesday, showing their support for the Democratic candidate.
Super Tuesday marked the beginning of The Democrats Abroad Global Primary.
Given the logistics of the global operation, voters will have eight days to cast their vote, with the primary concluding on March 8.Here is video footage of the Londoners for Bernie event:These people will be doing more than just march for Sanders, they plan on voting for him as well.
American expats make a small but very real impact in the Democratic primary race.Speaking to Business Insider UK, former chair of Democrats Abroad UK, Bill Bernard, said: It s a great occasion.
We had a similar turnout in 2008 when it was Hillary Clinton versus Obama.
The turnout was enormous that year and today seems to be equaling that.
Globally, Americans who are living abroad will have 21 delegates representing them at the Democratic National Convention in July.
First they will meet up for a Global Convention in Berlin, Germany on May 14.
Of those, 8 delegates are super delegates.
Despite the media s spin, Sanders is doing very well for himself in the primary election.
The only loss for the campaign on Super Tuesday was Clinton s very narrow win in Massachusetts.
That being said, Sanders entered the race knowing he was in for a long uphill battle against another candidate with global name recognition.
So, for Sanders, every delegate is crucial.According to the London for Bernie website, Sanders is currently beating Clinton globally.
That isn t surprising when you consider the fact that much of Sanders platform could be considered a list of things the United States needs to catch up to the rest of the developed world on.Here is more video footage that shows Sanders supporters chanting feel the Bern.
