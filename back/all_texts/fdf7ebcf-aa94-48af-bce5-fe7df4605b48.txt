WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the House of Representatives tax committee said on Wednesday that achieving a permanent cut in the U.S. corporate tax rate could take “several steps.” Republican Representative Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee which is working to write a tax reform bill, told reporters: “That’s our goal and I think it’s going to take several steps through the process to achieve that.” Brady did not elaborate on his comment but said Senate rules for reconciliation bills were a concern.
Under Senate rules, tax cuts must expire if they add to the federal deficit outside a 10-year budget window.
