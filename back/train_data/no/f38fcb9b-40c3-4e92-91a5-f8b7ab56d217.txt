washington ( reuters ) - the government of niger has approved the use of armed american drones , a u.s. official said on thursday , expanding the u.s. ability to target militants in the region .
reuters had already reported that niger had sought to arm u.s drones against jihadist groups operating on its border with mali , but it had not been previously reported that an agreement had been reached .
an ambush in niger that killed four u.s. soldiers in october has thrown a spotlight on the u.s. counterterrorism mission in the west african country .
the u.s. official , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said the permission for drones had been granted earlier this week but the capability had not yet been used .
what began as a small u.s. training operation has expanded to an 800-strong force that accompanies the nigeriens on intelligence gathering and other missions .
it includes a $ 100 million drone base in the central nigerien city of agadez which at present only deploys surveillance drones .
u.s. forces do not have a direct combat mission in niger , but their assistance to its military does include intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance in their efforts to target violent islamist organizations .
