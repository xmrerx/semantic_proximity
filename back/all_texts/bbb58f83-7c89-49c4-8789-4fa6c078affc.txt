Breitbart News published a story about our 100 Percent FED Up Facebook page being hidden from the Facebook news feed after we began posting several stories a day on the topic of illegal immigration.
After an investigation into our page settings by a Facebook employee, he discovered a core function was missing from our settings.
The function that was missing from our page settings is what allows our page to be seen by a specific audience (or not at all).
It s really quite ironic that the guy who s been doing everything in his power to make illegal alien a dirty word on Facebook, would build a massive wall around his Hawaiian domicile wouldn t you agree?For years, Kilauea, Kauai resident Gy Hall has enjoyed the view of the ocean and the breeze along Koolau Road.
Then, a few weeks ago, a crew started to build a wall which happens to belong to Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg.
The feeling of it is really oppressive.
It s immense, Hall said.
It s really sad that somebody would come in, and buy a huge piece of land and the first thing they do is cut off this view that s been available and appreciative by the community here for years.
Hall said the wall extends along Koolau Road, near mile marker 20, and is about six-feet tall.
He said its projected length and completion are unclear.Multiple attempts by TGI to contact Shawn Smith, former Falk Partners manager, who Hall says sold some of the $200 million, 700-plus-acre property to the billionaire, were unsuccessful Friday Shosana Chantara, a Kilauea resident, voiced her concerns about the breeze that s being obstructed.
It s hot behind that wall.
Because it s up on a berm, there s not a breath of air on this side from the ocean, Chantara said.
You take a solid wall that s 10 or more feet above the road level; the breeze can t go through.
Another Kilauea resident, Donna Macmillan, calls the wall a monstrosity.
