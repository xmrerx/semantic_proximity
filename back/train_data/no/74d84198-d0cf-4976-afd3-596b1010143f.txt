moscow ( reuters ) - a company with ties to an ally of russian president vladimir putin has won the right to develop a prime piece of moscow real estate near the kremlin , two sources familiar with the deal told reuters .
moscow city government auctioned off the plot , which lies on the bank s of the moskva river and includes a number of historic buildings , and it was won by a construction company called gorkapstroy-garant , according to the city .
the two sources , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter , said that the firm represents the interests of businessman gennady timchenko .
reuters was not able to independently verify that timchenko , who has been described by the u.s. treasury department as a member of putin s inner circle , has a financial interest .
a spokesman for the volga group , which groups together timchenko s business interests , did not respond to telephone calls or to an emailed request for comment on thursday .
the plot is a few hundred meters from the kremlin , and some of the buildings on it date back to the 18th century .
under a development plan presented by the moscow city government in august , the winning bidder will preserve and restore historic buildings , turn one of the buildings into a hotel and convert some of the complex into apartments .
timchenko has since 2014 been subject to u.s. sanctions imposed on moscow for its role in the ukraine crisis .
no contact details are listed for gorkapstroy-garant .
its parent company , gorkapstroy , did not respond to a written request for comment .
staff were unable to connect a reuters reporter by phone to gorkapstroy s boss .
the site had been used as a training facility for russia s strategic rocket forces , the arm of the military which operates russia s nuclear arsenal .
it became the property of moscow city a few years ago .
