seoul ( reuters ) - north korea said on thursday that american student otto warmbier had suffered no torture during his 17-month detention , a day after an ohio coroner said he died from lack of oxygen and blood to the brain caused by an unknown injury .
sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for trying to take from his hotel an item bearing a propaganda slogan , the university of virginia student was held by north korea from january 2016 until his release on june 15 .
warmbier died days after arriving in the united states and his parents said that their son had been tortured while in north korea .
north korea had provided medical care to warmbier despite his hostile acts against the country , and claims of torture are groundless slander aimed at opposing the north , north korea s foreign ministry spokesman was quoted as saying by the state-run kcna news agency .
