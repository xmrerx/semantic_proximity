When most presidents in the past have sent a message leading into the new year, they ve sent messages of hope, unity, and a better tomorrow.
Clearly, President-elect Donald Trump is not trying to be like any former leader.Trump s New Year s Eve message, sent via his medium of choice Twitter went something like this: Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don t know what to do.
Love!
Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do.
Love!

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2016This narcissistic message was clearly not about the nation or bringing us to together in any sort of way, but instead throws over half the nation under the bus.However, if one were to redact most of Trump s tweets and just leave the intro and the close, it would sound something like this: Happy New Year to all.
Love!
Redacted, Trump sounds just like Obama!

It actually sounds remarkably like the president we ve had for the past eight years, President Barack Obama.If only Trump could contain his narcissistic animosity towards those who don t like him or agree with him.
However, his fragile ego doesn t seem to make that possible thus his constant Twitter fits of rage against anyone who dare speak against him.Redacted Trump could actually be a good leader.
Unfortunately, he doesn t seem to know how to edit himself for the greater good.
Hopefully that will change.Featured Photo by Chip Somodevilla, Twitter/Getty Images
