tallinn ( reuters ) - french president emmanuel macron said on friday the european union would be weakened if it agreed to discuss its future trading relationship with britain before brexit divorce terms are settled .
if we accept speaking about life after ( brexit ) we will open 27 debates on the future life that are profoundly weakening for the eu .
that s why the chosen method is the good one , macron said when asked why the eu did not soften a negotiating approach that has frustrated london .
