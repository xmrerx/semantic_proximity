It s now no surprise that Donald Trump, the most hated presidential candidate in the field, is the GOP s frontrunner.
It seems being hated is all the Republican Party is good for these days.And there s even better news for Democrats!A new poll from the Pew Research Center shows that the GOP is overwhelmingly hated by the American public and has reached its highest level of disdain since 1992.
According to the poll, 62 percent of Americans have an unfavorable impression of the GOP whereas only 33 percent view it favorably.
American s positive perception of the GOP fell four points in the last six months.The poll also found a very interesting trend: most of the negativity towards the GOP came from self-identified Republicans, where only 68 had a favorable view of their own party an 11 point drop from October.As Trump rises is in the polls, Republicans feelings about their party falls.
What a coincidence.In contrast, 45 percent of Americans had a favorable view of the Democratic Party versus 50 percent who harbored negative views.
Eighty-eight percent of Democrats had a favorable view of the party.Not surprisingly, Independent voters were more favorable to the Democratic Party preferring them 37 to 28 percent than the Republican Party.
As Trump continuously tells the public he s winning with Independents, he certainly hasn t been very successful.
Also not surprising was respondents who were black, female or young were also much more likely to give favorable impressions of the Democratic Party compared to the GOP.When broken down, the poll reminds us of what we already know:White people, in general, are almost identical in how they feel about both parties; 37 percent have a favorable view of both parties, while 59 percent have an unfavorable view of the Democrats and 58 percent for the Republicans.It looks like the two-party system has failed the oppressed whites yet again how sad.Over 2,000 Americans responded to the poll, which was conducted between April 12 to 19 and it has a margin of error at 2.5 percent.Featured image via John Sommers II/Getty Images
