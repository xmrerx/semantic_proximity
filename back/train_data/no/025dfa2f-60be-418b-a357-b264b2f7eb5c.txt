donald trump spent monday pretty much just making an ass of himself on twitter .
after he attempted to intimidate sally yates and tweeted numerous lies about the hearing later in the day , one might assume the donald would take a break .
instead , he took one of those aforementioned lies and blasted it across the top of his twitter profile.the header , as you can see , features the whitest room of people you have ever seen all giving a thumbs up and because he s a narcissist one of his own quotes , which is a lie : director clapper reiterated what everybody , including the fake media already knows- there is no evidence of collusion w/ russia and trump .
naturally , twitter is having a lot of fun with this : never really believed there was collusion between trump & russia .. until he just put that twitter header up .

( @ memattieni ) may 9 , 2017the amazing-or not-thing is that this is * not * what clapper said .
the twitter banner of potus is literally ( & seriously ) a false statement .
https : //t.co/6icn3pivfw david corn ( @ davidcorndc ) may 9 , 2017i wonder what twitter thinks about @ realdonaldtrump putting its logo in his header pic.twitter.com/bxkmvyyeu0 farhad manjoo ?
( @ fmanjoo ) may 9 , 2017clapper did not in any way , shape or form , confirm that there is no evidence of collusion , no matter what the donald s twitter banner says .
clapper explained that he was not aware of any evidence demonstrating collusion , but that he was unaware of the fbi investigation into the administration s dealings with russia until director james comey announced its existence publicly in march .
that s a far cry from no evidence .
the real story the one trump doesn t want you to know is that sally yates confirmed under oath that she warned donald trump general mike flynn was compromised 18 days before trump did anything about it .
we believed that gen. flynn was compromised with respect to the russian , yates said .
to state the obvious , you don t want your national security adviser compromised with the russians .
and she s right.featured image via screengrab
