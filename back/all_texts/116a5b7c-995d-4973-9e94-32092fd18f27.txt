MOSCOW (Reuters) - Accusations that Russia was involved in an explosion in Ukraine s capital that killed two people and injured a member of parliament are baseless and hysterical, the Kremlin said on Thursday.
Beyond all doubt, these are new signs of this anti-Russian campaign which has unfortunately swept across Ukraine and Kiev, Russian President Vladimir Putin s spokesman Dmitry Peskov told a conference call with reporters.
Ihor Mosiychuk, a Ukrainian lawmaker, was wounded in the explosion in Kiev that killed two people.
He blamed Russia on Thursday for the blast that Ukrainian officials called an act of terrorism.
