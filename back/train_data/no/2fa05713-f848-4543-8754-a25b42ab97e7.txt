remember when donald trump said he would debate bernie sanders and then refused to do so when sanders accepted ?
well , now we know how it would have gone.during trump s coronation at the rnc convention , the vermont senator sat back at home and responded to trump s acceptance speech on twitter and the result clearly shows that sanders can wipe the floor with trump on social media or in person.of course , sanders targeted trump s economic proposals in particular , but he also counter-punched the republican nominee on his middle east policy , students loans , the supreme court , and citizens united all while lampooning trump for using other nations to manufacture his products. # rncwithbernie pic.twitter.com/x5nusi6aun bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016 will trump mention climate change , the great environmental crisis of our time ?

# rncwithbernie bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016 we believe in bringing people together , not dividing them up .
bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016trump is wrong .

bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016 trump s big economic plans : give trillions in tax breaks to millionaires , refuse to raise the federal minimum wage .
# rncwithbernie bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016trump s economic plan : $ 3.2 trillion in tax breaks for millionaires , cut programs for low-income americans .
# rncwithbernie bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016 what a hypocrite !
if trump wants to fix trade he can start by making his products in the us , not low-wage countries abroad .
# rncwithbernie bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016fix trade .

# rncwithbernie bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016still waiting for a single word about covering the 28 million americans without health insurance .

bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016 trump : i alone can fix this .
is this guy running for president or dictator ?
# rncwithbernie bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016trump : i alone can fix this .
maybe he doesn t understand that a president has to work with congress .
# rncwithbernie bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016 looks like ted cruz was right about one thing .
trump does not understand what the constitution is about .
# rncwithbernie bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016our movement understands that what we don t need is trump s huge tax breaks for millionaires .
# rncwithbernie bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016 trump thinks climate change is a hoax .
my supporters understand that we must move away from fossil fuels , not expand them .
# rncwithbernie bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016will there be one word about student debt or making college affordable ?
or just concerned about more tax breaks for the rich ?
# rncwithbernie bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016 trump s economic plan : same old , same old trickle-down economics .
pathetic .
# rncwithbernie bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016trump s economic plan : let states lower the federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 an hour , already a starvation wage .
bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016 trump s supreme court nominees would , like scalia , oppose a woman s right to choose , support citizens united and gut the voting rights act .
bernie sanders ( @ berniesanders ) july 22 , 2016bernie definitely made it clear that donald trump is not a viable alternative for his supporters to turn to in the wake of his endorsement of hillary clinton .
sanders understands that trump would be a disaster for this country and going forward a little by voting for hillary is way better than going completely backwards by voting for trump.oh , and it s also pretty clear that sanders kicked trump s ass.featured image via twitter
