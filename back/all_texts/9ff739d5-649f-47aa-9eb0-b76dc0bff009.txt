Donald Trump s pathetic effort to reach out to black voters got even more disgusting on Saturday, and social media took him to the woodshed for it.On Friday, 32-year-old Nykea Aldridge was killed in Chicago after two gunmen opened fire on another man.
She was an innocent bystander who was simply picking up her kids from school.She s also the cousin of Chicago Bulls star Dwyane Wade, who has spoken out repeatedly against gun violence.Wade announced his cousin s death via Twitter, expressing his grief and once again condemning the gun violence that has plagued the city.My cousin was killed today in Chicago.
Another act of senseless gun violence.
4 kids lost their mom for NO REASON.
Unreal.
#EnoughIsEnough DWade (@DwyaneWade) August 27, 2016Wade s mother, a pastor, spoke at the hospital where her niece died.
Just sat up on a panel yesterday, The Undefeated, talking about the violence that s going on within our city of Chicago, never knowing that the next day we would be the ones that would be actually living and experiencing it, she said.
We re still going to try and help these people to transform their minds and give them a different direction, so this thing won t keep happening.
Supporters of Donald Trump, however, used the sad incident as a reason to pander for Wade s support.
@DwyaneWade vote for trump MADAME (@MagicRoyalty) August 27, 2016And the Republican nominee used the tragedy to pander to black voters on Saturday in a desperate move to fix his imploding poll numbers.Dwayne Wade s cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago.
Just what I have been saying.
African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2016Trump literally used this tragedy to declare that black people will vote for him even though he has not specified how he will prevent these shootings from continuing.
Wade and his family have not even had time to mourn their loss and Trump is already politicizing it for personal gain.This is about as sick as politics gets, and to add insult to injury, Trump couldn t even be bothered to spell Wade s first name correctly.And as usual, Twitter was quick to jump all over Trump for his insensitivity and lack of human compassion.
That s an honest question, @realDonaldTrump: what is wrong with you?
You say Clinton just sees black people as votes.
What did you just do?
Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) August 27, 2016Also, @realDonaldTrump, will you be citing all black murders going forward as reasons to vote Trump?
Or just those related to famous people?
Jamil Smith (@JamilSmith) August 27, 2016 @realDonaldTrump You are disgusting.

Trump is sick and disgusting.
Judith Raquel (@GWGMJ30) August 27, 2016 @realDonaldTrump you are so insensitive.
Using the tragic death of a mother of four to draw attention to your campaign .
chuck swirsky (@ctsbulls) August 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump A family s tragedy is not a political opportunity.
Fuck you.
HarleyPeyton (@HarleyPeyton) August 27, 2016Trump even took the original tweet down and posted it AGAIN, this time spelling Wade s name correctly but changing nothing else.
But Twitter continued ripping him a new one.
@realDonaldTrump Not even a thought and a prayer this time?
Sahil Lavingia (@shl) August 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump please stop.

(@MightBeReign) August 27, 2016 @realDonaldTrump You don t realize misspelling his name wasn t the offensive part of that tweet.
I m starting to pity you.
(@MornMoor) August 27, 2016@realDonaldTrump You re not just tone deaf, you re a self-satisfied orange-faced humanity vacuum.
Andrew W Chamings (@AndrewChamings) August 27, 2016Seriously, Republicans should be hanging their heads in shame right now.
This is unforgivable and should make Trump totally unelectable.Featured image via Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images
