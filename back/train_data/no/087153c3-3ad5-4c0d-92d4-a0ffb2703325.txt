paris ( reuters ) - francois compaore , the younger brother of former burkina faso president blaise compaore , was taken into custody by french authorities on sunday in connection with the murder of a journalist , his lawyer said .
the killing in 1998 of norbert zongo , who published burkina faso s independent newspaper , became a symbol of repression during blaise compaore s 27-year rule , which ended in 2014 at the hands of a popular uprising .
before his death , zongo had been investigating the murder of a driver who worked for francois compaore , and his killing triggered violent protests .
francois compaore was arrested at paris s charles de gaulle airport after returning to france from ivory coast , where his brother lives in exile , his lawyer pierre-olivier sur said in a statement .
compaore will appear before a judge within 48 hours , he added .
burkina faso media said he was held on an arrest warrant issued by that country s government .
his lawyer said only it was an international arrest warrant .
french prosecutors could not immediately be reached for comment on the case .
sur said the charges were politically motivated by a burkinabe government unable to get its hands on blaise compaore , whom the ivorian government refuses to extradite despite an international warrant for his arrest in connection with the 1987 murder of former president thomas sankara .
burkina faso s uprising and subsequent elections raised hopes the country would finally reckon with past crimes , but some activists say the government of current president roch marc christian kabore has moved too slowly against former regime members , some of whom serve in the new administration .
authorities opened a trial this week against allies of blaise compaore accused of leading a failed coup d etat in 2015 , including the alleged mastermind , compaore s former spy chief general gilbert diendere .
