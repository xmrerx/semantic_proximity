When they go low we go high -Former First Lady Michelle Obama explaining how Democrats take the high roadSince @dailycaller and @peterjhasson think tweets are worse than putting ppls lives at risk, please show them all the love they deserve Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) May 6, 2017He didn t stop there however, the unhinged Eichenwald kept ranting.
He went on to suggest that people should start dropping dead bodies off at FOX News:With Fox News saying ppl with preexisting conditions exaggerate the impact of no insurance, we should have our dead bodies dropped there.
Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) May 6, 2017His tweets keep getting more and more insane, like this one where he suggests Republican want to kill Americans for tax cuts:I've sometimes wondered if Republicans would even kill for tax cuts.
Now we know.
Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) May 5, 2017Or this one where Eichenwald says Evangelicals who have insurance are Satan :Since Evangelicals are now saying ppl can do w/o insurance because it helps bring them to God, evangelicals w/ insurance clearly love Satan.
Kurt Eichenwald (@kurteichenwald) May 5, 2017Eichenwald doubles down on his visceral hate for anyone who holds an opposing view with this vile tweet, where he confirms to everyone who follows him or reads his tweets that liberalism is indeed, a mental disorder:Millions like me tonight dont know if GOP "health" bill will pass & kill them.
I hope those who vote for it someday face same anguish we do.
