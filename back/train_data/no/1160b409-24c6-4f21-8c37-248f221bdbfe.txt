green party presidential candidate jill stein appeared on msnbc to discuss the north korean crisis .
did anyone really expect her to have anything of value to say on the subject , or is stein being used by the media so viewers will play clips of the incredibly ignorant and hilarious comments stein during the msnbc interview over and over again .
you know , kind of like a cheap marketing campaign.crazy lil kim , and before him , his father , have been flexing their nuclear muscle for years .
there is clearly a dominant crazy gene in that family and to ignore it or pretend they are somehow victims of the us , now that they appear to have nuclear missiles capable of hitting chicago , los angeles or denver would be almost as stupid as green party presidential candidate jill stein.watch : watch : @ drjillstein : north korea has been demonized by us , forced to attain nukes .
