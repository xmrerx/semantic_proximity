moscow ( reuters ) - at least two people died and two were injured on thursday after a part of a nine-storey building collapsed in the russian city of izhevsk , an emergencies ministry official said , after an apparent gas explosion .
the official said there were still some people trapped under debris of the building in izhevsk , which is 1,220 km ( 760 miles ) east of moscow and hosts the plant that manufactures the famed kalashnikov assault rifle .
russia s investigation committee said a natural gas blast appeared to have caused the building collapse .
there have been several similar accidents across russia in recent years due to a poor safety record of gas usage , including in the southern russian city of volgograd in december 2015 where at least five people died .
