Friends of Bill Long-secret emails just caught Team Hillary in another blatant lie namely, the claim that Clinton Foundation donors got no special treatment from Clinton s State Department.
In fact, ABC s case study of the 2010 Haiti-relief feeding frenzy may be the most damning foundation scoop yet.And the foundation isn t even denying it.ABC News got the emails via a Freedom of Information lawsuit.
They show that, after the devastating 2010 Haiti earthquake, a top Hillary aide repeatedly gave special attention to Friends of Bill looking to cash in.Indeed, the aide, Caitlin Klevorick, kept asking foundation official Amitabh Desai to flag when people are friends of WJC William Jefferson Clinton.
Anyone without a special tag (FOB, WJC-VIP) got rebuffed by State and referred to a federal website.State was besieged with requests to get in on $10 billion in aid contracts, described in one government cable as a gold rush.
One FOB, a major foundation donor who d served as Bill s Texas chair, used his pull on behalf of a firm he admitted wanted to get some of the business and had him use the Clinton Foundation as a facilitator.
Klevorick told ABC the special attention was about learning who had a history in Haiti so as to get the necessary resources to the right places as soon as possible to save lives.
One problem: She never asked if anyone had experience in Haiti or even with aid relief.
Her only question: Is this a FOB?
And her only instruction to the foundation was that all FOBs be flagged.
Which is why the Haiti analyst for the nonpartisan Center for Economic and Policy says, The line was pretty faint between the foundation and the State Department.Even if the Clintons follow through on their vow to put disinterested third parties in charge at the foundation, this is a warning of how a Clinton White House would work because political favoritism and corruption are just how Bill and Hillary roll.Via: NYP
