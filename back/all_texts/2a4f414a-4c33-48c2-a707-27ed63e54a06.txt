On Sunday, Republican Senator Ron Johnson was vocal about punishing people with pre-existing conditions.
He suggested that they deserved to have higher premiums because having a preexisting condition is like getting into a car accident.While discussing the Republican health care bill with Meet the Press host Chuck Todd, Johnson thinks that he knows the answer to why insurance companies are abandoning certain markets, but that nobody wants to talk about it.
The Republican from Wisconsin suggested the reason was the Obamacare rules that protected Americans from preexisting conditions, rather than market instability creating by Republicans.
We know why those premiums doubled.
We ve done something with our health care system that you would never think about doing, for example, with auto insurance, where you would require auto insurance companies to sell a policy to somebody after they crash their car.
States that have guarantees for preexisting conditions, it crashes their markets, he continued.
It causes the markets to collapse.
It causes premiums to skyrocket.
Ron Johnson believes that if we treated people more like machines and less like living, breathing beings, the insurance markets would be a lot better off.
