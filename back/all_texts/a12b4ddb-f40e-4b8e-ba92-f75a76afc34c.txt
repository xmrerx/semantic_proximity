Are you a Republican?
Are you tired of trying to figure out which GOP candidate to vote for?
Well, you re in luck because the DNC can totally help you out.The Democratic National Committee created a parody commercial for a dating site service that matches conservative voters with the Republican candidate that best completes them.That s right.
Conservative voters can find their political soulmate on gopHarmony.The ad features a bunch of happy young men and women who are using gopHarmony satisfactorily, complete with testimonials.
I m still looking for that perfect match.
Someone who hates Obamacare just as much as I do!
one woman claims.A man named Dr. Love then appears to comfort conservatives that the site is here to finally help them find a GOP candidate who is just as out of touch with reality as you are.
I wanted to find my match easily without the constant disappointment, another woman says.
I also don t want to let Mexicans and Muslims into the country.
A male gopHarmony user then says he has no idea how the economy works, but that s okay because neither does anyone else on gopHarmony.The ad then lays out the metrics used to determine potential matches, including fear, being too thirsty, misogyny, xenophobia, climate denial, refusal to compromise, watching Fox & Friends unironically, hatred of unions and workers, being allergic to facts, attempting to repeal Obamacare, NRA score, and shutting down the government among many others.
If you re the kind of person that other people don t like being around, then gopHarmony is perfect, Dr. Love declares before concluding by asking viewers to please clap, a clear dig at Republican presidential wannabe Jeb Bush.Here s the hilarious video via YouTube:This video was a perfect shot at the Republicans by the DNC.
Of course, the video didn t paint an entirely accurate picture of the GOP.
After all, there was way too much diversity in it.
That s also something conservatives hate.
