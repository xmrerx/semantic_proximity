abidjan ( reuters ) - more than half a million people have fled ethnic violence in southeastern democratic republic of congo since last year , the norwegian refugee council ( nrc ) said on wednesday , warning that the area is on the brink of a deadly disaster .
four years of clashes between militias representing the luba , a bantu ethnic group , and twa pygmies in tanganyika province have killed hundreds of people and forced thousands to flee into neighboring zambia .
the conflict , which appears to have intensified in recent months , is part of a worsening humanitarian crisis in congo .
militia violence has spiked this year , fueled in part by president joseph kabila s refusal to step down when his constitutional mandate expired last december .
tanganyika is on the brink of a deadly disaster , said ulrika blom , nrc s congo country director , in a statement .
it s a catastrophic cocktail about to blow up .
the united nations declared congo a level three humanitarian emergency last month - the highest possible classification and on par with iraq , syria and yemen .
nearly 4 million congolese are internally displaced .
nrc , an independent aid agency , said that over 80 percent of the people sheltering in displacement sites it visited over the last two weeks in tanganyika do not have access to clean drinking water .
the conflict in tanganyika is driven by inequalities between bantu villagers and the twa , a hunting and gathering people historically excluded from access to land and basic services .
some 600,000 children are also on the brink of starvation in central congo s kasai region , where a local insurrection has killed up to 5,000 people since august of last year , the world food programme s executive director said on monday .
millions died during regional conflicts in eastern congo between 1996-2003 , most from hunger and disease .
