moscow ( reuters ) - six russian long-range bombers struck islamic state targets near the town of albu kamal in syria s deir al-zor province on wednesday , the russian defence ministry said in a statement .
the tu-22m3 bombers took off from bases in russia and overflew iran and iraq before launching the strike , it said .
the ministry said the planes had bombed islamic state supply depots , militants , and armored vehicles and that satellite and drone surveillance had confirmed that all of the designated targets had been destroyed .
it said sukhoi-30sm fighter jets , based at the hmeymim air base in syria used by russian forces , had escorted the bombers while they were in syrian air space and that all the bombers had safely returned to their bases .
russia on tuesday accused the united states of providing de-facto cover for islamic state units in syria and of only pretending to fight terrorism in the middle east .
specifically , the russian defence ministry said the u.s. air force had tried to hinder russian strikes on islamic state militants around albu kamal .
asked about the russian allegations , colonel ryan dillon , a spokesman for the u.s.-led coalition fighting islamic state , said : the russian ministry of defense statements are about as accurate as their air campaign and i think that is a reason for them to start , you know , coming out with their latest barrage of lies .
