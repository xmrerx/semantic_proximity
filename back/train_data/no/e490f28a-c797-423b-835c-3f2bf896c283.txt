ankara ( reuters ) - a turkish court on friday sentenced 25 people , including a former coastguard commander , to life in prison for trying to overthrow the government during a failed coup last year , state news agency anadolu reported .
prosecutors had charged 28 people over incidents at a naval base in the northwestern province of kocaeli on july 15 , the night of the coup attempt .
three suspects were acquitted .
the ankara court named the coastguard commander as hakan ustem .
the trial was one of the first in a series of cases against people accused of involvement in the failed putsch , in which more than 240 people were killed when rogue soldiers commandeered tanks , warplanes and helicopters and attacked state institutions including parliament .
earlier this month , a court found 42 former soldiers guilty of trying to kill president tayyip erdogan during the coup , handing most of them life sentences .
the government blames the network of u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen , a former ally of erdogan , for orchestrating the failed coup .
gulen , who has lived in self-imposed exile in pennsylvania since 1999 , has denied involvement and condemned the coup .
