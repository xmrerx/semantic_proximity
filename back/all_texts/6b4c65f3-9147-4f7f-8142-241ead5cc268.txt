It wasn t too long ago that Donald Trump deeply offended China by taking a phone call from Taiwan, violating the One China policy.
Since then, foreign relations under this new failing presidency have been nothing but chaotic and tense and unfortunately Trump is just making things worse.Over the weekend, Trump showed everyone that he s learning absolutely nothing about diplomacy, as he sent another f*ck you to China.
In an interview with the Financial Times published Sunday, Trump warned China that if they don t get North Korea under control, America would step in.
Trump said he is totally confident that the U.S. could handle North Korea s nuclear weapons program without any help.
His words were: If China is not going to solve North Korea, we will.
That is all I am telling you.
China has great influence over North Korea.
And China will either decide to help us with North Korea, or they won t. And if they do that will be very good for China, and if they don t it won t be good for anyone.
Then, he claimed that he could motivate China to move against the North Koreans, yet failed to clarify: I m not going to tell you.
You know, I am not the United States of the past where we tell you where we are going to hit in the Middle East.
This interview also had several other insane elements to it, in which Trump continued to defend his lies about former President Barack Obama wiretapping him and insisted that those false claims were turning out to be true.
However, his comments about China are likely some of the most disturbing to come out of the interview.Trump s timing couldn t be more disastrous, as he is set to meet with Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago club this week which will likely be another opportunity for Trump to disrespect China and put America at risk.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images
