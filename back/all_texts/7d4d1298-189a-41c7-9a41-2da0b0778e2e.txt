Actress Helen Mirren does not have tolerance for misogynist pigs like Donald Trump.
She refuses to put up with it in Hollywood and she definitely doesn t want to put up with it in politics.So during the ELLE Women in Hollywood event in Los Angeles where she was being honored as a legend, Mirren lit into the Republican nominee by informing the audience that she will be the nastiest of all nasty women, a clear reference to Trump s disrespectful remark aimed at Hillary Clinton during the third and final debate last week.
To make you proud that you chose to honor me tonight, I am going to be the nastiest of all nasty women, Mirren declared.After giving women several points of advice which included drinking tips and how to have a healthy happy marriage and a career, Mirren took a final shot at Trump by calling on women to ignore anyone who judges the way you look, especially if he or she is some anonymous miserable creep lurking on the Internet or is a bloated, small-headed dinosaury-handed candidate for President.
Oh, snap!Donald Trump is going to lose what s left of his tiny mind when he hears the way Mirren burned him.Throughout his life and this campaign, Trump has hurled sexist insults at women, seeing them as nothing more than sex objects meant to be conquered by men.
All of these disgusting remarks and his even more disgusting behavior have come back to haunt him in a big way in this election as over 70 percent of women have an unfavorable view of him and are poised to give Hillary Clinton a historic percentage of the women vote larger than what President Obama received in 2008 and 2012.In fact, if just women voted in this election, Hillary would win by one of the biggest landslides in history.The United States of Women vs.
