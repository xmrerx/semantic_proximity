Donald Trump hasn t even been president for a month, and already Americans (and the world) are extremely concerned about the future of this country.
One of those people is Nancy Pelosi, the highest ranking Democrat in the House of Representatives, and she delivered a few stunning comments recently in condemnation of Trump s terrifying choice of Steve Bannon for the National Security Council.Bannon is well-known as a white supremacist, and Pelosi wasn t afraid to call him just that.
While Republicans have sugar coated and flat-out lied when it comes to Trump s disgraceful behavior and choices, Pelosi pointed out the severity of the situation when she blasted Trump for this reckless decision.Stating that she was in full support of GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz s idea to require presidents to pass a mental evaluation, Pelosi said she can t wait until this is actually a reality: What s making America less safe is to have a white supremacist named to the National Security Council as a permanent member while the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs and the Director of National Intelligence are told, Don t call us, we ll call you.
You re no longer permanent members.
It s a stunning thing that a white supremacist, Bannon, would be a permanent member of the National Security Council You probably are aware of this, but I found it intriguing that House Oversight Committee Chairman [Jason] Chaffetz told the Washington Post that he was weighing legislation that, in essence, says that if you re going to have your hands on the nuclear codes, we should probably know what mental state you re in.
I can t wait until he introduces that legislation to be able to join as a cosponsor of that I think it s a very good idea.
We all know that if Trump were required to pass a mental exam, he would be done for.
He lacks the temperament, the intelligence and the focus to make logical, sound decisions and he is far more preoccupied with defending his tiny hands and inauguration crowds than improving the country.
Pelosi is far from alone in being concerned about Trump s mental state most of Americans (and many psychologists) agree that he needs an evaluation, ASAP.You can watch Pelosi s remarks below:Featured image via Win McNamee and Pool / Getty Images
