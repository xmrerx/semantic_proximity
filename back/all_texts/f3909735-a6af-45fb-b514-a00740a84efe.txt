KAMPALA (Reuters) - Uganda is launching a drive against online pornography that critics condemn as a diversion from deeper problems of graft, unemployment and crumbling social services facing President Yoweri Museveni.
The campaign is the latest salvo in a culture war between conservatives fighting what they see as foreign moral influences promoting criminality and a more liberal, often younger population.
This is an invasion, it s Western culture, said Simon Lokodo, a 59-year-old Catholic priest who serves as minister of ethics and integrity.
Over consumption of pornography ... the consequences are very dire, he told Reuters this week.
The government had released 2 billion shillings ($556,000) to his office to combat online pornography.
Some money would go to pornography-blocking software, he said.
Some Ugandans expressed anger at the cost of the ban, saying it served only to divert public attention from failures of President Museveni s government.
Critics of Museveni, who has ruled for 31 years, say he presides over widespread corruption and human rights abuses.
Parliament is considering a removing a constitutional age cap to allow Museveni to serve longer.
He is also widely considered to be grooming his son, a presidential adviser and the former commander of an elite military unit, to succeed him.
Andrew Karamagi, a rights activist and lawyer in Kampala, said he could not understand government obsession with what people watch, who sleeps with whom, how and when , while it struggled to fund social services such as hospitals and schools.
Uganda s only radiotherapy machine broke down last year and hasn t been replaced due to funding shortages.
Drug shortages are common in public hospitals where and in dilapidated public schools poorly-paid teachers often don t show up for class.
The regime ... does not have the moral authority to combat pornography, Karamagi said.
They are themselves an obscenity.
