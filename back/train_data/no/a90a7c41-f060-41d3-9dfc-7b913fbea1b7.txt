( reuters ) - russian cyber security firm kaspersky lab said on thursday that it has expanded its relationship with global law enforcement agency interpol , agreeing to share threat data to help police fight cyber crime .
the company disclosed the agreement as the kremlin dismissed claims by several u.s. newspapers that israeli intelligence officials had determined that russian government hackers were using kaspersky s software for espionage .
the reports were the latest in a series alleging the company and its founder , eugene kaspersky , have close ties to the kremlin .
reuters has not been able to validate those claims .
kaspersky has repeatedly said it has not helped russia or any other government engage in espionage .
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said on thursday the russian government believes the allegations against kaspersky are without merit .
he said that allegations , in articles in the new york times , washington post and wall street journal , were absurd .
the government has not had and does not have any connection to such activity , he said .
the accusations are ungrounded and unproven .
