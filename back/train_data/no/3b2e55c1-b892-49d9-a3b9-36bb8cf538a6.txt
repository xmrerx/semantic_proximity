beirut ( reuters ) - russia proposed a two-day ceasefire on monday in the last major rebel stronghold near the syrian capital damascus , where warplanes killed at least 41 people in two days of air strikes as russian-backed government forces tried to capture the area .
the syrian observatory for human rights , a war monitoring body , said 18 people were killed by bombing on monday and 23 on sunday .
at least 147 have been killed by air strikes and shelling since the syrian army , with russian air power , began the offensive to take the besieged rebel-held eastern ghouta nearly two weeks ago .
the area of densely-populated agricultural land is the last major territory near the capital still held by rebels fighting against president bashar al-assad s government .
across syria , fighters have been driven out of most towns and cities in the past two years since russia joined the war on assad s behalf .
eastern ghouta is also one of several de-escalation zones across western syria where russia has brokered deals to ease fighting .
russia proposed imposing a ceasefire in the de-escalation zone for tuesday and wednesday , interfax news agency reported , quoting the defence ministry .
such measures will ease tension in the western part of the de-escalation zone , general-lieutenant sergei kuralenko , in charge of russia s ceasefire monitoring center in syria , was quoted as saying .
the enclave has been besieged by assad forces since 2012 , but the siege has become far worse in recent months since routes used to smuggle in food were shut .
residents are so short of food that they are eating trash , fainting from hunger and forcing their children to eat on alternate days , the u.n. world food programme said in a report last week .
on monday , 13 shells hit government-held damascus and its surrounding areas , syrian state media sana reported .
four people were injured from a shell that hit the capital on sunday , sana said .
