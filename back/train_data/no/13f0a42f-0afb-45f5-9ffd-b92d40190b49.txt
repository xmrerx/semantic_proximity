we re the ones in pain , hillary .
you re making millions to process it .
we re the ones living it.sorry , simon & schuster may want hillary clinton to write the history , but i m not about to let her re-write it .
no one deserves more blame for the election debacle than hillary rodham clinton.gersh kuntzman goes on to us count the ways:1 .

remember how long it took for her to tell the truth ?
remember how that reminded every voter in america that hillary clinton s first instinct is to lie ?
just like she did when she claimed she had taken sniper fire during a first lady trip to bosnia .
just as she did when she said she never sent classified documents over her private email server.huntzman went on to call hillary out on her email server , her goldman sachs speeches and her pathetic campaigngo to new york daily news for entire story
