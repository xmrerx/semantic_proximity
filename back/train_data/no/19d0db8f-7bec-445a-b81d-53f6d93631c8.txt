copenhagen ( reuters ) - denmark passed a law on thursday that could allow it to ban russia s nord stream 2 gas pipeline from going through its waters on grounds of security or foreign policy .
the measure amends denmark s regulatory framework to allow the authorities to cite security or foreign policy as reasons to block a pipeline .
previously these were not valid grounds for objection .
denmark has been caught in a geopolitical conflict as russia s gazprom and its european partners have sought to build nord stream 2 , a giant pipeline to pump natural gas to germany through the baltic sea , bypassing existing land routes over ukraine , poland and belarus .
the proposed route goes through danish waters , but the pipeline consortium is investigating an alternative route north of the danish island bornholm which would run in international waters and therefore not be impacted by a potential danish ban .
nord stream 2 has already applied for permission in denmark and its application is being assessed at the danish energy agency .
the change to the law will take effect from jan. 1 but apply to applications that have already been submitted .
in june , danish energy and climate minister lars christian lilleholt said he expected the agency to have completed its assessment during early 2018 .
