washington ( reuters ) - democratic senator chris coons on monday announced opposition to president donald trump ’ s supreme court nominee , ensuring democrats can block a u.s. senate confirmation vote to give neil gorsuch the lifetime job .
coons ’ announcement put the number of democrats opposing gorsuch at 41 , the tally needed to use a procedural hurdle called a filibuster that requires 60 votes to allow a confirmation vote in the 100-seat senate .
republicans control the senate 52-48 .
if democrats mount a successful filibuster and block the confirmation vote senate republicans planned to hold on friday , republicans would then be expected to try to change the chamber ’ s longstanding rules to allow confirmation by a simple majority .
trump backs such a move , sometimes called the “ nuclear option . ”
