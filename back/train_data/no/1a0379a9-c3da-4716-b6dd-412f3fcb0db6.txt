i m convinced the freedom from religion group of atheists didn t get enough attention when they were kids .
they re perpetually offended by just about everything .
here s yet another case of them mocking a nativity scene with a childish display and then suing the texas governor when he took it down.texas gov .
greg abbott is being sued by an atheist group over his decision to remove its nativity-scene parody from the state capitol in december.the freedom from religion foundation announced a federal lawsuit against abbott in the western district of texas , austin division , on thursday .
the organization alleges the governor violated free speech , equal protection and due process rights when he ordered the removal of an exhibit commemorating the birth of the bill of rights.the image in question , approved by texas state preservation board , included the statue of liberty , the founding fathers and the bill of rights in a manger .
it was placed in the state capitol dec. 18 , 2015 , and remained there for three days before abbott acted .
mocking the capitol nativity scene is offensive .
i demand the removal of the satirical nativity scene from capitol , abbott tweeted dec. 22 , 2015.the governor also penned a letter to the state preservation board : this juvenile parody violates the preservation board s regulations and should be removed immediately .
the biblical scene of the newly born jesus christ lying in a manger in bethlehem lies at the very heart of the christian faith .
subjecting an image held sacred by millions of texans to the foundation s tasteless sarcasm does nothing to promote morals and the general welfare , abbott said .
to the contrary , the foundation s spiteful message is intentionally designed to belittle and offend , which undermines rather than promotes any public purpose a display promoting the bill of rights might otherwise have had .
