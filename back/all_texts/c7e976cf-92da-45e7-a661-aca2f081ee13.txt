Two Muslim men were shot to death in broad daylight while walking in the New York City borough of Queens on Saturday.
Both men were dressed in traditional Muslim clothing.
One of the men, Ala Uddin Akongi, was a local Imam.
He was killed instantly.
Akongi s aide was shot and severely wounded.
He was taken to the hospital where he died from his injuries.
The gunman is still at large.
Police are not currently treating the double-homicide as a hate crime, as the gunman s motive for the crime is not yet known.The New York Daily News reports that: Imam Alala Uddin Akongi, the married father of three, was a revered religious leader since his arrival in Queens from Bangladesh less than two years ago.
His assistant, 65-year-old Thara Uddin, died about four hours after the attack.The shooter left his victims lying in their own blood just one block from the Al-Furqan Jame Masjid Mosque in Ozone Park, where the two prayed together only minutes earlier.The imam s nephew said Akongi had no problems with anyone in the neighborhood.
Khairul Islam.
A local resident, was quoted as saying that: That s not what America is about.
We blame Donald Trump for this Trump and his drama has created Islamophobia.
Another local, Rahi Majid, said that: I m not sure what kind of an animal would kill that man.
He would not hurt a fly.
You would watch him come down the street and watch the peace he brings.
