united nations ( reuters ) - united nations secretary-general antonio guterres warned on thursday that the violence against myanamar s rohingya muslims in the northern part of rakhine state could spread to central rakhine , where 250,000 more people were at risk of displacement .
guterres told the u.n. security council during its first public meeting on myanmar in eight years , that the violence had spiraled into the world s fastest developing refugee emergency , a humanitarian and human rights nightmare .
we have received bone-chilling accounts from those who fled - mainly women , children and the elderly , he said .
these testimonials point to excessive violence and serious violations of human rights , including indiscriminate firing of weapons , the use of landmines against civilians and sexual violence .
more than 500,000 rohingya muslim have fled to bangladesh in the past month since insurgents attacked security posts near the border , triggering fierce myanmar military retaliation that the united nations has branded ethnic cleansing .
sweden , the united states , britain , france , egypt , senegal , and kazakhstan requested thursday s council meeting .
guterres demanded immediate humanitarian aid access to areas affected by the violence and expressed concern by the current climate of antagonism towards the united nations and aid groups .
the failure to address this systematic violence could result in a spill-over into central rakhine , where an additional 250,000 muslims could potentially face displacement , guterres said .
the crisis has generated multiple implications for neighboring states and the larger region , including the risk of inter-communal strife .
we should not be surprised if decades of discrimination and double standards in treatment of the rohingya create openings for radicalization , he said .
