Trump is going to win in a landslide, but wouldn t it be a delicious irony to see a male Bernie supporter have the power to keep her from assuming a role she stole from his guy several months ago It s the Electoral College that determines the President, not the popular vote.
And the Electoral College is made up of Electors.Usually, the Electoral College is a formality.
Electors vote for whomever won their state.This year, there s a hiccup.
A Democrat Elector in Washington state says he won t vote for Hillary.Washington state is almost certainly going for Hillary.If this man won t vote for Hillary, he could keep her from getting the 270 electoral votes needed to win the Presidency.Here s what he said:Robert Satiacum is a Bernie fan.
He thinks the Democrat primary was rigged.
He thinks Hillary cheated.
So he won t vote for her.Watch Satiacum letting everyone know he s not joking around:The Seattle Times reported: No, no, no on Hillary.
Absolutely not.
No way, said Robert Satiacum, a member of Washington s Puyallup Tribe who had supported Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders as the Democratic presidential nominee.
He had earlier told various media outlets he was wrestling with whether his conscience would allow him to support Clinton and was considering stepping aside for an alternate elector.
But on Friday, he sounded firm, even if the election is close.
I hope it comes down to a swing vote and it s me, he said.
Good.
She ain t getting it.
Maybe it ll wake this country up.
And the Seattle Times says there s another Elector in Washington state who might do the same thing:Bret Chiafalo, a Democratic elector from Everett who is also a Sanders supporter, said he is considering exercising his right to be a conscientious elector and vote for the person he believes would be the best president.
I have no specific plans, but I have not ruled out that possibility, he said.
