Here we go again, folks.
Yet another video has surfaced showing yet another protester getting the shit kicked out of him by Trump supporters, at yet another one of the Republican nominee s rallies.The disturbing incident happened on Monday held at Cumberland Valley High School, in the southern Pennsylvania town of Mechanicsburg.
The protester was carrying a sign when suddenly he was attacked.
Rally goers ganged up on him and were shoving him, punching him, and kicking him while they chanted USA!
USA!
Finally, a couple men do step in and help to break up the melee while waiting for police to come and escort the protester out of the rally.Silver Spring Police Chief Chris Raubenstine said that regardless of differing opinions violence is never the answer.
People got to realize that just because you disagree with someone, doesn t mean you can punch people.
The protester, who remains unnamed, refused medical treatment and declined to file a police report, although he does have the option to do so at a later date.Sadly, violence at Trump rallies has become commonplace and it is hardly unusual for a protester to be viciously attacked by supporters of the GOP nominee.You can watch the video of this latest incident here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AOXbEwlGYCs]Featured image via video screen shot
