washington ( reuters ) - michigan legislators need to pass legislation quickly to overhaul detroit ’ s beleaguered public schools before courts intervene , the state ’ s governor said on friday .
republican rick snyder said he is still pushing a plan for the school system that he offered last year that he said would provide $ 700 million to deal with the schools ’ massive debt and make other investments .
“ i need legislative support , ” he told msnbc in an interview .
“ i ’ ve asked the legislature to do that and i want to get that done before we have court intervention in the situation. ” snyder spokesman dave murray said municipal bankruptcy is not an option the state wants for the detroit public schools , although snyder would have the ultimate say on whether the district could head to federal bankruptcy court .
snyder ’ s plea for action comes after teachers ’ protests closed nearly all detroit schools this week .
all but nine of the district ’ s 97 schools closed because of the teachers ’ sickout on wednesday over complaints about low pay and crumbling infrastructure .
detroit ’ s schools , like the city , have suffered from financial hardship that has shaken the region in recent years .
the schools now are run under state oversight .
declining enrollment as well as heavy pension and debt obligations have left the district strapped for cash and it could run out of money as soon as april .
bills were introduced earlier this month in the michigan legislature to create two entities - the detroit community district to run the schools , and the current detroit public schools to retire debt .
the school system faces an estimated $ 3.5 billion in debt , according to one report from a nonprofit public affairs group , the citizens research council of michigan .
