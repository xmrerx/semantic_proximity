North Korea just blinked With the strong statements from Defense Secretary Jim Mad Dog Mattis and after President Trump s threats of massive retaliation for any new threat against the U.S., NoKo backed off Defense Secretary Jim Mattis gave a quick statement that could be what resonated with NoKo.
He said it s game on if North Korea fires missiles at Guam.
If they shoot at the United States, I m assuming they hit the United States.
If they do that, then it s game on, Mattis said.
I think if they fire at the United States, it could escalate into war very quickly, yes.
That s called war, if they shoot at us.
Mattis then said, Let s not do this, OK, folks?
Let s not start saying, General Mattis said it s war, Secretary Mattis said it s war, War is up to the president, perhaps up to the Congress.
The bottom line is we will defend the country from an attack.
It s not that I m over here, you know, Dr. Strangelove, you know, doing things like that, OK?
Mattis made the point that he would know within minutes if a missile was fired towards the U.S.
He said, We ll take it out.
You don t shoot at people in this world, unless you want to bear the consequences.
OK?
All right.
THERE YOU GO!
THIS IS A VERY STRONG REBUKE TO THE THREATS AND IT SEEMS TO HAVE WORKED.
