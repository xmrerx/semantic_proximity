At some point, far in the future, former Minnesota Congresswoman Michele Bachmann will learn that she probably should stop expressing her opinion on any matter more complex than which hole does the square peg fit in?
The Tea Party superstar s relevance has fizzled out over the years, with her base either dying off or ending up in prison for one gun-related crime or another but this relic from the Hoveround Revolution still occasionally attempts to cling to her former stardom among the uneducated masses of the nation.
Question: if 45% of Americans pay no federal income taxes, should they be allowed to vote?
she asked.Naturally, anyone whose intelligence is above the level required to operate a toaster without adult supervision mocked her relentlessly: Why don t 45.3 percent of Americans pay federal income tax?
They can t afford it, of course.
Americans are underpaid and undervalued as the upper class continues to find every excuse possible to cut wages and profit off of the backs of those they exploit.
This, of course, doesn t mean that they pay no taxes.
Everyone, including the poor, pays sales tax and a number of others.Bachmann and her Tea Party cohorts view themselves as champions of the Constitution a document none of them, including Bachmann, have apparently read.
Not only does the Constitution guarantee the right to vote, but it is the right mentioned most in the text of the Constitution as total of five times.
The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged is very clear: U.S. citizens get to vote, period.I know, I know, it seems crazy that people like Bachmann are able to grasp the meaning of shall not be infringed as the half of the Second Amendment with which they are familiar is worded, yet are incapable of grasping shall not be denied or abridged.
But there you have it.Featured image via Pinterest
