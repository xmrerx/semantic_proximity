Donald Trump s pride and joy is the tacky, gaudy literal glass tower he lives in, known as Trump Tower.
It, and other Trump structures around the nation and world, are the best indicators of the guy s undeniable and extreme narcissism, so making fun of them is sure to get The Donald s knickers in a twist and that is just what Google Maps did on Saturday.For quite some time during the afternoon, Trump Tower showed up on Google Maps as Dump Tower.
This did not go unnoticed on that bastion of internet trollery, Twitter.

During the election, everyone tried to shame him by painting him as unacceptable, by appealing to the better instincts of the electorate by pointing out his bigotry, misogyny, and other unsavory characteristics.
However, since Trump and his supporters have no sense of shame, that didn t work.
However, they DO have pride.
They can t stand to be disagreed with, and they ESPECIALLY cannot stand to be mocked.
So, keep it up, Google Maps and everyone else.
Mock and troll the hell out of Trump for his entire presidency until his head explodes.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images
