kiev ( reuters ) - the head of the international monetary fund , christine lagarde , said she had a constructive phone call with ukrainian president petro poroshenko late on thursday in which she urged him to speed up the fight against corruption .
perceived backsliding on reform commitments , including delays in establishing an independent court to handle corruption cases , has held up billions of dollars in loans under ukraine s $ 17.5 billion imf program .
action by parliament and prosecutors against existing anti-corruption institutions such as the nabu investigative bureau also provoked a wave of criticism this week from reformists in ukraine and its foreign backers , including the imf .
i had a constructive and open discussion with president poroshenko on ukraine s efforts to fight corruption , lagarde said in a statement .
lagarde said she and poroshenko discussed the need to safeguard the independence of nabu and similar institutions and that they agreed on the urgency of establishing an anti-corruption court .
i assured the president that the imf stands ready to continue to support ukraine , along with other international partners , in the fight against corruption and encouraged the authorities to accelerate the implementation of reforms , she said .
