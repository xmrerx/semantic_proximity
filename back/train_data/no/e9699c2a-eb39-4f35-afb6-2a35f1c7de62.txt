juba ( reuters ) - a south sudanese rebel group on friday accused government troops of attacking their base only a day after the parties signed a ceasefire in a four-year war that has killed tens of thousands of people .
the ceasefire , that would allow humanitarian groups access to civilians caught in the fighting , formally comes into force on sunday morning .
on friday afternoon , a spokesman for the spla-io rebel group said army forces had attacked a rebel base in deim jalab , in the western part of the country .
lam paul gabriel said two rebels and five government troops were killed in the fighting .
the army spokesman in the capital , juba , did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
the war that began in late 2013 in the world s youngest nation has forced a third of the population to flee their homes .
the united nations describes the violence as ethnic cleansing .
earlier this year , pockets of the country plunged briefly into famine .
the latest round of talks in the ethiopian capital , convened by the east african bloc igad , brought the warring sides back to the negotiating table after a 2015 peace deal collapsed last year during heavy fighting in juba .
after the new agreement was signed on thursday , south sudan s information minister michael makuei leuth told journalists : the cessation of hostilities will be effective 72 hours from now .
as of now , we will send messages to all the commands in the field to abide by this cessation of hostilities .
from now onwards , there will be no more fighting , he added .
just talks .
the german foreign ministry welcomed the agreement as an important step toward bringing peace to south sudan .
we call on all participating parties to implement the agreement in a comprehensive and sustainable manner , and to ensure that humanitarian organizations are not hindered in doing their work , a ministry spokeswoman said .
