Hillary has been stirring up the hateful movement Obama, Eric Holder and Al Sharpton started years ago, as a means to encourage blacks to come out to the polls on her behalf on November 8th.
American voters need to ask themselves what kind of a person stirs up hate and division between races for the sake of getting votes?
What kind of person is okay with dividing a nation just to obtain the ultimate power position in politics?
The worst criminal to ever run for President of the United States .Crooked Hillary Clinton that s who.Watch her shamelessly pander to the worst common denominator for votes:Watch Hillary encourage Black Lives Matter terrorists to take their action to a new level:Oh look Black Lives Matter is actually listening to Hillary.
Last night they vandalized one of the most beautiful buildings in Washington DC that just happens to being to Hillary s opponent:Trump's new DC hotel vandalized this morning w/ Black Lives Matter graffiti.
I have a feeling this isn't going to be isolated.
Smh.
