Rapper B.o.B.
has recently gained some notoriety for his theories about why the Earth is actually flat.
I won t get into reasons why the earth is not flat.
It s too ridiculous to even deserve a proper debate.There may be a good chance that this is some elaborate trolling by B.o.B.
because he doesn t limit himself to just thoughts about a flat earth.
He also went on to talk about something called Mark 2 REM driven clones and Synthetic Robotoids, with the suggestion we all look it up.
Well, one person seemed to have looked up B.o.B.
and that was Larry Wilmore of The Nightly Show.
Wilmore took the rapper to task over the tweets that B.o.B.
had sent out, such as the horizon is always eye level, where is the curve?
and Once you go flat you never go back.
A few individuals tried to explain over Twitter why he couldn t see the curvature of the earth while he was physically standing on it, but many more chimed in to defend his crackpot suggestions.
Needless to say, Twitter alone was not taking care of things.That s when Wilmore called in the one and only Neil deGrasse Tyson to explain exactly why B.o.B.
was so wrong.
Not only did NDT set the rapper straight, but he went on a bit of a tirade about how we have developed a culture that is partially accepting of looney theories like this.
Calling it a growing anti-intellectual strain, NDT correctly explained how being wrong becomes being harmful when you are both wrong AND have influence over others.
A direct line can be drawn from his statement to the attitudes of so many famous people today.
All the way from average D-list celebrities to presidential candidates, there is a rather unprecedented uncoolness for knowing things and being well-informed about how the world works.Watch Neil deGrasse Tyson s epic takedown of intentional ignorance below:featured image via video screen capture
