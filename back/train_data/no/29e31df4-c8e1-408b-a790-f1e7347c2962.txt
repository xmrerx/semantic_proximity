lagos ( reuters ) - nigeria s president muhammadu buhari told members of his party before he was first elected that he would only seek one term , implying he did not intend at that time to run in 2019 , the minister of women s affairs told reuters on wednesday .
the comments by aisha alhassan could heighten uncertainty over whether buhari plans to contest the next election .
buhari took power in 2015 but has been absent for much of this year due to illness .
he is yet to say if he will seek a second term .
in 2014/2015 he said he was going to run for only one time to clean up the mess that the ( previous ) pdp government did in nigeria .
and i took him for his word that he is not contesting in 2019 , minister of women affairs alhassan said .
alhassan said in the interview she would resign if buhari seeks re-election and would support former vice president atiku abubakar if he decides to run .
alhassan s portfolio ranks relatively low down in nigeria s cabinet .
abubakar was vice president from 1999 to 2007 as part of the people s democratic party ( pdp ) .
he joined the all progressives congress ( apc ) , buhari s party , in 2014 .
she said buhari made the comments in 2015 to apc members but gave no further details .
the president s two spokesmen declined to comment on the minister s remarks .
buhari , 74 , returned on aug. 19 from three months of medical leave in britain for an unspecified ailment .
it was his second stint of sick leave this year following a break between january and march .
many people say they doubt whether buhari is well enough to serve another term in nigeria , which is africa s most populous country and has the continent s biggest economy .
if today mr. president says he is running in 2019 i will go to him respectfully and thank him for giving me an opportunity to serve and then tell him that i have to resign because my political father may be running , said alhassan .
