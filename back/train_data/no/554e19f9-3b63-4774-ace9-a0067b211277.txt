vienna ( reuters ) - the head of the united nations nuclear watchdog will visit iran on sunday for talks with senior officials there , as opposition from the united states threatens to undermine an international accord to curtail iran s nuclear program .
yukiya amano , the director general of the international atomic energy agency , will discuss iran s implementation of the 2015 agreement , the iaea said on wednesday .
the visit comes during a dispute between washington and tehran over u.s. president donald trump s decision this month not to certify iranian compliance with the landmark nuclear deal between iran and six world powers .
the u.s. congress now has less than 60 days to decide whether to re-impose economic sanctions on tehran that were lifted under the deal , in exchange for restrictions on iran s nuclear activities .
amano , whose agency is in charge of policing those restrictions , has defended the agreement as a net gain for nuclear verification and said iran s commitments under the deal are being implemented .
the iaea did not mention trump s refusal to certify iran was complying with the agreement .
european union leaders have reaffirmed their commitment to the accord , hoping that congress will prevent the deal from collapsing .
iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei has said tehran will stick to the agreement as long as the other signatories do , but will shred the deal if washington pulls out , as trump has threatened to do .
