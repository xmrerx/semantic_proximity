the press has been lying about president trump since day one but it s never been more evident than during the 9-day trip the potus and flotus just finished.the press claimed that melania trump swatted the president s hand away during a walk .
not true ! the press decided that the president manhandled a guest at the g7 when he moved forward to take his assigned spot .
not true ! the latest lie is that president trump chose not to listen and not wear headphones during a speech .
not true ! the big problem with all of this is that the video of trump watching the speech went viral and the tweet making the false claim was retweeted thousands of times .
the retraction was retweeted about 42 times .
fake news and false allegations against our president end up becoming truth to those who read the fake news put out by the main stream media .
in fact , the bbc reporter who put out the video and tweet still has the lie up on his twitter page ! here it is below : a short clip that sums up this g7 summit : look who has chosen not to hear a translation of his italian host s speech # g6 pic.twitter.com/6pxbblfvof james landale ( @ bbcjlandale ) may 27 , 2017frank luntz tweeted out just how important it is when the press lies it becomes truth :
