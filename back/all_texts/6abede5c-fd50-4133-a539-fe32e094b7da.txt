President Trump blasted the fake media (see full interview below) for criticizing his response to Hurricane Maria and said Puerto Ricans actually loved it when he lobbed these beautiful, soft paper towels into the crowd.In a friendly interview with Mike Huckabee for the Trinity Broadcasting Network, Trump said he s done a great job helping Puerto Rico and was just having fun when he started tossing paper towel rolls at hurricane victims.
There was a crowd of a lot of people and they were screaming and loving everything and I was having fun, Trump said his visit to San Juan Tuesday.
They were having fun.
They were saying: throw them to me, throw them to me, Mr. President.
And so the next day they said, oh, it was so disrespectful to the people.
It s just a made up thing.
RESPECT FOR THE WHITE HOUSE President Trump speaks up on why the First Lady wears formal shoes when leaving the White House: Out of respect for the White House, she wants to look good leaving the front entrance of the White House.
So she dresses up and puts on formal shoes, high heels, Trump said of the First Lady s fashion choices.
.
She has sneake rs, in the meantime, so she can change into other clothing when we re walking through where a hurricane is just leaving.
And she took tremendous abuse.
The media will keep up their lies so it makes it even more important for President Trump to get out there and do interviews like this.
The media makes him out to be horrible person by lying about things like the paper towel incident.
He s been great with every problem he s taken on.
