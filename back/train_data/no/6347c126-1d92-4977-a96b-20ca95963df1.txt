ankara ( reuters ) - turkey will retry a lawmaker from the main opposition party after a court annulled his 25-year prison sentence but he will remain in custody , broadcaster ntv and opposition lawmakers said on monday .
enis berberoglu became a symbol for more than 50,000 people detained in the wake of a failed coup in july 2016 .
the chairman of his secular republican people s party ( chp ) started a 425 km ( 265 mile ) protest march from the capital ankara to istanbul when he was convicted and sentenced in june for military espionage .
the court had said berberoglu gave an opposition newspaper a video purporting to show turkey s intelligence agency trucking weapons into syria .
monday s decision to cancel the sentence came from the regional court of appeals , broadcaster ntv said .
berberoglu was the first chp lawmaker to be jailed in a crackdown by president tayyip erdogan s government that has raised concerns among turkey s western allies and rights groups .
more than 150,000 people , including teachers , academics and lawyers , have also been suspended from their jobs .
around 150 media outlets have also been shut and some 160 journalists jailed , the turkish journalists association says .
a prosecutor has called for jail sentences of up to 15 years on terrorism charges for rights activists including the local head of amnesty international , amnesty said on sunday .
critics say turkey is sliding toward greater authoritarianism .
the government says such measures are necessary , given the vast security threats it is facing .
