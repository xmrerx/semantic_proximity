bamako ( reuters ) - mali s president ibrahim boubacar keita , head of a group of five countries in africa s sahel region , has asked the united states to remove a travel ban on chadian nationals , saying that a failure to do so could affect chad s security commitments .
security analysts expressed surprise when chad , a key u.s. security partner since the cold war , was named last week alongside north korea and venezuela as part of an eight-country the travel ban .
chad s army acts as a bulwark against local and regional armed movements and played a critical role in pushing back troops from jihadist group boko haram when they made a bid to expand beyond northeastern nigeria in 2015 .
its troops continue to hold front-line positions in unstable north mali where jihadists ousted government authorities five years ago .
as recently as february , chad , also a key french ally , hosted a u.s. military training exercise for special forces as part of a broader strategy to empower regional troops such as the g5 sahel security bloc consisting of chad , mali , niger , mauritania and burkina faso .
the president of the g5 thinks this decision could affect the commitment of chad , which has until now shown itself to be a key partner in the fight against terrorism in the g5 sahel and beyond , said keita in a statement sent to journalists late on wednesday .
the president ... calls on the authorities to favorably re-examine the matter by lifting the sanctions against chad , he added .
chadian officials expressed surprised at the decision earlier this week , calling it incomprehensible .
the new u.s. measures , which have no end-date , help fulfill a campaign promise president donald trump made to tighten u.s. immigration procedures and align with his america first foreign policy vision .
the white house says the restrictions are the consequences for countries not meeting new requirements for vetting immigrants and issuing visas .
