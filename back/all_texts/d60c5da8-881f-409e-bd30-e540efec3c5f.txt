A spokesperson for the Clinton Foundation claims the group will not return Weinstein s donations, which totaled between $100,000 and $250,000.Because oops!
The Clinton Foundation has already spent the money.
But don t worry, Harvey s dirty money went to very good causes supporting women and children.
And we all know how much Bill loves to take care of women This image by cartoonist Antonio F. Branco, perfectly illustrates just how generous the Clinton s are with their charitable donations.The spokesman said the foundation already spent the money on its programs, such as lowering the cost of HIV medication and supporting women and girls in developing countries.The foundation said it supports commitments to combat human trafficking, and runs the No Ceilings Project which aims to advance the full participation of girls and women around the world through data-driven analysis on gender inequality, an in-depth conversation series, innovative partnerships, and CGI commitments.
The explanation comes after foundation board member Chelsea Clinton ducked questions about Weinstein s money from a DailyMail.com reporter while attending a Clinton Global Initiative University event at Northeastern University in Boston on Saturday.The former first daughter hustled out a side door after the event, evading a reporter as she rushed to her car surrounded by aides and security.The Clinton Foundation and a spokesperson for Hillary Clinton had previously declined to comment on the Weinstein matter.Organizations have been divided on whether to return money to Weinstein, who gave to numerous political and philanthropic causes over the years.
