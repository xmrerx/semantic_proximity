Donald Trump is getting thrashed on the Internet right now for threatening a public university.Milo Yiannopoulos was going to speak at the University of California-Berkeley on Wednesday but the school chose to cancel the event after massive protests broke out on campus against the speech.Yiannopoulos is a racist right-wing bully who hates strong women.
He is associated with the Alt-Right movement that includes white nationalists, Nazis, and white supremacists.As the Southern Poverty Law Center notes,The fact that Yiannopoulos has been photographed wearing a necklace with the German Iron Cross symbol, illustrates the diversity of opinion within the Alt-Right world.
But, at the end of the day, neo-Nazis like Anglin, coat-and-tie racists like Richard Spencer and Jared Taylor, and oddball figures like Yiannopoulos have more in common, in terms of sharing a vision of society as fundamentally determined by race, than they disagree about.The protests against Yiannopoulos forced U.C.
Berkeley to cancel the speech.
And Donald Trump is furious about it.If U.C.
Berkeley does not allow free speech and practices violence on innocent people with a different point of view NO FEDERAL FUNDS?
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 2, 2017That s right, Trump literally just threatened to punish a public university for not letting a racist deliver a speech due to mass protests by students.It s a pathetic and unprecedented attack that Twitter users did not appreciate.
@realDonaldTrump U don t see the hypocrisy in ur statement?
Free speech IS peaceful protesting.
Stop trying to be a dictator.
Kyle McMahon (@KMacMusic) February 2, 2017@realDonaldTrump Don t you try and ban free speech at WH press conferences?
Or is that OK because dictators always have final say?

We need more education.
UCB is great!

First you call journalists fake news.
Now you ll go after universities.
This is how civilisation ends.

@realDonaldTrump has no remorse for refugees from war-torn countries, but is a staunch advocate of a white foreigner who is as vile as him.

@realDonaldTrump Vandalism was wrong but punishing the entire university for the actions of a few is so excessive, like banning a religion!
Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) February 2, 2017This coming from a man who knows all about practicing violence on innocent people w different views, right @realDonaldTrump!

He literally encouraged violence at his rallies but now he is all of a sudden angry about violence at a protest?1,500 people showed up to peacefully protest Yiannopoulos.
It only got violent after 150 masked agitators from an anarchist groups showed up and started attacking people and destroying property.One can hardly blame the university for something that was out of their control.Trump is also a hypocrite for whining in defense of free speech even though he has been attacking the free press and anyone who criticizes him.
Also, hate speech is not free speech.
And hate speech is what Yiannopoulos peddles.Once again, Donald Trump proves that he is out of his depth and is completely unqualified to be president.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images
