WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is withdrawing from UNESCO, the United Nation s cultural and educational agency, effective Dec. 31, the U.S. State Department said in a statement on Thursday.
This decision was not taken lightly, and reflects U.S. concerns with mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization, and continuing anti-Israel bias at UNESCO, the department said, adding that the United States would seek to remain engaged ...as a non-member observer state in order to contribute U.S. views, perspectives and expertise.
