Donald Trump just declared himself a threat to our democracy.During the final presidential debate in Las Vegas on Wednesday night, Republican nominee Donald Trump told moderator Chris Wallace that he will decide on Election Day whether he will accept the results or not.
I will keep you in suspense, he said.Trump s refusal to say that he would accept the results of the debate no matter what has caused a national outcry and concern that his supporters will cause violence and chaos on Election Day if he loses.And Trump only fanned the flames even more on Thursday when he made a stunning declaration that makes it clear how he will react on November 8th if Hillary Clinton wins.
I would to promise and pledge to all of my voters and supporters, and to all of the people of the United States that I will totally accept the results of this great and historic presidential election if I win, Trump said at a rally in Delaware, Ohio.He then pointed at the crowd and they cheered.Here s the video via YouTube.In addition, Trump accused Hillary Clinton s campaign of inciting violence and said hers is truly a campaign that will do anything to win.
This is treason, pure and simple.
Donald Trump just openly admitted that he has no intention of conceding if Hillary Clinton wins the election.
Instead, he vowed to undermine our democracy and unleash his army of supporters upon the nation, the very supporters who have threatened to violently overthrow the government and assassinate Hillary Clinton if their candidate loses.Donald Trump just disqualified himself, and Republican leaders must denounce him and do everything in their power to remove him from the ballot.This kind of rhetoric is dangerous and could very well end up getting people killed, and that is unacceptable in this country.Featured Image: Screenshot
