it s no secret to anyone not living under a rock that there is no love lost between donald trump and rosie o donnell .
it s also no secret that alec baldwin s brutal and spot-on mockery of trump on saturday night live is really getting under trump s skin , and has been for some time now .
however , the ultimate blow came this past saturday night , when snl featured a surprise appearance by actress melissa mccarthy as trump s bumbling , lying , combative press secretary sean spicer .
the portrayal stole the show and went viral.while trump has yet to tweet about it , the word on the street is that what bothered him the most about snl s treatment of spicer wasn t the mockery itself , but rather that spicer was portrayed by a woman .
to trump , that equals making his press secretary look weak.given this perfect storm of facts sure to be causing the notoriously thin-skinned president wannabe to seethe , trump s own favorite social media platform , twitter , has come up with a brilliant way to have snl finally make trump really blow his stack : have rosie o donnell portray either trump himself or even better top trump political strategist steve bannon.bannon is the former head of the white supremacist website breitbart news , and is clearly the one who is in trump s ear and pulling the strings behind the scenes .
to have him portrayed by the woman trump hates most in the world would be epic .
here are just a few tweets on this subject : i 'm begging you @ snl please get rosie o'donnell to play `` president bannon '' over # blotus .
he 'll melt like the wicked witch !

if snl would replace alec baldwin with rosie o'donnell in all of their trump sketches evan peterson ( @ evan_up ) february 7 , 2017america , i promise you : nothing will get steve bannon out of the white house faster than rosie o'donnell playing https : //t.co/ypehukqdgg ( ( ( glenn hauman ) ) ) ( @ glennhauman ) february 7 , 2017 @ davekingthing @ juddapatow snl should have trump in gimp suit with rosie o'donnell as steve bannon holding leash .
hit him where it hurts .
matthew lee myers ( @ themattylee ) february 7 , 2017nothing against alec baldwin , he 's been doing a great job .
but imagine the steam shooting out of trump 's ears if rosie o'donnell plays him .
charles johnson ( @ green_footballs ) february 7 , 2017rosie o'donnell as steve bannon on @ nbcsnl would be incredible .
b ( @ briancharnick ) february 7 , 2017apparently , o donnell herself is game as well : rosie o'donnell has already said yes .
now the ball 's in snl 's court .
@ snl https : //t.co/zbiv0ogdfw emigre80 ( @ emigre80 ) february 7 , 2017ew : rosie o'donnell nominated herself to play donald trump s controversial chief strategist on # snl .
https : //t.co/faeacsuo7r jack merphy ( @ profinvproduct ) february 7 , 2017and that s just for starters , for the trend just started as of this writing .

if rosie plays either trump or bannon , the real trump s head just might literally explode.featured image via frederick m. brown/getty images ( trump ) /jeff kravitz/filmmagic , inc ( o donnell )
