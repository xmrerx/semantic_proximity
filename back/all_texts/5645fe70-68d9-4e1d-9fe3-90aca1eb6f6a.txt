Hillary Clinton has some nerve claiming that the VA scandal was not widespread.
What does she know?
She obviously doesn t know what she s talking about and has offended veterans once again is she calling them liars?
If it s the Republican right wing conspiracy then why is this a bipartisan cause that s using FACTS instead of sweeping criticisms?
This woman has some nerve to make this claim after Dems blocked any help for our military or veterans.The VA scandal that left thousands of veterans on long waiting lists for care while officials received bonuses wasn t a really bid deal according to Hillary Clinton.
She said on MSNBC that it wasn t as widespread as it has been made out to be, and then she went on to blame Republicans for failing to provide the VA with proper funding.
It s all part of some plot to call for privatization.She said the problem is real, but cautioned that it s not been as widespread as it has been made out to be on MSNBC s Rachel Maddow Show on Friday.The former first lady blamed Republicans for using the issue as part of an ideological agenda and said they want the VA to fail.
Now nobody would believe that from the coverage you see, and the constant berating of the VA that comes from the Republicans, in in part in pursuit of this ideological agenda that they have, Clinton said.
They try to create a downward spiral, don t fund it to the extent that it needs to be funded, because they want it to fail, so then we can argue for privatization.
Senate Democrats blocked a bill to fund the VA earlier this month in order to negotiate a larger budget deal.
I m sure she left out the part about her party blocking VA funding so they could spend money on other things.
Never mind that, or how President Obama is holding up a defense bill.
President Obama is engaged in similar hostage taking, having just vetoed bipartisan defense legislation that, among other things, would pay the troops.Via: The Lonely Conservative
