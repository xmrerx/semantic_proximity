united nations ( reuters ) - the united states will vote against a u.n. general assembly resolution on wednesday calling for the lifting of the decades-old u.s. economic embargo against cuba , reversing an abstention by washington last year .
u.n .
ambassador nikki haley will vote against the resolution , introduced annually by havana for 26 years , to underscore president donald trump s new cuba policy , which puts greater emphasis on advancing human rights and democracy , state department spokeswoman heather nauert said on tuesday .
the united states consistently voted against such resolutions for 24 years but abstained for the first time in 2016 as washington and havana forged a closer relationship and reopened embassies in both countries in 2015 .
but tensions have flared recently between the two former cold war foes .
trump said earlier this month he believed havana was responsible for a series of alleged incidents that washington says harmed 24 of its diplomats .
cuban officials investigating the u.s. complaints said last week talk of acoustic strikes was science fiction .
the resolution on wednesday is non-binding but can carry political weight .
only the u.s. congress can lift the full embargo , put in place more than 50 years ago .
the cuban delegation to the u.n. did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
last year , the resolution was adopted by the 193-member general assembly with 191 votes in favor .
israel joined its ally the united states in abstaining .
u.s .
senator patrick leahy , a democrat , led a group of 10 senators urging trump on tuesday to direct the u.s. delegation to once more abstain from voting .
