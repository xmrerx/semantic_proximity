dar es salaam ( reuters ) - tanzania s government on tuesday suspended publication of an opposition-leaning newspaper for three months , the fourth newspaper to be shut down since june in what critics say is a crackdown on press freedom .
the newspaper , tanzania daima , was shut down for publishing an article about the number of tanzanians on life-prolonging anti-retroviral drugs used to treat aids , the director general of the tanzania information services , hassan abbasi , said in a statement .
the article was factually incorrect , abbasi said .
the move comes after president john magufuli warned in january that the days of newspapers his government viewed as unethical were numbered a statement that triggered concern about censorship .
the government banned the critical newspaper mwanahalisi in september for two years after accusing it of inciting violence .
another independent newspaper , mawio , was banned in june over articles linking two former presidents to alleged improprieties in mining deals signed in the 1990s and early 2000s .
magufuli has won some praise from western donors for an anti-corruption drive and cutting wasteful public spending .
but opponents accuse him of increasingly undermining democracy by curbing dissent and stifling free speech .
magufuli has denied opposition accusations that his government was becoming increasingly autocratic .
