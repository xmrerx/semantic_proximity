Hey Robert Mueller!
Do you care to find out which foreign leaders candidate Hillary Clinton spoke with during her campaign?
Because according to Hillary, she received messages from foreign leaders asking her if they can endorse her to stop Donald Trump from becoming President.
I am already receiving messages from leaders.
I m having foreign leaders ask if they can endorse me to stop Donald Trump.
Hillary Clinton, March, 2016Hmmm Is there a tape of candidate Donald Trump like the one of Hillary, where he admits to having discussions with foreign leaders about how to stop Hillary from becoming President?While speaking at a Democratic Presidential Townhall meeting in Columbus, Ohio, in March of 2016, Hillary thought she was rather clever by attempting to make it appear as though Donald Trump was wildly unpopular with all of her foreign connections.
It s too bad the media forgot about this clip:TREASON?
Video surfaces of Hillary admitting she was in contact with foreign leaders interfering in our election!
