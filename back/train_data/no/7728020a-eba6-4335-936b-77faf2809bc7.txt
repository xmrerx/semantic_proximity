the latest video from campus reform shows just how far some college students think universities should go to recognize people s racial identity delusion and all ! the ivy league setting of brown university shows cabot phillips asking students about a hypothetical pocahontas policy that would allow students to self-identify based on race .
overall i think it s a good thing , one student said .
however , that student later said in the video that he feels weird talking about this as not a person of color .
phillips asked , but what if you feel like one though ?
another student answered , it s intended to create uh , you know , an atmosphere of inclusion and support diversity and i don t see anything wrong with that .
if somebody identifies as something it should be their right to , another student said.soooo these college snowflakes choose to live in the land of delusion and call it an atmosphere of inclusion and diversity .
in our day we called it mental illness .via : daily caller
