Now that former reality television star, serial rapist and all-around scammy businessman Donald Trump has won the election, many of his supporters are arguing that it s time the rest of America moved on and accepted him.
However, most of us can t get behind the fact that a racist misogynist is going to be leading the country, and are still speaking out against the president-elect any chance we can get.One of those people is The View s Joy Behar, who gave conservatives the perfect reality check on why she will never stand behind Trump or his hateful rhetoric.
On Friday, Behar railed against Trump and the idea that America must now come together under him and forget every awful thing he s said about women and minority groups during his presidential campaign.This discussion came up as The View s hosts were discussing whether or not left-leaning celebrities should perform at Trump s inauguration.
When co-host Jedediah Bila argued that even celebrities who don t agree with Trump s message should perform for him, Behar strongly disagreed.
Behar brought up the fact that Trump said several divisive, offensive things during his campaign that had a major impact.
She said: I do not forget what he said when he was campaigning!
He insulted every group!
Bila tried to defend Trump, noting that Obama had a hard time winning everyone s acceptance in 2008, but Behar said there was no comparison between a moron like Trump and our great 44th President.
Reminding Republicans that they fought Obama every step of his presidency, Behar said: They obstructed him for 8 years, so why do I have to be so nice?
The resistance that the GOP is facing in regards to Trump is not only a taste of their own medicine, but it is humanity s reaction to a completely unqualified bigot that has just been given more power than he deserves or knows what to do with.You can watch Behar tear into the GOP below:Featured image via screenshot and Drew Angerer/Getty Images
