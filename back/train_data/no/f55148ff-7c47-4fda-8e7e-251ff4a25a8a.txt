moscow ( reuters ) - russian president vladimir putin said on wednesday a complete victory had been achieved over islamic state militants on both banks of the euphrates river in syria .
in comments released by the kremlin , putin said the military operation in the area was now finished , and that the focus would switch to a political process that would eventually involve presidential and parliamentary elections .
putin did not specify whether he was referring to the end of military operations in the whole of syria , or just the areas around the euphrates valley .
russia s military intervention in syria s civil war in 2015 has turned the tide of the conflict in favor of moscow s ally , syrian president bashar al-assad and against rebel groups fighting to oust him .
western governments and rights groups have alleged russian air strikes killed civilians , an allegation moscow has denied .
two hours ago , the ( russian ) defense minister reported to me that the operations on the eastern and western banks of the euphrates have been completed with the total rout of the terrorists , putin said .
naturally , there could still be some pockets of resistance , but overall the military work at this stage and on this territory is completed with , i repeat , the total rout of the terrorists , he said .
we need to ... move , undoubtedly , on to the next stage - the start of a political process .
putin also said it was important to establish the congress of syrian peoples , a proposed peace conference that russia has offered to host , which would lead to the preparation of a new constitution and then presidential and parliamentary elections .
but it is a big and prolonged task , he said .
