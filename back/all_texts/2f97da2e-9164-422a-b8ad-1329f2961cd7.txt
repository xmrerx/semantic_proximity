WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House has signaled to congressional Republican leaders that it has pulled back from U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s threat to shut down the government if a border wall with Mexico is not funded, the Washington Post reported on Friday, citing a senior Republican congressional aide.
Trump promised to build a wall with Mexico on the campaign trail.
He also threatened recently to shut down the government if Congress did not provide funding for the wall.
But shortly after Trump made those comments, White House officials quietly notified Congress that the $1.6 billion would not need to be in a stopgap funding bill meant to fund government operations from October until sometime in early December, a senior GOP congressional aide said, according to the Post.
However, Trump still wants wall funding to be included in the December budget bill, the Post said.
