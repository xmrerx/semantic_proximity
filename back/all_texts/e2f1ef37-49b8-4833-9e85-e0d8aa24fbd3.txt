If you were not ready to give thought to anything other than politics, you are in luck as the campaign for 2020 has already begun.
The Trump/Pence team has already put out its first ad, in which they decry the fake news.
This has caused several of the main news networks to say they will not air the new ad.CNN, ABC and NBC has cited a graphic that shows the words fake news over the faces of a number of anchors.
The rest of the ad is devoted to listing President Donald Trump s accomplishments over the first 100 days that he has been in the White House.
The ad goes on to flame the fake news for not covering everything the president has done since assuming office.All networks that are not running the ad say that it is inaccurate.
ABC News reported that the ad was a personal attack against the network.
The reporters who were targeted by the Trump ad were Rachel Maddow, Wolf Blitzer, Andrea Mitchell, Scott Pelley and George Stephanopoulos.Trump s daughter in law weighed in.
Lara Trump, Eric s wife, said, Apparently, the mainstream media are champions of the First Amendment only when it serves their own political views.
She is working on the president s reelection efforts.The campaign is not just making misleading ads, however.
They are also actively working on donations and are courting high level donors.The ad also lists the problems the campaign has seen with press coverage of the president and his team.
For example, Sean Hannity did a press interview with 60 Minutes and he had a beef with the way they edited the piece.
Another example of fake news coverage was a segment on The Rachel Maddow Show where a copy of the president s 2005 tax return.The ad will run on FOX News and the FOX Business Network.Featured image via the Trump/Pence campaign.
