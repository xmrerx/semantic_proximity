addis ababa ( reuters ) - the speaker of ethiopia s lower house of parliament submitted his resignation on sunday , one of the highest-ranking officials to do so since the ruling eprdf coalition came to power in 1991 .
abadula gemeda did not disclose reasons behind his decision , but said he would disclose the factors once his move was approved by parliament .
analysts in the horn of africa country said abadula , an ethnic oromo , may have decided to step down owing to disapproval of the government s response to unrest that roiled ethiopia s oromiya region in 2015 and 2016 .
the violence there forced the government to impose a nine-month state of emergency that was only lifted in august .
given the existence of circumstances that do not enable me to continue in this position , i have submitted my resignation to my political party and the house of people s representatives , he said in a short speech on national television .
i will disclose the reasons behind my decision once my request is reviewed by the house of people s representatives , the former defense minister added .
the unrest was provoked by a development scheme for the capital addis ababa that dissidents said amounted to land grabs and turned into broader anti-government demonstrations over politics and human rights abuses .
it included attacks on businesses , many of them foreign-owned , including farms growing flowers for export .
in april , a government-sanctioned investigation said 669 people had been killed during one period in the violence and more than 29,000 people arrested
