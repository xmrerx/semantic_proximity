united nations ( reuters ) - russia vetoed on friday a japanese-drafted u.n. security council resolution to extend by one month an international inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in syria , just a day after moscow blocked a u.s. push to renew the investigation .
the mandate for the joint inquiry by the united nations and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) , which was unanimously created by the 15-member security council in 2015 , ends on friday .
syrian ally russia has now cast 11 vetoes on possible security council action on syria since the country s civil war began in 2011 .
the u.n./opcw investigation found that the syrian government used the banned nerve agent sarin in an april 4 attack and has also used chlorine as a weapon several times .
it blamed islamic state militants for using mustard gas .
