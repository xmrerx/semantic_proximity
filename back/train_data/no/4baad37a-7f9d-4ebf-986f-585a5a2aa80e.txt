it was 1991 when trump testified to congress about that irrational exuberance as he complained that monetary policy was pushing money into international markets , while construction was being restricted .
trump said then , watch markets and if housing/building gets too loose , it could be reined in then .
but instead they never reined it in and dem s like raines and gorelick helped push ninja loans and got their bonuses by selling their junk as aaa to average joes .
you create jobs , you create so many other things , incentive has to be put back in to the construction of things that are needed , such as housing trump in 91 .
trump was for keeping jobs in america back in the 1980 s even ;
