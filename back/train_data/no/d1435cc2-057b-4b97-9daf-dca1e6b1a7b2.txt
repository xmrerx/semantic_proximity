dubai ( reuters ) - the deputy head of the palestinian islamist group hamas vowed to keep close ties with israel s arch-enemy iran and to maintain its weapons , iranian media reported on sunday , rejecting israeli preconditions for any peace talks .
hamas , which is designated as a terrorist group by western countries and israel , signed a reconciliation deal this month with palestinian president mahmoud abbas s fatah faction .
undoubtedly , the palestinian resistance forces will never give up ... their arms , the semi-official news agency mehr quoted saleh arouri as saying at a meeting with the iranian parliament s speaker ali larijani in tehran .
israel said on tuesday it would not hold peace negotiations with a palestinian government dependent on hamas and demanded that hamas recognize israel , disarm , and sever its ties with iran .
our presence in iran is the practical denial of the third pre-condition cutting ties with iran , arouri said earlier , quoted by iran s fars news agency .
in august , a hamas leader said that iran was again its biggest provider of money and arms after years of tension over the civil war in syria .
hamas had angered tehran by refusing to support its ally , syrian president bashar al-assad , in the six-year-old civil war .
hamas seeks israel s destruction .
it has fought three wars with israel since seizing the gaza strip from forces loyal to western-backed president abbas in 2007 .
