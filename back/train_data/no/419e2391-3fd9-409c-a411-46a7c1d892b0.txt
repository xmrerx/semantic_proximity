seoul ( reuters ) - south korea s foreign minister will visit japan this week to meet her japanese counterpart , the foreign ministry said on sunday , with seoul and tokyo seeking to boost cooperation over the handling of north korea s nuclear and missile programs .
the need to confront the threat posed by north korea s ballistic missile and nuclear tests comes despite lingering tension over the issue of sexual slavery during japan s wartime occupation of korea .
kang kyung-wha will arrive in tokyo on tuesday and meet japanese foreign minister taro kono during her two-day visit , her first trip to japan as south korea s top diplomat , the foreign ministry in seoul said in a statement .
the two ministers will exchange views on issues of common interests focusing on bilateral relations and north korea-related issues , including its nuclear programme , the ministry statement said .
south korea and japan are seeking to improve security cooperation over north korea , but there have been conflicting signals over whether they can resolve a feud over comfort women who were forced to work in japan s wartime military brothels .
ties have been frozen over the issue , with south korean president moon jae-in has promising to renegotiate an unpopular 2015 pact signed with japan .
under that pact , japan apologized again to former comfort women and promised 1 billion yen ( $ 8.9 million ) for a fund to help them .
the two governments agreed the issue would be irreversibly resolved if both fulfilled their obligations .
