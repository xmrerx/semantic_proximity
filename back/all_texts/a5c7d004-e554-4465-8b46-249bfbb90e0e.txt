WASHINGTON (Reuters) - White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said on Wednesday he expected the U.S. Congress to get tax reform done this year, citing a productive meeting with Republican congressional leaders.
“Yesterday was actually a very good day for us on tax reform,” Cohn said in an interview with Fox News.
“We agreed on the schedule, we agreed on our objectives and we agreed on a time frame.
We’re all on board to do it this year.”
