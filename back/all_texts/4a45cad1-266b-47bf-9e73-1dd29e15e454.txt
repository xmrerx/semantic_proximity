Congresswoman Shelia Jackson Lee joined Roland Martin to talk about the devastation left from Hurricane Harvey.
To get a picture of what s happening in Houston the congresswoman tried to explain at the 2:20 mark that, Many people don t know that we are 50 feet below sea level and are still flooding.
HUH???
WHAAAAT????
Yes, she opened her mouth and removed all doubt she s clueless!FACTS: SEA LEVEL = HOUSTON: Downtown Houston stands about 50 feet (15 m) above sea level, and the highest point in far northwest Houston is about 125 feet (38 m) in elevation.
Land along the Texas Gulf Coast is sinking at the rate of about 2 inches per decade, which may not seem like much.DON T FORGET THAT RACE CARD: 3:45 Martin starts to talk about the black folks Is the storm racist now?Jackson Lee and Martin went on to pull out that race card: Houston neighborhoods have been hit, but a majority of them have been African American neighborhoods that are underwater.
That s where we keep going back to, explained Lee.As of now, Congresswoman Lee wants to, Make sure the President complies and keeps the promises that he made.
That people can return to their lives.
