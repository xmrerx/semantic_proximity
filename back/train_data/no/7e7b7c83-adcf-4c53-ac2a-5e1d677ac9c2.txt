washington ( reuters ) - u.s. democratic presidential candidate bernie sanders announced on friday he had accepted an invitation to the vatican , saying his views on fighting income equality were similar to those of pope francis .
“ i am a big , big fan of the pope , ” sanders said in an interview on msnbc .
“ he ’ s trying to inject this sense of morality into how we do economics ... and we need that absolutely desperately. ” the sanders campaign said in a statement that he would attend a conference on social , economic and environmental issues during the april 15 visit .
sanders , who has made fighting poverty a central issue of his campaign , said he would talk about how to create a moral economy during his visit .
the visit will come four days before the primary election in delegate-rich new york , a state that both sanders and his rival democrat hillary clinton are viewing as home turf and hoping to win .
the announcement of sanders ’ trip came as the pope called for a church that was less strict and more compassionate toward “ imperfect ” catholics .
sanders said he admires the pope for talking about the “ worship of money , the greed that ’ s out there. ” “ there are people who think that bernie sanders is radical , ” sanders said on msnbc .
“ read what the pope is writing . ”
