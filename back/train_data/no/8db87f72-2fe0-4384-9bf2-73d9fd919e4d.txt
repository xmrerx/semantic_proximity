tokyo ( reuters ) - mongolian sumo grand champion harumafuji on tuesday apologized for injuring a fellow wrestler who media said suffered a fractured skull after being hit with a beer bottle in the latest scandal to engulf the closed , hierarchical sumo society .
harumafuji , 33 , hit takanoiwa on the head last month at a party of sumo wrestlers from mongolia , public broadcaster nhk quoted unnamed sources affiliated with the japan sumo association as saying .
takanoiwa , 27 , is not taking part in the 15-day tournament that started on sunday in fukuoka , western japan , due to the fracture , concussion and several other injuries , according to the association s twitter entry .
takanoiwa told the association it would take two weeks for the injuries to heal , nhk and other media said .
the association said harumafuji would sit out the tournament and that it was looking into the matter .
as for takanoiwa s injuries , i apologize deeply for causing trouble for stable master takanohana , people affiliated with takanohana stable , the sumo association and my stable master , nhk showed harumafuji telling reporters .
he declined to give details of the assault , nhk said .
takanoiwa belongs to a stable led by former grand champion takanohana .
the stable master has already reported the incident to police , kyodo news agency said .
it was not immediately clear if harumafuji would be charged .
no one was available for comment at harumafuji s or takanoiwa s stable .
in 2010 , former stable master tokitsukaze was sentenced to fives years in prison for instructing seniors to beat up a novice 17-year-old wrestler .
the same year , grand champion asashoryu , also from mongolia , retired from the ancient sport following a probe into reports of a drunken scuffle in tokyo .
