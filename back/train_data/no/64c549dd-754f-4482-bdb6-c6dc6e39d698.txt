buenos aires ( reuters ) - alberto nisman , the argentine prosecutor who was found dead days after accusing former president cristina fernandez of covering up iran s role in the 1994 bombing of a jewish community center , was murdered , a federal judge said on tuesday .
in a 656-page ruling , judge julian ercolini said there was sufficient proof to conclude that the shot to the head that killed nisman in january 2015 was not self-inflicted .
that marked the first time any judge has said the case was a murder .
fernandez and others had suggested the death was a suicide , but a prosecutor investigating the case last year recommended it be pursued as a murder probe .
nisman s death could not have been a suicide , ercolini wrote in tuesday s ruling , which also charged diego lagomarsino , a former employee of nisman s , with accessory to murder .
lagomarsino has acknowledged lending nisman the gun that killed him the day before he was to appear before congress to detail his allegation against fernandez .
but he has said nisman asked him for the gun to protect himself and his family .
fernandez , now a senator , was indicted for treason earlier this month over nisman s allegations that she worked behind the scenes to clear iran of blame for the attack on the amia jewish center , which killed 85 people , in an effort to normalize relations and clinch a 2013 grains-for-oil deal with tehran .
human rights groups and the former head of interpol have criticized that indictment .
tehran has denied links to the attack .
