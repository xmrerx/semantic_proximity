The New York Daily News is not known for subtlety when it comes to its covers.
The snarky newspaper pulled no punches when it came to using its cover to go after White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for calling concentration camps Holocaust Centers and invoking Nazi butcher Adolf Hitler when talking about Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad.
Wednesday morning s cover reads: Nazis murdered 2.7 million Jews, gassing 6,000 a day in Auschwtiz alone FORGOTTEN BY WHITE HOUSE Here is the image of that cover via New York Daily News Twitter:Of course, The New York Daily News isn t the first to go after Spicer for these remarks.
The Anne Frank Center has called on Donald Trump to fire Spicer, as has House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi.
Further, this is part of a disturbing pattern of anti-Semitism from Team Trump.
During the campaign he regularly retweeted white supremacists, most infamously when he tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton over a pile of money with a Star of David that said, Most Corrupt Candidate Ever.
This tweet caused such an uproar that House Speaker Paul Ryan was forced to speak out about it.
After he was elected, Trump s White House deliberately left any mention of Jewish people out of their Holocaust Remembrance Day statement.
And, of course, no one can forget that we have avowed white supremacists working in the West Wing.To that end, if this administration doesn t want to be called bigots, they need to stop acting like it.
Get rid of the racists, homophobes, xenophobes, and other assorted overtly bigoted people.Don t hold your breath on that one, though.
We ll have four years of this kind of stuff.
The only silver lining may be that in the end, the GOP can no longer say that they don t traffic in bigotry, since it s right there in the White House for all to see, while their party is in charge.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
