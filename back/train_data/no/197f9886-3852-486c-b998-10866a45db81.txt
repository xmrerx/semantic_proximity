one millennial is 100 % fed up !
with her generation .
it all started when millennial alexis bloomer watched an elderly man limping into the post office , and watched two young men walk by him and not even offer to help him .
here s part of what alexis had to say : we re just existing , we re not really contributing anything to society .
our generation doesn t have the basic manners that include no mam and yes mam .
we don t respect our elders .
we don t even respect our country .
we re stepping on our flag instead of stepping up to volunteer .
and we idolize people like kim kardashian and then we shame people like tim tebow .
we re lazy , we re really entitled , and we want to make a lot of money and have free education but we re not really willing to put in the work .
we re more divided as a country than ever before , and i think our generation has a lot to do with it .
everything that used to be frowned upon is now celebrated .
