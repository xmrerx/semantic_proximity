The Whiner-in-Chief humiliated himself again.Trump hates the free press, which is why he is threatening to destroy the First Amendment as soon as he gets in office.
He has accused the media of creating false stories about him even though all the stories he has been whining about are factually correct.
Trump just hates reports that tell the ugly truth about him.In the weeks since winning the election, Trump has told lie after lie on Twitter, the biggest of which was that 3 million people voted illegally, a claim that has been thoroughly debunked.On Monday, Trump literally offered the media a deal.
He says he will stop tweeting so much as long as the media kisses his ass.
In other words, only print stories that make him look good, which is the way dictators use the press.If the press would cover me accurately & honorably, I would have far less reason to tweet.
Sadly, I don t know if that will ever happen!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 5, 2016This is nothing more than a scam by Trump to get the media not to cover up his screw-ups and terrible behavior.
And Twitter users were quick to wreck him for it.
@realDonaldTrump If you were doing your job and not wasting time tweeting nonsense, they d have something positive to cover, Donny.

@realDonaldTrump If by honorably you mean high moral standards, I think that s exactly what the press does, and why you don t like it.
Simon Hedlin (@simonhedlin) December 5, 2016@realDonaldTrump The press is covering you just as you are: a pathetic, spoiled baby who has zero respect among anyone of brains & decency.

(@mrmichaelpersad) December 5, 2016@realDonaldTrump Don t blame the press for your incompetence.It s not that you tweet; it s that you tweet demonstrably false propaganda.
David G. McAfee (@DavidGMcAfee) December 5, 2016@realDonaldTrump You whine more than my two year old cousin.
You re humiliating our country.
Molly Knight (@molly_knight) December 5, 2016@realDonaldTrump you are pathetic and small.
You are going to put the country in danger over your ego Rob Stevenson (@ArtDamagedOne) December 5, 2016@realDonaldTrump from what I see, the press covers you by your own words and actions.
Maybe you should look at the man in the mirror.
Rahul Sood (@rahulsood) December 5, 2016@realDonaldTrump Maybe pay less attention to satire and more attention to The Office of President of The United States.

@realDonaldTrump GET OVER IT AND GROW UP.
You are very insecure.
This isn t a TV show.
#smh David Sugarman (@SugarmanSpeaks) December 5, 2016Indeed, it s time for Donald Trump to grow a pair and start taking the presidency seriously.
We have freedom of the press in this country and he is going to be criticized.
If President Obama had tried to shut down the free press, conservatives would have thrown a hissy fit.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images
