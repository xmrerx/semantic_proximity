berlin ( reuters ) - an iraqi man preacher accused of recruiting fighters for islamic state in syria and iraq , including two believed to have killed more than 150 iraqi soldiers in suicide bombings , went on trial in a german court on wednesday .
four alleged members of the islamist network he had set up also stood trial .
prosecutors say the 33-year-old preacher , identified as ahmad abdulaziz abdullah a. in court documents , recruited at least seven individuals who ended up traveling to the middle east where they fought alongside islamic state militants .
two died in two separate suicide bombing attacks against iraqi army positions in 2015 in which more than 150 soldiers were killed , prosecutors said .
the two recruits , identified as mark and kevin k , joined islamic state in 2014 .
the main suspect , known by the nickname abu walaa , which in arabic means father of loyalty , and the four others a turk , a german , a serbian-german dual citizen and a national of cameroon were arrested in november in raids in the states of lower saxony and north-rhine westphalia .
they have been held in custody since then .
the defendants have chosen to remain silent during the trial .
the men had held religious lessons during which potential recruits were handed radical islamic material , prosecutors said .
prosecutors believe abu walaa preached at the fussilet mosque in berlin , which was attended by a failed asylum seeker who killed 12 people at a christmas market in the german capital last year .
the federal prosecutor essentially accused the suspects of being members of and supporting a foreign terrorist organization , a spokeswoman for the higher regional court in the northern city of celle said .
michael murat sertoez , a lawyer for one of the suspects , said : there will be a lot of protected witnesses who will testify and that is not acceptable for us .
