buenos aires ( reuters ) - forensic scientists have identified the remains of 88 argentine soldiers buried in anonymous graves on the falkland islands after the country s 1982 conflict with britain , the international committee of the red cross ( icrc ) said on friday .
the results were presented to argentine and british delegations , and argentine authorities would inform the families of the soldiers directly and confidentially , the icrc said in a statement .
scientists analyzed 122 sets of human remains in 121 anonymous graves in the darwin cemetery in the south atlantic , an icrc spokeswoman said .
one of the graves , which were all marked argentine soldier only known to god , had two bodies .
the icrc has been interviewing families of dead argentine soldiers since 2012 and 107 have consented to dna testing .
during britain s two-month war to reclaim the falklands , which argentines call the malvinas , 255 british troops and about 650 argentine soldiers died .
the majority of the argentines that perished were on a navy ship that sank .
for us , the process will end when all those who fell are identified , said ernesto alonso , a veteran of the war .
while the south american country still claims the islands , president mauricio macri has adopted a softer tone than his predecessor cristina fernandez .
the two countries signed an agreement last december to try to identify the soldiers and to divide the $ 1.5 million of related costs .
the icrc forensic scientists , and two experts each from argentina and britain , began their efforts in june .
