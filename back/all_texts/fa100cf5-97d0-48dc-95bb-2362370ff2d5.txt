On Thursday night, Vice President Joe Biden joined host Jimmy Fallon on the Tonight Show for the very first time, and he did not disappoint.Biden was his usual charming self, and he continued to captivate the audience throughout the interview, even as he took on a more serious tone when Fallon asked him if he watched the debate between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton on Monday night.
Biden admitted that he had watched, and was baffled that Trump had even been able to make it as far as the debate stage.Fallon also asked Biden about the constant fact-checking that was required whenever Trump opened his mouth, and Biden made the audience erupt in laughter as he said: I ve never quite seen anything like that.
I ve never seen anybody who knew as few facts.
Biden then brought up his own debate against Sarah Palin, which had taken place eight years ago, before going right back to critiquing Trump s pathetic debate performance and character.
In particular, Biden called out the shocking moment that Trump said he was smart for not paying his federal income taxes like the rest of Americans, and advised that it was nothing to brag about.Biden, much like his boss President Barack Obama, is widely loved and respected by the American people, so his criticism is especially damaging to Trump.
Americans should take note when Biden says Trump has caused a lot of worry and tension for America s allies, and is putting the reputation of our country in jeopardy.
Biden said: I ve never known of a candidate who knows as little about the world as this man does.
I don t even think he understands how much damage he does by what he already said.
Biden s right Trump is absolutely clueless and it couldn t have been more obvious after he had to go up against Clinton on Monday.
