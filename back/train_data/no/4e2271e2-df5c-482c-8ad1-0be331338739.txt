dubai ( reuters ) - a senior uae diplomat said on wednesday the arab world would not be led by turkey , the gulf state s first comment on ankara since a quarrel broke out last week over a retweet by the emirati foreign minister that president tayyip erdogan called an insult .
anwar gargash , minister of state for foreign affairs of the united arab emirates , said there was a need for arab countries to rally around the arab axis of saudi arabia and egypt .
the sectarian and partisan view is not an acceptable alternative , and the arab world will not be led by tehran or ankara , he wrote on his official twitter page .
last week , turkey summoned the charge d affaires at the uae embassy in ankara , after uae foreign minister sheikh abdullah bin zayed al nahayan shared a tweet that accused turkish troops of looting the holy city of medina a century ago .
erdogan himself lashed out : some impertinent man sinks low and goes as far as accusing our ancestors of thievery ... what spoiled this man ?
he was spoiled by oil , by the money he has , the turkish leader said at an awards ceremony .
turkey s state-run anadolu newspaper reported on saturday that turkey planned to rename the street where the uae embassy is located in ankara after fakhreddin pasha , the commander of the ottoman turkish troops at medina in 1916 .
medina , the holiest site in islam after mecca , is now in saudi arabia .
the uae sees itself as a bulwark against political forms of islam , and views erdogan s islamist-rooted ruling ak party as a supporter of groups like the muslim brotherhood , which it opposes .
