WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s personal lawyer Michael Cohen said on Tuesday he had been asked to testify on Sept. 5 before the House Intelligence Committee.
“I am committed to complying with the subpoena by the House Permanent Select Intelligence Committee, including the request to testify on September 5th,” Cohen told Reuters, confirming an account first reported by Bloomberg News.
The House committee is among those investigating alleged Russian meddling in the U.S. election and any possible collusion with the president’s campaign or associates.
It approved a subpoena for Cohen on May 31, but the committee had not announced any date for his testimony.
