Caddell s remarks came after hearing Michelle Obama s now infamous comments to Oprah Winfrey:The First Lady was asked by Oprah Winfrey whether she thinks that her husband s administration had achieved his promise of hope for America.
Yes.
I do, she said.
Because we feel the difference now.
See, now, we are feeling what not having hope feels like.
You know.
Hope is necessary.
It s a necessary concept and Barack didn t just talk about hope because he thought it was just a nice slogan to get votes.
He and I and so many believe, what else do you have when you do not have hope?
Caddell continued, The Bush people, they had a certain conduct.
George W. Bush kept his mouth shut about Obama forever.
What s Obama doing saying, I m going to be back here right after vacation.
I need to be in Washington.
I need to comment ?
Where s the part where you gracefully leave the stage?
