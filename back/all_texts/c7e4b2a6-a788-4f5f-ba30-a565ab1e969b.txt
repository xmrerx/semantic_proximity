Hillary Clinton was one of the most hands-on First Ladies this country has ever seen.
From healthcare to childcare, Clinton took the lead in sparking new and necessary debates on a multitude of issues.
She then served, in her best capacity, as Senator of New York.
For two terms, she carved out a bipartisan (yet liberal) ideology that more than a few times caused her to take heat both from the right and the left.As Secretary of State, President Obama s words sum it up best: One of the best decisions I ever made as president.
Even after forty years of public service, fighting for the things that matter (albeit, with some mistakes made along the way), some on the left don t think she s qualified to be President of the United States.Following his own lead, the White House confirmed that President Obama disagrees with some of those on the left, namely Senator Bernie Sanders, and thinks that not only is Clinton unequivocally qualified to be the president, but as deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz puts it to reporters:The president has said that Secretary Clinton comes to this race with more experience than any other non-vice president in recent campaign history.President Obama also added, again, that he was proud of Clinton s service as Secretary of State.Clinton has made building on President Obama s legacy a staple in her campaign.
The White House s praise of Clinton s qualifications is paramount as the heat turns up in New York between her and Senator Bernie Sanders, who faces an uphill battle to win the nomination.Currently, Nate Silver s FiveThirtyEight gives Clinton a 95 percent chance of winning New York.
The White House s praise (and possibly veiled endorsement) could carry weight for Clinton amongst Democrats and left-leaning independents.
Last month, President Obama told Democratic donors to unite behind Clinton, but denied that signaled an endorsement.
