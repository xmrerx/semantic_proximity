LOME (Reuters) - Security forces fired tear gas at hundreds of anti-government protesters carrying out a late night sit-in at an intersection in central Lome as part of a bid to force President Faure Gnassingbe to step aside, witnesses said on Thursday.
The opposition chief said earlier that evening that they would remain seated on the tarmac of the Dekon crossroads until Gnassingbe, whose family has ruled for 50 years, left power.
