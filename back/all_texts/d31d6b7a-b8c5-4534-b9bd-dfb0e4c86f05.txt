There are a lot of people who have a lot to say on the internet about our political process, and especially about the most current election cycle.
Yet, some of these same people are the ones who claim to be above voting, either because they think it doesn t actually matter, or they pathetically just don t remember to do it.These people are called slacktivists.
Individuals who like to complain their little heart away on the internet, but then do absolutely nothing about what they ve been complaining about when it comes to the real world.One person who seems to have had enough of these sorts of people is none other than the Tony Award-winning creator of the Broadway hit musical Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda.Miranda took to Twitter and wrote: Tweeting voting.
Posting a video voting.
Your essay on FB voting.
If you CAN vote and you don t?
You ve done nothing.

If you can take the time to complain nearly every day about politics, but can t take the time to go vote, you ve done absolutely nothing.If you want to actually make lasting change in this nation you need to take the time to vote in individuals who will represent not only your best interests but the best interest of the entire nation and the world.Vote.
Because your vote is your voice that actually makes a difference.Featured Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Tony Awards Productions
