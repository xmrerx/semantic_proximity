tokyo ( reuters ) - japan and the united states are in 100 percent agreement that pressure should be maximized on north korea over its weapons and nuclear program , chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga said on wednesday .
suga , japan s top government spokesman , said this was a stance they had previously affirmed .
he made the comment when asked about u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson s remark that the united states was open to holding direct talks with the rogue state .
tillerson offered on tuesday to begin direct talks with north korea without pre-conditions , backing away from a key u.s. demand that pyongyang must first accept that any negotiations would have to be about giving up its nuclear arsenal .
