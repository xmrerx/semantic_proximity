Well, it happened, folks.
Jon Stewart made yet another triumphant return just in time for the election, and he definitely had a message to share DO NOT ELECT DONALD TRUMP.While making an appearance on The Late Show with his old pal Stephen Colbert, the duo made sure the clear message of making sure Trump loses was front and center.Stewart appeared as the Mayor of Candytown in an effort to get out the vote.The hilarious sketch showed how shocked Stewart was to hear that Trump had, in fact, been elected as the Republican nominee.
Then, when the little orphan in the sketch tried to say she didn t know which nominee was worse, Trump or Hillary Clinton, Colbert and Stewart shouted He s worse!
very loudly in unison.Making a surprise appearance was none other than Broadway s new Hamilton star Javier Mu oz, to again drive the point home to get out and vote.It has become more apparent than ever that pretty much all of sane America knows that Donald Trump cannot be allowed anywhere near the Oval Office.
However, to make sure he s never even remotely near the White House, everyone, and I mean everyone, has to get out and vote!In the meantime, watch all the hilarity go down here:Feature image via video screen capture
