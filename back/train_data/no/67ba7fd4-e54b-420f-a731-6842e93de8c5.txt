brussels ( reuters ) - the european union s brexit negotiator praised on friday the speech of british prime minister theresa may for a constructive spirit in divorce talks with the eu , but said he needed more clarity on what some of her declarations meant .
the speech shows a willingness to move forward , as time is of the essence , michel barnier said in a statement .
prime minister may s statements are a step forward but they must now be translated into a precise negotiating position of the uk government .
barnier , who is conducting negotiations on britain s exit form the eu in march 2019 on behalf of the 27 governments remaining in the bloc , noted may did not address the issue of the future of northern ireland s relations with ireland .
he also said he would need to discuss further may s pledge that britain recognized that no eu country would have to pay more in to the eu budget or receive less from it because of brexit .
we stand ready to discuss the concrete implications of this pledge .
we shall assess , on the basis of the commitments taken by the 28 member states , whether this assurance covers all commitments made by the united kingdom as a member state of the european union , he said .
he said that britain s request for a two-year transition period after it leaves the eu , during which london would still be part of the eu s single market , could be discussed as soon as there was agreement on the principles of the divorce .
