Making an appearance on ABC s The View, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) let the ladies know what she thinks about Trump s latest attacks on her, and what she plans to do about it.Warren explained that the Republican presidential candidates, or for that matter the GOP in general, let Trump walk all over them throughout the primary process.
They let him bully them, and unfortunately for them, it worked.
Warren also explained that by the time they caught on to his strategy of bullying himself to victory it was far too late, and she s not about to let that happen to Hillary Clinton in the general election.
She s speaking up and calling him out now, because there is no time to wait, and there is no time like the present to throw the mud right back in his face.The Massachusetts Senator was also asked about what she thinks of the nicknames given to her by Trump, especially Pocahontas, as well as Scott Brown s call for her to get a DNA test to prove if she is, in fact, part Native American.Warren simply shrugged it off and said she s never used the heritage she was told by her parents that she had to get ahead in life, and that the attacks by both Trump and Brown prove that they ll say and do anything to try to get ahead regardless of facts and reality.As far as her plans for Trump she said: Can they bully me into shutting up?
Nope, not happening.
Rest assured that it seems as if she s going to keep up the battle against the egomaniac all the way through November.Watch Warren explain herself here:.
