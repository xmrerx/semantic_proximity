abuja ( reuters ) - nigeria s atiku abubakar , a former vice president and key ally of president muhammadu buhari , quit the ruling party on friday saying it had failed the people , and a spokesman said he might run in a presidential election due in february 2019 .
abubakar is the first political heavyweight to signal a likely bid for the presidency , which could pit him against 74-year-old buhari , who took power in 2015 but has been absent for much of this year due to illness .
questions over buhari s fitness or willingness to run in 2019 are rife in nigeria , both within and outside his ruling all progressives congress ( apc ) party , which abubakar had earlier quit in an unprecedented public rupture .
divisions within the party have been exacerbated by buhari s recent long absences abroad for treatment for an unexplained ailment and discontent with his administration .
the main opposition is also struggling to maintain unity , according to party members .
in a statement announcing he was leaving the party , abubakar said the apc has failed and continues to fail our people and accused it of a draconian clampdown on all forms of democracy within the party and the government .
a spokesman later told reuters that abubakar , who was nigeria s vice president from 1999 to 2007 and has made numerous unsuccessful bids to become the country s leader , is prepared to run for the presidency in 2019 .
an apc spokesman declined to comment on abubakar s departure .
