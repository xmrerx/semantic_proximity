Ted Cruz s presidential campaign is gaining a reputation of going into the gutter during the Republican primary so far, and it appears that his supporters making media appearances are going there as well.Appearing on Fox Business, Cruz booster Andrea McWilliams argued that especially in light of the recent death of First Lady Nancy Reagan, Republican primary voters should consider the potential first ladies in the field, and went on to attack Donald Trump s wife, Melania.
If Donald trump is elected, Mrs. Trump will be the first first lady that has ever posed nude; the first first lady that s the third wife [of the president]; and the first foreign-born first lady in this century.
She said, by contrast, Cruz s wife Heidi would be the first pro-life first lady.
Taken aback by the claim, host Neil Cavuto pressed McWilliams to expound on her attack.Asked by Cavuto what difference any of it made, McWilliams said it was critically important.
You ve been covering Nancy Reagan, look at what an influencer she was to her husband.
I think posing nude speaks to character, she said.It s also worth noting that McWilliams seemed to be concerned that Melania Trump is foreign born.
She is originally from Slovenia.
She married Trump in 2005, and is his third wife.When she was dating Trump she was still a model, and posed in a nude photo shoot for GQ magazine inside and on Trump s private jet.It s interesting for a Cruz supporter to go this route, as his campaign has been the closest associated with risqu content so far.
A few weeks ago his campaign released an ad featuring an adult film star, and when it was revealed the panicked campaign pulled the ad.
