Sean Hannity went there.
In an argument with Megyn Kelly, he boldly announced that she supports Hillary Clinton.
Donald Trump, with all due respect to my friend at 10:00, will go on Hannity and pretty much only Hannity and will not venture out to the unsafe spaces these days, Kelly said Wednesday a reference to The Donald s mission to avoid any and all press who won t spend all their time together fondling his tiny orange wherever.
These days, that s pretty much just Sean Hannity, so Trump spends a lot of time using Fox News as a platform from which he can scream lies to the Stupid Part of America.Naturally, Hannity was upset that Kelly has a problem with this, tweeting that Kelly supports Hillary Clinton you know, because only Clinton supporters can possibly have a problem with The Donald s actions.
@megynkelly u should be mad at @HillaryClinton Clearly you support her.
And @realDonaldTrump did talk to u. https://t.co/vsQiNMgHut Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) October 6, 2016Naturally, the world mocked his stupidity.
@SusanKnowles @bosseone2 @seanhannity @megynkelly WHY do Trumpites equate not supporting @realDonaldTrump w supporting @HillaryClinton?!?!?

@seanhannity Wait.
So now you re standing on principle?
C mon, Sean!
If you re against @MegynKelly you must be for @maddow.
Own it!
Jordan Gehrke (@jmgehrke) October 6, 2016@seanhannity @megynkelly @HillaryClinton @realDonaldTrump Such a tough guy, Sean!
Did you type this while on your knees in front of Trump?
ginalou (@ginalou) October 6, 2016Clearly Kelly does not support Trump with all that blood coming out of her wherever and all but it is unknown if, and even unlikely that, she actually supports Clinton.
but it doesn t matter.
Facts don t matter to Trump or his basket.
In fact, The Donald s deplorables are already attacking the female Fox host based on an unfounded claim by perhaps the dumbest host on the network:Time to boycott Megyn Kelly's show and support Sean Hannity show.
We the viewers have the power to coax Fox into making a decision Deplorable IXLR8 ?
(@arian0027) October 6, 2016I hate to break it to all 4 of Megyn Kelly's remaining fans, but yes, it is true (and very obvious).
Megyn Kelly is a liberal.
#WakeUpSheep Jeremy Nolt (@RealJeremyNolt) October 6, 2016I can't even watch Megan Kelly anymore.
She sounds like a leftist whining about sexism all the time ?give me break @seanhannity @megynkelly Deplorable Melissa (@sweetatertot2) October 6, 2016@seanhannity @megynkelly An example of a man reacting to a mouthy woman.
Megyn is jealous she's on the wrong side of the people & history Females 4 Trump ??
(@FemalesForTrump) October 6, 2016Whom does Kelly actually support?
Based on her treatment at the hands of Trump supporters, I d say she s probably leaning Clinton.Featured image via Pinterest
