Almost every day, this year s presidential election is becoming more and more like a high school election, or rather middle school, at least on the Republican side.
Empty promises of walls and this and that being thrown all over the place.
They might as well be promising free French fries and all-day recess.
Then there s the name-calling from every direction.
The only thing left, really, would be a food fight at the next debate.Now, we ve officially gotten to the my wife is hotter than your wife part of the election.It all started when an anti-Trump/pro-Cruz group had an ad in Utah featuring Melania Trump in her GQ spread where she was pretty much naked.
Trump, and actually rightfully so, was less than pleased.
However, he responded in the Middle School fashion that we ve now become accustomed to seeing and went directly after Ted Cruz s wife Heidi, claiming he ll spill the beans on her.Taking this ridiculousness a step further, Trump has now retweeted an image that quite honestly screams, look at my wife, she s so much more attractive than your wife.

And Cruz was spot-on with his response to the image.Donald, real men don't attack women.
Your wife is lovely, and Heidi is the love of my life.

So, no matter who, folks vote blue.Featured image via Flickr/Flickr
