Donald Trump just got fined $10,000 for improperly using the atrium of Trump Tower for campaign events, which violated an agreement between Trump and the city that is meant to preserve public space.The public atrium of Trump Tower was repeatedly closed for the Republican nominee s campaign events, which ultimately resulted in an investigation by the New York City Department of Buildings.
In New York City, it is common for buildings to have public atriums.
This is done in an effort to preserve public space as developers continue to build office and residential buildings larger and larger.In June of this year, Trump couldn t be bothered to take the time out of his busy schedule to show up for a court hearing about a bench that was removed from the atrium of Trump Tower.
As a result, he was smacked with a $10,000 fine.According to the Wall Street Journal, the bench in question was part of a public space agreement between Trump and the city.In January, the city ordered Trump Tower Commercial LLC to remove two Trump Store kiosks from the atrium of Trump Tower.
One of these two kiosks sold campaign merchandise and accepted donations to Trump s campaign.The New York City Department of Buildings issued a statement regarding the $10,000 fine.The building owner removed kiosks and replaced a bench that s required to be in the atrium.
However, the owner must still pay the $10,000 penalty levied earlier this year.Trump certainly seems to have a hard time following rules.
As a narcissist, he tends to think that he is above the law and that the rules don t apply to him.
He truly believes that he can just do whatever the hell he pleases.
But it looks like the city of New York thinks otherwise.
Unfortunately, it is unlikely that even a $10,000 bill will help that message to sink in.Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images
