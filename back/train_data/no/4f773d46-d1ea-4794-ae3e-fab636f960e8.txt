mexico city ( reuters ) - mexico will not recognize catalonia s declaration of independence from spain , mexican president enrique pena nieto wrote in a post on twitter on friday evening .
the political turmoil in spain intensified on friday as the madrid government dismissed catalonia s president and parliament hours after the region declared independence .
pena nieto made it clear he will stand beside spanish prime minister mariano rajoy as he confronts the nation s most acute political crisis since it embraced democracy in 1978 .
mexico will not recognize the unilateral declaration of independence of catalonia , pena nieto wrote .
we hope for a political and peaceful solution .
nations including france , germany and the united states have also voiced their support for spanish unity .
spain was plunged into uncertainty on oct. 1 when catalonia , a prosperous northeastern state that accounts for 20 percent of spain s gross domestic product , held an independence referendum , though courts had declared the proceedings illegal .
separatists declared victory despite a participation of only 43 percent .
shortly after the referendum , mexico s foreign minister luis videgaray said in a statement that the country favored a unified spain .
