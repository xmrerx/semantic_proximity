Arizona Senator Jeff Flake can t vote for Donald Trump.
He said so on CNN.
He won t vote for Hillary, either (boo), but he also can t make himself vote for someone as full of pond scum as Trump.
So, true to form, Trump took to Twitter to blast Flake for having the gall to say something so horrible about him:The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2016 The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake.
Sad!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 4, 2016The GOP s former House Policy Chief, Evan McMullin, isn t having any of this at all.
He unleashed a firestorm of tweets in response to Trump over his skin that s as thick as a single layer of gauze.
Nobody who is, or was, a Republican, hits The Donald over the head for his repeated attacks on fellow Republicans better than McMullin just did:.
@realDonaldTrump demonstrates his fragility once again by attacking @JeffFlake, one of America s most courageous leaders.
Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) September 4, 2016 Important leadership truth: Strong, conservative leaders like @JeffFlake unify us while weak, petty men like @realdonaldtrump divide us.
Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) September 5, 2016I refuse to accept a bully president.https://t.co/15zpelBRKf Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) September 5, 2016 .
@realDonaldTrump is a weak, fragile, and petulant man who cannot stomach dissent or criticism.
https://t.co/l0woBG3qwY Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) September 5, 2016McMullin, who linked to a blog post he wrote about Trump in the above tweets, then finished his tweetstorm with this series:This election isn t about me, and at this point it isn t just about who will sit in the Oval Office in January.
https://t.co/nMymQM2C4a Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) September 5, 2016 It s about the character of our nation: who we are and who we aspire to be.
https://t.co/1LGqrmjpVS Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) September 5, 2016It s so important that we not only defeat @realDonaldTrump in November Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) September 5, 2016 but that we stand up, every day, to his unacceptable attacks on our nation s most courageous leaders.
https://t.co/j7DtAyNrSU Evan McMullin (@Evan_McMullin) September 5, 2016McMullin s Twitter profile says he s now an independent candidate for President, but he seems to know that he doesn t have a chance in hell of winning.
He s a Never Trumper, and he praises other Never Trumpers for being Never Trumpers before it was cool.
In his blog post about Trump s ridiculous attack on Flake, he fleshes out some of his tweets a little better: But Donald Trump is a weak, fragile, and petulant man who cannot stomach dissent or criticism.
Even as he promises to be a uniter who will bring the country together, he lashes out against leaders within his own party courageous, principled conservatives like Arizona Senator Jeff Flake.
[emphasis in original post]He s got it right.
Other Republicans and conservatives who can t stomach a Trump presidency have it right, too.
Some will vote for Hillary.
Some will probably vote for Gary Johnson.
But McMullin just put the man with the onion-paper thin skin in his place.Photo of McMullin by George Frey/Getty Images.
