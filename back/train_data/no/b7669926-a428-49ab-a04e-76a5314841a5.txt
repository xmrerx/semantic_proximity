baghdad ( reuters ) - iraqi forces are deploying tanks and artillery south of a kurdish-held area of northern iraq where a section of a kurdish oil export pipeline is located , security sources said on monday .
the buildup is taking place northwest of mosul , an official from the kurdistan regional government s ( krg ) security council said by phone from the kurdish capital , erbil .
an iraqi government security advisor said the fish-khabur area , northwest of mosul , is the location of crossings into turkey and syria that baghdad wants to bring under its control .
but he declined to say if a military move was being prepared .
a pipeline carrying crude across iraqi kurdistan connects to a metering station in fish-khabur before feeding another pipeline that takes the crude to the turkish mediterranean coast for exports .
the military buildup is taking place around rabi a , 40 kilometers ( 25 miles ) south of the fish-khabur , the kurdish security official said .
turkey and iran both support measures taken by the iraqi government to isolate the krg after it held a referendum on kurdish independence on sept. 25 and to bring the kurdistan region s oil exports and land crossings under baghdad s authority .
iraq has shown zero signs of de-escalating , said a statement by the krg security council about the deployment , adding that units being brought to the region include iranian-backed popular mobilisation paramilitaries .
the fish-khabur crossing has been under kurdish control since 1991 , when the united states and western powers imposed a no-fly zone over northern iraq to protect the kurds from saddam hussein s army .
the syrian side of the border in the region is now under the control of u.s.-backed syrian kurdish forces .
