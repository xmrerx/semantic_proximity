21st century wire says just days before the us inauguration , in his recent interview with the times of london president-elect donald trump continues to challenge a number of washington foreign policy sacred cows , particularly neoconservative positions .
he signalled a lifting of us sanctions against russia in the spirit of cooperation in nuclear arms reductions and also to partner with moscow in the fight radical islamist terror .
trump also laid into nato calling it obsolete , while potentially driving a wedge between traditionally tight us-eu relations as he chastised brussels , as well as us ally germany and its leader angela merkel over her country s immigration policy .
they have sanctions on russia let s see if we can make some good deals with russia .
for one thing , i think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially , said trump.regarding a change in sanctions policy , trump added , something can happen that a lot of people are going to benefit .
his off-handed comments on the eu will certainly upset career mandarin europhiles in brussels and berlin too : you look at the european union and it s germany .
basically a vehicle for germany .
that s why i thought the uk was so smart in getting out .
21wire s patrick henningsen spoke to rt international about the policy signalling in trump s interview and what it means going forward .
how long will his rhetorical rebellion will last and will it translate into policy ?
