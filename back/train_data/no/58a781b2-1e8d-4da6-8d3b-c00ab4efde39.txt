republicans need to get a backbone , says former congressman jason chaffetz ( r-ut ) when asked about the testimony of jared kushner before the senate intelligence committee .
every time the democrats say they need to call up jared kushner or donald trump jr. , then call up chelsea clinton , call up the clintons .
https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=md3pma-iz_echaffetz was on fire : there we have an inspector general who issues a report stating an actual crime .
you have bill clinton , the former president , taking millions and millions of dollars from countries that hillary clinton was then going into and doing business .
so every time a democrat says , i got ta talk to donald trump jr. , then go up and bring chelsea clinton in there .
because she was involved in the benghazi situation , she was involved with the foundation .
i mean , when i tried as the chairman of the oversight committee , to bring in ben rhodes to talk about the iran situation , nobody knows what the deal with iran was , they claimed executive privilege .
chaffetz says they would never do this to the clintons and he s right on the money : they would never , ever , ever do this to the clintons .
and that is what is fundamentally wrong with this .
they could have easily , out of all the people in the world they could have easily claimed executive privilege on this one , proximity to the president , it s his son-in-law , he s his closest adviser , he could have easily pulled that off .
but there he is , he s gon na go in there as an open book and they should get a lot of credit for it .
