It is no secret that President Donald Trump likes to call any press coverage that he does not like fake.
This weekend he upped the ante a bit when he did an interview with John Dickerson for CBS s Face the Nation.
Trump took the opportunity to bash the show to the show s host.After Dickerson called Trump out on some of his policy reversals over the course of the first 100 days of his presidency, this exchange happened: It s always a challenge like life itself is a challenge.
It s very funny when the fake media goes out which we call the mainstream media, which sometimes, I must say is you, said Trump.
You mean, me personally?
asked Dickerson Your show, I love your show.
I call it Deface the Nation , but your show is sometimes not exactly correct, said Trump.
