berlin ( reuters ) - a german court sentenced an 88-year-old woman to six months in prison on monday for denying the holocaust and for inciting hatred .
ursula haverbeck , who describes herself as a revisionist historian , said at a public event in january 2016 that gas chambers in auschwitz concentration camp were not real .
a court in berlin found haverbeck guilty after examining a short video of her speech in which she said that she was citing a book , not expressing her own views .
the court , however , found the speech to be her own and gave her six months in prison .
denying the holocaust , in which six million jews were killed , is a crime in germany , punishable by up to five years in prison .
haverbeck , who is avoiding going to jail by appealing the verdict , has faced similar legal cases across germany .
the latest was by a court in north rhine-westphalia last summer when she was given a 10-month prison sentence for the same charges .
