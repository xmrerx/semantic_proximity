amateur president donald trump has avoided doing any real work while only being on the job for just over one month .
the 70-year-old has taken several vacations , though , and his trips to his extravagant resort mar-a-lago have cost the taxpayers dearly .
just after winning the election , trump went on a thank you tour .
later , after taking the oath of office , the thin-skinned alleged president held a rally in florida .
trump needs his ego fed daily .
with abysmally low approval ratings and finding himself plagued with scandals , trump wants his supporters to throw a rally in his honor .
maybe the millions of people who voted to make america great again should have their own rally .
it would be the biggest of them all ! , he tweeted to his 25.5 million followers.maybe the millions of people who voted to make america great again should have their own rally .
it would be the biggest of them all !

: o @ realdonaldtrump steven bonnell ii ( @ omnidestiny ) february 25 , 2017trump launched a war on u.s. intelligence agencies and the press .
it looks like the amateur potus needs a safe place .
@ realdonaldtrump you are the biggest snowflake .
get criticized : hold a rally with your sycophants .

aaron gouveia ( @ daddyfiles ) february 25 , 2017trump is making america embarrassed again .
@ realdonaldtrump maybe next time you should delete a tweet like this and just find someone to hug you instead .
this is embarrassing matthewdicks ( @ matthewdicks ) february 25 , 2017a reminder to the whiner-in-chief .
@ realdonaldtrump this is america .
we do n't have rallies for leaders we 've elected .
that 's why we have elections .

pic.twitter.com/xqt29rjper bernie sanders ( @ sensanders ) february 25 , 2017probably the only good thing about our newly minted alleged president using twitter as his presidential podium is that we can call him out at every turn .
trump unleashes mean-girl tweets to distract the public from what s really going on .
many times he tweets our self-praise while patting himself on the back .
in this case , he has to know that another rally won t make him look presidential but it s a great tool to distract us from what s taking place .
the white house conveniently banned selective members of the press yesterday and that s because of the new reports on his ties to russia.photo by scott olson/getty images .
