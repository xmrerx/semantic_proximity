Rep. Maxine Waters says there s something she wants to talk about: impeachment.During a Sunday afternoon interview, CNN anchor Fredericka Whitfield asked Waters if Democrats were simply playing a game of tit for tat, going after Trump to get even for his role in the racist birther conspiracy surrounding former President Obama and the unprecedented obstructionism of Republicans.Waters said that even if you completely ignore all of that, what Trump has done since he was elected in November has been outrageous and he has not provided legitimate leadership.
She said that she has no doubt that Trump was involved in the latest White House scandal with Devin Nunes, chairman of the House Intelligence Committee.
He has done so many things to show he doesn t understand government, Waters said.
He s not willing to learn.
He doesn t learn from his mistakes.
Instead of learning, he gets up the next morning and tweets something all over again.
Then, the Democratic congresswoman said that what she wants to talk about is this: if we can prove Trump colluded with Russia, then we can kick his orange-hued derriere out of the White House.
We want to know whether or not there was collusion, Waters said.
We want to know about the hacking into the DNC and the interference with our elections.
And I really want to know because I know that if we can prove collusion, then he is impeachable.
A lot of people don t want to talk about that, but I do, she added.Watch Waters talk impeachment here, via CNN:Featured image via video screen capture
