Who is silencing political speech, physically attacking those with divergent views, demanding that every American share one single ideology.
But sadly, the real truth is that these violent agitators have little idea about why they march.
Theirs is a movement with no cause, a temper tantrum with no purpose.
They are a generation lost in space .a propaganda arm of the party of disappointment.
If I were wrong, would Hillary Clinton really be their standard bearer?
These rioters are being manipulated by big government forces who need them to regain political power
