moscow ( reuters ) - former russian economy minister alexei ulyukayev , accused of taking a $ 2 million bribe from rosneft chief executive igor sechin , told a court on thursday he was the victim of a monstrous and cruel provocation .
state prosecutors said the bribe was given last year on nov. 14 in exchange for ulyukayev approving the sale of state-controlled oil company bashneft to rosneft .
ulyukayev denies the charges .
he says he thought the bag holding the bribe was a gift of expensive alcohol .
a monstrous and cruel provocation was carried out against me , ulyukayev told the court in his final statement before it hands down a verdict on dec. 15 .
this trial has aroused public interest similar to that of a circus , he added .
the charges are absurd , the evidence is absurd , and at its base lies the cruelty and impunity of the provocateur .
rosneft head sechin , a witness in the trial and a close ally of president vladimir putin , has not appeared in court , citing work commitments .
russian prosecutors earlier this month sought a sentence of 10 years in jail for ulyukayev .
