The world is eagerly awaiting the testimony of former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates regarding the Trump/Russia connection.
Of course, we all remember how she was promptly fired for refusing to defend Donald Trump and his bigoted administration s unconstitutional Muslim ban.
Afterward, it also came out that Yates warned Trump and others in the White House that then-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn was possibly compromised by Russian operatives.
He was only fired weeks later when it came out that he lied to Mike Pence about his conversations with the Russians.
Now, it seems that the White House has two goals: Smear Sally Yates as some kind of Democratic political hack, and put as much distance as they can between the Trump Administration and Michael Flynn.Now that they cannot stop Sally Yates from telling Congress everything she knows about this Russia mess, it seems that Flynn will be the one to take the fall, and despite his previous loyalty to Trump, the White House is just fine with that.
Perhaps this is why Flynn previously asked for immunity so he could tell Congress what he knows.
Axios reports that the Trump White House strategy to make themselves look squeaky clean in all of this when they are clearly balls deep is as follows:Of course, the point of portraying Yates as some kind of Obama holdover is to make it seem like she s making the case for Trump s impeachment and the indictment of his officials.
She isn t, though.
Sally Yates is a career Department of Justice lawyer who has served under both Republican and Democratic administrations.
Her only loyalty is to the law.This is all just more of the Trump Administration s lies and propaganda, in order to distract from the fact that this Russia mess is getting hotter and hotter by the day.
Hopefully, there is something Sally Yates has to say that will warrant a few arrests starting in the West Wing of the White House.Featured image via Pete Marovich/Getty Images
