shanghai ( reuters ) - china has jailed 21 people for their roles in a deadly fire that killed 39 elderly people at a private nursing home two years ago , state-run xinhua news agency reported on friday .
xinhua said the nursing home in the central henan province had been illegally extended and flammable materials had been used on the extension .
fan huazhi , legal representative for the nursing home , received a prison term of nine years while contractor feng chunjie , who did not have the appropriate work certificate , was sentenced to six-and-a-half years in prison .
the other defendants , including firefighting officers and managers at the nursing home , received jail terms ranging from two-and-a-half to eight years .
reuters was unable to reach fan or feng for comment .
china has had a history of similar disasters as workers are often poorly trained or ill-equipped to protect themselves from accidents .
in january , a fire at another nursing home in northeastern china killed seven people .
