What is it that they don t get?
Does anyone even listen to these inciters of anger and hate?
This is pitiful!WARNING: Profanity/Strong Racial LanguageThis Week on the New Black Panther Party s Black Power Radio, national chairman Hashim Nzinga said since America has declared war on us, evidenced by military police in the black neighborhood protecting the rich, the New Black Panthers should be looked upon as Founding Fathers who declare war and are willing to die or kill to save our babies and to save a black nation that is dying before our eyes.
Nzinga said, America is about protecting the rich and the powerful.
He added, We pay taxes.
They have declared war on us and it s nothing but state racism.
So if we say we are at war, we should be applauded like George Washington, Nzinga continued.
We should be applauded like Thomas Jefferson.
We should be applauded like the Founding Fathers of the country.
This is not the hate hour, this is the love hour, he added.
We have to love ourselves enough to be willing to die or kill to save our babies and to save a black nation that is dying before our eyes.
