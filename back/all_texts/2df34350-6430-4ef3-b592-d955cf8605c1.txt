HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s military detained Finance Minister Ignatius Chombo on Wednesday after seizing power in an attempt to root out criminals around President Robert Mugabe who it said were causing social and economic suffering, a government source said.
Chombo was a leading member of the so-called G40 faction of the ruling ZANU-PF party, led by Mugabe s wife Grace, that had been vying to succeed the 93-year-old president.
