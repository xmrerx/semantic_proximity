we re not sure what s funnier , the fact that he talks about being a pretty good president or that he actually thinks anyone believes him when he says he can t run again because the constitution prohibits it , saying : the law s the law .
when did this president ever let a little thing like the constitution or the law get in the way of his agenda ?
