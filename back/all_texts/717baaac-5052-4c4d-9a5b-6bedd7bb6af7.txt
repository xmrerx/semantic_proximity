Greta van Susteren left Fox News abruptly recently, but she s having a bit of fun trolling the network.
When someone leaves, standard procedure is to redirect their news page back to Fox s own website.
However, they also redirected her personal page, Greta.com.
That s not right she owns the domain.
So she took matters into her own hands and redirected it somewhere else.She redirected it to an animal rescue site called PetsConnect Rescue.
PetsConnect noticed that, and was so grateful for it that they even tweeted a thank-you at her.
Since Fox is right-leaning, and also named after an animal (unless it was named for men s views of women as eye candy), that s punking a little hard.
Animal rights and welfare do not matter to the right at all.Not only that, but on the chance that Fox stole her domain to needle her, and it wasn t an honest mistake, needling them back with a sharp pipe like this seems to be the most reasonable thing to do.Fox News is falling apart at the seams with all of the sexual harassment allegations being thrown at them, and also with Gretchen Carlson s $20 million settlement.
The network also publicly apologized to her, and settled with a handful of other women as well.It also recently came out that they re guilty of hacking into the personal phones of journalists at other news outlets to find out who they were talking to.
In short, Roger Ailes maintained one of the biggest tissues of lies ever: Running his network into the ground and calling it a success.The toilet is too lofty a place to describe the depths to which they have sunk.Van Susteren s website is Greta.com.
Since it s her domain, it will go where she wants it to.
That s her right, and Fox News can go suck it.Featured image by Nancy Ostertag/Getty Images
