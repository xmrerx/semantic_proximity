get this , previously deported mentally ill illegal aliens are being sent back to the u.s. thanks to a judge s decision : federal judge dolly m. gee s ruling will let immigrants with serious mental disabilities request to have their cases reopened in hopes of returning to the u.s .
the ruling covers immigrants deported from california , arizona and washington between nov. 21 , 2011 and jan. 27 this year .
so it s not enough that we have the invasion of central americans and now muslim refugees now the mentally ill get another shot at coming here too !
what kind of insanity ( no pun intended ) is this ? is it any surprise that the aclu brought this case ?
doesn t the aclu have an obligation to look out for legal and law abiding americans first ?
the government identified 900 immigrants who could benefit from the ruling , though there could be more and it s unclear how many would qualify to have their cases reopened , iguina said.now dig deep for this little tid bit of info : under the agreement , the federal government said it will help those with reopened cases return to the u.s. and pay for some transportation costs .
doesn t this just make you want to stop paying taxes altogether ?
why should we pay for these people to come back over our border when they broke the law the first time ?
