The jury discussed the culpable negligence for the manslaughter requirement, he said.
Eventually, the two unconvinced came to agree to acquit Yanez.Yanez shot Castile seven times after he pulled him over for a broken tail light.
Yanez claimed that Castile was reaching for his gun, although prosecution argued that Yanez acted too hastily in the exchange.
