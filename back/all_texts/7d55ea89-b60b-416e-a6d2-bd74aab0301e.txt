Last week, Oregon Judge Steve Grasty issued a statement that could be summed up as Geddafugouttahere!
The statement was directed to head Domestic Terrorist Cliven Bundy who s been overcome with delusions of power.
Bundy has declared that the four morons still inside the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge will retain possession of the property and he s also demanding that local officials resign because they haven t been America-Lovin Christian Soldier For Freedom fully supportive of the Bundy militia s seizure of federal property.
Judge Gratsy seemed a bit confused as to why some schmuck in Nevada thinks he can dictate the law in Oregon: Last night I got a tweet with a copy of the letter in it from Mr. Cliven Bundy.
I looked at that and wondered what does that mean?
Perhaps he thinks he owns the refuge.
I don t think that s the case.
Judge Gratsy also responded to a petition to arrest the officers involved with the 100 percent justified shooting of martyr moron Lavoy Finicum: This isn t a valid petition in any sense of the law that I understand, Grasty told KOIN 6 News on Tuesday.
That request won t be honored.
Even funnier, the patriots that have been protesting clearly don t know how to count: Mr. Curtiss said [the petition] it was 200 signatures.
What was delivered to us has lines for 150 signatures and it 118 signatures on them, the judge said.
We think we can identify 111 of those as maybe Harney County folks.
That sums up the Bundy clown parade perfectly: Ignorant of the law, very angry and very, very stupid.
With a lot of guns.
What could possibly go wrong?Since this story was first reported on, Cliven Bundy has been arrested for trying to join up with domestic terrorists and the four boneheads at Malhuer are reportedly in the process of surrendering after demanding that they not be arrested.Here s the full story via KOIN6: Featured image via AI Archives
