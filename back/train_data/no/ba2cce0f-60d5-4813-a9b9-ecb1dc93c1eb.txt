istanbul ( reuters ) - turkey could seek a deal to acquire a missile defense system with another country if russia does not agree to joint production of a defense shield , its foreign minister was quoted as saying on monday .
nato member turkey is seeking to buy the s-400 system from russia , alarming washington and other members of the western alliance , and president tayyip erdogan said ankara has already paid a deposit on the deal .
turkey hopes that the deal would allow it to acquire the technology to develop its own defense system , and foreign minister mevlut cavusoglu , in an interview with turkish newspaper aksam , said the two countries had agreed on joint production .
if russia doesn t want to comply , we ll make an agreement with another country , he said when asked about reports that russia was reluctant to share the technology .
but we haven t got any official negative replies ( from russia ) .
kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov , asked in a conference call with reporters if the deal would go ahead if moscow did not agree to joint production , said : contacts and negotiations at an expert level in the context of this deal are ongoing .
this is all i can say for now .
cavusoglu said turkey had initially hoped to reach agreement with producers from nato allies .
western firms which had bid for the contract included u.s. firm raytheon , which put in an offer with its patriot missile defense system .
franco-italian group eurosam , owned by the multinational european missile maker mbda and france s thales , came second in the tender .
turkey , with the second-largest army in the alliance , has enormous strategic importance for nato , abutting as it does syria , iraq and iran .
but the relationship has become fractious since an attempted coup against erdogan in july 2016 and a subsequent crackdown .
