trump s supporters have become increasingly violent at trump campaign events .
that violence is usually directed towards protestors and people of color .
trump has been actively encouraging this violence , though he still claims that he is not.people have noted that many of the people stuck in traffic are angry at the protestors .
twitter , as per usual , is doing a great job of pointing out the problem with some people s priorities.drivers angry bcuz of inconvenience .
people protest bcuz # nevertrump has threatened torture , mass expulsion & violence .
