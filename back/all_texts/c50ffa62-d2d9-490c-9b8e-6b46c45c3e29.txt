LONDON (Reuters) - British defence minister Michael Fallon said his past conduct had fallen below the high standard required in his position on Wednesday in a resignation letter to Prime Minister Theresa May.
A number of allegations have surfaced about MPs (Members of Parliament) in recent days, including some about my previous conduct.
Many of these have been false but I accept that in the past I have fallen below the high standard we require of the Armed Forces that I have the honor to represent, Fallon said in the letter published by May s office.
