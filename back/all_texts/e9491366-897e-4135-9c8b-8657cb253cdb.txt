Gay-hating, Ted Cruz-loving Pastor Kevin Swanson is back, and he is calling for more executions.
First, he used the bible as a reason to suggest the execution of LGBT people, and now, he s using that same book and reasoning to say that Girl Scout leaders have to be killed for you guessed it promoting homosexuality.
Swanson took aim at the popular Harry Potter series of books as well as the Girl Scouts, saying that they should be banned because of Jesus s teachings, that we must be against movies that promote homosexuality or organizations that promote homosexuality.
These comments came during Swanson s hateful radio program, and he rounded them out with: You ve got to take what He (Jesus) says and you have to apply it.
This isn t the first time Kevin Swanson has suggested that death is the solution to homosexuality.
During his National Religious Liberties Conference, where he shared the stage with none other than GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz, Swanson said: There are instances in which both the Old and New Testament speak to the matter with unbelievable clarity.
There s not to be any debate about it.
You know what that sin is it s the sin of homosexuality.In fact in Romans 1 Paul affirms that this particular sin is worthy of death.
The Old and New Testament, I believe both speak with authority and we outta receive it.
You can watch video of that particular rant, below:This guy is literally calling for genocide of an entire subset of the American population.
He is also aligned with a serious contender for the presidency of the United States.
That should frighten any sane, reasonable person, regardless of political affiliation.You can listen to the audio of these vile remarks below, via Right Wing Watch:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/251830295 params= color=ff5500 width= 100% height= 166 iframe= true /]Featured image via video screen capture
