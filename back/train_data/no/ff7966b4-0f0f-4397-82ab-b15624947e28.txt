donald trump has been described by many as sounding like a comic book villain come to life , and now veteran star wars icon mark hamill just proved it to the entire world.writer matt oswalt ( brother of comedian patton oswalt ) pointed out on twitter that trump s weird-sounding new year s tweet message sounded just like something the joker would say right before releasing a swarm of killer bees into gotham .
this sounds like something the joker would say right before releasing a swarm of killer bees into gotham https : //t.co/sykschvyuh matt oswalt ( @ mattoswaltva ) december 31 , 2016well on the internet , you truly never know who is listening at any given moment .
after playing luke skywalker ( of course ) in the original star wars trilogy ( a new hope , the empire strikes back , and return of the jedi ) , mark hamill has for years led a double life as the joker .
he has appeared in several batman and dc comics animated tv shows , movies , and video games voicing the deranged serial killer clown.and now he is using his voiceover magic for something truly useful , mocking trump.after oswalt s message , hamill posted a tweet with an audio clip attached of him reading trump as if he were the joker : the trumpster quote # 1 # anewjeerstoast https : //t.co/qzqegu18r6 mark hamill ( @ hamillhimself ) january 8 , 2017the hilarious tweet went viral right away , and it scarily shows how much of a matchup there is between the clown prince of crime and the clownish politician .
hamill labeled his audio clip as quote # 1 so there will obviously be some clamor for a followup , perhaps even an animated trump/joker matchup of some sort ? oswalt also suggested what sounds like a multi-million dollar idea : billion dollar idea : an app that you can feed every trump tweet into that plays it back in @ hamillhimself joker voice .
you re welcome .
it s sad that america will have to suffer for at least four years under a leader who clearly would be right at home inside a comic book , but he is already showing us that he will be a boon to comedians and other creatives , to allow us to deal with the havoc he wreaks .
