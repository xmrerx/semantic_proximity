Don't miss it!You can hear more about the exhibition from the PRI interview below:https://www.pri.org/stories/2017-11-02/searching-hillary-clinton-s-unused-confettiSpecial thanks to:MILCKAtlantic RecordsGabe GreenbergKiku Obata & CompanyLaurent TornoDieu DonnePosted by Anderson Ranch Arts Center on Monday, December 18, 2017When that didn t happen, she came up with another idea for 200 pounds of Clinton confetti that went unused: to encase it glass snow globes with a metal placard inside that reads And Still I Rise a reference to a Maya Angelou poem of the same name.Bunny Burson made 1,000 of the special snow globes, which she s selling at the grand opening of her And Still I Rise art exhibit at the Anderson Ranch Arts Center in Snowmass Village.
PLANNED PARENTHOOD GETS THE PROCEEDS: Nothing says breaking the glass ceiling like giving money to a baby killing, body parts selling factory like Planned Parenthood.The globes sold locally will go to the Arts Center, while proceeds from sales elsewhere will go to Planned Parenthood, according to the news site.
It was a natural progression when this happened, as sad as it was, to use the confetti to lift people up including myself, Bunny Burson said at the opening Tuesday.
It was cathartic for me to make the work, and I want young women and girls who see it to be able to do what they dream of doing and break the glass ceiling.
