if the democrat voters don t care if they re voting for a woman who is under criminal investigation after putting our national security at risk , or that she will bring her husband , a serial sexual assaulter who was previously impeached after lying about having sex with an intern in our white house , why would they care if obama once despised her ?
concerned that hillary clinton is still struggling to generate excitement , president barack obama is preparing to campaign for her by reminding voters there was a time he didn t like her so much , but he came around and they should too.that s the only way , obama and aides working with him think , that she ll have the positive mandate she ll need to govern .
winning the white house by just not being trump won t help win house and senate races , and it won t give her the support she needs if and when she s the new president , trying to keep the public and congress behind her agenda.watch bob hope give a brilliant description of democrats here : you want people to feel as passionate about hillary clinton being president as they do about stopping donald trump .
if this isn t a close race , it s still going to matter a great deal for her presidency , said david plouffe , obama s 2008 campaign manager and now an outside political adviser to both the president and the campaign .
that s one place where we need to see some improvement , on the intensity side of the clinton question .
that imperative will define obama s message when he hits the trail for his rescheduled joint rally with clinton , which will take place in charlotte , north carolina , on july 5 .
he can make the case as the highest profile convert to be her supporter , said white house communications director jen psaki .
