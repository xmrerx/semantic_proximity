istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish authorities issued arrest warrants for 110 people from a seized company over alleged links to the u.s.-based cleric who ankara says orchestrated last year s attempted coup , dogan news agency and other media said on friday .
it said the police operation to seize the suspects , who were managers , partners and employees of the publishing group kaynak holding and related companies , was focused on istanbul but spread across 24 provinces .
kaynak holding was seized by the state in 2015 over links to the movement of islamic preacher fethullah gulen , who has lived in self-imposed exile in pennsylvania since 1999 .
he has denied involvement in the july 2016 abortive putsch .
hundreds of firms like kaynak , many of them smaller provincial businesses , were seized by authorities in a post-coup crackdown and are now run by government-appointed administrators .
under the crackdown , more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over alleged links to gulen , while 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the military , public and private sectors .
in a separate operation centered in ankara , 38 former employees from schools owned by the gulen network were arrested on friday , according to turkish media .
the schools were closed by a decree after the failed coup .
the government dismisses rights groups concerns about the crackdown , saying only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by gulen s network , which it says infiltrated institutions such as the judiciary , army and schools .
