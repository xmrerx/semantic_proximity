beijing ( reuters ) - china on monday criticized a visit by indian president ram nath kovind to the remote state of arunachal pradesh , which china claims , saying china opposed any activities by indian leaders in disputed areas .
the latest row over arunachal pradesh suggests the asian giants remain far apart , despite recent attempts to defuse tension over a region that china claims as southern tibet .
the indian president went over the weekend , inaugurating a new state assembly building .
for india , the state is where the sun first rises - being its easternmost region - each day , and from here light is spread across the country , he said in a speech to the state assembly .
he also remarked on several steps taken by the federal government to advance the state s transport links .
speaking at a daily news briefing in beijing , chinese foreign ministry spokesman lu kang said that china had never recognized arunachal pradesh , but that china s position on the border issue was clear , which was to seek a solution both could accept via talks .
before the border issue is resolved , both sides should jointly work hard to protect the peace and tranquility of the border region .
china resolutely opposes indian leaders activities in disputed regions , lu said .
sino-india ties are at an important stage in development , and china hopes india does not do anything to complicate the border issue but should instead create conditions for border talks and the healthy , stable development of relations , he added .
china and india have tried to develop two-ways ties in recent years but there is still deep distrust over the border dispute .
in april , china slammed india s decision to host tibetan spiritual leader the dalai lama in the same region , saying it could cause serious damage to relations .
