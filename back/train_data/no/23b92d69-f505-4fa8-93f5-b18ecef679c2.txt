idiots !
that s the first comment at yale alumni magazine on twitter under the proud announcement of the removal of a musket from a stone carving we couldn t agree more with the commenter idiots for sure ! check out the comments there s hope !
yale alumni magazine provided a blurb entitled disarmament to explain why they felt it necessary to remove/hide/disfigure a stone carving of a puritan pointing a musket at a native american : was not appropriate yale alumni magazine : if you were especially observant during your years on campus , you may have noticed a stone carving by the york street entrance to sterling memorial library that depict a hostile encounter : a puritan pointing a musket at a native american ( top ) .
when the library decided to reopen the long-disused entrance as the front door of the new center for teaching and learning , says head librarian susan gibbons , she and the university s committee on art in public spaces decided the carving s presence at a major entrance to sterling was not appropriate .
the puritan s musket was covered over with a layer of stone ( bottom ) that gibbons says can be removed in the future without damaging the original carving.at the york street entrance to @ yalelibrary , a puritan has been disarmed .
