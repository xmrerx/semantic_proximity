Now that Donald Trump has scared and fleeced uneducated, gullible people into giving him the White House, there are many concerns regarding many of his campaign promises namely the insane so-called deportation force that will round people up and ship them from the country.
Thanks to the many, many protests regarding Trump s win, it is now up to the leadership of the GOP to clean up Trump s mess, because he is incapable of doing so himself.
Therefore, House Speaker Paul Ryan went on CNN s State of the Union to speak to Jake Tapper on Sunday, in which he addressed the promise of mass deportations.
Ryan said: We are not planning on erecting a deportation force.
Donald Trump is not planning on that.
That s not what we re focused on.
We re focused on securing the border.
We think that s first and foremost, before we get into any other immigration issue.
We ve got to know who s coming and going in the country.
We ve got to secure the border.
Of course, this is not what Trump himself said on the campaign trail.
Here is what Trump insisted, via The Hill: You re going to have a deportation force, and you re going to do it humanely, Trump said a year ago.
Look, we have to do what we have to do, and Ike did it and other people have done it, Trump said, referring to President Dwight Eisenhower s policy of deporting 1.5 million people by bus and dropping them off at remote parts of the border.So, whose promise should we trust?
Ryan s or Trump s?
Considering the lying, sniveling, skeevy nature of today s Republican Party, we must assume the worst That they are planning on mass deportations, but want people to be caught unaware when they start.These people are truly frightening.
Buckle up, folks.
It s going to be a long four years.Paul Ryan: We are not planning on erecting a deportation force https://t.co/KNeF02vhbv #CNNSOTU https://t.co/skw76OndVK CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) November 13, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
