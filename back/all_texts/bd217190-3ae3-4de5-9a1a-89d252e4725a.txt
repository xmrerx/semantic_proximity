Things got a bit uncomfortable during Rick Perry s confirmation hearing for a position in a department he forgot existed, then wanted to eliminate, and literally just learned what it does.
Now he wants to run it.
I have learned a great deal about the important work being done every day by the outstanding men and women of the DOE, Perry said in his opening statement at his confirmation hearing.
My past statements made over five years ago about abolishing the Department of Energy do not reflect my current thinking.
In fact, after being briefed on so many of the vital functions of the Department of Energy, I regret recommending its elimination.
The thought of Rick Perry being in charge of our nation s nuclear stockpile is terrifying, but we were treated to a rare bit of levity during the former Texas Governor s exchange with Senator Al Franken.The Senator thanked Trump s nominee for recently visiting him in his office.
Did you enjoy meeting me?
Franken joked.
That s when things got weird.
Perry uttered a sentence that will almost assuredly be memed for months or even years to come: I hope you are as much fun on that dais as you were on your couch.
May I rephrase that?
Perry asked.
Please.
Please.
Please, Franken replied.
Oh my lord.
Oh my lord.
