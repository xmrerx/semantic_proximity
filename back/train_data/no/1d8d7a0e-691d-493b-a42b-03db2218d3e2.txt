beijing ( reuters ) - late u.s. president abraham lincoln , who freed the slaves , would have approved of china s policy to end serfdom in tibet , a senior chinese official said on thursday .
china considers devoutly buddhist tibet an inherent part of its territory and routinely rejects accusations from exiles and rights groups of repression and human rights abuses .
chinese forces entered tibet in 1950 in what the government terms a peaceful liberation , and says its rule has brought prosperity and freedom to what was a backward and feudal society , including freeing a million people from serfdom , an event marked in tibet as serfs emancipation day .
speaking on the sidelines of china s 19th communist party congress , supervision minister yang xiaodu , who helps fight corruption , said the united states and tibet had much in common with their human rights experiences .
yang recounted a tale of meeting a person he described as a former assistant u.s. secretary of state during a visit to the united states .
i said , in chinese people s minds , lincoln is a hero , as he freed the slaves , and on this issue chinese and american people s recognition is the same , it s a human rights issue , yang said .
in tibet we freed the serfs , and how are american friends not able to understand this ?
this is also a human rights issue .
if you look at it from lincoln s point of view , he would have approved of china overturning the serfdom system in tibet .
lincoln issued the emancipation proclamation freeing slaves in the united states in 1863 .
china keeps a tight grip on tibet due to periodic anti-chinese unrest , and all foreigners require permission to visit , including foreign reporters .
penpa tashi , tibet s propaganda chief , told reporters at a separate event that it would like to have more foreign visitors .
but tibet is a high altitude area , he said .
our receiving capability is still being improved .
