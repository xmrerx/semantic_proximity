Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse seems to be fed up with his party, and there s no way in hell he s going to vote for Donald Trump.
In a lengthy Facebook post, the Nebraska Senator called for a third party run to stop Trump.
While he was certainly none too kind to Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton, he made it clear that his sights are set on stopping Trump from getting anywhere near the White House.
Here is the embed of the post:Now, anyone with any sense regarding how our political process works knows that there s no way in hell a third party candidate can win in the current climate.
In other words, if others jump ship like Senator Sasse has, the GOP throws the election to Clinton.
Yep, you read that right.
There is at least one senator in the Republican Party who is already openly willing to pursue a track that goes against his own party s nominee.
That is how much he hates Trump.He isn t the only one, either, most likely.
House Speaker Paul Ryan has already come out and said that despite the fact that Trump is his party s presumptive presidential nominee, that he cannot support him at this time.
Further, there are plenty of Republicans who are struggling with the idea of supporting a nomination where Donald Trump is at the top of their ticket.
It s about time finally, there are Republicans who are at last somewhat sane who have drawn a line in the sand to show that they value their country over their party.
There was a time when this would never have been the case.
That is how bad Trump is.Now, again, Sasse was no friend to Democrats in this post, but his response to the idea of a Donald Trump nomination is quite telling.
