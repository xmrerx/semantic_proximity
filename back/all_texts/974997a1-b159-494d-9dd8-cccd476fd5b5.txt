Donald Trump repeatedly attacked former President Barack Obama each time he went golfing but the alleged billionaire has just taken his 13th golfing trip in the two months he s been on the job.
Each one of Trump s defenders seems to have an old tweet blasting Obama for his golf trips, which pale in comparison to Trump s lavish vacations.
Last week, White House press secretary Sean Spicer tried to explain why golfing trips are OK for Trump but were not OK for Obama.
And now we have Newt Gingrich s old tweet coming back to haunt him.The disgraced former House Speaker tweeted in 2013, Trump and president obsma both golf but trump doesn t charge the taxpayers $920,000 for a golf weekend in florida.
Trump and president obsma both golf but trump doesn't charge the taxpayers $920,000 for a golf weekend in florida.
Newt Gingrich (@newtgingrich) March 8, 2013We can only assume Gingrich meant Obama, not obsma.
Well, he did inadvertently get that right.
Each time Trump goes to his Mar-a-Lago resort, it costs taxpayers $3 million, not $920,000.
The alleged president is on track to spend $1 billion in 4 years to house his wife in New York City and vacationing in Mar-a-Lago virtually every week.The Internet pounced on Gingrich s hypocritical tweet.
@newtgingrich hey newt, it's so cool how you're not even embarrassed to shart in public.

Paolo Bacigalupi (@paolobacigalupi) March 26, 2017@newtgingrich you're right.

Social Media Poison (@coreypierceart) March 26, 2017@Marbs84 @newtgingrich @slack2thefuture Today was golf outing # 12 in 9 wks in office.
Newt, I think trump golfs more than he presidents.
Connie (@ceejchris82) March 26, 2017@newtgingrich no, but the Secret Service does.
Maybe shut the fuck up instead of always opening your giant, privileged white cakehole.
The Duke Of Winjer (@jamesmielke) March 26, 2017@newtgingrich boy you're gonna be real mad when you find out how much his trips to Mar-A-Lego cost each weekend, huh Victoria McNally (@vqnerdballs) March 26, 2017Gingrich s hypocrisy is duly noted.
The former House Speaker has been strangely quiet over Donald Trump s repeated trips to the golf course, and what s really disturbing is that he regularly goes golfing at Trump-owned golf clubs, meaning that there is another conflict of interest for us to deal with.
Trump is literally profiting from his presidency.
In 2011, the former reality show star tweeted, I play golf to relax.
My company is in great shape.
@BarackObama plays golf to escape work while America goes down the drain.
Meanwhile, Trump broke another campaign promise, this one to repeal and replace Obamacare.
Instead, he offered tax breaks for the wealthy while throwing the elderly, veterans and lower-income Americans under the bus.
Then he went golfing after his plan failed miserably.Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images with added tweet.
