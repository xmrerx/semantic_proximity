manila ( reuters ) - three russian warships , including two anti-submarine vessels , docked in manila on friday to unload what navy officials said was weaponry and military vehicles donated to the philippines as part of a new defense relationship .
it was the third port visit this year by russian warships as part of philippine president rodrigo duterte s moves to engage closely with moscow , an arch-rival of manila s former colonial master and closest defense ally , the united states .
the load included 5,000 assault rifles , a million rounds of ammunition and 20 army trucks , russian and filipino navy officials said .
we would do our best to make this port call a significant contribution indicating friendly ties and relations between two nations in the interest of security and stability in this region , said eduard mikhailov , deputy commander of russia s pacific fleet flotilla .
the visit was timed to coincide with the arrival next week of russian defence minister sergei shoigu , who is attending a regional defense meeting , and u.s. counterpart jim mattis , a philippine navy spokesman said .
russia and the philippines are expected to sign a security deal on military logistics next week .
