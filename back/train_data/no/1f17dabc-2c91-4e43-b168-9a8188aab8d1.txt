if i were u.s. district judge andrew hanen , i d be keeping these guys close by : the injunction that has blocked president barack obama s executive amnesty will remain in place following the ruling of a federal judge tuesday night in this texas border city.in a late night ruling , u.s. district judge andrew hanen sided with the state of texas and 25 other states that are suing to stop the executive action that would grant legal status to at least 5 million illegal immigrants.the states have sued the federal government claiming that obama s amnesty would cause irreparable harm and financial loss to their state if the executive action continues .
earlier this year hanen granted an injunction requested by the 26 states seeking to halt the implementation of obama s amnesty .
they states claimed the damage would have already been caused and even if they won the lawsuit there would be little they could to at that point.hanen s new ruling comes after the u.s. government tried to fight the judge s ruling by asking for a stay of the injunction and also after information pointed to a possible violation by the federal government by granting a three year extension to the program known as daca which granted status to hundreds of thousands of undocumented aliens in school.read hanen s decision below.hanen rulingvia : breitbart news
