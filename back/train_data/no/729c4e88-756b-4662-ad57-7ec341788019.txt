donald trump is totally going to lose his sh * t when he sees this.as we all know , trump is insecure about the size of his hands and he has a major problem with women mocking him.so when melissa mccarthy played sean spicer on saturday night live last week it not only lite the internet on fire , the skit enraged trump because spicer was played by a woman , which trump believes makes spicer look weak .
you know , because trump doesn t consider women strong , independent , and equal to men.well , late show host stephen colbert took trump s gripe and ran with it on friday night .
evidently , he was not laughing because apparently , trump thought a woman playing a man makes spicer look weak , colbert began .
first of all , i have met melissa mccarthy and she could kick the ass of every man in that administration .
and then colbert unveiled the greatest trolling of trump seen yet .
if the president thinks a woman portraying sean spicer makes him look weak , then he s really not going to like this picture we made of a little girl pretending to be donald trump .
and he s especially not going to like it when you retweet it at him with the hashtag # largerhands .
here s the video via twitter.tonight !
we don t think @ realdonaldtrump is going to like this very much .

harrison garcia ( @ malcontentmic ) february 11 , 2017 @ colbertlateshow @ realdonaldtrump she also has more self regulation and reading comprehension .
katrien ( @ kat7115 ) february 11 , 2017of course , trump supporters are whining and accusing colbert of bullying their hero , conveniently ignoring that comedians poked fun at president obama for eight years .
the only difference is that president obama could take a joke while trump is a joke.featured image via screenshot
