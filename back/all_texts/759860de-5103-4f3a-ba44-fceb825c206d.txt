Admiral Michael Rogers, the current head of the National Security Agency s Cybersecurity division, confirmed today that Wikileaks email releases, possibly along with Russia s hacking of the DNC during the summer, were a concerted effort to create a specific outcome in our election.
If their goal was to elect Donald Trump, then it certainly worked and our election was, in fact, rigged.He was speaking at the Wall Street Journal CEO Council, and the subject was actually the rocky relationship between the NSA and the private sector.
He argued that the private sector needs to give him more access to their network structures, while the private sector inherently distrusts the government and its intentions.During that interview, though, he fielded a question about Wikileaks releasing batches of emails from John Podesta, one of Hillary s close aides and confidantes: You told NPR in August that these emails were clearly leaked for a reason and they were leaked I believe to achieve an effect.
What can you tell us about Wikileaks from what you know?
He replied with: There shouldn t be any doubt in anybody s mind This was not a target that was selected purely arbitrarily.
This was a conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect.
He went on to explain a little about going after hackers by hardening systems and increasing knowledge, and they re also trying to hurt hackers by working with other countries on the problem.
If he s right, though, then we re in a lot of trouble at the behest of a hostile nation.Watch his comments below: A conscious effort by a nation-state to attempt to achieve a specific effect NSA chief on WikiLeaks https://t.co/kvmrTyVE30 #WSJCEOCouncil pic.twitter.com/AT2pxK2ROR Wall Street Journal (@WSJ) November 15, 2016Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
