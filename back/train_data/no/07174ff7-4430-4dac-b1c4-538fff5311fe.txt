when she s not shamelessly bashing people who don t think human action is dangerously warming the planet or radically confusing the role of the first lady , cnn anchor carol costello is busy making ridiculously stupid comments on-air.this mainstream media dummy actually said the chattanooga mass murderer mohammad youssef abdulazeez reminded her of boston marathon bomber dzhokhar tsarnaev .
the muslim murderer who slaughtered four marines before being blasted by police was a good-looking kid and was also popular in high school , costello said .
this guy actually reminds me of dzhokhar tsarnaev , she said .
good-looking guy .
everybody liked him .
he was popular in high school .
very well-educated .
both of them were wrestlers , and then something happened .
this is just another example of a media madam living in a bubble where she s blinded to see that the only comparison that should be made between the marine murderer and the boston marathon bombers is that they were all sick animals and cowards .
idiot .
