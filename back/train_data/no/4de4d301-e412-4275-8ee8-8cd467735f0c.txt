we have waaay more than 11 million illegals in this country thanks to obama s open border policy .
we re in deep trouble and it s not good .
please try and wake your neighbors up by giving them any and all info you can on the invasion of america that s been happening full force since obama go into office .
department of homeland security secretary jeh johnson told an audience today that illegal aliens are not going away and are in effect us citizens.the nation s top immigration officer said that the 11 million undocumented aliens in the united states are not going away , are in effect citizens , and added that deporting the few the administration wants out is unpleasant.jeh johnson , secretary of homeland security , told harvard university students this week that the administration is focused on its plan to integrate illegals into america , despite the policy being tied up in court.johnson said that he plans to be in the front row of the supreme court april 18 when the case is discussed.but in the meantime , he is making the case that the illegals here , estimated at a much higher 15.7 million by the center for immigration studies , have essentially become american .
the proof : they go to school , have licenses to drive , and can even practice law in california .
this should be considered treason !
