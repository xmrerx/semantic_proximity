WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly told a congressional panel on Tuesday that he expects a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border to be “well under way” within the next two years.
Kelly said the wall would be some kind of “physical barrier,” perhaps including a fence in some places.
Republican President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border to stop illegal immigration.
