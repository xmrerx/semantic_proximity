Donald Trump sure knows how to make you want to vomit.
It s a skill he has mastered.
This particular cringeworthy clip where he admits he thought Paris Hilton was hot at the age of 12 is one such moment.Trump appeared on the Howard Stern Show where he went on and on about how beautiful his daughter Ivanka s BFF was as a child and it is disturbingly creepy.
Now, somebody who a lot of people don t give credit to but in actuality is really beautiful is Paris Hilton, he said.
I ve known Paris Hilton from the time she s 12, her parents are friends of mine, and the first time I saw her she walked into the room and I said, Who the hell is that?
Did you wanna bang her?
Stern asked.
Well, at 12, I wasn t interested, Trump said, I ve never been into that but she was beautiful.
Trump continued, saying that Paris Hilton is dumb like a fox.
He then confessed that he had watched her sex tape.
When Stern asked how he happened to come across the leaked video, the GOP nominee said that his wife, Melania, had shown it to him.Trump s obsession with women s looks is no secret and neither is his love of young women.
Hell, this is the man who said if his daughter wasn t his own flesh and blood perhaps he d be dating her.
