The video below is a great example of what the Cleveland police officers are dealing with outside of the GOP Convention.
Hundreds of protesters got into a chaotic tussle but the police officers (as you can see in the video) were right in the middle to break it up.
This is yet another example of what police officers have to deal with urine tossing?
Hundreds of protesters and police took over Public Square in downtown Cleveland yesterday.
Some of the larger groups dispersed just after 5 p.m., but about 10-20 new protesters arrived with masks on.
Heavy law enforcement presence remained for several hours.Cleveland Police Chief Calvin Williams was on hand most of the afternoon to try and keep groups calm.
Williams said he was shoved by a person trying to get to another protester, however, there were no arrests and no injuries.It s the largest gathering of protest groups and the largest gathering of police since the beginning of the Republican National Convention.Activists from Black Lives Matter, Westboro Baptist Church and the KKK were in the square and, at one time, were throwing urine at each other.KPLC 7 News, Lake Charles, Louisiana Via: kpictv
