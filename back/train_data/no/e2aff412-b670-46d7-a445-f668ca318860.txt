united nations ( reuters ) - the united nations general assembly on wednesday adopted a resolution calling for an end to the u.s. economic embargo on cuba , with the united states voting against it after abstaining last year for the first time in 25 years .
the 193-member general assembly passed the resolution with 191 votes in favor .
israel , as it has done in the past , voted in line with its top ally .
the non-binding resolution urges the united states to repeal the embargo on cuba as soon as possible .
the u.n. vote can carry political weight , but only the u.s. congress can lift the full embargo , put in place more than 50 years ago .
u.s .
ambassador to the united nations nikki haley called the plenary meeting on this subject political theater .
the cuban regime is sending the warped message to the world that the sad state of its economy , the oppression of its people , and the export of its destructive ideology is not its fault , haley told the general assembly .
the u.s. position had been announced on tuesday at the state department .
cuba s foreign minister bruno rodriguez said haley and the united states lack the slightest moral authority to criticize cuba , calling her remarks disrespectful against cuba and its government .
tensions have flared recently between washington and havana , which forged a closer relationship under former u.s. president barack obama and reopened embassies in both countries in 2015 .
haley said the diplomatic status between both countries is not changing .
u.s. president donald trump said earlier this month he believed havana was responsible for a series of alleged incidents that washington says harmed 24 of its diplomats , while cuban officials said last week talk of acoustic strikes was science fiction .
