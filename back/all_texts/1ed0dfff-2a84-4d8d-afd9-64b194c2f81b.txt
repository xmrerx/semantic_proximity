LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May s meeting with European Union officials last week was constructive and friendly , her spokesman said on Monday when asked about an unflattering newspaper account of the meeting in a German newspaper.
I think you re referring to a newspaper article with no quotes in it, but I have no comment whatsoever on that, the spokesman said.
He referred to a joint statement issued following the meeting last week which said the talks were constructive and friendly.
