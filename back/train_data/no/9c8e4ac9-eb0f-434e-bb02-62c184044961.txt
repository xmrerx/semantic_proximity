london ( reuters ) - failure to pass the government s flagship piece of brexit legislation through parliament will result in holes in the statute book and increased uncertainty , two junior british ministers said on thursday .
this bill is about how we leave , it s about delivering certainty and continuity in the law as we leave the european union , said steve baker , a minister in the brexit department .
if this bill were not to pass ... then of course there would be holes in the statute book .
the result would be that the statute book would not function as intended .
