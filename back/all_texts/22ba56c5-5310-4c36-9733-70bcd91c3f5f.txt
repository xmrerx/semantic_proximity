We ve been abuzz all day about a doctor who was forcibly removed from a United Airlines flight at Chicago s O Hare International Airport.
Chicago Department of Aviation police yanked him out of his seat so hard his face hit the armrest and he ended up in the hospital.
Most people who have any kind of a conscience are outraged, as well they should be, because there are a zillion things wrong with this scenario.Bill O Reilly, on the other hand, doesn t seem to be all that outraged over it.
His reaction was positively disgusting.
Seriously.
After showing the video, he literally laughed.
Then he said: I shouldn t be laughing but it s just so bizarre.
Good lord, does the man have any decency at all?
Oh, wait, we know the answer to that already.
Yes, it s bizarre, but not in a way that warrants laughing.
How black does your soul have to be to laugh at something like this?
Watch below:United had oversold this particular flight and was having trouble getting people to voluntarily give up their seats so they could get a flight crew to Louisville.
With no volunteers, they randomly selected four people to be bumped, and this doctor was one of them.
He refused to give up his seat, so United called Dept.
of Aviation police to get rid of him.And O Reilly finds it funny.
But what can we really expect from a disgusting excuse for a human being such as Billo the Clown?Featured image via screen capture
