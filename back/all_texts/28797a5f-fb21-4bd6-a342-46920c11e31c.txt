Barack Obama has to be the world s biggest hypocrite.
Here he is in 2005 adamantly defending our borders: We simply cannot allow for people to pour in, undocumented and unchecked.
@PressSec Obama 2005: "We simply cannot allow for people to pour in, undocumented, unchecked".
OUCH!

So in 2005, it was against the law to enter our country illegally, but in 2016 they should not only flood into our country and overwhelm our nation, but they should also vote.
But yeah Trump is a racist for trying to clean up the mess Obama started.
