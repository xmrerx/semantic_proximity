the right is up in arms .
no , not because sally yates threw a huge snowball down avalanche hill and not because millions of americans could lose their health insurance .
they are losing their shizzle because martha stewart posed in a picture in front of photos of donald trump and snoop dogg .
it was a thing of beauty if you aren t a trump lover.in the photo , stewart posed in a corner between the two portraits with her arms crossed .
to snoop , it was all peace and love .
to trump , though , she flipped the portrait the bird.can confirm this martha stewart photo is real pic.twitter.com/f3s6jadvo6 yashar ( @ yashar ) may 8 , 2017there are questions about the photo s legitimacy but new york magazine and daily beast writer yashar confirms its validity.stewart , who once hosted a spinoff of trump s apprentice is no fan of the man .
during the election , she was firmly in hillary clinton s camp , and she said this about trump and clinton : there is so much to know and so much to learn and so much diplomacy and kindness and introspection that goes with that kind of job , stewart told cnnmoney during a luncheon for andrea bocelli s foundation sunday .
and it does not exist in the world of donald trump .
this is the most important election of the last hundred years , she said .
we have to be very certain that we elect a person who has experience , knowledge , a base of education in the world of world politics as well as domestic politics and so obviously i m voting for hillary clinton .
and we just can t have a country run by someone who is totally unprepared for what comes.source : cnnconservatives , who are having a tough day/month/year are not amused : @ 2alaw @ bfraser747 @ marthastewart martha obamaclinton put you in prison+hillary did same crime+zero in prison ! !
flip off them they did this !
