Meryl Streep made a white grievance queen explode on Sunday night.Donald Trump waited until the next morning to lash out at the legendary actress, but Tomi Lahren went on an hour long Twitter rage just after Streep s speech.The white supremacist favorite repeatedly insulted and threatened Streep and Hollywood celebrities in a psychotic rant that should have mental health professionals concerned.Meryl bout to get some final thoughts tomorrow.
These entitled Hollywood crybabies still don t understand how out of touch they are!
Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) January 9, 2017Nearly 3 million more Americans voted for Hillary Clinton than Donald Trump, so Streep is definitely in touch with the majority.It might be warm in LA, but make no mistake it s raining snowflakes.
Out of touch, whiny, overpaid SNOWFLAKES!
#GoldenGlobes Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) January 9, 2017Ironic, considering Donald Trump makes billions of dollars but doesn t pay taxes and often doesn t pay people who do work for his company.
Also, has Lahren not seen Trump s Twitter feed?
It s FULL of real whining.These Hollywood elites wouldn t know average, every day hard-working Americans if we bit them in the ass.
#GoldenGlobes Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) January 9, 2017Aw, Lahren thinks she s a hardworking person.
That s so adorable.
Must be SOOO hard to spew random bullshit on television in a studio.
No need to learn lines.
No need to work an 18 hour day.
No need to work in some tough environments on location away from family.
No need to learn new things to make a role convincing to the audience.
Just show up and say whatever racist offensive thing on your narrow mind at the moment and get paid for it.Hey Meryl, your #liberalprivilege is showing.
#GoldenGlobes Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) January 9, 2017Freedom of speech is a right, not a privilege.Oh no!!
What will @realDonaldTrump do without the support of the liberal Hollywood elite?!
Oh I know, he will Make America Great Again.
Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) January 9, 2017He ll pout on Twitter about it.Oh and Meryl, we are just fine with watching football.
Thanks.
#GoldenGlobes Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) January 9, 2017The ratings are down this year so apparently not everyone is just fine with it.You re right about 1 thing Meryl, violence does incite violence kinda like the violence the DNC paid for at Trump rallies.
Kinda like that.. Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) January 9, 2017That has been debunked for awhile now.Safeguard the truth Meryl?
Like the truth in those 33k deleted emails?
Or are we talking about Hillary s lies?
Not sure, Meryl .
Tomi Lahren (@TomiLahren) January 9, 2017Still obsessing over Hillary s emails?
Seriously?It sounds like Lahren is in need of anger management classes.
She can take Donald Trump with her.Featured image via screenshot
