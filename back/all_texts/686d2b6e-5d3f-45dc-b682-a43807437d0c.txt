When White House spokesliar Sean Spicer demanded that the Anne Frank Center praise Donald Trump for, for the first time since he became President, denouncing the rash of antisemitic violence and other crime that has popped up since his election.Traditionally, Trump has been terrible with even acknowledging that bad things happen to Jewish people.
even omitting them from his Holocaust announcement.
But for the first time that can t be emphasized enough he named Jews as the actual victims of antisemitism: The anti-Semitic threats targeting our Jewish community and community centers are horrible and are painful and a very sad reminder of the work that still must be done to root out hate and prejudice and evil.
While some praised Trump for finally doing the right thing, for most it was too little too late especially when it s considered that his staff is overflowing with Nazis, white nationalists, white supremacists, alt-Righters, and other synonyms.
His statement today is a pathetic asterisk of condescension after weeks in which he and his staff have committed grotesque acts and omissions reflecting Antisemitism, yet day after day have refused to apologize and correct the record, Steven Goldstein, executive director of the Anne Frank Center for Mutual Respect, wrote in a Facebook post.
Make no mistake: The Antisemitism coming out of this Administration is the worst we have ever seen from any Administration.
He added: The White House repeatedly refused to mention Jews in its Holocaust remembrance, and had the audacity to take offense when the world pointed out the ramifications of Holocaust denial.
And it was only yesterday, Presidents Day, that Jewish Community Centers across the nation received bomb threats, and the President said absolutely nothing.
When President Trump responds to Antisemitism proactively and in real time, and without pleas and pressure, that s when we ll be able to say this President has turned a corner.
This is not that moment.
I think he s been very forceful with his denunciation of people who seek to attack people because of their religion, because of their gender, because of the color of their skin, Spicer lied in response.
It is something that he s going to continue to fight and make very, very clear has he has no place in this administration.
Trump, of course, chose an alt-right scumbag named Stephen Miller, who has ties to white supremacist Richard Spencer, as a senior adviser and has handed anti-semitic, racist hatemonger Steve Bannon so much power that many people are saying he s actually the President.
It s ironic that no matter how many times he talks about this, it s never good enough, Spicer whined, ignoring that Trump literally has never actually defended persecuted Jewish people before.
The Anne Frank Center, he says, needs to get with the program and sing The Donald s praises: I wish that they had praised the president for his leadership in this area, and I think that hopefully as time continues to go by, they recognize his commitment to civil rights, to voting rights, to equality for all Americans.
The Center shot back on Twitter, giving them a condition that would cause them to do that fire the most blatant and terrible Nazi on staff: @WhiteHouse says our org should "praise" @POTUS @realDonaldTrump on #Antisemitism THEN FIRE STEVE BANNON.

@WhiteHouse Sean Spicer you are wrong to claim @POTUS has addressed #Antisemitism many times.
No & we had to beg.

Lotta hoaxes for attention.
And calling Trump anti-Semitic so quickly?

(@JinSaotome) February 21, 2017@AnneFrankCenter @WhiteHouse @POTUS @realDonaldTrump Why fire Bannon?
He isn't an anti-semit.
No evidence to support baseless charge.
