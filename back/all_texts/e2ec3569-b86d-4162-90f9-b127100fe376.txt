We ll likely never know exactly how many people attended Donald Trump s inauguration, but despite his claims, the crowd size was much smaller than either of President Obama s inaugurations and much smaller than the Women s March on Washington in protest of Trump.Still, despite a roster of d-list entertainment and too little fanfare, Republicans have to brag that Trump set records, any record, so they found one.
According to McClatchy, Trump set the record for numbers of prayers in his inauguration.While for most Americans, that statistic might elicit, at best, a yawn, Sarah Palin (yes, she has a blog now) was the one who jumped on it most enthusiastically, with this clickbait headline:Donald Trump was inaugurated yesterday as America s 45th President yesterday.In the midst of the ceremonies, he set a record and a surprising one, at that.President Trump set the record for the most prayers ever said during an inaugural ceremony.While not as clickbaitey, that non-record record was covered by The Kansas City Star and conservative blogs like Townhall.We weren t the only people noticing the desperation in this story:@kberntson2 @SarahPalinUSA What kind of devout Christian assaults women and stiffs people who work for him?
Your kind of Christian?
Ugh!!!!!

@SarahPalinUSA I m sure he had to resort to prayer since he also broke the record for the lowest attendance & approval ratings ever.
Mayra Martinez (@MayraMM) January 21, 2017If the implication is that starting an administration is somehow a sign of character, note that the previous prayer record was set by Richard M. Nixon.
Of course, Trump has already bypassed Nixon s level of corruption and lies.
Many say the country needs the prayers, but the country needs action.
Perhaps Trump can set another record for shortest time before impeachment.Featured image via Pool/Getty Images
