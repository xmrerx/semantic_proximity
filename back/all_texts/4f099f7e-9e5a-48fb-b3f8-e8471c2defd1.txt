SIGONELLA, Italy (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump arrived in Sicily from Brussels on Thursday ahead of a two-day Group of Seven summit at which other leaders are expected to pressure him to soften his stance on trade and climate change.
The G7 meeting in the resort town of Taormina is the last leg of a nine-day tour by Trump of the Middle East and Europe â€” his first foreign trip since taking office in January.
After visits to Saudi Arabia, Israel and the Palestinian Territories, Trump met Pope Francis in Rome on Wednesday and held talks on Thursday with the heads of European Union institutions and the NATO military alliance in Brussels.
His plane landed in the Sigonella military airbase.
He was due to be flown to Taormina by helicopter.
