Wow!
This is huge!
The Democrats and their leaders are obviously ticking off the big guys with big bucks Was it something they said?
DNC Chairman Tom Perez could be the culprit or was it Donna Brazile exposing the corruption in the DSNC?
We re happy Morgan saw the light and ditched the DNC but he s still on board with some Democratic candidates He needs to come on over to the RIGHT side!TALLAHASSEE John Morgan tossed a bomb Friday into the 2018 political landscape, saying in a post-Thanksgiving message he is leaving the Democratic Party, and that Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson should not run for re-election, but rather seek the governor s mansion so he can leave a legacy.
I can t muster enthusiasm for any of today s politicians, the prominent trial lawyer and Democratic fundraiser wrote on Twitter.
They are all the same.
Both parties.
I plan to register as an independent and when I vote, vote for the lesser of two evils.
Morgan said, while he would support some Democratic candidates he likes, he would not raise a dime for national groups like the Democratic National Committee.
F no, he said when asked if he would help national organizations.
That s like pissing money down a rat hole.
Read Donna [Brazile s] book Morgan was referring to a book by the former interim DNC chair, previewed this month in POLITICO Magazine, where she says the party essentially rigged the DNC to support Hillary Clinton before the Democratic primary was over.
Bunch of dumb ass political hacks, Morgan added.
