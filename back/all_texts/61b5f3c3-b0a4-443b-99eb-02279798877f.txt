Is CNN contributor and Democratic Strategist Bob Beckel speaking on behalf of a frustrated Hillary Clinton who was just exposed by Wikileaks in a document suggesting Wikileaks founder Julian Assange should be taken out with a drone?
Is this how the Democrat party handles anyone who stands up to Hillary and exposes the Clinton s criminal behavior?
Threaten them to shut them up, and if they don t shut up assassinate them?
Way to show the Democrat Party s true colors Bob.Here s what Bob Beckel has to say about how to handle Wikileaks founder Julian Assange and his leaks to the public exposing the crooked Democrat Party and their crooked Queen Hillary Look the way to deal with this it s pretty simple.
We ve got special ops forces.
A dead guy can t leak stuff.
The guys a traitor, he s treasonous, and he s broken every law in the United States (Is he talking about Obama?)
And I m not for the death penalty, and if I m not for the death-penalty, there s only one way to do it illegally shoot the son-of-a-bitch!
