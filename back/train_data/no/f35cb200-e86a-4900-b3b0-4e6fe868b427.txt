twitter moments reported that alaska mom jolene jackinsky was waiting at an airport when she noticed the former president , who was immediately drawn to her baby.barack obama can be seen posing and smiling with a baby he randomly saw in the airport .
not surprisingly , abc news reported on the supposedly spontaneous photo and included a dramatic quote from the mother of the baby as their headline , that made it seem as though jesus himself appeared at the airport in front of the baby s mother : oh my god , it is obama : alaska mom , baby meet ex-president '' oh my god , it is obama '' : alaska mom , baby meet ex-president https : //t.co/hig00hf1uq pic.twitter.com/zkhxy7ownw abc news ( @ abc ) july 8 , 2017liberals on twitter were beside themselves with excitement over america s worst president , barack obama.i would cry so many tears if obama held my child https : //t.co/atp8afxph5 jasmin roederer ( @ jazzyflagrant ) july 8 , 2017the ex i will never get over https : //t.co/yqbfpgmlwn chaffer with no s ( @ jchaf15 ) july 8 , 2017not everyone was so impressed with the former president s pose with the baby at the airport .
