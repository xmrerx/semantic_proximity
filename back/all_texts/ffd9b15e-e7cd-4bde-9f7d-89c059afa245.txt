Senator John McCain is battling an aggressive form of brain cancer that will likely kill him, and he knows this.
This grave reality seems to have given him a new outlook on his role as a United States Senator.
In fact, his lease on life is so new and refreshing that he is going up against his best Senate friend, Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC).
Now that McCain is firmly in the no camp, the GOP can only lose one more vote, as Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) is already a hard no vote as well.This bill is even more radical than the one McCain killed before, with a drastic move on the Senate Floor as Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell looked on with his stony turtle face signaling humiliation and rage.
On this bill, McCain says: I cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal.
