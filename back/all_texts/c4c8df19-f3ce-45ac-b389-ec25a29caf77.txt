Early voting has concluded in Nevada, and tallies don t really favor Trump.
In fact, he and other Republicans may have already lost the state, given that Democrats currently have a 73,000 vote lead just in Clark County.
That s more than the margin by which President Obama won in 2012.Democrats have a 45,000 vote lead overall in the state, not including rural counties, and that could spell doom for the entire Republican ticket statewide since it gives Democrats a six-point lead going into Election Day.
It s not just Trump s chances bottoming out, it could also be the Republicans hopes to retain control of the Senate.In other words, there are currently 45,000 tiny blows killing the GOP s hopes for that state.Jon Ralston, Nevada s top political analyst, says that Trump needs a miracle to win at this point.
So do Republicans this could cost them Harry Reid s Senate seat, as well as the state s two House seats and the state legislature.Nearly half of the state voted early, including higher numbers of Democrats than Republicans, and that just compounds the GOP s woes there.
If voter turnout approaches 80 percent total on Tuesday, then two-thirds of the vote is already in.
The remaining votes would almost all have to go to Trump and the GOP for them to win anything there.Nevada s diversity is a big part of what s giving Trump problems Latino voters kept the Cardenas market open until 10pm because they were turning out in such large numbers.
In fact, in Clark County, Friday was the single largest early-voting day they ve seen.The funny thing is that Trump has been polling within just a few points of Hillary in Nevada, so this probably comes as a shock to Republicans.
But Republicans were pretty sure of a Romney victory in 2012, and he lost badly.
Their so-called autopsy report revealed significant problems that they totally ignored, and this is the result.Trump has almost no path to the White House without Nevada.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
