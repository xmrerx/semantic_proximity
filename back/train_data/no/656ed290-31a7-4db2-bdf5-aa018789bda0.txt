rep. keith ellison ( d-mn ) said that president obama bore some of the blame for democrats spectacular collapse in the 2016 election at an event at the university of minnesota wednesday.ellison was quick to say that he voted for every radical piece of legislature that barack obama pushed for , but when it comes to uniting the party , it appears that the most narcissistic , self-serving president in history may have been much of a team player .
barack obama could have been a better party leader , and i think that the fact that he wasn t has put his legacy in jeopardy , ellison said .
given that we lost a lot of state house seats , governorships , secretaries of states , his true legacy is in danger , ellison continued .
and i don t think he can say that he wasn t part of those losses .
ntknetworkbarack obama s not exactly a team player unless of course you re talking about the times that he worked with al sharpton and eric holder to divide our nation .
when it came to promoting other democrats however , obama didn t have such a great track record .
if you don t believe us , just ask hillary these numbers don t lie : republican strategist rory cooper pointed out in this blistering tweet that under president obama , democrats lost over 900 state legislature seats , 12 governors , 69 house seats , 13 senate seats.under president obama , democrats have lost 900+ state legislature seats , 12 governors , 69 house seats , 13 senate seats .
that 's some legacy .
