beijing ( reuters ) - the north korean nuclear issue must be resolved peacefully , chinese foreign minister wang yi told his russian counterpart during a meeting at the united nations , china s foreign ministry said on tuesday .
the united states and south korea , and separately russia together with china , started military drills on wednesday in a show of force against north korea , which has repeatedly defied the united nations to conduct nuclear and ballistic missile tests .
wang said in a meeting with russian counterpart sergei lavrov on monday that china would strictly implement u.n. security council sanctions and stressed that parties directly involved must also take action and responsibility .
the current deepening vicious cycle must be broken .
resuming peace talks is an equally important step in implementing security council resolutions , wang said , according to a statement on the foreign ministry website .
russia has supported china s suspension-for-suspension proposal , where the united states and south korea would agree to halt joint military drills while north korea halted missile and nuclear tests .
chinese president xi jinping and u.s. president donald trump spoke about keeping pressure on north korea using economic sanctions imposed through the united nations , the white house said on monday .
trump and xi spoke on the phone days after trump and his aides publicly discussed potential military action against north korea .
trump said on friday he was more confident than ever that our options in addressing this threat are both effective and overwhelming .
pyongyang carried out the latest in a rapid series of missile launches by firing another mid-range ballistic missile over japan on friday , soon after its sixth and most powerful nuclear test on sept. 3 , in defiance of united nations sanctions and other international pressure .
