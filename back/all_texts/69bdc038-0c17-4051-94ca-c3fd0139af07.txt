Minneapolis mayoral candidate Raymond Dehn proposes disarming cops in wake of Damond shooting.
Only one year ago, the FBI named Minneapolis, MN as one of the most dangerous cities in America.
Minneapolis is also home to the largest Somali refugee population in America.
According to the Star Tribune, Minnesota remains near the top among states for refugee resettlement, measured as a share of state population.
It is also the top destination for refugees who move from the state where they were originally resettled.
Of the 2,338 total, almost 45 percent hailed from Somalia.In the wake of the shooting death of Australian Justine Damond, Raymond Dehn, a candidate in the race for Minneapolis mayor has proposed disarming police officersThe Australian woman was shot dead by police officer Mohamed Noor after calling 911 to report a suspected sexual assault.
Officers don t need to carry a gun on their person all the time, said Raymond Dehn, one of the frontrunners in the mayoral race and who currently serves in the Minnesota House of Representatives.
Currently, officers carry all sorts of assault weapons in their cars.
So why can t one of those weapons be the side arm (such as a baton that sits on a holster)?
It s important that we begin to have a conversation, and I would say that all things are on the table.
We live in a culture where guns are pervasive.
Cops carrying guns is part of a larger conversation about guns in our society, he said, according to the Star Tribune .Better yet, how about just disarm the cops who, like Mohamed Noor, are only on the force to demonstrate Minneapolis commitment to diversity, rather than because they re competent to be police officers?Even better still, how about hire and fire cops based on merit, rather than for their value as trophy Muslims or Somalis on the force?Nah that would be Islamophobic.
