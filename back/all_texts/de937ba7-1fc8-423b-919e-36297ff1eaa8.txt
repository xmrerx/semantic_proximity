During a segment of Triumph s Summer Election Special, Donald Trump supporters got trolled hard.
A group of Trump supporters volunteered to be a part of a focus group.
As far as the Trump supporters know, they have been selected to watch and review potential Trump campaign video advertisements.What they don t know is that the campaign ads they are watching are entirely fictional.
The point of the prank is to test the supporter s loyalty to their chosen candidate.
We decided to assemble a group of them for an unfiltered view at how they connect with Trump s vision for America, as Triumph the Insult Comedy Dog puts it.The phony ads they watch are rather extreme bizarre even.
During the ad, a Trump impersonator says that they will build a giant electrified fence as a temporary way to keep any illegals out while they construct the real wall that Trump has promised to build if he is elected president.The people in the focus group also watch an ad where Trump calls out Hillary Clinton, demanding that she reveal to the world that she is a man pretending to be a woman.Another ad features Trump s solution to helping women feel more secure in bathrooms.
Rather than banning transgender individuals from using the restroom, Trump will provide every woman who uses a public bathroom with a firearm.Spoiler alert: The Trump supporters totally fall for the gag, believing they are real.
Now, it is important to keep in mind that research has shown that people tend to offer opinions about subjects that are ridiculous.
However, given just how extreme the advertisements are, it s still rather pathetic not to mention hilarious.You can watch the video in full, below.Featured image from video screenshot
