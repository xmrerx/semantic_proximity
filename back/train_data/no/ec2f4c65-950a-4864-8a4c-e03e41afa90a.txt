rome ( reuters ) - italy s anti-establishment 5-star movement , which leads most opinion polls ahead of a national election due by may next year , on friday launched an internal ballot to choose its leader and candidate for prime minister .
the hot favorite is 31-year-old lower house deputy luigi di maio , the party s most high-profile and popular politician , who has made no secret of wanting the job and appears to have no rivals to worry him .
the biggest problem for the maverick movement founded eight years ago may be finding credible alternative candidates in the contest , which will take the form of an online vote of 5-star s members , in line with its credo of direct democracy .
di maio , who is deputy speaker of the chamber of deputies , is considered a good communicator and one of 5-star s more moderate figures .
a post on 5-star s official mouthpiece , the blog of its founder beppe grillo , said the candidate for prime minister would also be the party s leader , something which is not always the case in italian politics .
grillo , who founded 5-star in 2009 , has so far acted as its de facto chief , though he has never run for any office and the party has always prided itself as having a horizontal structure with no official leader .
the only person considered a realistic threat to di maio , the fiery deputy alessandro di battista , has given no indication that he plans to run .
another deputy seen as a potential challenger , roberto fico , who represents the left wing of the party and has recently distanced himself from di maio s tough positions on law-and-order and immigration , has also not yet made any move .
the post on grillo s blog said 5-star s local and national representatives who wish to run had until monday to present their candidacies .
the timing of the online vote has not yet been set but the winner is due to be announced on sept 23 at 5-star s annual national meeting at the adriatic coastal town of rimini .
