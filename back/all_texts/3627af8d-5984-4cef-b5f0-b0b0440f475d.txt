A former hostage, Pastor Saeed Abidini, recalls the night he was released as a prisoner in Iran including waiting on the tarmac for hours.
Well, well, well wouldn t you know that Obama and Hillary lied again!
They both claimed that this was not a ransom BUT the hostages had to wait until the plane-load of money arrived before they could leave.
If that s not a ransom then I don t know what is.
These people are evil!Saeed Abidini: I just remember the night at the airport sitting for hours and hours there and I asked police why you not letting us go And he told me we are waiting for another plane and if that plane take off we gonna let you go.Trish Regan: You slept there at the airport?Abidini: Yes, for a night.
They told us you going to be there for 20 minutes but it took hours and hours.
And I ask them why you don t let us go, because the was there, pilot was there, everyone was there to leave the country.
And he said we are waiting for another plane so if that plane doesn t come we never let us go.Please listen to Col. Ralph Peters explain more about this and as usual he s dead on!
