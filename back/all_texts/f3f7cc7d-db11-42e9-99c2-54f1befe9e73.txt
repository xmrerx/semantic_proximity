You can t blame the guy who had the whole election wrapped up and then, embarrassingly gave it back to Barack for trying right?Sorry Mitt Romney On FOX News Sunday this morning Rush Limbaugh pointed out that even with a brokered convention the Republican nominees must have won a majority of delegates in at least 8 states.So far only one candidate qualifies with 12 state victories Donald Trump.Rush said the GOP would have to change the convention rules in order to steal the election from the Republican base.So even if the GOP establishment wants to nominate a Paul Ryan or Mitt Romney they couldn t because they have not won majority of delegates in any state let alone 8 states.This convention rule Number 40 was adopted at the 2012 convention.
