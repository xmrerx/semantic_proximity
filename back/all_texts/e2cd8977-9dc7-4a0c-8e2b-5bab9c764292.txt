How crazy is it that a Fast and Furious gun was used in the Paris terror attacks?
One of the guns used in the November 13, 2015 Paris terrorist attacks came from Phoenix, Arizona where the Obama administration allowed criminals to buy thousands of weapons illegally in a deadly and futile gun-walking operation known as Fast and Furious.
A Report of Investigation (ROI) filed by a case agent in the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco Firearms and Explosives (ATF) tracked the gun used in the Paris attacks to a Phoenix gun owner who sold it illegally, off book, Judicial Watch s law enforcement sources confirm.
Federal agents tracing the firearm also found the Phoenix gun owner to be in possession of an unregistered fully automatic weapon, according to law enforcement officials with firsthand knowledge of the investigation.The investigative follow up of the Paris weapon consisted of tracking a paper trail using a 4473 form, which documents a gun s ownership history by, among other things, using serial numbers.
The Phoenix gun owner that the weapon was traced back to was found to have at least two federal firearms violations for selling one weapon illegally and possessing an unregistered automatic but no enforcement or prosecutorial action was taken against the individual.
Instead, ATF leaders went out of their way to keep the information under the radar and ensure that the gun owner s identity was kept quiet, according to law enforcement sources involved with the case.
Agents were told, in the process of taking the fully auto, not to anger the seller to prevent him from going public, a veteran law enforcement official told Judicial Watch.Read more: Judicial Watch
