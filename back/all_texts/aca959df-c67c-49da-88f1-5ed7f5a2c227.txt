You have to give it to President Trump who went after the fake news media in a big way today.
He challenged them to answer if it s ok to take down statues of George Washington Where does this end?.
@POTUS: George Washington was a slave owner Are we going to take down statues of George Washington?

ANOTHER PART OF HIS STATEMENT: President Donald Trump ripped the media today and it was great to see.
He said he didn t want to comment on the events over the weekend in Charlottesville, Va., until he knew the all of the facts.
He said, you still don t know all of the facts Well done Mr. President!Trump spoke in Trump Tower today trying to discuss the infrastructure plan for America.
Questions from reporters were instead about Charlottesville and his reaction to the violence there.
The press kept asking why he didn t respond to the events faster POTUS: It takes a little while to get the facts.
You still don t know the facts, and it s a very, very important process to me.
THE BEST PART -He pulled out the statement from Saturday:To clarify what he said on Saturday, Trump pulled out his remarks from that night and read them over for the press.
He said, Before I make a statement, I need the facts.
So I don t want to rush into a statement, so making the statement when I made it was excellent.
TRUMP TAKES A SWIPE AT THE MEDIA CLASSIC!
There was no way of making a correct statement that early.
I had to see the facts unlike a lot of reporters.
Frankly, people still don t know all of the facts.
He hit back at the salivating press with such great force GREAT JOB PRESIDENT TRUMP!
