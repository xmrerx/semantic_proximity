During Donald Trump s most recent rally in Tampa, Florida, he went on and one about the size of his dick crowd.
As if that is representative of poll numbers, which ironically show him losing nationwide.Because the cameras shooting the event didn t show the entire crowd size, Trump thought it wise to say that the room was packed to the corners and beats any crowd his opponent Hillary Clinton gets.What Trump didn t think to realize would be that reporters, like the Washington Post s Ed O Keefe, would quickly prove Trump to be a pants on fire liar McLiarface.Watch O Keefe s video here:VIDEO (again): Trump state fair hall not packed full as he falsely claims.

It s as if he doesn t think any of the press would quickly scan the room to notice that the room not only isn t packed but is barely filled at all.It s amazing that Trump will tout lie after lie after lie and his supporters eat it up with a spoon.
All the while believing that it s Hillary Clinton who is the actual liar.
Even though she was found to be the most fundamentally honest candidate out of anyone who ran on either side.You can, quite literally, listen to Trump and everything out of his mouth speaking against Hillary is what someone has said about him.
It s classic projecting and it s not even hidden well.
It s actually quite sad that so many are still falling for it.
However, those people vote and we need to make sure to get out the vote ourselves and make sure Trump doesn t get anywhere near the Oval Office.Featured image via video screen capture
