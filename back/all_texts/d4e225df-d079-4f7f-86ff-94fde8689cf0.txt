LONDON (Reuters) - British aid minister Priti Patel is flying back to London after cancelling a planned trip to Africa, the BBC reported on Wednesday, after local media reported she was facing the sack for not fully disclosing meetings during a holiday to Israel.
The BBC quoted unnamed sources as saying that she was on a plane.
Some on social media suggested she would arrive in London at around 1500 GMT.
