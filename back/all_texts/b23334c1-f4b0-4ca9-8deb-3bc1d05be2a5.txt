CNN s Ana Navarro becomes totally unhinged in an attack on president Trump and one of his advisers.
Her on-air tirade is so unhinged that the co-hosts just sit there in shock.
The irony is that she speaks in hateful terms of Trump while claiming he s going to cause someone to harm the news media.
That s pretty funny since she said nothing when a play depicting Trump being assassinated was all over the news and that Kathy Griffin beheaded Trump too!
This woman is supposed to be a Republican strategist ??
?Cry me a river CNN is not the victim and a meme is not inciting violence.
The left can t handle being called out!

She just tweeted this morning that she will never accept Trump as her President.
Well, it s going to be a looong 8 years for this political fraudster!Did she forget about all of the past Presidential moves that were much, much more offensive .Bill Clinton?
No, she won t mention that sexual deviant because the truth is that Navarro is a DEMOCRAT!Get this woman off of the cable shows as someone speaking on behalf of the Republican Party!
