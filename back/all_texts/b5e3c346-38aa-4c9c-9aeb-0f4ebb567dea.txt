A new report from the New York Times revealed some interesting goings-on with Team Trump.
For one, Donald Trump had his Twitter account taken away by his aides.
Even they know that Donald cannot control his temper.Stephen Bannon, who took over as Donald Trump s campaign manager while taking time off from Breitbart.com, has empowered the racist Alt-Right movement, giving them a voice in politics.While at the Radisson Hotel in downtown Manchester, Donald Trump s aides gathered to form a dialogue of what the GOP presidential nominee should say and what he should not say about FBI director James Comey s vague and bizarre letter that he sent to Congress which suggested that something pertinent was found in Anthony Weiner s emails regarding Hillary Clinton s private server controversy.The New York Times reports:They sent Michael T. Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general, onstage with a mission: stall.That s when Bannon s pants caught on fire.As the aides agonized over which words to feed into the teleprompter, they become so engrossed that a hot light set up next to the machine caused Mr. Bannon s Kuhl hiking pants to begin smoldering.
I think my pant leg is on fire, he said after noticing the acrid smell.Steve Bannon's pants literally caught fire when he was helping to craft a Trump speech.

Most of them were duplicates and the others were unrelated to government business.The investigative team had been working around the clock to process and review emails found on former New York congressman Anthony Weiner s laptop using a program that targeted only the emails to and from Clinton s closest aide, Huma Abedin, within the time when Clinton was secretary of state.They got nothing and that makes one wonder why Comey sent that letter to Congress to begin with.
Actually, we know why and the man needs to resign.Featured image via Kirk Irwin/Getty
