MADRID (Reuters) - Catalonia s parliament has canceled a meeting on Tuesday following the Spanish government s takeover of the region, a parliamentary source said on Monday, confirming the regional legislative had accepted Madrid s order for it to dissolve.
On Friday, Spain fired the Catalonian regional government and dismissed the Catalan parliament after political leaders defied Madrid and made a unilateral declaration of independence.
The central government s authority in the region was to be tested on Monday after prominent members of the Catalan administration had said they did not accept the move and a civic group called for civil disobedience to the ruling.
