One of the most insane things about Republican nominee Donald Trump is that even when he massively f*cks up, he can t help but brag about how smart and brilliant he is!
This has been especially true when it comes to his shady tax returns, which he still refuses to release to the American people despite several promises to be transparent.If you watched the first presidential debate between Trump and Hillary Clinton last week, you saw Trump shamelessly boast about how smart he was for not paying federal income taxes.
And after recent reports discovered that the business mogul hasn t paid taxes in almost two decades, Trump claimed to have brilliant , superior knowledge of America s tax codes, which allows him to manipulate the system to his advantage.
Well, the truth is coming out now that an ex-accountant of Trump has come forward.Jack Mitnick, one of Trump s former accountants, has given an interview with Inside Edition that exposes another one of Trump s many lies.
Mitnick was the accountant cited in the 1995 tax returns that were recently leaked, where Trump was shown to have lost a staggering one billion dollars in a year.
According to Mitnick, Trump doesn t even know anything about taxes, even though he claims to.
Mitnick said: I did all the tax preparation.
He never saw the product until it was presented to him for signature I m the one who did all the work.
This sounds exactly like typical Trump taking full credit for the hard work of other people.
The only thing Trump did that was perhaps smart was to hire a savvy accountant and yet he continues to try and convince America that his knowledge of how the tax system works makes him the better presidential candidate.
