singapore ( reuters ) - the u.s. navy plans to transport the uss john s. mccain to japan for a full damage assessment after a collision last month in which ten sailors died between malaysia and singapore .
moving the mccain to yosuka , where the navy has repair and maintenance facilities , would allow the crew to be close to their families , the naval systems command office said in a news release on thursday .
the guided missile destroyer is currently moored at singapore s changi naval base .
the move is notionally planned for late september .
the mccain suffered significant damage in the collision with a tanker east of the straits of malacca and singapore on aug. 21 .
compartments , including berthing , machinery , and communications rooms , were flooded .
the news release said a full assessment was needed to determine cost , schedule and location for the ship s repairs .
