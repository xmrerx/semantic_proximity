Is there any level to which Trump s press secretary, Sean Spicer, will not sink on behalf of his lying boss?
It seems not.
In another press conference today, he addressed the sheer size and scope of the Women s Marches, which took place all over the world, and said that they weren t protesting against Trump: A lot of these people were there to protest an issue of concern to them and not against anything.
Yeah, sure, alternative facts aren t facts and people aren t buying the alternative facts that Spicer and Trump have to sell.
The Women s Marches were absolutely about Trump, his election, and his misogyny women were sending him a message that we will not tolerate any efforts to step up oppression of us.That s reflected in the way Twitter responded to Spicer:@seanspicer I travelled 1200 miles to DC from Nebraska for the Women s March, and every marcher I spoke to along the way was anti-trump.

Trump is something.

Awesome keep it going.

@seanspicer said the Women s March was about various issues, not necessarily against anything.
This was 1.5 blocks from the White House pic.twitter.com/APiiXEQHFE George Zornick (@gzornick) January 23, 2017Recurring chant at the Boston Women s March: Hey ho, hey ho, Donald Trump has got to go @seanspicer NorahBrink (@nbrink77) January 23, 2017OH PLEASE SEAN SPICER DO MANSPLAIN THE WOMEN S MARCH TO US ((( Rachel Sklar ))) (@rachelsklar) January 23, 2017Or if you ve attended the Sean Spicer school of maths, about 11 people participated in the Women s March.
https://t.co/ktasdGSUGz Patrick Swagger (@TheSwagger) January 23, 2017@seanspicer Facts are facts.
Alternative facts are lies.
The Women s March was against Trump-and that s a fact.
Arlene Fischhoff (@kabfmd) January 23, 2017In other words, Spicer ought to give it up.
It s absurd that people have to take to Twitter to correct the White House press secretary on the lies he tells on behalf of his witless wonder of a lying boss.Sir Ian McKellan, who participated in the Women s March in London, picked up a sign near Trafalgar Square that perfectly epitomizes how we re all reacting to Spicer and Trump:When is someone going to attend a presser with rotten tomatoes to throw at Spicer?Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images
