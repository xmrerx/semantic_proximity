jerusalem ( reuters ) - israel s military on wednesday reduced by four months the 18-month jail term of an ex-soldier who killed an incapacitated palestinian assailant , saying his service record warranted clemency though he showed no remorse in the case .
in march 2015 , infantry conscript elor azaria was caught on videotape shooting dead a palestinian who was lying wounded after taking part in a stabbing attack on other israeli soldiers in the occupied west bank city of hebron .
azaria said he shot abd elfatah ashareef because he feared the palestinian could carry out another attack , but a court-martial found contradictions in the testimony and convicted him of manslaughter .
the verdict was upheld on appeal .
after being discharged from the military , azaria went to prison last month and appealed to the armed forces chief , lieutenant-general gadi eizenkot , to reconsider his sentence , citing the cost to his family of the acrimonious trial .
in a response letter made public on wednesday , the military informed azaria that eizenkot had decided to cut the jail term on grounds of compassion and mercy ... taking into account your past as a combat soldier in an operational theater .
but the letter also faulted the former soldier over grave actions for which you did not take responsibility and for which you did not express regret , adding that the important messages in the court rulings should be heeded .
azaria became a right-wing cause celebre in israel , where most jewish men and women are drafted at 18 for military service .
one poll found that nearly half of israeli jews believe any palestinian attacker should be killed on the spot .
the palestinian government said azaria s jail term had given israeli soldiers a green light to kill with impunity .
under israeli law , manslaughter can carry a maximum 20 years behind bars .
military prosecutors had asked the appeals court to impose a three- to five-year sentence on azaria , but were turned down .
