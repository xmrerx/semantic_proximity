the big question is who , in congress has the will to stop him ?
keep your notepads handy america , and start keeping track of who you will and won t re-elect in 2016.white house chief of staff denis mcdonough pushed back against the notion his president is played out in the wake of his last state of the union address , promising audacious executive action in barack obama s final year in office.during a breakfast with reporters in washington , d.c. , on tuesday , mcdonough responded to the observation that the president s final speech before congress lacked the usual pledge to go it alone if lawmakers failed to act.coupled with the feeble executive actions on gun control announced earlier this month , had president obama rethought the utility of acting unilaterally on issues important to the white house ?
we ll do audacious executive action over the course of the rest of the year , i m confident of that , said mcdonough , explaining that president obama s decision not to outline specific executive actions was more about a commitment to process than a lack of willpower .
process is your friend , but process also dictates what you can do , mcdonough said .
and we do want to make sure that the executive actions we undertake are not left hanging out there , subject to congress undoing them .
in addition to gun control , the white house has expressed interest in further unilateral actions on immigration reform , and in working around congress to close the prison in guantanamo bay .
but mcdonough said the white house is considering executive action on any and all issues , and that the main question president obama plans to ask himself is why not ?
and so that s the spirit through which we ll approach this last year , mcdonough said.via : national review
