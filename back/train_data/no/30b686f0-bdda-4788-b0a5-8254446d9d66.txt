jesse watters : gop can t drain the swamp when their own members are plugging the hole .
jesse watters made an excellent point about republicans and their failure to repeal obamacare .
the gop can t seem to get out of its own way .
the gop can t drain the swamp when their own members are standing in the way.watters nailed it !
this is so on point ! msnbc s joy reid confirmed what watters said when she commented on the three women watters mentioned and called them the resistance to trump : wednesday on msnbc s deadline : white house , network host joy reid said sens .
susan collins ( r-me ) , lisa murkowski ( r-ak ) and shelly moore capito ( r-wv ) stalled efforts in the senate to repeal obamacare because they are leading kind of the resistance to president donald trump .
( video below ) reid said , when it comes to politics i think it s such a man s world for so long it s so much of politics driven by men telling women what s best for them .
and that has not caught up to the 21st century in a lot of ways .
i think the most glaring spectacle we have seen is this 13 member , all male , all white commission deciding what s best for health care , including women s health care .
she continued , these three republican women are saying no .
and these three republican women are leading kind of the resistance to the bill , even within the gop .
i honestly have to say that , nicolle , on the trail last year covering the campaign i noticed among white women , in particular , there was not a drive a see a woman in the white house for its own sake .
but after the election , suddenly women are saying , wait a minute .
we are being taken advantage of .
and women are stepping up a little bit as well .
