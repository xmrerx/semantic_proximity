relinquishing control over border crossings with turkey , iran and syria was a demand made by iraq , iran and turkey in retaliation for the kurdish independence referendum held on monday in northern iraq .
backed by ankara and tehran , the iraqi government has demanded that the kurdish leadership cancel the result of the referendum or face sanctions , international isolation and possibly a military intervention .
