msnbc s chris matthews definitely didn t get a tingle up his leg when it came to democrat jon ossoff .
turns out he s confused over what ossoff was selling matthews said about ossoff : i don t know what the hell he was selling .
he wasn t selling much .
ossoff lost a race that was the most expensive house election ever to republican karen handel on tuesday night in a race democrats hoped to turn blue as a sign of national discontent with president donald trump .
outside donors from liberal states like california , spent big bucks to win this seat .
donations totaled a whopping $ 50 million1ossoff s loss has prompted much soul searching from democrats , including the left-leaning matthews.introducing his panel , matthews discussed the race , saying that he wasn t even really sure what ossoff was running on .
it seems to me that there was a lot of progressive hype about a guy who wasn t running as a progressive , which is another interesting twist to this , matthews said .
he was running on basically , let s get together and be normal or something .
i don t know what the hell he was selling .
he wasn t selling much , he said.further on in the discussion , matthews made fun of his panelists for the rapidly changing narrative pushed by democrats in the wake of yet another democratic defeat .
if it went for ossoff , you would be jumping up and down , saying how great a victory it was , right ?
come on , you re smiling .
i know you re smiling .
i know how people play politics .
if you lose , oh , no , big thing .
if you win , yay !
i mean , which is it ?
matthews asked.wow !

he s treating his guests with such a condescending tone .
