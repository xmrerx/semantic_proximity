washington ( reuters ) - u.s. climate envoy todd stern , who helped hammer out an international agreement in paris last year to curb carbon emissions and spur development of clean technologies will step down on april 1 , the state department said on monday .
stern , who was climate envoy for seven years , “ played an enormous role in achieving so many of our climate milestones , and the tireless work by todd and his team over many years will benefit future generations in every corner of the globe , ” secretary of state john kerry said in a release .
stern will be replaced by jonathan pershing , a geologist , who has spent the last three years at the department of energy , serving as senior climate adviser to ernest moniz , the department ’ s secretary .
fighting climate change has been one of president barack obama ’ s top priorities .
his administration , which is in its last year , says it can still meet its climate goals , despite the supreme court ’ s putting a pause on his clean power plan .
the plan has helped prompt a wide ranging switch from coal-fired power plants to natural gas-burning plants , which release less carbon emissions .
