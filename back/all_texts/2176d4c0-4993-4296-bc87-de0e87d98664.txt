Hillary Clinton 9/11 NYC pic.twitter.com/q9YnsjTxss Zdenek Gazda (@zgazda66) September 11, 2016UPDATE ON WHAT WENT ON BUT STILL SILENCE FROM THE PRESS: The Democratic presidential nominee appeared to faint on her way into her van and had to be helped by her security, the source said.
She was clearly having some type of medical episode.
Clinton s stumbled off the curb, her knees buckled and she lost a shoe as she was helped into a van during her unexpected early departure, a witness told Fox News.The NYPD retrieved her shoe.The lapdog media is downplaying this medical emergency (as expected) but would we even know about this had it not been for people recording her departure?
This was an area that press isn t allowed into.
The Clinton campaign came out with a statement saying she felt overheated and is now resting at Chelsea s apartment.
Do you believe this reason or are you skeptical like me?
Even if it was a fainting spell, this woman seems unwell with all the coughing.
Your thoughts?
