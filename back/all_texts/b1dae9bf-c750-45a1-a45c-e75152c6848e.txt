Remember that cute scene in the movie Love Actually when The Walking Dead s Andrew Lincoln declares his love for Keira Knightley using a series of clever cue cards?
Well, SNL just upped that scene with a very clever one of their own that we are sure Donald Trump will hate as much as he hates the cold opener.Cecily Strong, appearing as an elector in the scene, answers a knock at her door to find Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton standing there holding a stack of cue cards, attempting to sway her to vote for ANYONE but Donald Trump even John Kasich.
I know that you re an elector And on December 19th, you re supposed to vote for Donald Trump But bish, he cray.
The cards go on to read: Look, I know I lost the election And we may never know why **cough** Russia, You don t even have to vote for me Just vote literally for anyone else Like John Kasich Tom Hanks The Rock A rock.
That advice is very convincing, but it gets better!Watch the full sketch here:Featured image via video screenshot
