madrid ( reuters ) - spanish police have occupied the catalan government s communications hub on the eve of a banned independence referendum which madrid is attempting to thwart , the regional authority said on saturday .
tens of thousands of catalans are expected to vote in a ballot that will have no legal status as it has been blocked by spain s constitutional court and madrid has sent thousands of police to the northeastern region to stop it taking place .
but catalan leader carles puigdemont told reuters on friday that the referendum would go ahead regardless .
everything is prepared at the more than 2,000 voting points so they have ballot boxes and voting slips , and have everything people need to express their opinion , puigdemont said .
on saturday a catalan government spokesman said at least four police officers had entered the center in barcelona which controls the regional government s telecommunications and it and were expected to stay there for two days .
this followed an order by catalonia s high court on friday for police to prevent electronic voting taking place .
the court also instructed google to delete an application it said was being used to spread information on the vote .
police and spain s interior ministry did not confirm the action .
the head of the catalan regional police has ordered officers to evacuate and close polling stations by 6 a.m. on sunday , before the voting is due to open at 9 a.m. at a closing rally for the independence campaign in barcelona on friday , people formed the slogan referendum is democracy in large white letters on a stage in front of a cheering crowd , many draped in the red-and-yellow catalan flag .
other catalans camped out in polling stations in order to defy court orders to close them .
