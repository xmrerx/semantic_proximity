Republicans need to get a backbone, says former Congressman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) when asked about the testimony of Jared Kushner before the Senate Intelligence Committee.
Every time the Democrats say they need to call up Jared Kushner or Donald Trump Jr., then call up Chelsea Clinton, call up the Clintons.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Md3pmA-IZ_EChaffetz was on fire: There we have an Inspector General who issues a report stating an actual crime.
You have Bill Clinton, the former President, taking millions and millions of dollars from countries that Hillary Clinton was then going into and doing business.
So every time a Democrat says, I gotta talk to Donald Trump Jr., then go up and bring Chelsea Clinton in there.
Because she was involved in the Benghazi situation, she was involved with the Foundation.
I mean, when I tried as the chairman of the Oversight Committee, to bring in Ben Rhodes to talk about the Iran situation, nobody knows what the deal with Iran was, they claimed executive privilege.
Chaffetz says they would never do this to the Clintons and he s right on the money: They would never, ever, ever do this to the Clintons.
And that is what is fundamentally wrong with this.
They could have easily, out of all the people in the world they could have easily claimed executive privilege on this one, proximity to the President, it s his son-in-law, he s his closest adviser, he could have easily pulled that off.
But there he is, he s gonna go in there as an open book and they should get a lot of credit for it.
