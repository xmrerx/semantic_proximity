Normally, the thought of listening to Coldplay is the stuff of nightmares, just behind spooning with Sarah Palin and spending more than 20 seconds staring at Ted Cruz s face.
But something is happening that, for a few seconds, might just make what would normally be an act of self-torture tolerable: Coldplay has announced that the President s moving rendition of Amazing Grace will be included on their next album.The band s frontman, Chris Martin, says the singing voice of President Barack Obama will make an appearance on upcoming album, A Head Full of Dreams, which is due to be released next month.
He told British tabloid The Sun: We have a tiny clip of the president singing Amazing Grace.
Because of the historical significance of what he did and also that that song being about, I m lost but now I m found .
The publication notes that the band has obtained both Obama s personal permission to use his voice, and that of the church in which the golden words were recorded.A source close to the band added: Barack Obama wouldn t let just anyone feature his vocals on the record, especially considering what a deeply emotional moment it was for him.
But he clearly loves Coldplay and is happy to be a part of their music history.
The band were obviously thrilled.
They needed to get permission from Obama himself and the Charleston church it was recorded in.
I met Barack Obama in the summer and one thing he said to me was, Oh I have your songs on my iPod, but I just thought, Oh I bet he says that to every pop star he meets, Martin says.
I can t get my head around the notion that the President of the USA would have any of my songs on his playlist.
It is just too surreal.
While many would question the President s choice in music, none can deny that it would truly be an honor for any band to obtain the President s personal permission to use his voice in their songs.Watch the President show off his dulcet tones below:Featured image via Getty
