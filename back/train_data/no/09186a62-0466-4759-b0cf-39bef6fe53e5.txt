last night , at a rally in melbourne , florida , trump was trying to build more fear of brown people in his base of loyalists by referencing a completely imaginary terror attack in sweden .
since then , he s received an earful from the former prime minister of sweden , prompted questions from confused swedes , and social media has been abuzz with mockery of the imaginary attack , too.one would have expected trump to respond fairly quickly , since he s now formally joined the ranks of kellyanne conway and sean spicer when it comes to fake terror attacks , but he didn t. he waited until this afternoon to respond , and it s extremely laughable : my statement as to what s happening in sweden was in reference to a story that was broadcast on @ foxnews concerning immigrants & sweden .
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) february 19 , 2017yes , sure , by all means , let s call this debacle fox news fault and completely ignore the words that actually spewed forth from his mouth : you look at what s happening last night in sweden .
sweden !
who would believe this ?
sweden !
they took in large numbers .
they re having problems that they never thought possible .
twitter , meanwhile , is positively gleeful in their mockery of the liar of liars for another egregious lie : @ realdonaldtrump none of which referred to anything that happened two nights ago .

mark machado ( @ markmachado ) february 19 , 2017 maybe , just as a change of pace and maybe to keep all of us on our toes , he should actually take responsibility for what he says and apologize .
but what are we talking about ?
trump is one of the worst pathological liars in the long , sad history of pathological liars.featured image by joe raedle via getty images
