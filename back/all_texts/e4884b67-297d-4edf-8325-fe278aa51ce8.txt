During the Republican primaries, the biggest feud (if you don t include Donald Trump and Megyn Kelly) seemed to be between Ted Cruz and the man who is now the President Elect.
Now, Cruz is one of Trump s strongest supporters.
Well, he seems to be one of Trump s strongest supporters, except for the fact that Cruz can t seem to make himself say that Trump isn t a liar.In May, Cruz went on a rant calling Trump a pathological liar, after Trump accused Cruz father of being involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy.
Yes, that a how insane the election of 2016 got.
(Trump) doesn t know the difference between truth and lies, he lies practically every word that comes out of his mouth.
Here s that somewhat surreal exchange between Cruz and the media from May:Just to recap: Trump insults not just his rival, but his rival s family.
Cruz calls Trump a pathological liar, and now Cruz is a Trump supporter.
Well, they do say politics makes strange bedfellows.Still, it appears Cruz hasn t quite let it go.
On Sunday s This Week, Cruz was asked, Do you still think Donald Trump is a liar?
Cruz had no answer, other than to say, You know, I m not going to re-litigate the past.
I m going to focus on the future.
I m going to focus on what s in front of us.
Here s the video:While it s become the stereotype that politicians lack principles, it s apparent that for many in the Republican party, principles sell for cheap.
Cruz has long been among Trump s most vocal critics, and suddenly, none of that matters because with Trump a.)
Cruz sees an opportunity for a cabinet position, and b.)
Cruz thinks his dream of a theocratic government will finally come true under Trump.
Cruz might be right on both counts.Featured image via video screen capture
