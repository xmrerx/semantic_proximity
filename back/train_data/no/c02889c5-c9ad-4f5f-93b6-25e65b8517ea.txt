copenhagen ( reuters ) - denmark s prince henrik , the husband of queen margrethe , has been diagnosed with dementia , a condition that has affected his behavior and judgment , the palace said on wednesday .
the announcement came weeks after the 83-year-old announced he did not want to be buried next to his wife , saying he was unhappy he had never been acknowledged as her equal .
following a longer diagnostic process and lately a series of examinations during late summer , a specialist team ... has now concluded that his royal highness prince henrik suffers from dementia , the royal house said in a statement .
the extent of the cognitive failure is ... greater than expected considering the age of the prince , it added .
henrik , who married margrethe in 1967 , retired last year and renounced his title of prince consort , saying he was disappointed not to be named king consort .
since then he has participated in very few official duties and spent much of his time at his private vineyard in france .
in denmark , a princess traditionally becomes queen when her husband takes the throne , but a man does not become king when the roles are reversed .
