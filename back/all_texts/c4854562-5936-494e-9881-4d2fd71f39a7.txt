WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump called on the Republican Congress to pass a short-term government spending bill later on Thursday to avoid a shutdown when current funding expires at midnight on Friday.
Republicans in the House of Representatives have unveiled a stopgap spending bill that would allow the government to stay open at current funding levels.
“Pass the C.R.
(continuing resolution) TODAY and keep our Government OPEN!” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.
