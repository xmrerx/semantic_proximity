the democrat s war on mostly ugly women former pennsylvania gov .
ed rendell believes that donald trump will ultimately lose the support of women because of his past comments , arguing that there are more ugly women in the united states than attractive women.rendell , a former two-term governor in the keystone state , made the remarks to the washington post in a piece on trump s attempt to make inroads with suburban voters , particularly in the philadelphia suburbs .
he told the post s dave weigel that for every woman he wins , he ll lose 1 1/2 or two gop women voters .
will he have some appeal to working-class dems in levittown or bristol ?
sure , rendell told the post .
for every one he ll lose 1 1/2 , two republican women .
trump s comments like you can t be a 10 if you re flat-chested , that ll come back to haunt him .
there are probably more ugly women in america than attractive women , rendell added .
people take that stuff personally .
wendell , also a former democratic national committee chairman , has long been a top surrogate for former secretary of state hillary clinton , having supported her in her 2008 bid for the white house .
