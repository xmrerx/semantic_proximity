beijing ( reuters ) - chinese authorities on monday arrested a japanese citizen suspected of spying , local state media said .
the arrest was made in the port city of dalian in the northeastern liaoning province , which borders north korea , the official dalian daily s online report said .
the report said ken higuchi was being investigated by the dalian city national security bureau on suspicion of spying against china , and that prosecutors had approved his arrest .
the character given for higuchi s first name could also be the names takeshi or takeru .
it was unclear from the report , however , whether higuchi was a new case or whether he had been detained earlier , and the latest development was his formal arrest .
china detained six japanese nationals in march on suspicion of illegal activities .
four of the six returned to japan in july , three of whom were there doing geological research into hotsprings , according to their employer .
china s foreign ministry also in july said that a single japanese citizen was being investigated on suspicion of harming china s national security .
reuters was unable to contact japan s foreign ministry by telephone .
monday was a national holiday in japan .
china s relationship with japan has been strained for decades over the legacy of japan s wartime aggression , while a maritime territorial dispute over small islands in the east china sea has in recent years added to the suspicion between the two sides .
in 2010 , four japanese nationals were detained in china on suspicion of entering a military zone and taking photographs without permission .
at least two japanese citizens were arrested on suspicion of espionage in 2015 .
last year , china said it was investigating a japanese citizen on suspicion of endangering national security .
