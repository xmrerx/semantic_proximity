Donald Trump is too lazy to take a proper Christmas photo to share with the American people.Instead, he merely took a screenshot of himself raising his small fist in front of a Christmas tree and photoshopped the words Merry Christmas on it.#MerryChristmas pic.twitter.com/5GgDmJrGMS Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 25, 2016You know, because taking a picture with his wife and kids is too much work.Well, Twitter didn t let Trump get away with it and promptly took the time on Christmas morning to tell him to go f*ck himself.
@tonyposnanski @realDonaldTrump only Donald would send a Christmas card reminding us of our impending doom.
Jen Dent (@JentotheDen) December 25, 2016@JentotheDen @tonyposnanski @realDonaldTrump I also love that it s just him, no family, no warmth, just a tiny fist and a tree.

Yesterday him and Melaina wished people a Happy #Hanukkah.
Today it is just him with a fist in the air at a rally.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) December 25, 2016@realDonaldTrump you love seeing your own face don t ya Matt Shore (@mattshore) December 25, 2016.
@realDonaldTrump Oh Donald I know you think that looks handsome, but do one without the smug look and fist in the air.

Mary Wooten (@mfwooten1) December 25, 2016@realDonaldTrump Your message is insincere after expressing bigotry toward so many people.
You are unfit to lead.

@realDonaldTrump Based on pic, seems your endgame to ending War on Christmas was to make yourself God?
Shannon Watts (@shannonrwatts) December 25, 2016@realDonaldTrump Remember, you re one of the most hated people to have ever lived.

(@RejectTrump) December 25, 2016Unlike Trump, President Obama knows what Christmas is all about and shared this wonderful picture of himself with his wife and two daughters with a nice Christmas message to the American people.The best part of the holidays is the time we share with those we love.
On behalf of Michelle, Malia, and Sasha, Merry Christmas everyone.
pic.twitter.com/EznGyxluS8 President Obama (@POTUS) December 25, 2016Yet, Republicans claim Trump is the one who has family values.Two hours after Obama s tweet, Trump posted this bullshit.Merry Christmas and a very, very, very , very Happy New Year to everyone!
