WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump has invited all Republican senators to discuss healthcare over lunch at the White House on Wednesday, the day after the party’s push to overhaul Obamacare collapsed in the U.S. Senate, a White House official said on Tuesday.
“There is movement on healthcare,” the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity, and without providing further detail on developments.
