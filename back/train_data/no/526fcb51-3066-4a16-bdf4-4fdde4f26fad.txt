it s teetering on the ridiculous watching the us mainstream media get their knickers in a twist over donald trump s provocative comments during the last presidential debate about the possibility of election rigging , and whether or not he would respect the official result on november 8th.paul ryan , the republican speaker of the house , also weighed in decriying trump s assertion akin to a threat to democracy , stating , our democracy relies on confidence in election results , and the speaker is fully confident the states will carry out this election with integrity .
more than a bit melodramatic , considering recent history it seems that the unashamed pro-clinton us mainstream media have an incredibly short memory .
remember the 2000 presidential race between george w. bush ( republican ) and al gore ( democrat ) ?
it was not only contested , the election was eventually called on a technicality by the us supreme court.who held up the election : the very same democratic party who are going hysterical over trump s recent off-hand remarks .
again , that same democratic party also cried foul in 2004 , when john kerry lost by a narrow margin to the incumbent bush.was there fraud and rigging in 2000 and 2004 ?
many leading leftwing media pundits still think so , and yet the us liberal-dominated mainstream media and political savants still equate trump s comments with a coup d etat threat.brasscheck tv says : here s sanitized , mainstream news media s account of the endless campaign of 2000 .
and even their version is wild and unbelievable anyone who has seriously studied the issue knows that the level of voter fraud , although not zero , is minuscule , and that in-person impersonation hardly ever exists .
yet by saying it over and over , trump is fanning flames that are dangerous for our democracy .
always the dutiful gatekeeper and establishment-controlled media arm , cnn makes the old pravda seem like zero hedge.read more election news at : 21st century wire 2016 filessupport our work subscribe & become a member @ 21wire.tv
