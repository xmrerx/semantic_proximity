With his son Ammon Bundy in jail with most of the the militants who had been occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Harney County, Oregon, Cliven Bundy has decided to take matters into his own hands.
In a letter addressed to the authorities responsible for the arrests of many of the militants and the death of one, Cliven Bundy says that the folks still occupying the refuge will fight to the death.
The letter read, in part: This is notice that We the People of Harney County and also We the People of the citizens of the United States DO GIVE NOTICE THAT WE WILL RETAIN POSSESSION OF THE HARNEY COUNTY RESOURCE CENTER.
Harney County Resource Center is the name the militants have given to the refuge in place of its original name.The letter was posted to the Bundy Ranch Facebook page, in full:// < !

Sheriff.Share share share ..Posted by Bundy Ranch on Monday, February 1, 2016This stunt shows that Bundy is even more of an idiot than his son, who had requested that the occupation end after the arrests and after the death of LaVoy Finicum.
Bundy said to the media during an interview: What this is saying is that Cliven Bundy is taking control of things.
If we don t retain it, then we ve lost everything that we ve done in the last two months.
We re not gonna give up.
This is not Ammon s message.
This is my message We ve made a decision to retain it The feds are going to get out of there.
Remove all federal and state policing agents out of Harney County.
So, with his son in jail along with the majority of supporters jailed as well, Cliven sees fit to make demands of all authorities.
He also says that he does not believe that Ammon really wanted the occupation to end, but said that he did under duress: That s what he said, but I never believed it.
I don t think that s what s in his heart.
He probably got his arm twisted.
Ammon Bundy s statement, however, seems to run contrary to what his father wants: To those who remain at the refuge, I love you.
Let us take this fight from here Please stand down.
Go home and hug your families.
This fight is ours for now, in the courts.
The four who are left are choosing to remain, demanding that they not be prosecuted despite the huge number of crimes they have obviously committed.Bundy and all involved in emboldening this ridiculousness all need to go to jail for a long, long time, their demands be damned.
This lawlessness has gone on more than long enough.Featured image from Gage Skidmore/Flickr via Raw Story
