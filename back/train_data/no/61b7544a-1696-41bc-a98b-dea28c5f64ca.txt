mexico city ( reuters ) - the mexican government on thursday said it had declared the north korean ambassador to mexico persona non grata in protest at the country s nuclear tests , an unusually firm step that moved it closely into line with washington .
in a statement , the government said it had given kim hyong gil 72 hours to leave mexico in order to express its absolute rejection of north korea s recent nuclear activity , describing it as a grave threat to the region and the world .
mexico has traditionally sought to steer clear of diplomatic ructions , but in the past few months it has adopted robust language to condemn the governments of venezuela and north korea as they descended into increasing international isolation .
facing a rocky relationship with u.s. president donald trump due to his threats to tear up the north american free trade agreement ( nafta ) , mexico has backed him diplomatically on issues that imply no great political cost for the government .
north korea s nuclear activity is a serious risk for international peace and security and represents a growing threat to nations in the region , including fundamental allies of mexico like japan and south korea , the mexican government said .
mexico s step follows a tide of international condemnation of north korea for repeated missile launches in recent weeks that intensified again following a nuclear test on sunday .
an official at the mexican foreign ministry noted , however , that president enrique pena nieto s government was not breaking diplomatic ties with north korea .
