in case people weren t already aware , lesbians exist .
i know , shocking , right ?
i mean , one even wrote this article .
reading this could be exposing you to unadulterated homosexuality .
yet , if you re not gay , it s not going to turn you gay .
just as me watching every disney film featuring an extremely heterosexual princess did not turn me straight .
so , how great would it be if their were a lesbian princess ? however , it looks as though some folks just couldn t wrap their heads around a simple , innocent request to give elsa from disney s hit movie frozen a girlfriend.i hope disney makes elsa a lesbian princess imagine how iconic that would be alexis isabel ( @ lexi4prez ) may 1 , 2016dear @ disney , # giveelsaagirlfriend alexis isabel ( @ lexi4prez ) may 1 , 2016it would be iconic , and about damn time .
although , many of us already assumed elsa was gay , and maybe merida from brave too .
oooh , how cute would they be together ? unfortunately , there are still a lot of stupid people out there who love to make sure their hatred of the lgbt community is as visible as possible .
the homophobia speweth over : why ?
this is a childrens film # giveelsaagirlfriend pic.twitter.com/xxwsoxjqlh witchy the kitten .
( @ witchysmiles ) may 2 , 2016 # giveelsaagirlfriend is disgusting conrad schwarz ( @ conradancat ) may 2 , 2016this person apparently believes homosexuality is an alternative who knows , maybe it is for them .
who am i to judge ? .
@ disney please # dontgiveelsaagirlfriend .
# giveelsaagirlfriend is a terrible idea .
do n't make alternative sexuality an issue for children .
evangelicalarminians ( @ arminiansociety ) may 2 , 2016this person thinks everyone is gay now .
in a perfect world , but alas , no # giveelsaagirlfriend , are y'all fr ?
why does everyone have to be `` gay '' now ?

tyler thompson ( @ the_tythompson ) may 2 , 2016 # giveelsaagirlfriend there is no reason not to , it 's time to teach children of all genders that homosexuality is just as normal and valid wasd ( @ phancied ) may 2 , 2016 # giveelsaagirlfriend we need this .
so many families could benefit from this , lets bring kids up to accept all kinds of love .
jenny 2.0 ( jasmine ) ( @ laurentomyholly ) may 2 , 2016some pointed out the delicious hypocrisy : # giveelsaagirlfriend if it 's `` okay '' for a girl to date a beast & sexualize a fish , then ofc its okay to date the same gender .
# loveislove reana ( ep trash ) ( @ reana_s_ ) may 2 , 2016ya think ?
! although , this tweet pretty much sums things up perfectly : spoiler alert : frozen was a metaphor for a closeted person learning to love herself and your children adored it .
# giveelsaagirlfriend twitnter is coming ( @ ohnoshetwitnt ) may 3 , 2016no matter which way you look at it , it shouldn t matter either way , and the all the homophobes out there really need to let it go .
