Khizr Khan has been nailing Trump ever since he denounced the Republican nominee s hateful rhetoric at Hillary Clinton s Democratic National Convention last week.
Things have only escalated as Trump has repeatedly attacked Khan and his wife, who lost their son, Muslim Army Captain Humayan Khan, while he was fighting for our country.But now that Trump has made some truly heartless, disrespectful comments about receiving a Purple Heart from one of his supporters yesterday, Khan came out in full blast and is more furious than ever that Trump disrespected every veteran by saying, I always wanted to get the Purple Heart.
This was much easier.
In an interview with CNN s Anderson Cooper, Khan shamed Trump and called the acceptance of the medal heartless.
Khan insisted that Trump should have pinned that back to that veteran s chest and should have hugged him and thanked him!
Khan, making sure that no one forgets that Trump had the chance to serve his country, and he dodged the draft instead, said: You had your chance.
You escaped.
You dodged the draft and now you want an easy Purple Heart in your pocket?
You should have pinned it back.
Even now, call that man.
I want his surrogates to call that man, thank him and put that Purple Heart back on that person s chest.
He wants to be the leader, commander-in-chief of this United States of America?
That is the thoughtfulness?
He should have put that Purple Heart back.
If he would have been sensible he would have known what it takes to earn that Purple Heart.
In fact, Trump had five deferments so that he could avoid serving his country, yet he thinks he is worthy of accepting a veteran s Purple Heart?
Really, there is no one more undeserving of a Purple Heart than Trump.
