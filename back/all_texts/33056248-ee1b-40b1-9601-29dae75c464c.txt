Roughly 70% of states use some form of electronic voting machine.
The ease with which these machines can be manipulated is stunning Donald Trump said this week that he fears the election will be rigged for Hillary Clinton.
Although he didn t specify exactly how Clinton, her team, or her supporters would commit widespread voter fraud, allowing her to steal a Presidential election, he insisted that the 2012 Presidential election demonstrated a cause for significant concern.I ve been hearing about it for a long time, Trump told CNN.
And I know last time, there were you had precincts where there was practically nobody voting for the Republican.
And I think that s wrong.
I think that was unfair, frankly.
Many of Trump s supporters agree.But how easy is it to actually rig an election?
It turns out that while voting machines are notoriously easy to hack, throwing a national election is a major operation that would require serious technical firepower.In a recent CBS News report, hackers demonstrated that individual electronic voting machines the kind used in most precincts are particularly vulnerable.WATCH:Via: Heat Street
