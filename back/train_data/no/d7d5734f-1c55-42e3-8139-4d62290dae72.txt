does a judge have the right to determine what a mother and or father names their child ?
don t think for one minute in this politically correct environment we re living in , this couldn t happen right here in the united states some names are so bizarre , we can t believe they ve ever been given to children .
but a recent landmark case just went a step further by telling a mother she can t give her newborn twins the names she chose.the mother , who is from powys , wales , attempted to name her offspring cyanide and preacher .
she believed cyanide was a pretty name for a little girl with positive implications since it s the poison that killed both hitler and his follower joseph goebbels , according to metro .
she also argued that she had the right to name her own children .
however , justice eleanor king ruled that the name could cause emotional harm to the child in the future .
it is hard to see how the twin girl could regard being named after this deadly poison as other than a complete rejection of her by her birth mother , said king.the twins , now 8 months old , were reportedly conceived of rape .
they were placed in foster care , along with their three half-siblings , due to the mother s history of mental illness and drug and alcohol abuse.social workers from powys county council brought the case to the british appeal court .
an injunction had previously been issued to prevent the mother from formally registering the names .
this is one of those rare cases where the court should intervene to protect the girl twin from emotional harm , said king .
