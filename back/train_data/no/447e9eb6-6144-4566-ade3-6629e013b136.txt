jerusalem ( reuters ) - israel s mayor of jerusalem nir barkat said on tuesday that moving the u.s. embassy in israel from tel aviv to the holy city can take two minutes .
senior u.s. officials have said president donald trump is likely on wednesday to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital while delaying relocating the embassy from tel aviv for another six months , though he is expected to order his aides to begin planning such a move immediately .
the officials said , however , that no final decisions have been made as an outcry grew across the middle east and among world powers against any unilateral u.s. decision on jerusalem .
barkat said the united states would only have to convert one of its existing assets in the city , such as its consulate located in west jerusalem .
they just take the symbol of the consulate and switch it to the embassy symbol - two american marines can do it in two minutes , and give the ambassador david friedman a space to sit in , barkat told israel radio .
the implementation of this decision is immediate and then later slowly start moving the employees in a more structured manner to begin providing services in jerusalem , barkat said .
the status of jerusalem is one of the major stumbling blocks in decades of on-and-off israeli-palestinian peace talks .
the palestinians want east jerusalem as the capital of their future state .
israel considers all of the city its indivisible , eternal capital .
jerusalem is home to sites holy to islam , judaism and christianity israel captured arab east jerusalem during the 1967 middle east war and later annexed it , a move not recognized internationally .
u.s. endorsement of israel s claim to all of jerusalem as its capital would break with decades of u.s. policy that the city s status must be decided in negotiations with the palestinians .
