PARIS (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron said on Friday that France s position on Brexit talks had not changed and that there could be no talks on the future relationship between Britain and the EU as long as issues around citizen rights, Ireland and the divorce bill had not been settled.
As far as France is concerned, we won t change the agreed process in any way, and we won t open talks on the future relationship as long as the conditions set in the first phase have not been met, he said at an EU summit in Gothenburg, Sweden.
