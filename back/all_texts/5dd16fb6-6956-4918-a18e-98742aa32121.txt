On Friday, Donald Trump embarrassed himself with a tweet, as is becoming a daily ritual, that was so stupid that seemingly all of Twitter could not help but come together to mock the orange sh*tgibbon in the White House.
Trump continued his anti-Muslim tirade by reaching deep inside himself and tweeting We must keep evil out of our country .
We must keep "evil" out of our country!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 3, 2017To even the most casual observer, it is obvious that Trump is referencing his Muslim ban, which was an effort to keep people of one specific religion from entering our country and, of course, that the word Islam was intended to fill in the quotes.
Americans responded to The Donald s latest dogwhistle by asking him when the f*ck he s going to be stepping down and leaving our country.
@realDonaldTrump cool, so when are you packing up?

@realDonaldTrump Then get the fuck out of my country, stop dismantling its institutions, and stop emboldening Nazis.
Starkles (@dcstarkey) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump 65 million of us tried to do that.
John Pavlovitz (@johnpavlovitz) February 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump Putting it in inverted commas means you're using 'evil' as a euphemism.
Let's try and guess what word you actually mean.

(@YourAnonCentral) February 3, 2017The Trump administration has not had a good time of it lately.
From completely making up a terrorist attack and blaming Muslims for it to f*cking up relations with Australia, a country that has had our back always since World War I, to threatening to send troops to Mexico, the Trump Team has done nothing but make our country less safe by antagonizing our allies and enemies alike in his selfish quest to satisfy his overinflated and undeserved ego all while empowering the Ku Klux Klan, Nazis, and other real Americans who want their 1950 s America back.To most of us, that is the true evil.
