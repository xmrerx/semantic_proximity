The usual suspects are going to show up tonight for President Trump s rally in Phoenix, AZ.
With Soros and Democrat donors throwing money at rent-a-mobs, you can bet the faux protesters will be out in droves tonight with their mass-produced identical signs.

In addition to organizing mass protests outside the rally, Indivisible is encouraging protesters to register for tickets for the rally itself, increasing the likelihood that protesters will disrupt Trump s speech, as often happens at Trump s rallies.Although originally founded by activists not backed by donors, Indivisible s website now states that the group is a project of the Advocacy Fund, a progressive advocacy group that receives money from the Open Society Policy Center, an arm of Soros Open Society Foundations.
That revelation follows USA Today s reporting in May that leaders of Indivisible and Women s March met with Democracy Alliance, a Soros-led network of left-wing donors, to discuss funding options.VIA: DAILY CALLERVia: Truthfeed
