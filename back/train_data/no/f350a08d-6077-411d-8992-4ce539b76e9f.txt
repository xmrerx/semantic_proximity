mas was described by federal prosecutors as the overt arm of the u.s. muslim brotherhood , and icna is recognized as the front for the pakistani islamist group jamaat-e-islami ( jei ) founded by one of the foremost thinkers on modern jihad , syed abul a la maududi.at the event , mas leader khalilah sabra openly discussed the importance of muslim support for black lives matter , and urged revolution .
