I think that maybe I wouldn t be here if it wasn t for Twitter, Donald Trump told Fox News earlier this year.
This possibility apparently has Twitter co-founder Evan Williams staying up at night, as he just apologized for any role Twitter played in putting Orange Mussolini in the White House.
It s a very bad thing, Twitter s role in that, Williams told the New York Times in an article published Saturday.
If it s true that he wouldn t be president if it weren t for Twitter, then yeah, I m sorry.
This isn t the first time Williams has expressed dismay at the impact of social media on Trump s message of hate.
What we tend to forget is that Zeus was so pissed at Prometheus that he chained him to a rock so eagles could peck out his guts for eternity, he said in a commencement speech at the University of Nebraska earlier this month.
Some would say that s what we deserve for giving the power of tweets to Donald Trump.
Unfortunately, Trump is correct that Twitter played a huge role in swinging his election his way especially with numerous paid Russian trolls on his side spreading lies about his opponent.Even more unfortunately, the lies and hate he continues to tweet as President* are continuing to have a deleterious impact on our nation.Featured image via Getty Images/Pool
