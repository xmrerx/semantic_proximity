kabul ( reuters ) - islamic state claimed responsibility for a suicide attack on monday on a compound of afghanistan s national intelligence agency in kabul , which killed at least five people and wounded two .
the blast comes a week after the group claimed responsibility for an attack on a training facility of the same agency , the national directorate for security , in kabul that ended when the attackers were killed before causing significant casualties .
in a statement issued through the group s amaq news agency , islamic state said it was also behind monday s attack .
in kabul , security officials said the explosion was caused by a suicide bomber who approached the agency s entrance on foot before blowing himself up .
all the casualties reported were of civilian passersby .
najib danish , a spokesman for the interior ministry , said at least five people were killed and two wounded .
u.s. president donald trump has been briefed on the attack , white house press secretary sarah sanders said .
islamic state s local affiliate , which first appeared in eastern afghanistan near the border with pakistan in early 2015 , has become increasingly active and has claimed several recent suicide attacks in kabul .
it has frequently fought taliban militants and has been heavily targeted by u.s. air strikes and special forces operations in its main stronghold in nangarhar province .
but there remains considerable uncertainty about how the group operates and the exact nature of its connections with islamic state in iraq and syria .
