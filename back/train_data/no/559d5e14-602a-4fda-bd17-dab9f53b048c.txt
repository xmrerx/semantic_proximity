while pundits at msnbc , cnn , fox and the major networks appear before the cameras in full make-up telling millions of viewers who won the debate , middle america was making up their minds that one candidate no longer represented their values , and certainly didn t care about their jobs .
hillary may have won over the voters who don t care that she is a ruthless woman who has scratched , and clawed her way to the top , simply because she comes equipped with the proper genitalia .
but in the real world , voters are looking for a president who they can trust to protect and defend their jobs , someone who doesn t put the urgency of taxing americans to solve man-made global warming before our national security or before the opportunity to put food on their table or pay for braces for their teenagers youngstown , pa. ken reed sat down at main bar of the tin lizzy tavern with two things in mind , to dig into the tavern s oversized cheese steak and watch the presidential debate .
i am hungry and undecided in that order , he said digging into the savory dish in a bar that dates back to 1746.kady letoksy , a paralegal by day , a waitress and bartender at night at the tin lizzy sat beside him , at 28 she has never voted before , she is now thinking it might be a good idea.letosky entered the evening undecided in a town that is heavily democratic in registration , her dad she says is extremely liberal her sister the opposite .
trump had the upper-hand this evening , she said , citing his command of the back-and-forth between her and clinton.reed , 35 , is a registered democrat and small businessman , by the end of the debate , clinton never said a thing to persuade me that she had anything to offer me or my family or my community , he said sitting at the same bar that had local icons as regulars , such as the late fred rogers , and arnold palmer who had his own stash of pm whiskey hidden behind newer bottles of whiskey for his regular visits .
have to say trump had the edge this evening , he came out swinging but also talked about specifics on jobs and the economy , reed said.reed said clinton came across as either smug or as though she was reading her resume , adding there was nothing on her resume that reached his life , i am a small businessman , a farmer , come from a long line of farmers and coal miners , the policies she talked about tonight ultimately either hurt me or ignore me , he said.that is how today s cosmopolitan and political classes view main street voters as people whose values , traditions , skills , jobs , and lives are being replaced by something new .
i ve been a democrat all of my life , but when clinton mentions her husband and the jobs he brought to the country in the nineties it s not a fair assessment , she is no moderate democrat the way he was , her policies would not bring back jobs , said nathan nemick.it burns nemick when clinton references her husband , like she did in the debate on trade and jobs , she is nothing like him , he said of the democrat he admired in his youth.pennsylvania is a high-stakes state for both candidates , but particularly clinton , and westmoreland is a high-stakes county , particularly for trump.she needs to win this state , and he needs not just to win this county but to do so by 2,000 more votes than mitt romney did in 2012.westmoreland is one of about 10 formerly or traditionally democrat-blue counties across the state where trump must drive up a higher-than-normal turnout , or even flip them to republican-red , in order to offset an anticipated high turnout for clinton in philadelphia.between 1960 and 2000 , westmoreland county democrats handily won presidential races with one exception : ronald reagan s 1980 victory.by 1984 , voters here were back to their democratic allegiances , giving their votes to walter mondale , michael dukakis and bill clinton.when al gore turned the party towards its progressive wing in 2000 , however , he left behind westmoreland county democrats.democrats here are more traditional in their values they are pro-gun , pro-life , pro-coal something today s democratic party has left no room for.trump probably connects better with such voters than did romney in 2008 , or john mccain in 2004 ; a large part of the reason is his outside-the-box style .
yet , for him to win the state , such voters need to turn out in force here and elsewhere to offset philly s overwhelming numbers .
he was just a regular guy , just a working class guy at heart like everyone else around here , said jim sciabica , the unofficial bar manager and small businessman , who kept mr. palmer s pm whiskey tucked in a corner away from patrons and workers .
