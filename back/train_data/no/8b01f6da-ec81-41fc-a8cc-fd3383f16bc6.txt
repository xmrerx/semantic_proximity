moscow ( reuters ) - sea trips between vladivostok , russia and isolated north korea have resumed after a two-month break , with the transport of cargo , the ria news agency reported on monday , quoting the head of the company operating the route .
the north korean-flagged mangyonbong left the russian port for north korea s rajin on sunday , ria said , citing the company s director general , vladimir baranov .
the ferry line , the only one between the two countries , was opened in may to carry cargo and passengers , predominantly chinese tourists .
it stopped operating in august , however , because the port in vladivostok refused to provide services to the vessel after the company failed to pay for them , ria reported citing a port official .
the ferry service was launched in may in spite of calls by the united states for countries to curtail relations with pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs .
on monday , katina adams , a spokeswoman for the u.s. state department , said washington expected all u.n. member states , including russia , to fully implement u.n. sanctions on north korea and urged countries to take additional steps to apply maximum pressure on ( north korea ) , including by cutting their economic and diplomatic ties .
baranov said the ferry was carrying only cargoes and no passengers for now , though the company was in talks with the port to resume passenger traffic , ria said .
pyongyang s nuclear tests and missile launches have stirred global tensions and prompted several rounds of international sanctions at the u.n. security council .
russia has condemned north korea s weapons testing but opposes u.s.-led efforts to isolate north korea economically .
president vladimir putin on monday signed a decree imposing restrictions on north korea in order to comply with a u.n. security council resolution introduced in response to pyongyang s missile tests in late 2016 .
