When one searches for the perfect way to describe supporters of Donald Trump, many things come to mind.
Many are white supremacists.
They re almost all Islamophobic bigots.
They re definitely uneducated cretinous taint barnacles.
They re violent people who express their discontent in the form of beatings.
But no one, no one, has described Trump fans so perfectly as GOP strategist Rick Wilson.Responding to a question about Trump s massive white supremacist following on MSNBC s All In With Chris Hayes, Wilson let his frustration with the sort of people Trump is attracting fly loose.
I think that there is definitely still a very significant portion of the party that is a limited government conservatism based faction of the overall coalition, Wilson said.
Now the screamers and the crazy people on the all-right as they call it, you know, who love Donald Trump, who have plenty of Hitler iconography in their Twitter icons and names They sure do, Hayes interrupted.
I can back that up.
Wilson continued:Yes, he went there: Donald Trump s supporters are basement-dwelling neckbeards who possess a strong sense of ethnic nationalism and are brought to climax by pictures of cartoon characters.
Wilson says that, despite Trump s wide appeal among conservatives, he doesn t think this other stuff that Trump is toying with is really a part of the mainstream conservative movement by any stretch of the imagination.
The question to me is, this is all going to be tested, right?
Hayes replied.
I agree with you: there are large parts of people who are avowed Republicans and conservatives who genuinely care about limited government.
But what we re seeing right now is this sort of electoral test.
And that s what makes today so fascinating, this fight so fascinating.
