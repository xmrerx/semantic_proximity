amsterdam ( reuters ) - a dutch citizen will go on trial in the netherlands next monday on charges he committed war crimes in ethiopia in the 1970s .
the 63-year-old dutchman , who was born in ethiopia , is accused of the incarceration , torture and murder of opponents of former ethiopian leader mengistu haile mariam in the late 70s .
as mengistu s representative in the ethiopian province of gojjam , the man is accused of ordering the killing of 75 young prisoners in 1978 and of being responsible for the incarceration and inhumane treatment of more than 200 people .
an ethiopian court has sentenced the man to death , in absentia , for his role in what was called the red terror , which the communist military junta of mengistu conducted after the ouster of the ethiopian emperor , haile selassie , in 1974 .
the ethiopian sentence can t be carried out in the netherlands , making a new trial the best option to hold the man to account , the dutch national prosecutor s office said on tuesday .
the trial in the hague is based on an investigation by the international crimes team of the dutch national police .
it contains the statements of several ethiopian witnesses , some of whom will be present at the trial , the prosecutor s office said .
the accused has been held in provisional custody in the netherlands since 2015 .
mengistu was found guilty in absentia of genocide in 2007 , after he and top members of his military government were accused of killing thousands during his 17-year rule .
mengistu was ousted in 1991 and fled to zimbabwe , where he still lives .
