von Storch, 45, is the Duchess of Oldenburg, a distant relative of the Duke of Edinburgh, who trained as a lawyer and spent 10 years as an insolvency specialist before entering politics.As Breitbart London has reported, her eurosceptic AfD party campaigns against mass migration and stands on a more children for German families platform.After coming close to entering the German parliament soon after its founding in 2013, AfD won seats in last year s European Parliament elections where it sits in the European Conservatives and Reformists Group alongside British Conservative Party MEPs.It then won representation in five German state assemblies after widening its appeal with populist positions on law and order, immigration and traditional social values.
