Donald Trump addressed thousands of motorcyclists, many of them military veterans, attending the annual Rolling Thunder gathering to honor the nation s soldier missing-in-action.
The bikers have been great supporters of Trump as he mentioned last week: I am doing it in honor of the great bikers who have been totally supportive of my campaign and now I want to be supportive of them.
I look forward to it!
GREAT!
WE MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE AMERICA!
