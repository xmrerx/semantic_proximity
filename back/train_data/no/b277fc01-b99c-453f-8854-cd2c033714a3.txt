itv reporter : british reporters in various degrees of politeness they have said to you that you should really keep your views to yourself .
with that in mind , mr. president , do you still think it was the right thing to intervene in this debate ?
and what happens if the uk does decide in june to leave the european union ? barack obama : this is a decision for the people of the united kingdom to make .
i am not coming here to fix any votes maybe some point down the line there might be a uk-us trade agreement but it s not going to happen anytime soon because our focus is in negotiating with a big block the european union to get a trade agreement done .
and the uk is going to be in the back of the queue .
not because we have a special relationship but because given the heavy lift on any trade agreement , us having access to a big market with a lot of countries rather than trying to do piecemeal trade agreements is hugely inefficient .
