It s looking as though Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is losing support even from within his own ranks.
You know things are getting bad when even your top surrogates start turning against you, which is exactly what just happened on Fox News when Newt Gingrich called Trump pathetic.
Gingrich knows that Trump needs to keep his focus on Hillary Clinton if he even remotely wants to have a chance at defeating her.
However, Trump has hurt feelings because many Republicans don t support his sexual assault against women have turned against him, including House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI).
So, that has made Trump lash out as his own party.Gingrich said on Fox News: Look, first of all, let me just say about Trump, who I admire and I ve tried to help as much as I can.
There s a big Trump and a little Trump.
The little Trump is frankly pathetic.
I mean, he s mad over not getting a phone call?
Trump s referring to the fact that Paul Ryan didn t call to congratulate him after the debate.
Probably because he didn t win despite what Trump s ego tells him.Gingrich also added: Donald Trump has one opponent.
Her name is Hillary Clinton.
Her name is not Paul Ryan.
It s not anybody else.
Trump doesn t seem to realize that the person he should be mad at is himself because he truly is his own worst enemy.
This will ultimately lead to his defeat and he will have no one to blame but himself.Watch here via Politico:Featured Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images
