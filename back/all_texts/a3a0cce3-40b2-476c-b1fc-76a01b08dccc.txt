PARIS (Reuters) - France will not recognize Catalonia if the Spanish region unilaterally declares independence, European affairs minister Nathalie Loiseau said on Monday.
If there were to be a declaration of independence, it would be unilateral, and it would not be recognized, Loiseau said on CNews television.
Catalonia, which has its own language and culture and is led by a pro-independence regional government, held a referendum on Oct. 1 over secession in defiance of Spain s constitutional court, which had declared the vote illegal.
Catalonia cannot be defined by the vote organized by the independence movement just over a week ago, the French junior minister said.
This crisis needs to be resolved through dialogue at all levels of Spanish politics.
A hasty decision to recognize independence following such a unilateral declaration would amount to fleeing France s responsibilities, Loiseau added.
If independence were to be recognized - which is not something that s being discussed - the most immediate consequence would be that (Catalonia) automatically left the European Union.
