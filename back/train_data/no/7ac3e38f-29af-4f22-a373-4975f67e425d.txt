washington ( reuters ) - a kurdish referendum for independence has decreased focus on fighting islamic state militants in iraq , a spokesman for the u.s.-led coalition fighting the militant group said .
the focus which used to be like a laser beam on isis is now not 100 percent there , so there has been an effect on the overall mission to defeat isis in iraq as a result of the referendum , said coalition spokesman colonel ryan dillon , using an acronym for islamic state .
dillon added that there had been no impact on current military operations out of erbil s airport .
