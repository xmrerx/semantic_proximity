This is political correctness out of control!
What do these goofballs think we won the war with?
Hopefully, they come to their senses and go ahead with the memorial including the rifle.A Milford, Michigan, veterans group is up in arms after a proposal to place a memorial containing a battlefield cross a military helmet and dog tags atop a semiautomatic rifle mounted on boots was deemed too pro-violence by the local council.The battlefield cross dates back to Civil War days as a stark reminder of the sacrifices of fallen soldiers.Fox News reported Bear Hall, the chairman of the Friends of American Veterans in Milford, wanted to place a sculpture of the iconic image at the end of a walkway to an existing veterans memorial.
But some on the local council deemed it inappropriate.
There was some concern from a couple of members regarding the specific memorial that s proposed.
Specifically, the gun, said Milford Village Manager Christian Wuerth, to the Detroit Free Press.
They understood the history and meaning of it.
They just didn t feel it was appropriate for that specific location.
Councilman Tom Nader was one who opposed the memorial.
Being a veteran, I want to see a monument there, yes, he said.
I just don t think this is the proper one.
But as another council member, Jennifer Frankford, said: If it wasn t for the boots and the gun and helmet, we wouldn t have all the freedoms we have.
The council is supposed to debate the matter again at an upcoming hearing.Hall, meanwhile, said his group would support the final decision with caveats.
If [the council] doesn t want it as a focal point, that s fine, but we don t want some foofoo fountain either, he said.
Everyone s thinking the same thing we re thinking we didn t win the war by throwing sticks and stones.
