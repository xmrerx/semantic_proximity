Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke is so enthralled with Donald Trump that he s been inspired to run for the Senate, but the Republican Party supposedly isn t having it.
GOP chairman Reince Preibus finally said something about it, which, in and of itself is weird because Duke announced this a day ago:This is ridiculous on its face because Priebus chairs the party that nominated Donald Trump, and Donald Trump attracts white supremacists like iron filings to a rare earth magnet.
Priebus might think he s telling the world that the GOP isn t made up of a bunch of bigoted hypocrites, but the Internet sees right through him.
They raked Priebus over coals so hot that, if Satan were real, he d be insane with jealousy.
Indeed, Priebus is quite proud of the GOP s decision to nominate Trump, as evidenced by posts on his official Facebook page.
It s only a little over the top, given how he allegedly feels about racists who spread their hate like David Duke:While Trump does denounce white supremacists to appease the press, he s always retweeting them.
Also, Richard Spencer, a prominent white supremacist, pointed out that Trump must think like them, because otherwise they wouldn t be so drawn to him.
They see something in his rhetoric to which the GOP s leaders have turned a completely blind eye.Priebus doesn t know this?
Hard to believe.
He s as transparent as clear mountain air.
The GOP is officially the party of white supremacists, and his token repudiation of David Duke is way too little, way too late.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
