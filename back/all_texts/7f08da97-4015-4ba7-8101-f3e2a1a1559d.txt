Donald Trump and his team are not only some of the most corrupt people we ve ever had infiltrate our government, but they re also some of the most cowardly and Trump has just set an example to his team that will likely give way to even more spineless behavior.In an interview with CBS s Face The Nation, Trump actually cut the interview short, ending it abruptly by literally fleeing from reporter John Dickerson when Dickerson dared to question Trump about his unfounded claims that former POTUS Barack Obama wiretapped him (Trump has STILL not been able to prove this).Dickerson was speaking to Trump inside the Oval Office when the discussion turned to Trump s relationship with Obama, and Trump made some extremely disrespectful, inflammatory remarks.
Trump said he d had some difficulties with Obama over what happened with surveillance.
When Dickerson cornered Trump on why he d called his predecessor sick and bad in his wiretapping accusations in March, Trump practically had a breakdown from being put on the spot while the cameras rolled.
Trump gave this incoherent response: I don t stand by anything.
I just, you can take it the way you want.
I think our side s been proven very strongly.
And everybody s talking about it.
And frankly it should be discussed.
I think that is a very big surveillance of our citizens.
I think it s a very big topic.
And it s a topic that should be number one.
And we should find out what the hell is going on.
Trump only seemed to get more frustrated and edgy as Dickerson tried to get to the bottom of Trump s babbling.
Trump said: You don t have to ask me.Because I have my own opinions.
You can have your own opinions.
Dickerson had tried to hold Trump accountable, and it was just too much for the man baby.
Trump suddenly ended the interview by straight up walking AWAY from Dickerson, saying Okay, that s enough, thank you, thank you very much.
