Obama s minions in the Democrat party never disappoint in their efforts to support this president on just about anything.
Mikulski is retiring so what does she care?
Sad day for America CALL HER Office Office of Senator Barbara Mikulski 503 Hart Senate Office Building Washington, DC 20510 (202) 228-1122Sen.
Barbara Mikulski of Maryland became the crucial 34th vote Wednesday, declaring the agreement was the best way to curb Iran s nuclear ambitions.In a statement, Mikulski said she had studied the deal carefully, and had concluded it was the best way forward.
I ve considered the alternatives very closely.
But in the end, they don t present a more viable option to this deal, she wrote.
No deal is perfect, especially one negotiated with the Iranian regime.
I have concluded that this Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is the best option available to block Iran from having a nuclear bomb.
For these reasons, I will vote in favor of this deal.
She also called on Congress to affirm its commitment to the safety and security of Israel.
Mikulski, 78, has been lauded by the Jewish community as a staunch supporter of Israel during her Senate career, the longest for a female in US history.Congress is to vote later this month on a resolution disapproving the deal, which is unanimously opposed by Republicans, who call it a dangerous giveaway to Iran.The backing from Mikulski, who is retiring next year, gives supporters the margin they need to uphold an Obama veto of a congressional resolution of disapproval if Republicans pass such a measure later this month.And it spells failure for opponents of the international agreement who sought to foil it by turning Congress against it.
Leading that effort were Israel and its allies in the US, who failed to get traction after spending millions of dollars trying.Read more: Times of Israel
