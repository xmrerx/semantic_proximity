It s funny how extreme right-wing Christians always think they know what their God is thinking about politics, especially since most of the candidates who say that God told them to run for president never even get the nomination, much less become president.
Well, another such right-wing Christian has added his voice to this narrative: Pastor John Hagee.
On the Tuesday edition of his show Hagee Hotline, the fiery preacher issued a dire warning: Vote for Donald Trump in November, or God will come for you.
Hagee warned that God will not hold us harmless, and that voting is an imperative duty.
He continued to rant: I m going to vote for the candidate that s going to make the U.S. military great again.
I m going to vote for the party that is going to solve the immigration problem, not the one that has created the immigration problem.
I m going to support the party that brings jobs back from China I m not going to vote for the party that has betrayed Israel for the past seven years.
If you can read a newspaper, you know who I m talking about.
No candidate is perfect, but I want you to go vote and may God give us a leader who has the courage to put America first and stand up for we the people.
Now, I don t know about you, but this sounds an awful lot like a preacher putting politics into religion to me.
If Hagee s ministry is tax exempt, he needs to lose that status if he can t stop the politicking.
Further, no higher power if one were to actually exist would want a dangerous, racist, sexist, xenophobic narcissist as the leader of the free world.This election cycle sure has brought out the nutjobs, all thanks to the likes of Donald Trump.
If that man wins, we re ALL going to need some divine intervention for sure.Watch the video of Pastor Hagee s comments, via Right Wing Watch:Featured image via video screen capture
