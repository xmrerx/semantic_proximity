Sunday, GotNews reported that the primary source of the White House leak was traced back to Deputy Chief of Staff and #NeverTrumper Kate Walsh.
The goal was to undermine the Trump Presidency and Administration.Walsh is being investigated as a primary person of interest and is said to have been distributing highly confidential information to The New York Times and others.
From Got News: Everyone knows not to talk to her in the White House unless you want to see it in the press, says a source close to the president.
The only question is whether or not she s doing it at the behest of [White House Chief of Staff] Reince Priebus or if she s doing it to advance herself in DC media circles.
Walsh would have significant access as she controls the president s schedule.
There s also reportedly a trove of e-mails where Katie Walsh and Reince Priebus discuss how to rid themselves of Trump, according to a former #NeverTrump consultant.
The president and his allies have been deliberately feeding her fake information in order to find her network, says a source close to the president s family.
It s been going well.
Walsh was a #NeverTrump Republican during the campaign .

.
a White House investigation is planned into Walsh, who couldn t be reached for comment.
