MADRID (Reuters) - Spain s state prosecutor on Monday called for rebellion and sedition charges to be brought against Catalonia s leaders over their push to separate from Spain.
Attorney-General Jose Manuel Maza also called for charges of misuse of funds to be laid.
Under Spain s legal system, the request goes to a judge for consideration.
Maza asked the judge to call the seccessionist leaders to tesify.
