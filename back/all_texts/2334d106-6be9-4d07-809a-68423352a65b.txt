Donald Trump is an absolutely despicable human being, and, believe it or not, he just sunk even lower.
Trump, while talking in a Town Hall on MSNBC, has indicated that he wants to ban abortion outright and punish women who seek them to boot.
Well, anyone with a shred of decency knows that punishing women for seeking reproductive healthcare is absolutely deplorable, and Democratic presidential frontrunner Hillary Clinton took to Twitter to say just what we are all thinking about Trump s horrible anti-woman rhetoric.First, she reminded us that this man could become president, and how dangerous that prospect is:Just when you thought it couldn't get worse.
Horrific and telling.

Trump can try to walk back his words, but we heard him loud and clear.
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 30, 2016Then, Clinton went on to point out the dangerous absurdity of punishing women for abortion and making them criminals:Even by his impossibly low standards, @realDonaldTrump's suggestion that women be punished for seeking abortion is abhorrent.
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 30, 2016Remember: If you make abortion a crime, you make women who seek abortions criminals.
You put one in three women at risk.
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 30, 2016Hillary then reminded us that Trump isn t the only Republican who thinks this way, he s just the only one who has said it outright:The fact is, Trump isn't that different from every other Republican candidate who would also outlaw abortion.
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 30, 2016We were then reminded that many women specifically women in financial straits and minority women are already being punished with lack of access to reproductive healthcare:Women, especially low-income women and women of color, are already being punished by GOP-led efforts to stigmatize and restrict health care.
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 30, 2016Every woman regardless of income or zip code deserves access to health care.
If you don't get that, you have no business being president.
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 30, 2016And lastly, but also most importantly, Hillary Clinton reminded us what we must do to stop Trump: VOTE:At this point, Donald Trump has insulted the vast majority of Americans.
The good news is, there's something we can all do about it: Vote.
Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 30, 2016Hillary Clinton is spot on with this.
Trump, and the entire GOP, are downright dangerous to women everywhere.
The only way to stop this madness is to VOTE BLUE, no matter what, in November.Featured image via Instagram
