Neil Cavuto faced off with Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee over her call for President Trump to resign after his tweets attacking Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough: Enough is ENOUGH!
@realDonaldTrump you need to resign!
This woman is just hateful!
She claims to know Trump is unhappy GMAFB!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKPPzMPRrNYThis woman is a perfect example of the SWAMP in DC.
She needs to go!
She s mooched off of the American people for way too long and is a hateful racist!She says in the video above that she s gone through impeachments before, but said, We can t wait that long.
It is time for you to resign.
Enough is enough.
I love America.
I love these people.
And we need a Commander-in-Chief.
Cavuto confronted her about this and brought up the coarse language from presidents past.
She argued that he is incompatible with the office, and in addition to issues like Russia and James Comey, his continuous assault on women only adds to it.She called Trump ill-suited for the office, and when Cavuto pressed her further by saying let the American people decide, the congresswoman responded by pointing to the President s low poll numbers.Jackson said she s going by his behavior in decrying his unfitness for office and Cavuto shot back by saying she just doesn t like him.They kept going back and forth, including on the question of the 25th amendment, and Cavuto asked her if she should be waiting for more evidence of something actionable.Jackson Lee said impeachment is a separate matter, telling Cavuto, I hope he does the right thing and resigns.
And yes, she is completely standing by this: I will not back down.
The President has lost the trust of the American people and needs to resign.
WWE KNOW THIS WOMAN HAS A LONG HISTORY OF BULLYING PEOPLE.
PLEASE WATCH THE VIDEO BELOW OF AN EXCHANGE WITH MICK MULVANEY HE GETS INTO IT WITH HER:Mick Mulvaney is one smart cookie.
