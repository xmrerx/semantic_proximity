washington ( reuters ) - the united states is seeking a new era for zimbabwe , the state department s top official for africa said on thursday , implicitly calling on long-time president robert mugabe to step aside as a political crisis mounts .
in an interview with reuters , acting assistant secretary of state for african affairs donald yamamoto appeared to dismiss the idea of mugabe , who has ruled zimbabwe for 37 years , remaining in a transitional or ceremonial role .
it s a transition to a new era for zimbabwe , that s really what we re hoping for , yamamoto said .
zimbabwe s army seized power this week , in an apparent effort to prevent mugabe , 93 , from handing power to his wife .
he has not resigned or been formally deposed , however , and he was pictured on thursday shaking hands with the military chief , constantino chiwenga .
yamamoto , speaking on the sidelines of a meeting with african union officials at the state department in washington , described the situation in zimbabwe as very fluid .
the united states would discuss lifting multiple u.s. sanctions on zimbabwe if it began enacting political and economic reforms , he said .
in a message for zimbabwe s political leaders , he said : our position has always been that if they engage in the constitutional reforms , economic and political reforms , and move forward to protecting political space and the human rights , then we can start the dialogue on lifting sanctions .
the united states has not given aid to zimbabwe s government for many years , but provides development aid to nongovernmental groups , particularly for healthcare .
now whether we give to the government , that depends on what happens in zimbabwe , yamamoto said .
u.s. secretary of state rex tillerson is due to meet on friday in washington with 37 african foreign ministers .
