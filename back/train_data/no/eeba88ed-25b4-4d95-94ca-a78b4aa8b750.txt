as the # nevertrump movement has become officially irrelevant , our hilarious friend joe dan gorman of intellectual froglegs puts the state of trump s winning campaign into perspective for americans # nevertrump is fading into the sunset now relegated to a few tassel loafered pockets of resistance .and social media trollers .
the anger babies , if you will ( a phrase coined by my friend anthony adams , i liked it so i stole it ) .
these folks like ben shapiro , bill kristol , paul ryan , etc believe themselves to be intellectually superior to all of us .
they represent purist of the pure the self-appointed guardians of conservatism , who for the most part are the biggest hypocrites on the planet.first .. where was their little # neverromney when we were forced to vote for the grandfather of obamacare ?
or # nevermccain ? apparently mccain-feingold didn t infringe on our first amendment too much .
via- intellectual froglegsthe trump train has officially left the station .
get on or get out of the way .
trump is winning .
it s all he knows how to do .
either america accepts hillary and bernie s radical agenda for america , which includes gun control , as well as the loss of our first , and several other precious amendments , or we support a man who is passionate about saving our nation from the evils of globalism and socialism. # neverhillary # neverbernieif you like love intellectual froglegs videos as much as we do , consider giving joe dan gorman ( the guy who s in the video and works so hard to create these great illustrations that capture the true state of our nation ) a donation here .
