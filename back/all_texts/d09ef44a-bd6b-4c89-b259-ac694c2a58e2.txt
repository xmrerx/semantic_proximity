Capitalism is a crazy system.
On Black Friday, we celebrate consumerism at its finest but Cards Against Humanity has typically refused to be part of the most insane shopping day of the year, whether they are peddling literal bull shit, raising their prices for the shopping holiday, or literally selling nothing at all.
This year, the gaming company decided to let people throw their money into a gigantic hole in the earth.
The holidays are here, and everything in America is going really well.
To celebrate Black Friday, the company writes on their website.
Cards Against Humanity is digging a tremendous hole in the earth.
They have vowed to keep paying some people to dig a hole in the ground for absolutely no reason as long as people are willing to throw their money away on such nonsense.At the time of writing, people have been willing to spend around $40,000 on a gigantic hole in the ground on corporate America s most profitable day.
According to the company, the hole which is real is in America.
And in our hearts.
Some companies take a stand against Black Friday in small ways, but there s nothing better than actually dumping people s money into a hole in the ground.You can watch the hole being dug below.
