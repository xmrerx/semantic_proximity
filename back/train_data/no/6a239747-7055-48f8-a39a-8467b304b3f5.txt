albany , n.y. ( reuters ) - a new york appeals court on thursday upheld a lower court ’ s dismissal of a suit seeking to remove republican presidential candidate ted cruz from the state ’ s primary ballot because of his canadian birth .
the new york appellate division agreed with the lower court ruling that the suit should be thrown out because it missed the deadline for filing an objection to cruz ’ s appearance on the april 19 ballot .
lawyers for cruz successfully argued that the objectors had filed their petition nearly three weeks late .
the appeals judges said they would not address the merits of the case , saying they were “ academic. ” roger bernstein , a lawyer for the petitioners , said his clients intend to appeal the decision .
new york residents barry korman , 81 , of manhattan , and william gallo , 85 , of manhasset , had filed the suit , arguing that because cruz was born in canada , he is not a “ naturally born ” citizen as the constitution dictates for a u.s. president .
cruz has defended himself against similar claims in multiple states , saying he was a u.s. natural born citizen at birth because of his mother ’ s u.s. citizenship at the time .
cruz was born in 1970 in calgary , alberta .
