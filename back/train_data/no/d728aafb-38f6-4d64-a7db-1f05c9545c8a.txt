for the umpteenth time , obama takes the opportunity to trash americans while overseas president obama on monday pushed world leaders to finalize a sweeping global agreement that would cut carbon emissions and hopefully stave off the worst effects of climate change.invoking the words of martin luther king , jr. , obama insisted that a grim future hurt by worsening global warming is one that we have the power to change .
right here .
right now .
but only if we rise to this moment , he said in a speech kicking off the paris conference .
for all the challenges we face , the growing threat of climate change could define the contours of this century more dramatically than any other , obama said .
what should give us hope that this is a turning point , that this is the moment we finally determined we would save our planet , is the fact that our nations share a sense of urgency about this challenge and a growing realization that it is within our power to do something about it .
i ve come here personally , as the leader of the world s largest economy and the second-largest emitter , to say that the united states of america not only recognizes our role in creating this problem , we embrace our responsibility to do something about it , he added .
