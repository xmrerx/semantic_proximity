maxine waters said on msnbc that there must be a probe into the unsubstantiated dossier that surfaced last month , alleging that trump could be subject to blackmail from the russians .
the coverage they have on him , sex actions that s absolutely true , referring to the dossier s detailed description of claims trump met with russian prostitutes .
they should really read it , understand it , analyze it , determine what s fact .
if we do the investigation , then we will find the connections .
and i do think that impeachment will be necessary , rep. maxine waters claims on @ msnbc that the sex allegations about trump in the russian dossier are true .
