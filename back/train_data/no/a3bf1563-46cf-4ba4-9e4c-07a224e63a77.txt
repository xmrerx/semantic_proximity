billionaire investor and all around puppet master , george soros , said in an opinion piece in the wall street journal that he would invest $ 500 million to meet the needs refugees.the payout answers the obama administration s call to action initiative , asking u.s. companies to help ease the migrant crisis.soros , the founder of the open society foundations , stated that he intends to work as closely as possible with the office of the united nations high commissioner for refugees and the international rescue committee to properly manage his investments.fact sheet for obama s call to action : viewhow are these refugees chosen and vetted , an by whom ? it is a bit concerning that to even get on the site that can provide the information on how refugees are vetted you have to sign in to the national journal website.the bbc did piece on the vetting process that outlines the un s deep ties to the system : viewthis outline details how the un and the u.s. state department basically run the vetting process .
which is extremely concerning seeing as how obama has been known to recruit muslim foreign service officers through jihad conferences , as reported here at judicial watchif you look closely at the above links and tie them all to what we know is a corrupt relationship between soros and obama it becomes very apparent that the influx of refugees isn t a charitable act to save lives .
we re being taken over by an outstanding number of possibly dangerous individuals and they are funded by those up on high.basically muslims are vetting other muslims and telling us they are not dangerous while the government drives us farther into debt with the expense of these refugees even though they know that many if not most of these refugees are in fact ties somehow to terrorist organizations with a strong intent to kill us .
no wonder the terrorist attack numbers on our homeland has been higher in the last 8 years then ever in american history.how do you feel about that ?
i for one am not ok with any of it .
