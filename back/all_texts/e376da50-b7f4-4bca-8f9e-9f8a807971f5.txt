Well, no one can say Hillary Clinton doesn t have a sense of humor.
That s for sure.If you were watching the latest Fox News Republican debate at home, you quickly realized that within minutes they were literally comparing hand size.
It was a circus sideshow of the wildest magnitude.
All the candidates were yelling over one another and literally nothing was getting discussed, because it was just insult after backhanded insult.Clearly noticing this ridiculousness was former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.
During the debate she tweeted out:#GOPdebate pic.twitter.com/SGW200luN8 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) March 4, 2016This tweet is probably how most of us were feeling during the entirety of the GOP debate absolutely bored.
Nothing of substance was being discussed whatsoever.
They were all just insulting each other and tearing each other down.
They weren t talking about how their policy ideas will improve the lives of citizens.
No, they were talking about how great they are, or how wrong the other person is.
It was a shit show.Hillary also tweeted:True on foreign policy and literally everything else.

This election is far too important to be left in the hands of those who just hurl insults at one another.
