WARNING: Disturbing image of a man being shot.The FBI released the official helicopter-based video footage of Oregon militiaman LaVoy Tarp Man Finicum being fatally shot by police while trying to break through a law enforcement road block in a white SUV.From the vantage point of the surveillance plane beginning at timecode 9:00, a truck driven by Finicum can be observed traveling at high speed on the abandoned Highway 395 toward the police barricade.
Before colliding with vehicles arranged by FBI and Oregon State Police troopers, the SUV swerves to the left to go around the road block but is quickly thwarted by the accumulated snow.
A man, presumably Finicum, emerges from the car with his arms outstretched.Officials begin to approach the man when he appears to reach into his coat and pulls out an object resembling a handgun.
The FBI reported that the handgun was a 9mm semi-automatic firearm, carried in Finicum s left jacket pocket.It s at this point when we see the man fall limply into the snow, fatally wounded by one or more Oregon State Police officers.The official description of the incident from the FBI s Greg Bretzing:As the white truck approaches the roadblock, there is a spike strip across the road but it appears Finicum missed it as he attempted to drive around the roadblock.
He nearly hits an FBI agent as he maneuvers to the left.
The truck gets stuck in the snowbank.Finicum leaves the truck and steps through the snow.
Agents and troopers on scene had information that Finicum and others would be armed.
On at least two occasions, Finicum reaches his right hand toward a pocket on the left inside portion of his jacket.
He did have a loaded 9 mm semi-automatic handgun in that pocket.At this time, OSP troopers shot Finicum.The video debunks claims by the Oregon militia that Finicum was surrendering to police on his knees.
