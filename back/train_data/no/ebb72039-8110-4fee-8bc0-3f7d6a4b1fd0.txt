when nordstrom announced on thursday that it will no longer be selling this season s merchandise from ivanka trump s fashion line over boycotts from the left , i was truly shocked .
nordstrom discontinued a line by the daughter of the president of the united states because they left doesn t agree with his positions on national security .
let that sink in ! imagine the outrage if nordstrom agreed to cancel a clothing line by malia obama because conservatives didn t approve of the former president obama.if we had an honest journalist in the mainstream media , they would be exposing the hypocrisy of the left , who relentless demand we show tolerance for other points of view while behaving like the most intolerant group of people in the world.the end of the relationship between the department-store chain and trump s brand came after boycott threats from the grab your wallet campaign , which has called on people to stay away from companies that sell both ivanka and donald trump s merchandise , the seattle times reported.nordstrom tweeted that the decision to stop selling trump s brand was not a political move but one that was based on its sales performance .
a spokesperson for nordstrom did not say if the decision to stop selling trump s fashion line was permanent .
