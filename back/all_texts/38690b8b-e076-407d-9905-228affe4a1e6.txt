When thinking about who you d likely want as the next President of the United States, one would probably think of someone who is well-versed in policy and leadership.
Someone with a proven record of legislative success.
Someone who you wouldn t be embarrassed of representing you and your interests around the globe.
Unfortunately, when watching the GOP debates, you re not going to find any of those qualities, at least amongst the front-runners.At the most recent debate, the subject of hand size was literally brought up, and of course, hand size is actually the size of their dicks, because of course that s what these guys would be talking about.
Noticing how utterly ridiculous not only bringing this subject up is, but also finding it humorous that Donald Trump in particular took such offense in what appears to be major overcompensation, Ellen DeGeneres of The Ellen Show showed us a better interpretation of what his hand size actually may be.In a modified clip of the most recent debate, Ellen had Trump s hands photoshopped into tiny little baby hands.
He still waved them around like he has something to prove, but this time, it was seemingly far more accurate.Truth be told, we don t need a person obsessed with proving how large or great they personally are.
We don t need someone who uses I, me, or my every other sentence.
Running for president is running to serve the citizens of the United States, not yourself.
It s not about being the best, it s about making sure the nation works well for all.We need someone who can lead the nation.
Donald Trump is not that person.Watch the hilarity from The Ellen Show here:Featured image via image screen capture
