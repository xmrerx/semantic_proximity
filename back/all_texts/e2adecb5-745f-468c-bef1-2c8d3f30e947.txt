It s nice to see freedom of speech is alive and well in the godless party of America Maybe Barack and the Dem s should listen to what Kanye has to say.
After all, it appears after years of behaving like a vapid rapper, he s taken a liking to Dr. Ben Carson and his message to America: As soon as I heard Carson speak, I tried for three weeks to get on the phone with him.
I was like, This is the most brilliant guy.
But then again .that s likely the reason the Dem s don t want Kanye to speak If the Democrat party attempts to silence a popular black entertainer who supports a 100% black man for President (who grew up in the ghettos of Detroit) shouldn t Americans be a bit concerned about blatant discrimination?Kanye West, who says he s plotting his own 2020 presidential bid, will perform at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser in San Francisco attended by President Obama on Oct. 10.But don t expect West to unleash one of his rants: He ll be required to stick to performance only.A source said, There will be restrictions .
.
.
Kanye won t be able to lecture the president about how to run the country.
West will debut songs from his next album, Swish, at the event, for which tickets cost up to $10,000.DNC member Robert Zimmerman quipped, Kanye will be an exciting draw, especially compared to the Republicans booking Wayne Newton or Clint Eastwood.
We all know how well that turned out.
