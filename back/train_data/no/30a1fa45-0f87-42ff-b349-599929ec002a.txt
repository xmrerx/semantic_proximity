four of these economically stable , good job market , income equality and is a place i would live were included in the best countries to be an immigrant ranking.countries also were scored in relation to others on the share of migrants in their population ; the amount of remittances the migrants they host sent home ; and graded on a united nations assessment of integration measures provided for immigrants , such as language training and transfers of job certifications , and the rationale behind current integration policies .

are sent out of the country ( and thus lost to the host country s economy ! ) .
