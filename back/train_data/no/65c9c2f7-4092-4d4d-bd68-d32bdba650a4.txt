oops !
hillary and her race-baiting campaign team are not going to want the black community to see this video donald trump doesn t want to give the black and minority communities a hand-out he wants to give them self-respecting jobs .
he wants to see every american reach their full potential regardless of the color of their skin .
this is a concept so foreign to the democrat party that the only response they re able to come up with is falsely accusing trump of being a racist and hoping it sticks .
for decades , the democrats have been able to get away with falsely labeling republicans but donald trump is not your average republican , and he s about to bring down the democrats false narrative like a house of cards.enjoy : https : //youtu.be/7u6pp5iflts
