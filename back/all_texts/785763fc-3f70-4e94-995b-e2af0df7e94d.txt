WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House expressed disappointment on Monday in the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision not to hear a bid by President Barack Obama’s administration to revive his plan to spare from deportation millions of immigrants in the country illegally.
“There’s no practical impact in terms of the implementation of this policy, and that of course is a double-edged sword,” White House spokesman Josh Earnest said at a news briefing.
