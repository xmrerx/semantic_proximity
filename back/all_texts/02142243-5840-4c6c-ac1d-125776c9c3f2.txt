Just when we thought the situation with the Bundy militia in Oregon couldn t get any worse, it does.
The drama is heating up now, because another group of lawless armed militants have decided to come be the security for the militia.
There s just one problem with that, though: the original militia says they don t want these new folks there.The new group calls themselves the Pacific Patriot Network, and they have taken it upon themselves to send armed guards from their group to protect the original occupying militia.
However, Todd MacFarlane, who is a lawyer for the Bundy side of the standoff, says of these new people: We don t need that.
We don t want it and we re asking you to leave.
According to the Bundy group, they really want to keep the situation from getting any worse than it already has.
MacFarlane says that the Bundy group is, quote, alarmed by the Pacific Patriot Network guards.
According the Brandon Curtiss, who heads the Pacific Patriot Network up, the guards he sent will only be patrolling the perimeter and has no plans to interfere with original occupants, or even join them in occupation.However, the point is, the Bundys people don t want them there.
The new people must be really scary if the original terrorists don t even want anything to do with them.
At this point, the federal government needs to simply step in and do something about these people.
It really has gotten way out of hand.Watch Bundy s militia people talk about these newbies, below:Featured image via video screen capture from Raw Story
