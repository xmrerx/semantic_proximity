cairo ( reuters ) - an egyptian army officer was sentenced to six years in prison on tuesday after announcing his intention last month to run in the country s 2018 presidential election , his lawyer and wife said .
a military court found colonel ahmed konsowa , 42 , guilty of expressing political opinions as a serving military officer , his lawyer asaad heikal told reuters .
konsowa appeared in a video last month announcing that he intended to run against president abdel fattah al-sisi in the vote , which will take place early next year .
he said he had submitted his resignation from the army in 2014 but it had not been accepted .
konsowa s wife rasha safwat said they would appeal against the verdict .
