MADRID (Reuters) - Catalan pro-independence party PdeCat (Catalan Democratic Party)said on Monday it will take part in a snap regional elections on Dec.21, a tacit admission that Catalonia s previous ruling party had been fired and parliament dissolved.
Earlier, another Catalan pro-independence party, Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC), also said it would participate in the elections.
Spain s Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy sacked the regional government, dissolved parliament and called a snap election on Friday after Catalonia leaders made a unilateral declaration of independence.
