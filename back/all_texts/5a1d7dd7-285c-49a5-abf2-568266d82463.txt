Donald Trump, while pretending to reach out to minorities, has almost no minority support.
That doesn t stop him from talking down to African-Americans and telling them that they live in conditions of dangerous squalor that only he can fix.
Of course, that doesn t stop Trump from bragging about his great relationship with the blacks.
Well, perhaps the two people holding up the Blacks for Trump signs at an October 12th rally had the last name of Black, because they certainly didn t look African-American.Most noticed only the woman, and Twitter tore her and the fake black outreach of the Trump campaign apart.Note the blond woman with the Blacks for Trump sign.
Okay.

(@ReRe_76804) October 13, 2016Um, Shaun King is bi-racial, just like the President who you hate because of his dark skin.Clearly, the problem is not with the woman.
It s simply that the woman (and the man who for some reason is ignored) is the perfect symbol of Trump s African-American outreach.
Trump is a white man who tells African-Americans how they should be feeling, while at the same time, having a deep history of racism.
His black outreach is a farce and he knows it, so really, who better to carry a Blacks for Trump sign than a white woman?Featured image via Darren McCollester/Getty Images.
