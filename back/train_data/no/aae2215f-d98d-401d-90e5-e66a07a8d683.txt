the electronic device shared by hillary clinton aide huma abedin and husband anthony weiner on which the fbi found more clinton emails was a laptop and it contained tens-of-thousands of emails , a senior law enforcement official told fox news on saturday.the fbi announced friday that it had restarted an investigation into emails clinton sent on a private server system while secretary of state , as a result of a probe into abedin s husband , disgraced new york democratic rep. anthony weiner , sexting , of sending sexually-suggestive electronic messages , to a teenage girl.the law enforcement official told fox news that the laptop had five digits of emails , meaning tens-of-thousands of them .

however , the agency did not find evidence that clinton had been criminally negligent and did not recommend criminal charges to the justice department.people familiar with the case say it was restarted by the fbi because the agency thought the new emails were pertinent to the investigation .
the source also told fox news that law enforcement officials think it s highly unlikely that all of the new-found emails are duplicates , as the clinton campaign has suggested.read more : fox news
