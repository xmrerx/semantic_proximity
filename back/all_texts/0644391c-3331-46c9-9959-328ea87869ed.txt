In another of Donald Trump s whine rests, the Dictator in Chief accused the media of not reporting terrorist attacks.
On Tuesday, Trump released the list of unreported terrorist attacks, which not surprisingly, have been extensively covered by the media.
Yes, it s sad that lies from the White House are no longer surprising.
What is surprising, though, is how the list was written.
It was either done in a sleep deprived flurry from Trump or some drunken monkeys got ahold of a computer.You have to give the White House credit.
For complete BS, the list is rather extensive.

Twitter has been brutal:White House list of allegedly undercovered Islamist terror attacks repeatedly misspells attacker.

Q:Ms. DeVos can you teach WH staff about spell check ?
A:Spell check?
Steven A Drizin (@SDrizin) February 7, 2017This keeps getting funnier.
I m sure the WH response will be alternative spelling .

Attention to detail is important when crafting laws or executive orders or when speaking with foreign leaders.
We get that the supposed billionaire who sits on 14 carat gold toilets ran as an every man, and let s face it, Americans are notoriously illiterate, but if Trump has this same inattention to detail in his businesses, it s no wonder he s gone bankrupt four times.
As for our country, the world is both laughing and weeping the latter because Trump has the keys to the nuclear arsenal.Read more:Featured image via Pool/Getty Images
