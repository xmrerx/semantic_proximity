The effects of a Donald Trump presidency are already starting to take shape.
We ve been hearing of incidents of racism all over the country where people feel Trump s win gives them the right to be as racist and violent as they want.Another thing to remember is everything Trump promised during the election.
One of those things was a ban on Muslims entering the country.The Daily Show s Hasan Minaj takes that threat of a ban very seriously, because he and his family are Muslim, and his mother is currently out of the country.While speaking to host Trevor Noah, Minaj broke character from a correspondent and takes on the role of himself as a concerned citizen.
He looked straight into the camera, and said: This is a true story.
My mom is out of the country right now.
She s visiting my grandma.
And she s a U.S. citizen.
She s lived here thirty years.
She s on the phone with me last night, and she s like, Hasan, I don t know if I can come back until February.
Am I going to be able to get back into the country?
And the fact that I can t tell her yes with one hundred percent certainty, is heartbreaking.
And there are a lot of people telling me, hey man, don t worry, Trump s not really gonna ban all Muslims, but I don t know, man.
That is my mom.
And I need her back home, because I love her Then adding some levity to the very serious situation, he says: and she owes me three hundred dollars.
Minaj looked genuinely concerned for his family, and that is terribly heartbreaking that he even remotely has to be fearful of a Trump ban on Muslims.
That can t be the America we live in.Watch him speak about his very valid concern here:Trump s victory hits @HasanMinhaj close to home.
