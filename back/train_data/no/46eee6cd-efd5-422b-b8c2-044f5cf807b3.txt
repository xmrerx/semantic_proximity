undisputed facts : an oak creek woman and her son have been indicted on allegations of stealing $ 3 million from the federal government through a benefits program intended to help the poor , according to court records.the indictment , released late wednesday , says the fraud was committed at family super saver store , 2301 w. hopkins st. , from 2009 to 2014 .
the indictment was handed down by the grand jury tuesday.elham m. brenda abdul rahim and ahmad zaki abdul rahim were both indicted on a count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud .
elham rahim also was indicted on counts of fraud and unauthorized use of food stamps , while ahmad rahim was also indicted on a count of lying to investigators from the u.s. department of agriculture.the conspiracy count carries up to 20 years in prison , but the defendants are likely to get much less time in prison under federal sentencing guidelines if they are convicted.ahmad rahim said wednesday he didn t know that he and his mother had been indicted and he denied being involved in any fraud .
he said his father , who has since died , used to run the store and he could not account for how he ran the operation.according to the indictment : the rahims used the store to exchange supplemental nutrition assistance program cards for cash .

the defendants would swipe the card for a certain amount , say $ 400 , and give half the amount to the recipients in cash and keep the rest .
the store would charge the government for the entire $ 400.via : jsonline
