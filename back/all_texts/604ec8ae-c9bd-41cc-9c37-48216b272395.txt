These social justice warriors always think they know what s best for you and everyone else.
Social justice is socialism so perhaps the White House press is correct.
It s easy to spread the wealth with other people s money Pope Francis and President Obama have both dedicated their lives to helping the less fortunate, and that commonality will be central to their meeting Wednesday during the pope s first visit to the United States, a White House spokesman said hours before Obama left to greet the pontiff as he landed at Andrews Air Force Base Tuesday afternoon.
Both men have talked, quite publicly, about their commitment to social justice, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said in previewing their Oval Office meeting scheduled for Wednesday morning.
And both men have dedicated their, not just their careers, but their lives, to that effort.
Certainly the kind of commitment that we ve seen from Pope Francis is unique and singular, Earnest allowed but I think the values that both men live out have some common ground.
Earnest talked about how Obama turned down high-paying jobs upon graduating law school to instead work in Chicago s poor South Side, and how Francis is known for advocating on behalf of impoverished communities in his home country of Argentina before ascending through the Roman Catholic Church s ranks.Via: Gateway Pundit
