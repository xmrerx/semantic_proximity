CARACAS (Reuters) - Venezuela s opposition coalition said on Sunday the pro-government election board was about to announce dubious results of regional elections, paving the way for a potential fraud dispute.
We have serious suspicions and doubts over the results they are going to announce, the Democratic Unity s election campaign chief, Gerardo Blyde, told reporters, after opposition leaders said earlier they were sure of a major victory.
