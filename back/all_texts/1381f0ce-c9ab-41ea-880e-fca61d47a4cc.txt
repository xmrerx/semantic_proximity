This would be a laugh a minute except for the fact that millions actually listen to this guy The most recent ramblings from U2 s Bono are a litany of lefty talking points that you ve heard a million times.
Social justice yada, yada, yada .People like Bono have absolutely no clue what Trump is about and what his mission has been.

There were setbacks, but it was as if the world was on a trajectory toward fairness and justice and equality for all.
