But that s not all he s doing to save America from Trump Sanders recently announced his plan to introduce legislation that will make it impossible for Trump continue to take advantage of tax loopholes.Trump s taxes have been a major topic throughout this entire campaign, as the business mogul continues to hold them hostage from the American people.
However, the truth has been coming out little by little.
Recent reports have stated that in 1995, Trump claimed a loss of almost one billion dollars on his tax returns, which may have enabled him to use legal tax loopholes to avoid paying federal income tax for 18 years!

It s time to create a tax system which is fair and which asks the wealthy and powerful to start paying their fair share of taxes.I will be introducing comprehensive legislation at the beginning of the next session of Congress to do just that.
