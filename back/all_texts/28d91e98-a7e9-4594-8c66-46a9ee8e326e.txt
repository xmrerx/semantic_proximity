President Trump called the branches of the Armed Forces this morning to wish everyone a Happy Thanksgiving.
He delivered his powerful comments at Mar-a-Lago where he offered his thanks and appreciation but got in a dig at Obama s terrible policy defeating ISIS.
His comments regarding the current policy in the Trump administration rang true too: It s an honor to speak with you all, to give God thanks for the blessings of freedom, and for the heroes who really have this tremendous courage that you do, to defend us and to defend freedom, Trump said.
So we want to thank you all very much.
Very, very special people.
They say we ve made more progress against ISIS than they did in years of the previous administration, Trump said.
And that s because I m letting you do your job.
You re performing more than 1,000 missions over the skies of Iraq and Syria in the last four months.
We re very, very proud of you.
Believe me, everybody in this country is watching, and they re seeing positive results for a change, instead of the neutral and negative reports.
s So as we give thanks to you this holiday, I know I speak on behalf of all Americans when I say that we totally support you, Trump said.
In fact, we love you.
We really do.
Well said Mr. President!
You can tell this president really appreciates our troops!
