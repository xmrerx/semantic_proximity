DHAKA, (Reuters) - Bangladesh and Myanmar agreed on Monday to set up a joint working group on the repatriation of Rohingya Muslim refugee who have fled to Bangladesh, Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali told reporters after talks with a Myanmar official.
We are looking forward to a peaceful solution to the crisis, Ali said after his talks with Myanmar government official Kyaw Tint Swe.
More than half a million Rohingya refugees from Myanmar have fled to neighboring Bangladesh since late August, to escape what the United Nations has branded ethnic cleansing by Myanmar s military.
