tokyo ( reuters ) - the head of japan s largest business lobby on thursday backed the prime minister s plan for companies to raise wages by 3 percent next year , boosting the chance that household spending will drive up consumer prices .
wages at big companies have been rising slightly more than 2 percent each year since 2014 , government data shows , and an increase of 3 percent or more next year would help the bank of japan to reach its inflation target .
the business community realizes that society demands higher wages , so we want to take more aggressive steps to raise wages , a government official quoted sadayuki sakakibara , chairman of the keidanren business lobby , as telling a meeting of the government s top advisory panel .
at the meeting , prime minister shinzo abe laid out a plan to encourage companies to raise wages and spend more money on capital expenditure with tax breaks .
the push for higher wages is an important part of abe s economic agenda , which has strong public support following his ruling coalition s comfortable victory in parliamentary elections on oct. 22 .
