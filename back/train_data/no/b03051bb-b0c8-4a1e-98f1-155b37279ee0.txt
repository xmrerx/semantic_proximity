cairo ( reuters ) - the leader of egypt s muslim brotherhood movement , mohamed badie , lost his appeal on wednesday against a life sentence for his role in violent clashes during political turmoil in 2013 , judicial sources said .
the judgment by the court of cassation against the sentence , handed out in 2016 , can not be appealed .
badie , 74 , was convicted for his role in violence that broke out in the suez canal city of ismailia days after the army , led by then general abdel fattah al-sisi , toppled president mohamed mursi , a member of the brotherhood , following mass demonstrations against him .
sisi was elected president the following year .
in the same case , the court on wednesday also upheld life sentences against seven other people and handed 10-year sentences to 39 and three-year sentences to 19 others .
they were charged with killing three people and attempting to kill 16 others , thuggery , and vandalizing public property among other offences , related to the clashes in ismailia in july 2013 .
authorities outlawed the brotherhood after mursi was ousted , and arrested thousands of its supporters .
they also dissolved its freedom and justice party , which mursi led .
mass life and death sentences have been common since then in what rights groups call an unprecedented crackdown by the government of sisi , who promised during campaigning for the presidency to wipe out the brotherhood .
badie has also been sentenced to life in eight other cases , only one of which has been confirmed .
two were canceled , two are pending appeal and three the subject of retrials .
