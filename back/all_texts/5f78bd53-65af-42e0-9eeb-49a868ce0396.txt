It hasn t been a very good time for Ben Carson s campaign to become America s first Black Republican President.
But his very public meltdown after getting trashed in Iowa might suggest that he has no place anywhere near the red button anyway.Carson crashed badly in Iowa, picking up just 9% of the vote, leaving him in fourth place behind Ted Cruz (28%), Donald Trump (24%) and Marco Rubio (23%).
His explanation?
According to Carson, it s all a big conspiracy to keep him out of the race for President.
He told supporters in a speech which felt rather more like a public nervous breakdown: I was reasonably happy today until I discovered the dirty tricks that were going on.
And people spreading rumors that I had dropped out and that people should caucus for somebody else, he continued.
I mean, do you think that that is something that s acceptable?
Apparently, Carson is arguing that people didn t vote for him because Ted Cruz told them not to.The candidate insisted his campaign was not over, and yet boarded an early flight home to Florida for rest meanwhile, the other candidates headed straight to New Hampshire or South Carolina to battle the next stage of the Primaries.So while his opponents were off developing their strategy for the next battleground states, Carson decided to write an email to his supporters, and continue his meltdown in public.
For months, my campaign has survived the lies and dirty tricks from opponents who profess to to detest the games of the political class, but in reality are masters at it, he wrote.
Even tonight, my opponents resorted to political tricks by tweeting, texting and telling precinct captains to announce that I had suspended my campaign in some cases asking caucus goers to change their votes.
What is considerably more certain than this conspiracy theory, is that Mr. Carson will be making that exiting from the race announcement soon.
Hopefully with a little more grace than he could muster in Iowa.
