san salvador ( reuters ) - an el salvador court on tuesday ruled in a civil case that former president mauricio funes and one of his sons had illegally enriched themselves and ordered them to pay nearly $ 420,000 in restitution to the government , a prosecutor said .
the country s second civil court ruled that funes could not justify $ 206,665 of his assets , while his son diego funes could not prove the origin of $ 212,484 , government prosecutor cecilia galindo told reporters following a closed-door ruling .
the court also recommended that prosecutors file criminal charges against funes , she said .
el salvador s attorney general had sought to recover $ 1.23 million from funes and his family .
the court acquitted funes ex-wife and the current social inclusion minister , vanda pignato , of similar charges , galindo said .
she did not specify why the court had levied a smaller fine than was sought by prosecutors .
funes , a former journalist , was elected in 2009 and brought the party formed by a former leftist guerrilla group , the farabundo marti national liberation front ( fmln ) , to power for the first time following a 1980-1992 civil war .
his term ended in 2014 and he sought asylum in nicaragua last year after claiming he was being politically persecuted .
funes said in his twitter account that he rejected the unjust and arbitrary sentence of the court .
you can not condemn defendants for stealing money from the state and say their assets are illegal just because there is pressure from the right to do so .
we will appeal this sentence , funes said in a post .
