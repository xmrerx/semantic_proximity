cairo ( reuters ) - egyptian security forces on monday killed five suspected militants and arrested 10 others in raids in the north of the country , the interior ministry said in a statement .
the suspects had planned attacks against public infrastructure and christians and had links with militants in north sinai , it said .
the raids took place in alexandria and qalyubiya provinces .
egypt has regularly carried out arrest raids and reported the killing of militant suspects in recent months as it fights a years-old islamist insurgency in the remote north sinai region .
president abdel fattah al-sisi ordered the army and security forces to restore order in sinai within three months after an attack on a mosque in november that was the deadliest in egypt s modern history .
islamic state is suspected to have conducted the attack in which more than 300 worshippers died .
security forces have also faced attacks from other islamists in the west of the country , near the border with libya .
