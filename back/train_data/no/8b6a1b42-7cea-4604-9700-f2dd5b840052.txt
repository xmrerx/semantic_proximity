united nations ( reuters ) - the united nations security council established a mali sanctions regime on tuesday that allows the body to blacklist anyone who violates or obstructs a 2015 peace deal , hinders the delivery of aid , commits human rights abuses or recruits child soldiers .
anyone added to the blacklist would be subjected to a global travel ban or asset freeze , according to the french-drafted resolution , which was unanimously adopted by the 15-member security council .
we do see the sanctions as an additional tool in order to promote the peace agreement , french u.n .
ambassador francois delattre told the security council .
time is not on our side and the peace agreement in mali is one of the keys to stabilization of the regional situation in the sahel .
the vast , arid sahel region has in recent years become a breeding ground for jihadist groups some linked to al qaeda and islamic state that european countries , particularly france , fear could threaten europe if left unchecked .
a 2015 peace deal signed by mali s government and separatist groups has failed to stop violence in northern mali by islamist militants , who have also staged assaults on high-profile targets in the capital bamako , burkina faso and ivory coast .
french forces intervened in 2013 to drive back islamist fighters who had hijacked the tuareg uprising to seize mali s desert north in 2012 .
the u.n. security council then deployed peacekeepers to the country .
attacks on u.n. troops have made it the world body s deadliest peacekeeping mission .
anyone who attacks peacekeepers could be blacklisted by the security council .
the united nations said two peacekeepers were killed and two seriously injured on tuesday in an attack on their convoy in the kidal region .
