stockholm ( reuters ) - sweden s anti-immigration sweden democrat party on wednesday tabled a parliamentary vote of no confidence in prime minister stefan lofven , demanding his resignation in the aftermath of a scandal over leaks of sensitive material .
lofven is almost certain to ride out the vote , which will take place on sept. 15 at the earliest , as the main , center-right opposition bloc has said it will not give its support .
but it will damage his standing just a year before the general election and ratchet up pressure on him to get rid of defence minister peter hultqvist , who has also been targeted by the sweden democrats over the it scandal .
the prime minister has talked about a breakdown , but he has not talked about the breakdown within his own government , parliament member paula bieler said .
if the sweden democrats attempt to unseat lofven fails , they will call for a no-confidence motion in hultqvist .
the center-right alliance bloc has also said it will table a motion of no-confidence in hultqvist .
if hultqvist is forced to resign , he would be the third minister to fall victim to the it scandal .
no-confidence motions are rare in swedish politics .
since 1980 , only seven have taken place and none one has succeeded .
