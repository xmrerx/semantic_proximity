The GOP healthcare bill that would literally kill bunches of Americans is thankfully circling the drain.
We haven t won the war on the GOP s cruel massive tax cut for the rich healthcare bill yet, but we re well on our way.
Now, with more than enough Republican senators defying Donald Trump and Mitch McConnell, we re almost there.
Also, we ve found a strong and outspoken potential ally in this fight: Senator Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.VA.).
Speaking with Politico on Sunday, Senator Capito said: I only see it through the lens of a vulnerable population who needs help, who I care about very deeply.
So that gives me strength.
If I have to be that one person, I will be it.
In these partisan times, this is an especially bold statement to make.
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is known for putting a massive amount of pressure on his members to do what he wants even if it violates their conscience or harms their constituents.
This bill definitely does that, as it will kick about 22 million people off of their healthcare if it becomes law, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office.
This would be an especially devastating for Senator Capito s state, because West Virginia is one of the states that is suffering the most from the nation s sweeping and deadly opioid crisis.That s to say nothing of the fact that people with disabilities who get their much-needed care through Medicaid would be relegated to institutions and nursing homes.
One severely disabled man and his mother went on MSNBC s The Last Word with Lawrence O Donnell and told guest host Ari Melber just how devastating Trumpcare would be to their lives.Grow a heart and a spine, GOP, and say no to Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump s deadly bill.
Did you really go to the United States Senate to make sure the people you are supposed to represent die?
If not, you ll follow Shelley Moore Capito and say no to Trumpcare.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
