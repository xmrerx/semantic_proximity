the gay mafia has a new corporate don .
this is the only article you will need to read about the sheer stupidity of left-wing agitators who are crowing about the new religious freedom law in indiana.yesterday , apple ceo tim cook , himself a gay man , published an op-ed in the washington post with this ominous title : pro-discrimination laws are dangerous .
cook argues that religious freedom laws , like the one signed by gov .
mike pence of indiana last week are dangerous to gay people.a debatable point .
however , what is not debatable is this : laws that make homosexuality punishable by death are dangerous to gay people.that s why you might be surprised to learn that cook s company , apple , does business in four ( 4 ) countries that make homosexuality a capital crime .
those countries are saudi arabia , the united arab emirates , nigeria , and qatar.if you zip on over to this page , you can see the list of all of the countries where apple does business .
those four countries are on the list.we anxiously await cnn s andrew cuomo or abc s george stephanopoulos to ask tim cook to appear on air and explain this glaring inconsistency , which should be obvious even to the average msnbc viewer.however , we all know that won t happen.via : downtrend
