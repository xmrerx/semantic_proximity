CNN went on to trash the amazing James O Keefe saying: O Keefe, who uses undercover stings to trap his targets, has a reputation for shady tactics (Says the network who was caught red-handed giving Donna Brazile debate questions to pass along to Hillary prior to the CNN hosted debate) and exaggerated statements.Some of his so-called expos s have relied on misleading editing techniques.
(How many times in the past month have we watched CNN cut the mic of a guest whose political views they disagreed with, and then called it a technical issue ?)
And an incident in 2010 landed him in legal trouble.https://twitter.com/Pamela_Moore13/status/834548654589542401After he was arrested at Senator Mary Landrieu s office, O Keefe pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor for entering federal property under false pretenses.
He was sentenced to three years of probation, plus community service and a fine.
Wow!
Is CNN referring to the guy who single-handedly (with a little help from his good friend Hannah Giles, who posed as O Keefe s prostitute) took down ACORN, one of the most corrupt leftist organizations in America?
And the same guy who exposed the truth about how Hillary s camp and Democrat operatives, who were actually responsible for inciting violence at Trump rallies?
And oh yeah the same guy who got Democrat operatives to admit on tape that they ve been committing voter fraud for several years?
Does CNN really believe anyone cares that James O Keefe was charged with a MISDEMEANOR!?
GASP!Here is CNN trying to get out ahead of what they know is going to be a public relations nightmare with a lame attempt at discrediting James O Keefe: https://twitter.com/Pamela_Moore13/status/834537309991231488Given his track record, many consider O Keefe discredited, and not a serious journalist.O Keefe s track record is impeccable and the impact his undercover videos have had cannot even be measured.
He has gifted Americans with his spectacular undercover work for years now, and we hope he continues to expose the Left and those associated with the anti-American left for a very long time.Armed with donations, (Here s the link to the Project Veritas donor site, if you re interested in contributing to the good work of an amazing team at Project Veritas) hidden cameras and his YouTube account, O Keefe has repeatedly tried to embarrass big news organizations in the past.
Most of his other subjects have been liberal groups.
Money CNNHere s a little teaser tweet that James O Keefe put out earlier today, putting CNN on notice and letting Americans know about his bombshell video tomorrow.

Here are some reactions to O Keefe s announcement:I can only imagine how many folks at @CNN are losing sleep tonight!
Especially those that got chummy with @donnabrazile #Cnnleaks #MAGA pic.twitter.com/98ahx78XL1 Pinball Wizard (@comermd) February 23, 2017Don't Worry @CNN If You Have NOTHING To Hide Then 100's Of Hours Of Leaked Footage Should Be A Cake Walk Right #CNNLeaks #MAGA pic.twitter.com/05wASjAsmZ Leah USA MADE (@LeahR77) February 23, 2017https://twitter.com/TEN_GOP/status/834556596780797952This Twitter user has an interesting point.
Twitter CEO @Jack tends to either misspell top trending conservative news #hashtags or bury them in trending hashtags.
We ll see what happens after the release of the video: Something tells me Twitter will NOT allow #CNNLeaks to trend tomorrow when the big @JamesOKeefeIII drop happens.
Just a wild guess.
