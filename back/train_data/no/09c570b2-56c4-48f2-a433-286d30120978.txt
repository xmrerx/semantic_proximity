an email released by wikileaks on sunday appears to show a former top aide to bill clinton arguing that an investigation into clinton foundation spending would show that chelsea clinton used foundation resources for her own wedding.the email , stolen from clinton campaign chairman john podesta and published by wikileaks , shows a back-and-forth between podesta and doug band , a former aide to bill clinton.band said he heard that chelsea clinton was conducting an internal investigation of money within the foundation from cgi [ clinton global initiative ] to the foundation .
he said he was hearing more chatter about how chelsea was talking about internal issues like that , and said it was not smart .
in a later follow-up to podesta , band wrote , the investigation into her getting paid for campaigning , using foundation resources for her wedding and life for a decade , taxes on money from her parents i hope that you will speak to her and end this , band added .
once we go down this road other emails showed band feuding with chelsea clinton .
for instance , clinton had warned that band was using bill clinton s name without his consent to win clients to his firm , and band replied by saying chelsea was a spoiled brat kid .
