It s bad enough that the Oscar s this year don t have any black people nominated.
Now, to insult to injury, it looks as though some folks think all black people look the same.Total Beauty, a Los Angeles based company that provides beauty tips, tweeted a photo of a stunning Whoopi Goldberg in her gown and wrote: We had no idea Oprah was tatted, and we love it.
Come on @TotalBeauty There are only a few of us there smhSorry @WhoopiGoldberg ?#screenshot pic.twitter.com/HYjdCVTdyI Holly Robinson Peete (@hollyrpeete) February 29, 2016Maybe because that s not Oprah.
We had no idea people, in this day and age, were still this dense.Well, you can only image the fun Twitter had at the expense of this company s absolute stupidity.
The hashtag #ThatsNotOprah quickly caught steam.I accidentally thought Whoopi was Oprah.

As they should be.
They re tweet calling Whoopi Oprah has since been deleted, and they ve offered an apology: We d like to apologize to Oprah and Whoopi, as well as everyone we ve offended.
It was our error, and there are no excuses.
We re sorry.

Total Beauty (@TotalBeauty) February 29, 2016As they should be.Now, some may think this is just a small error in judgement and this mistake was easy to make.
Those people are idiots.
Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah look absolutely nothing alike.
Total Beauty got called out on it and got the mocking they deserved.Featured image: Twitter/Twitter
