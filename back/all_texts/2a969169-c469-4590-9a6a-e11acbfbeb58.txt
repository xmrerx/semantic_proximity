There s stupid, and then there are those who write laws based off their ignorance and stupidity.
It d be nice if people could just keep their stupid to themselves, but alas, we have jerks writing laws to ban transgender men and women from using the bathroom.Calling out this stupid in the most real and raw way ever is Trae Crowder, who has dubbed himself in a very viral video The Liberal Redneck.
He absolutely decimated the ignorance surrounding the law in a magical one minute and forty-five seconds.After describing some of the lame arguments given why the law is needed to protect kids, Crowder says: These are the same motherf*ckers that put Mountain Dew in sippy cups and beat a six-year-old with a wire hanger for standing in front of the TV during Dr. Oz.
Adding: What do you think is gonna happen?
You do know that transgender people have existed forever, right?
What bathrooms you think they been using?
Then, after saying that the majority of sex offenders are actually grown men, Crowder throws out this zinger: Unless you re also suggesting we have separate bathrooms for Catholic priests, I think you need to cut the shit.
Then brilliantly, Crowder gets to the heart of it, and that s just that those writing the laws, or those who want the laws, simply just don t like the idea of transgender individuals.
He said: Because like most things that disgust you, you lack the capacity to understand it.
You know, h*mos, algebra sh*t like that.
He closes by saying that whether these bigots like it or not, people like himself and those who actually have the capacity to embrace those different from ourselves, are going to ensure the world is a better, more accepting place for generations to come.Well done, Crowder, you got to the heart of it, called it out, and said it like it is.Watch the video here:Featured image via video screen capture
