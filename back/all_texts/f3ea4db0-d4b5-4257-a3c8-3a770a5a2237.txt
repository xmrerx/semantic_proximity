While Republicans constantly shove their judgmental fingers in people s faces over some perverted and hate-filled idea of Christianity, Democratic Senator Cory Booker showed that real Christianity is about love and compassion with his response to a pretty typical Donald Trump twitter insult.Here s the video:It all began after Booker s speech at the Democratic National Convention.
Booker had the gall to call Trump out for mocking a disabled reporter.Trump, who insulted all the speakers, had some unkind words about the New Jersey Senator in a tweet, of course:If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future!
I know more about Cory than he knows about himself.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 26, 2016Rather than escalating into a Twitter war, Booker took to CNN to reply that he loves Donald Trump, just not his policies.
I love Donald Trump, Booker said Tuesday on CNN s New Day.
I don t want to answer his hate with hate.
I m going to answer it with love.
I m not going to answer his darkness with darkness.
He wants us to be speculating.
It sounds so sinister, he told CNN s Chris Cuomo and Alisyn Camerota.
I don t care, I love you Donald.
I pray for you.
I hope that you find some kindness in your heart, that you re not going to be somebody that spews out insults to your political opposition, that you re going to find some way to love.

I love you.
I just don t want him to be my president.
I don t want you to have the White House to be spewing that kind of mean-spirited hate that doesn t even belong in a playground sandbox, he said.He also said that while he ll keep on spreading love instead of hate, Trump s vitriol, that kind of meanness has no place in the presidency.
He challenged Trump to Bring it on!
