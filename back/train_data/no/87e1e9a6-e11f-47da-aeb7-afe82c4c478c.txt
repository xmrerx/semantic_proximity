boston ( reuters ) - democratic white house candidate hillary clinton is leading among likely voters aged 18 to 29 , according to a harvard university opinion poll released on wednesday .
the former u.s. secretary of state had the support of 49 percent of likely voters , ahead of republican rival donald trump ’ s 28 percent support , a substantially wider lead than democratic president barack obama had over republican former massachusetts governor mitt romney at the same point in 2012 .
national polls of voters of all ages also show clinton leading , though by a substantially narrower margin .
some 14 percent of respondents said they planned to vote for libertarian gary johnson , with 5 percent supporting the green party ’ s jill stein and 11 percent still undecided .
more than one in three self-described johnson voters said they were likely to change their minds before election day .
a majority of respondents , 51 percent , described themselves as “ fearful ” about the future of america , with just 14 percent of the 2,150 respondents saying they believed the country was headed in the right direction .
the sense of fearfulness was most predominant among white respondents , though 85 of black respondents said they believed they were “ under attack ” in modern american society .
some 62 percent of respondents said they believed race relations in the united states would worsen if trump was elected president .
twenty-two percent thought race relations would deteriorate if clinton won the nov. 8 election , with the plurality , 36 percent predicting they would stay the same .
the survey , conducted oct. 7-17 has a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points , meaning results could vary that much either way .
