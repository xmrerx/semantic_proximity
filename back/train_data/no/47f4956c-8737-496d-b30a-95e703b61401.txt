barcelona ( reuters ) - catalonia s independence movement could suffer a serious setback in elections this month , according to a poll published on sunday , which suggests separatist parties will narrowly fail to secure a majority in the regional parliament .
the three parties which supported catalonia s frustrated push to split from spain in october are seen as returning a total of 66 or 67 seats in the dec. 21 election , just shy of the 68 seats they would need to control the regional parliament , according to the poll in spanish newspaper la vanguardia .
unionist parties combined are also seen as falling short of an absolute majority , the poll finds , opening the door to a possible hung parliament with catcomu-podem , the catalan arm of the anti-austerity podemos party , as a potential kingmaker .
market friendly unionist party ciudadanos and two pro-independence parties , erc and junts per catalunya , the party of former catalan leader carles puigdemont , are in a dead heat to be the largest parliamentary force , according to the poll based on interviews between dec. 4 and dec. 7 .
turnout for the election , which was forced by the central government in an effort to break the political crisis that seized the region in recent months , is predicted to reach a record 82 percent .
