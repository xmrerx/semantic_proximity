WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A draft order calling for a review of whether a defunct CIA program to interrogate terrorist suspects in secret overseas “black site” prisons should be revived is not a White House document, the White House said on Wednesday.
“It is not a White House document,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters.
“I have no idea where it came from, but it is not a White House document.”
