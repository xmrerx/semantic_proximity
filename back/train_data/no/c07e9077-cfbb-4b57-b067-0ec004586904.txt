athens ( reuters ) - three people drowned , at least six were missing and scores of others were rescued in three separate incidents of migrants trying to reach greece across the aegean sea early friday .
greek authorities recovered the body of a woman and searched for more people missing after a wooden boat carrying migrants sank off kalymnos island , close to the turkish coast .
fifteen people , 10 men , four women and a child , were rescued , and greek coastguard vessels were searching for another six to eight people missing , a greek coastguard official said .
the turkish coastguard said it recovered another two bodies on its side of the maritime border , and that the boat was carrying 27 people .
rescue operations in turkish waters were ongoing , it said .
the departure point of the boat and the nationality of those on board was not immediately clear .
separately , greece rescued 127 migrants and refugees off chios island on board two boats in distress earlier on friday , the coastguard said .
arrivals of refugees and migrants to greece , which shares a long sea border with turkey , have increased in recent months , but not on the scale of mass arrivals in 2015 .
nearly 148,100 refugees and migrants have crossed to greece from turkey this year - a fraction of the nearly 1 million arrivals in 2015 - but arrivals have increased in recent months .
an average 214 people arrived daily in september , compared with 156 in august and 87 in july , greece s migration minister , yannis mouzalas , said on wednesday .
about 60,000 refugees and migrants , mostly syrians , afghans and iraqis , have been stranded in greece after border closures in the balkans halted the onward journey many planned to take to central and western europe .
