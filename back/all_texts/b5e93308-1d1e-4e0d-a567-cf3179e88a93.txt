The Republican Party may be losing another supporter as GOP Senator Susan Collins of Maine won t rule out voting for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Collins, who is a moderate, reached that decision based on Donald Trump s comments regarding Judge Gonzalo Curiel.
Calling his comments an order of magnitude more serious than anything else he s said so far on the campaign trail, Collins told reporters:This is a difficult choice, and it s one, like many of my colleagues, that I am struggling with.
It s not like we have perfect candidates from whom to choose in this election I worked very well with Hillary when she was my colleague in the Senate and when she was Secretary of State.
But I do not anticipate voting for her this fall.
I m not going to say never, because this has been such an unpredictable situation, to say the least.When pressed that her comment looks like she would be willing to back the Democratic nominee over the Republican, she responded:That is true.
But I do want to qualify that by saying it is unlikely that I would choose to vote for the Democratic candidate.In Collins own words, never say never.
While most Republicans refusing to back Trump have almost all indicated they would never vote for Clinton, Collins becomes the first Hill Republican to leave the option on the table for now.Collins told reporters just earlier this week that if Trump wants to earn her endorsement, he will have to really have to change his approach.
She also called on he presumptive Republican nominee to own up to making a mistake and to apologize to Curiel.As Trump enters the general phase of his campaign, he certainly isn t off to a good start with those in his own party.
Mark Kirk of Illinois has rescinded his support for Trump and Senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio have held off on endorsing.With Republican lawmakers so openly hostile towards Trump, it leaves people wondering just how many of these people are actually going to vote for him.Featured image via Alex Wong
