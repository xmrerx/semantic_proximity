moscow ( reuters ) - russia will abide by a european court of human rights ruling requiring it to pay nearly 3 million euros ( $ 3.6 million ) in damages for the 2004 beslan school siege , interfax news agency reported on tuesday , citing the russian justice ministry .
russia used excessive force to storm a school in the small southern russian town seized by islamist militants in 2004 , causing a high number of hostages to be killed , the court ruled in april .
the three-day drama began when islamist militants took more than 1,000 people hostages on the first day of the school year and called for independence for the majority-muslim region of chechnya .
more than 330 hostages lost their lives , including at least 180 children , when the siege ended in a gun battle .
it was the bloodiest incident of its kind in modern russian history .
the case for damages was brought by 409 russian nationals who either were taken hostage or injured in the incident , or were family members of those taken hostage , killed or injured , the european court of human rights statement said in april .
on tuesday , the court said in a press release that its grand chamber panel had rejected a russian government request to refer the case and said its ruling was final .
no other actions are being contemplated by the participants in this process , the russian justice ministry said in comments carried by interfax news agency .
in its april ruling , the court said the heavy-handed way russian forces stormed the school had contributed to the casualties among the hostages .
it also ruled that authorities had failed to take reasonable preventive measures , despite knowing militants were planning to attack an educational institution .
