reykjavik/copenhagen ( reuters ) - iceland s centre-right independence party has pulled ahead in an opinion poll before saturday s parliamentary vote , the second snap election in a year after a string of political scandals .
the independence party , which was part of every government from 1980 to 2009 and has been in power since 2013 , got 24 percent support in a poll published on thursday by frettabladid , iceland s largest newspaper .
the left-green party polled at 19 percent , while the social democrats stood to get 14.3 percent of votes as the third-biggest party .
just a week ago , the independence party and the left-greens stood neck and neck in polls at just under 20 percent each .
a victory for the independence party would give prime minister bjarni benediktsson the right to try to form a new government .
the pirate party , which rode a wave of anger against the establishment to become the third-biggest party in elections a year ago , stood to get 9 percent of votes , thursday s poll showed .
