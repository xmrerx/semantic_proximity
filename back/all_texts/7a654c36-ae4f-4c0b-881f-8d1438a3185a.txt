Donald Trump, at 71 years old, apparently just can t help but be a lecherous pervert who judges women solely on physical attractiveness and rarely does that include women over 50.French President Emmanuel Macron s wife Brigitte is 24 years his senior.
I guess Trump was taken by surprise that a 64-year-old woman could possibly be fit and attractive, so he did what no one with any diplomatic skills would ever even consider he complimented her looks, but not just her general looks, he told her she has a good body.
Perhaps the most disturbing part of that is that he thought he was being appropriate.Here s the video:Twitter had a field day with it: And what I hope #BrigitteMacron said to @POTUS And you look like a sack of s*** you lumpen plonker .

The answer was pretty much never, unless instead of a woman, you re talking about an action figure from your childhood.In case you were wondering when it IS appropriate to say, You re in such good shape beautiful, THIS: pic.twitter.com/Z1cnnRD8Ut Reebok (@Reebok) July 14, 2017I ll have to admit that I haven t bought a pair of Reeboks in a while.
