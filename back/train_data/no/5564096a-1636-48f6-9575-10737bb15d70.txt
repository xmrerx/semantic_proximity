this is what happens when political candidates divide nations by color to secure minority voting blocks , while white people are shamed into going along with a divisive , mean-spirited movement parenting magazine baby & family has told readers to beware of families who are inconspicuous and cheerful , as these warning signs indicate they are right wing and thus dangerous .
depicted with illustrations featuring solely blonde women and children , the report says ordinary parents must take action against right-wing families and make clear that their ideology has no place in the world.asserting that the term right wing stirs up anxiety and brings to mind burning refugee homes , skinheads , and the national socialist underground ( nsu ) group who carried out a string of violent attacks on foreign people , baby & family notes that people rarely connect it with women , family and children .this , the high-circulation german magazine declares , is precisely the great risk as such people are just as dangerous if not more so as gangs of nazi skinheads .
