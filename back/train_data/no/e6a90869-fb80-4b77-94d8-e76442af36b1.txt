whoever thought asking obama s terrorists soldiers to shut down highways , throw molotov cocktails , bricks , concrete and fireworks at innocent human beings who risk their lives every day to keep our cities and towns safe would be a good idea , should really reconsider .
there hasn t been this much anger or distrust between americans in decades .
in the end , this movement will have just the opposite effect the protesters hoped it would have .
police officers will likely stop coming into high crime areas and will instead , allow residents to sort out their own dangerous situations .
this movement has completely divided our country into responsible , level-headed americans vs. angry citizens and illegal aliens who have signed up to be soldiers in obama s race war and his war on law enforcement in america .
nothing good or positive will come out of this and obama knows that .
but then again , barack care about the interests of the americans who elected him .
it s all about pushing his radical agenda .
