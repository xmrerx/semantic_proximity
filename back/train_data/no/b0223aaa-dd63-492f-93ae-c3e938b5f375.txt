# dncleak pic.twitter.com/9l2ixl24er wikileaks ( @ wikileaks ) august 10 , 2016wikileaks has not said when it will now make its announcement .assange appeared on fox news last month , repeating his assertion that wikileaks has damaging documents on clinton and suggested wikileaks may soon release teasers .
more than three weeks later , that release has yet to take place.clinton s more fervent opponents have hoped for weeks that the promised document dump would be an october surprise damaging and revelatory emails or the like and inflict a mortal wound on her campaign .
there s no evidence however that such damaging information even exists.it was only this summer that assange s group leaked thousands of embarrassing emails from the democratic national committee which showed their disdain for bernie sanders insurgent campaign for the democratic presidential nomination .
the uproar over the disclosures forced dnc chairwoman debbie wasserman-schultz to resign in disgrace on the eve of the democratic national convention.death threats ? assange and his supporters have long claimed that his personal safety is at risk due to the danger he ( supposedly ) represents to clinton s presidential ambitions .
in august , liberal commentator bob beckel suggested in a tv appearance that assange be murdered , proclaiming that someone should shoot the son of a bitch !
assange himself has also recently hinted publicly that low-level dnc staffer seth rich , who was murdered this summer in washington dc , had been the source for wikileaks document dump on the dnc .
and that rich s alleged role in the leaks was linked to his death.via : heat street
