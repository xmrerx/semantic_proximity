The cover of National Geographic s upcoming January issue has sparked outrage online for featuring children questioning their genders and spotlighting what they call a gender revolution.
With articles titled, Making a man, Dangerous Lives of Girls, and Rethinking Gender, the publication is dedicating their entire first issue of 2017 to the single topic of the shifting landscape of gender, according to a press release.
To a degree unimaginable a decade ago, the intensely personal subject of gender identity has entered the public square, the press release states, adding that the issue will hit print newsstands on December 27.

Children are not mature enough to make these decisions.
They're still developing.

Say what?
: A penis doesn't make a man any more than a vagina makes a woman.
QED: gender has nothing to do with genitalia.
