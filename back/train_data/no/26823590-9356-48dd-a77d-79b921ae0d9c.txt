republicans have put forward a plan to stop obama administration s last minute regulations tuesday .
these midnight regulations published after the 2016 presidential election could cost the american taxpayer over $ 44 billion.california republican rep. darrell issa re-introduced legislation tuesday that would allow congress to overturn executive branch regulations finalized in the last 60 legislative days of an outgoing presidential administration.the bill amends the congressional review act , which would allow congress to recoup the ability to essentially curb numerous regulations rushed through the regulatory process in the last days of an outgoing administration at one time.issa s office claims the bill is designed to stem a growing trend by presidents , of both parties , to use their last few months in office to rush in costly , expensive or controversial new regulations .
the legislation , expected to be approved by the house wednesday , was already introduced with support from the judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte and pennsylvania republican rep. tom marino .
regulations impacting the economy , the environment , families , and our community should be done with great caution and transparency , not get rushed in last-minute on a president s way out of office .
this is a good piece of legislation that will help keep this and future presidents in check .
the midnight rules relief act is a reasonable plan to strengthen executive branch oversight , giving congress a better tool to ensure regulations are limited and , when necessary , approved in an open and transparent manner , issa said in a statement .
