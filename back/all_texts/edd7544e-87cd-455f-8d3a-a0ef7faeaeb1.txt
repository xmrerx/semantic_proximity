The latest results are in and things are looking pretty bleak for President Trump As of Monday, practically every single poll had Donald Trump plummeting in the ratings, however, the support of his impeachment was steadily rising and has now actually overtaken the president s approval rating.Yes, even when the margin of error is factored in, more U.S. voters are in support of Trump s impeachment compared to those that simply support him as the president and it doesn t really come as much of a surprise when one considers the events of the past week.
First, Trump pulled the U.S. out of the Paris climate accord, then there was the way he responded to the London terror attacks, undermining London mayor Sadiq Khan with a Twitter tirade that continually took one of Khan s comments completely out of context.
Add to these the ongoing probe into Russia possibly having a hand in helping him win the U.S. presidential election and Trump is not a particularly popular man at the moment.According to a Gallup poll published on Monday, Trump s approval rating dropped from almost 42% prior to the weekend down to 36%, inching ever so closer back to his all-time low of 35% back in March.
On the other hand, a Politico/Morning Consult poll published the same day found that almost 43% of American voters are in favor of beginning the official procedure to have Trump impeached.Despite there being no exact concrete number for where the president s approval rating stands, every poll reflected the exact same pattern over the course of the weekend following Trump s decision on the Paris agreement.
That includes polling sites such as Rasmussen Reports, ones that lean more than just a little to the right, still showing that 54% disapprove of the President s tenure.While Trump might have achieved a personal-high approval rating of 42% after his first official overseas trip as president, he is now rapidly approaching the territory of the lowest approval rating in the history of modern American politics.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
