Charles Woods, father of U.S. Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods, who was killed during the Benghazi attack, appeared on CNN Tuesday.
CNN Newsroom host Carol Costello repeatedly badgered him about Donald Trump s feud with Khizr Khan, and whether Trump should apologize.
I know who should apologize, and that would be Hillary Clinton, for lying to the American families who lost their loved ones as well as to the American public, Woods said.
