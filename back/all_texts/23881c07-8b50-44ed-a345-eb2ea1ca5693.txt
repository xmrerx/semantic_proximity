A microphone guy who worked on The Apprentice just came forward to tell the world that Donald Trump often referred to him as a f*cking monkey.
According to Buzzfeed News, the sound engineer is white, but he wanted his story to be heard without his name being released, because apparently, Trump was quite a monster to him and to many others, including to women whom he sexually harassed.He told Buzzfeed: Micing him was honestly the most abusive, humiliating, experience of my fifteen years as a sound engineer.
He treated me like I wasn t a human being.
In fact, there were several times Trump would refer to him as a f*cking monkey.
Trump would say: Woah, woah woah, who s this fucking monkey?
As well as: I m not gonna let this fucking monkey touch me unless he washes his hands.
Then he would be monitored by Trump s assistant to make sure he went and washed his hands.He also told Buzzfeed: Trump just kept calling me a f*cking monkey over and over.
I ve mic d everyone from Ben Affleck to Ren e Zellweger, and never, ever in my career have I run into something like that.
Apparently, working for him was pretty much one of the worst gigs in town.
He was a monster to many, many people, including several women he would sexually harass.
And after listening to Trump on the released Access Hollywood tapes, that is very, very easy to believe.Trump is not a person who should be allowed anywhere near the Oval Office.
He s a racist and misogynistic egomaniac who seems to have a short temper while having none of the required experience to be leader of the free world.Something tells me there will be more and more of these stories coming out as we get closer to election day, and hopefully, it will be the icing on the cake to make sure he s never, ever elected president.Featured Photo by Amanda Edwards/Getty Images
