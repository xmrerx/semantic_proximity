As Elizabeth Warren amps up her attacks on the Donald Trump and his fraudulent university (and V.P.
rumors are abuzz), the GOP nominee has decided to write her off simply as Pocahontas, echoing attacks from Scott Brown s campaign made over a controversy that looms over the Massachusetts senator.But like Hillary Clinton with her delete your account comment, a Warren supporter is trolling the loud, nasty, thin-skinned fraud (Warren s words) by purchasing the domain site Pocahontas.com and linking it back to her Senate campaign website.It s the ultimate trolling.
After calling her the Indian, Republicans have yet again been put into an awkward situation with Trump s blatant racism.
According to the Washington Post, some Republican lawmakers such as John McCain and Tom Cole (who is Native American) are uncomfortable with the rhetoric while some, including Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Roger Wicker of Mississippi, are brushing it off as good humor.
Trump s comments also caused ire with weary Republicans at Mitt Romney s summit in Utah, where mega-donors like Meg Whitman compared the Republican nominee to Hitler and Mussolini due to his racist rhetoric.Considering the fact that Hillary Clinton is ahead of Trump in five new national polls, it would make sense that the orange racist with tiny hands would go after Elizabeth Warren, who may very well be Clinton s running mate.
In fact, at a rally, Trump again referred to Warren as Pocahontas while his supporters responded with fake Indian war chants.Totally not racist, right?So please, if you can, type in Pocahontas.com and consider donating to Elizabeth Warren (she ll be needing it if she decides to join Hillary Clinton in making history).Trump s racist rhetoric is catching up to him, and people can see it.
Clinton and Warren are also getting under his skin.
Instead of promising good policy, Trump has devoting all his time to comebacks on Twitter.If this how the campaign will unfold, get ready for a Clinton landslide.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
