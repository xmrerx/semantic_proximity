Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump has redefined the election process.
All predictions can be thrown out the window along with hope and human decency.
In a decent society, if a presidential candidate was horrifically racist, they would be condemned.
If they cursed and spoke in a totalitarian tone, they would be quickly ushered out of any hope of winning an election.
However, this election seems different.
People seem to be lining up behind Trump s racism, xenophobia and totalitarian rhetoric in huge numbers.
Numbers reminiscent of another totalitarian regime that rose up in Europe during the 1930s and 40s.To be blunt, we cannot allow Donald Trump to win the Oval Office.
Not only would it be bad for the nation, but it would be horrific for the entire world.
Top foreign diplomats are already standing against Trump.
They know how dangerous his rhetoric is.Trump s campaign isn t the joke campaign everyone originally made it out to be.
No, he wants to be president, and that notion should scare the crap out of absolutely everyone worldwide.
The leader of the free world can t be against half the people living in it.Showing Trump in his true form, American Future Fund put together an ad that puts Trump at the White House podium using his inflammatory and derogatory rhetoric, curse words and all.
If seeing him at the podium doesn t light a fire under your ass to make sure he s never elected, then nothing will.Our nation is better than this.
We re better than this.
We cannot allow Trump to be President of the United States.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Thw6k1XNRtcFeatured image via image screen capture
