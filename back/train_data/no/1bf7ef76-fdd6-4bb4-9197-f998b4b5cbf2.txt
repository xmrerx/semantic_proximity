apparently being the daughter of the most corrupt political couple in america comes with some pretty significant financial benefits politico reported last year : when hillary clinton s speaking fees proved too steep for one public university last year , school officials reached for a less expensive alternative : her daughter , chelsea.according to a report from the washington post , representatives from the former secretary of state s office gave officials at the university of missouri-kansas city a $ 275,000 quote for a one-time speaking fee .
yikes !
one official emailed another , according to the report .
rather than paying that much , umkc opted to pay chelsea $ 65,000 for a brief appearance in february 2014 .
the former first daughter spoke for 10 minutes before participating in a 20-minute q & a session and posing for pictures .
for a sample of what that $ 65,000 might have bought the university , check out the clip above of chelsea recently on the campaign trail bashing trump.at one minute , the former first brat thinks this is worth $ 6500 of a public s schools money.what s that about wage equality , clinton spawn ?
