Unwilling to do the right thing himself, the United States Office of Government Ethics just sent Trump a letter asking him to punish Kellyanne Conway for her clear violation of the law in promoting Ivanka s clothing line.Conway told a giddy Fox News morning crew that she loves Ivanka s clothing and urged viewers to rush out to buy more of the merchandise all while standing in the White House briefing room.The OGE, like many independent lawyers, pointed out that this was a blatant violation of conflict of interest laws.
Even more infuriating, the White House appears to have made no effort to discipline Conway for a violation that many assumed would end in her termination.Although Press Secretary Sean Spicer stated during a press conference on February 9, 2017, that, Kellyanne has been counseled, and that s all we re going to go with, OGE has not yet received notification of any disciplinary or other corrective ation against Ms. Conway.
When OFGE has reason to believe that an employee may have violated the Standards of Ethical Conduct for Employees of the Executive Branch, OGE is authorized to recommend that the employing agency investigate the matter and consider taking disciplinary action against the employee.The OGE again reiterated that, given Conway s shameless plug on national television, the evidence is plain to see and that disciplinary action is warranted.
Meanwhile, Trump is busy throwing his national security advisor under the bus after the Washington Post proved that Michael Flynn did, in fact, illegally discuss Russian sanctions with Russia s ambassador to the U.S. before Trump was inaugurated.
Conway would represent the second high-profile advisor that Trump would have to jettison for separate ethics violations in a single week surely some kind of record.So far, Trump has refused to do anything to punish Conway.
In fact, he, too, used his station as president to promote his daughter s clothing line, tweeting a hit job on the Nordstrom retail chain for dropping her brand from its stores.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images
