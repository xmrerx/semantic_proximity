belfast ( reuters ) - northern ireland s political parties are rapidly running out of time to restore a devolved power-sharing government , britain s minister for the region said on monday , as he sought to avoid a return of direct rule from london .
the window of opportunity to restore devolution and to form an executive is closing rapidly as we move further into the autumn and with pressures in public services already evident , the need for intervention is becoming increasingly clear , james brokenshire told a news conference .
i don t want to have to take this action , my intent is for politicians in northern ireland to form an executive .
i m not going to pretend that this is easy as clear differences remain but it does remain achievable .
