ankara ( reuters ) - the united states has told turkey that jailed gold trader reza zarrab is in good medical condition , turkish deputy prime minister bekir bozdag said on thursday .
bozdag was speaking a day after turkey asked u.s. authorities about zarrab , who is awaiting trial in the united states on charges of evading u.s. sanctions on iran .
last week the u.s. federal bureau of prisons website showed that zarrab had been released , but a u.s. spokesman said on monday that he remained in federal custody .
