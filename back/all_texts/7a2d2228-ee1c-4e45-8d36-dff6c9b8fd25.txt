Tamara Holder was a guest on Joy Reid s MSNBC show this morning and mocked the women in President Trump s life.
Ironically, Holder was billed as an equal rights attorney and advocate .
Here she is mocking the women in Donald Trump s life BUT she claims to be an advocate for equal rights .Holder was peeved that women surrounding Trump had failed to condemn him over his tweets directed at Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough: I think the women in Donald Trump s life probably have smaller minds than his small hands .
.
.
he has continued to surround himself, Donald Trump, with very, very, weak-minded women, who are afraid of him.
Holder had mentioned Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Kellyanne Conway, and First Lady Melania Trump in her earlier comments.Small minds?
Weak-minded?
Afraid?
Holder s comments are laughable at best but only prove the nastiness and double standard of the left.
Has Tamara Holder ever been in a toe-to-toe conversation or debate with any of these women?
Nope!We would love, love, love to see Holder go toe-to-toe with any of these strong women!
