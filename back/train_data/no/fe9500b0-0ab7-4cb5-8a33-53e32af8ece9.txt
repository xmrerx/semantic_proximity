what in the world has become of the democrat party ?
hillary snubs the largest police union in america and then her vp candidate promotes black lives matter in his speech to the urban league .
is the democrat party the new party of lawlessness ?
rudy giuliani weighs in on this and jumps all over hillary : rudy giuliani joined the fox and friends weekend co-hosts today to react to the revelation that hillary clinton has snubbed the largest police union in the country.giuliani said the fact that clinton isn t seeking the endorsement of the national fraternal order of police is indicative of a shift among democrats .
the democratic party has become an anti-law enforcement party , giuliani said .
and this is the best demonstration of it .
he accused the democrats of stoking the flames of anti-police sentiment across the country , leading to the rise of groups like black lives matter and an increase in violence against law enforcement officers .
it comes right from the top , it includes hillary , giuliani said .
you don t even go talk to and seek the endorsement of one of the major police unions in the country ?
he noted that democrats didn t allow uniformed police officers on the floor of the dnc , calling the party s treatment of law enforcement outrageous .
