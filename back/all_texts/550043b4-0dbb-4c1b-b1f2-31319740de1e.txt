If you ve attended a basic geography class, you probably know that France and Germany are separate countries.
You probably also know that Paris is the capital of France.

Just announced that terror threat is at highest level, Trump tweeted Thursday.
Germany is a total mess-big crime.
Ironically, he ended the tweet with GET SMART!
