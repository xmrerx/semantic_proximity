Last night, Donald Trump gave a speech in Wisconsin that was meant to appeal to people of color a voting bracket that the Republican nominee has epically failed in trying to get on board with his campaign and policies.Trump must have been well aware that currently, only 1% of African Americans are supporting him and the fact that there is unrest and riots happening in Milwaukee you can always count on The Donald to find an opportunity to make himself look good and exploit tragedy.Here s a clip of the speech Trump gave, which is a blatant, pathetic attempt to try and win over African American voters by a man who once called a black man in the crowd My African American.
