I think we need somebody who knows the military.
I think he (Rick Perry) knows the military I find it difficult to want a Commander in Chief who has no experience being in the trenches, whatsoever I like somebody who answers to a Higher Power so it s not just all about them all the time.
That they truly are going to a Higher Power to see what they can do What I believe in is electing a leader who has a strong moral compass, who cares about people and not just himself and his own agenda.
And who is humble and good economically.
