tokyo ( reuters ) - police in northern japan have found eight men near a boat at a seaside marina who said they were from north korea , and appear to be fishermen whose vessel ran into trouble , rather than defectors , a police official said on friday .
the incident comes at a time of rising tension over north korea s nuclear arms and missile programs after president donald trump redesignated the isolated nation a state sponsor of terrorism , allowing the united states to levy further sanctions .
japanese police took the men into custody after a resident of yurihonjo , a city in the prefecture of akita , told police of the presence of individuals of unknown nationality , the official , yoshinobu ito , told reuters .
the men , who said they were north koreans , appear to be fishermen whose wooden boat , found nearby , had trouble and went adrift , ito said .
police and authorities were now dealing with the matter , he added .
chief cabinet secretary yoshihide suga , asked if the possibility the men were spies had been ruled out , told a news conference authorities were handling the matter carefully .
japan is studying plans to cope with a possible influx of tens of thousands of north korean evacuees should a military or other crisis break out on the peninsula , as well as how to weed out spies and terrorists among them , a domestic newspaper said .
last week , the japan coast guard rescued three north korean men on a capsized boat in the sea of japan , off central japan .
the men said they were fishermen and were later sent home aboard a north korean vessel .
twelve more crew went missing .
last week a north korean soldier dramatically defected to the south after being shot and wounded by his country s military as he made his getaway across the border in the heavily guarded demilitarized zone between the two countries .
