Double standards everywhere!
Socialist Bernie Sanders was asked whether Senator Al Franken should step down following an accusation of sexual misconduct.
Bernie replied that, Al is a very popular senator .
He totally dodges a yes or no answer what a hypocrite!
Notice how he goes on with the Dem talking points on women and how they aren t treated well in the workplace While Democrats cry out for Roy Moore to step down, they obviously have a double standard when it comes to their own CNN s Jake Tapper asked about the Franken scandal on State Of The Union.
PROOF OF GROPING WITH FRANKEN BUT ZERO PROOF WITH MOORE:A Los Angeles-based radio anchor wrote Franken aggressively kissed her without consent during a USO tour in 2006, and she also published a photo of Franken apparently groping her breasts while she slept.
Franken apologized, and he said he would cooperate with an ethics investigation.
I think that s a decision for Al Franken and the people of the state of Minnesota, Sanders said.
My understanding is that Al is a very popular senator.
People in Minnesota think that he is doing a good job, and his political future will rest with the people of Minnesota.
SO IS BERNIE SANDERS SUGGESTING FRANKEN SHOULD STAY BECAUSE HE S POPULAR?So socialist Bernie Sanders believes all is equal unless it comes down to Republican vs. Democrat?
Roy Moore is very popular in Alabama and nothing has been proven against him .NOTHING!There is proof with Franken BUT he s popular soooooo he gets a pass for being a groper?Double Standards, Double Standards Everywhere!READ MORE: WFB
