During a segment on the Late Show, host Stephen Colbert ripped the GOP for creating the monster that is Donald Trump.
Republicans are right now working double time to slay the beast.Right now, the GOP s strategy is to urge people to vote for any candidate who they think can win enough delegates to take down Trump.
Mocking this strategy, Colbert says: What an inspiring message for the world s greatest democracy.
Don t vote for who you think should be president, vote for whichever candidate in your state has the best chance of keeping Trump from getting enough delegates.
It s a system often employed by bros in bars that rhymes with clock block.
The GOP has cast Mitt Romney as their knight in Republican red.
The Republican establishment thinks that Romney s anti-Trump political crusade might be what is needed to halt Trump in his tracks.
However, as Colbert notes, there is something that the GOP seems to have forgotten Trump isn t a politician.
This guy says that s the only way to save democracy from the voters.
After you vote, maybe they ll give you a sticker that says, I did what Mitt Romney told me to do.
This game of ganging up on the popular guy that s actually winning, that s not democracy that s a reality show strategy.
And that s Trump s home turf.
Do you honestly think you re going to be better at this than him?
Trump is not running a political campaign, Colbert continues.
He s a reality show contestant who has established himself as a villain to polarize the audience and then do whatever it takes to get to the final tribal council to get the rose that lets him have sex with the top chef.
Then you get to name a Supreme Court justice in the fantasy suite.
It looks like the only thing that will take down Trump s campaign is the Democratic nominee.
Fortunately, polls indicate that there is an almost guaranteed chance of a Dem trouncing Trump in the general election.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot
