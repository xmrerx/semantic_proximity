the glowing review we gave to miss usa kara mccullough must be revoked bummer ! she was our hero when she defended liberty from the liberals who believe healthcare is not a right but a privilege .
liberals wasted no time exploding in rage , seeing it as an intolerable betrayal of their ideology by someone who had an advantage in the pursuit of her crown due to political correctness .
today we see this : i am privileged to have health care .
i do believe it should be a right .
@ missusa 2017 k ra mccullough clarifies response .
# missusa pic.twitter.com/qcc7irmmmq good morning america ( @ gma ) may 16 , 2017if healthcare is to be a right for all worldwide , you had better open up your wallet .
places like uganda can not be provided with modern healthcare on a coercive basis at the national level .
socialism has always been globalist in its redistributive aspirations.hot air says maybe she really is clarifying rather than reversing what she actually meant : her answer on sunday night wasn t all that coherent ( to all the american citizens worldwide ? ) .
she may have heard the word privilege and , in the stress of the moment , processed it not in the legal sense but in the colloquial sense , as a synonym for gratitude for one s good fortune .
e.g. , it s a privilege to be a citizen of the greatest country in the world , i m privileged to have a wonderfully supportive family , what a privilege to have good medical care through your job , etc .
a pageant contestant wants to project graciousness , so that s what she did.or maybe she was taken to the woodshed for an attitude adjustment , and came back a commie.via : moonbattery
