For most of us, the thought of no longer having President Obama in the White House brings tears to our eyes.
He s the very embodiment of change, the very picture of elegance, and has been, by far, one of the best leaders this nation has ever seen, as history will show.However, for most of us, we were around before Obama.
We know a world without him as Commander-in-Chief.
We know that while not ideal, the world will go on without him in the Oval Office.
But what if you were born when he was already in office?
What if you don t know a world with him as leader of the free world?
That s a pretty scary concept, and one little girl is just now grasping that reality.In a video posted to Facebook, Caprina D. Harris shows her granddaughter in the midst of a meltdown after realizing President Obama will no longer be president.
She writes, He has been her President all of her life and Yes her birthday is also on AUGUST 4!!!!
My poor baby!!!
This little girl is clearly devastated over President Obama finishing up his second term.
However, it s a feeling many of us share, but she manages to perfectly put into emotions and words.
When she utters, I m not ready!!
Neither are we, little one.
Neither are we.Hopefully whoever we choose next will be able to carry on his legacy.// < !
