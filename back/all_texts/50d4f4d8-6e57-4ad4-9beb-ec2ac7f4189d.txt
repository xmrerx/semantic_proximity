Donald Trump blew his own horn after his first press conference in six months on Wednesday, and Americans swiftly told him to shut the hell up.During the conference, Trump attacked the media over a leaked dossier of unverified information that included a claim that he was videotaped at the Ritz Carlton hotel in Moscow paying prostitutes to pee on the bed in the presidential suite that President Obama once stayed in.
The scandal has gone viral and is being dubbed Golden Showers.
The dossier also alleges that Trump colluded with the Russians to attack Hillary Clinton among many other claims.Trump lost his shit during the conference when CNN reporter Jim Acosta asked him some questions, and at one point, threatened Buzzfeed with consequences for publishing the unflattering material.Soon after the press conference, Trump praised himself on Twitter and referred to CNN and Buzzfeed as fake news while declaring that people believe him instead of the press.We had a great News Conference at Trump Tower today.
A couple of FAKE NEWS organizations were there but the people truly get what s going on Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017Yeah, that did not go over very well at all and Twitter users threw the book at him.

@realDonaldTrump We know you don t like how CNN treats you, and it hurts, but it s silly to dismiss the whole nationally-renowned network.

@realDonaldTrump Remember, Donald: When critical coverage gives you stress, don t undermine the freedom of the press!
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 12, 2017@realDonaldTrump Amazing, after the amount of fake news you put out during the election.

You should apologize to @Acosta.
