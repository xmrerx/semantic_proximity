border patrol council president brandon judd was on varney and co. this morning after news hit that paul ryan would cave and not put funding for the border wall in the budget this year .
he wasn t too happy about this news.paul ryan and the washington establishment continue to put up roadblocks to the trump agenda .
this is outrageous ! the strange thing is that there are reports that the wall will begin in san diego and that construction is set to start : president trump s proposed wall with mexico will kick off in the san diego border community of otay mesa , u.s. customs and border protection confirmed monday.the community is home to one of two border crossings in san diego and will be the site where 20 chosen bidders will erect prototypes of the envisioned wall .
winners will be selected around june 1 , the agency said.while funding for the massive infrastructure project is still not set , up to 450 companies submitted designs last week .
the agency s bid said roughly 20 companies will be selected to build the prototypes 30 feet long and up to 30 feet high .

what do you say about that ? brandon judd : i disagree .
president trump promised he was going to secure the border and part of securing the border is putting in place the proper technology and resources that allows us to be successful .
and a border wall in strategic locations is one of those things that must get done .
