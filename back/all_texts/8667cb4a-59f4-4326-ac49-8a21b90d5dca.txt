Every day Barack Obama rubs his radical transformation of America in our noses as we sit back and watch Republican Presidential candidates tear each other apart over comments they make about each other This Sunday marks three days since an Islamist gunman opened fire Thursday on military facilities in Chattanooga, Tennessee, killing five unarmed servicemen and wounding a policeman.President Barack Obama still has not ordered the lowering of the U.S. flag to half-staff at the White House and federal properties as a sign of respect and mourning for those killed, even though he (and former President George W. Bush) did so for previous mass killings by lone gunmen.In contrast it was only a matter of hours after the Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage last month before Obama bathed the White House in the rainbow hues of the LGBTQ movement.Also, Obama issued same-day orders lowering the flag following the the July 20, 2012 Aurora, Colorado mass shooting, December 14, 2012 Sandy Hook, Connecticut mass shooting and the September 16, 2013 Washington Navy Yard mass shooting.Obama ordered the flag flown at half-staff the day after the November 5, 2009 Fort Hood, Texas massacre.President George W. Bush ordered the flag lowered for the April 16, 2007 Virginia Tech massacre the day after that attack.Obama apparently did not order flags lowered following the Charleston mass shooting last month, however he went to Charleston and delivered the eulogy at the funeral for the Reverend Clementa Pinckney.
Several state governors did issue orders to lower flags in their respective states to honor the Charleston victims.Obama s selectivity on whether to honor victims of terror attacks or mass shootings was in evidence in May when Obama made no public or written statement on the Islamist terror attack in Garland, Texas.Obama vacationed in New York City this weekend.
Meanwhile several state governors took steps to arm National Guard troops under their command and issued proclamations ordering flags in their respective states be flown at half-staff to honor those killed in the Chattanooga attack.The Pentagon said the day after the attack it would continue to leave recruiters unarmed and unprotected, and ordered Marine recruiters to not wear their uniforms to work.Via: Gateway Pundit
