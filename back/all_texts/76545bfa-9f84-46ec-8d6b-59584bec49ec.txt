Donald Trump has said he would send home all Syrian refugees the US accepts, if he becomes president.The billionaire, who is the current frontrunner in the Republican race for the White House, told a New Hampshire rally: If I win, they re going back.

Describing them as a 200,000-man army , he later added: I m putting the people on notice that are coming here from Syria as part of this mass migration, that if I win, if I win, they re going back.
