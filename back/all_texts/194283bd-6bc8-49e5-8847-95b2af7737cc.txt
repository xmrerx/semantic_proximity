WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S.
Senator Ron Johnson said he opposes the Senate Republican tax proposal because it unfairly benefits corporations more than other types of businesses.
“If they can pass it without me, let them,” Johnson told the Wall Street Journal in an interview.
“I’m not going to vote for this tax package.”
