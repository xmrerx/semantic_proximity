brasilia ( reuters ) - the brazilian congress is ready to put to vote later on tuesday a fiscal package key to helping the government rebalance budget accounts regardless of any source of political turmoil , senate president eunicio oliveira said on tuesday .
speaking to reporters , oliveira said he backs a deep investigation into the emergence of new evidence suggesting that witnesses who involved president michel temer in a corruption scandal might have not been forthcoming about all of their crimes .
prosecutor general rodrigo janot said on monday that billionaire meat tycoon joesley batista and a fellow witness seemed to have inadvertently recorded a four-hour conversation discussing crimes not covered in their plea deal bargain .
they could lose immunity from prosecution and other benefits .
