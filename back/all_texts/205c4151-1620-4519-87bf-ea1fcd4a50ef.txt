Normally, it s not very nice to make fun of someone, but if you re someone as innately evil, smarmy, and calculated as Ted Cruz, well, that rule gets thrown out the window.
To be blunt, he s not that likeable, and for good reason.
He s the guy that wants to end marriage equality, repeal healthcare for millions, interpret the Constitution to his fancy, and make the Middle East glow in the dark.
Since the Republican presidential frontrunner Donald Trump decided he wouldn t show up to the debate on Thursday night because he was scared of Fox News Megyn Kelly, this left everyone s main focus of attack on the next guy in line Ted Cruz.
The poor Canadian-born senator didn t even seem to see it coming.And to sum up how everyone felt about Ted Cruz, not only at the debate, but pretty much in general, this GIF was born.
It shows the senator being completely blown off by everyone, and on live television.
No one even wanted to remotely entertain a conversation:The real takeaway from the #GOPDebate?
This Ted Cruz snub.

Josh Barro (@jbarro) January 29, 2016Aww, poor Cruz.
Although, he makes it really hard to feel bad for him.Featured image: Gage Skidmore (flickr)
