paris ( reuters ) - fewer french voters are dissatisfied with emmanuel macron s performance , a poll showed on sunday , halting a recent slide in the popularity ratings of the french president in recent months .
the poll , conducted by ifop for newspaper le journal du dimanche ( jdd ) , showed macron s dissatisfaction rating declining to 53 percent in september , from 57 percent in august .
some 45 percent expressed satisfaction with the centrist leader - up from 40 percent in august .
the poll of 1,989 people was carried out on sept. 15-23 .
macron s approval ratings have dropped sharply in opinion polls since his election in may , dragged down by labor reforms and planned budget cuts , including a decrease in housing aid for students .
the new poll comes as french far-left opposition party leader jean-luc melenchon drew tens of thousands to a rally on saturday against macron s labor reforms , aiming to reinforce his credentials as macron s strongest political opponent .
