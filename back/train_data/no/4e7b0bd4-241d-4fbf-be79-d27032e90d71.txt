amsterdam ( reuters ) - dutch caretaker defence minister jeanine hennis said on tuesday she was resigning after a report highlighted serious failures by her department during a united nations peacekeeping mission in mali .
the safety board last week issued its findings about an incident on june 6 , 2016 , when a mortar killed two soldiers and gravely injured a third .
it concluded that the ministry had let safety and medical standards slip in favor of pursuing strategic goals .
hennis announced her resignation during a parliamentary debate just days before the caretaker government is due to be replaced by a new coalition under prime minister mark rutte .
hennis said general tom middendorp , head of the armed forces of the netherlands , would also resign in response to the saftey board s harsh finding .
the dutch , who initially provided apache helicopter squadrons to the mali peacekeeping mission , are winding down their contribution , with troop numbers expected to drop to roughly 300 this year .
