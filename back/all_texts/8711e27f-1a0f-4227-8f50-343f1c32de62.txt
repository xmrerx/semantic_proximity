MOSCOW (Reuters) - Former Russian economy minister Alexei Ulyukayev, accused of taking a $2 million bribe from Rosneft chief executive Igor Sechin, told a court on Thursday he was the victim of a monstrous and cruel provocation.
State prosecutors said the bribe was given last year on Nov. 14 in exchange for Ulyukayev approving the sale of state-controlled oil company Bashneft to Rosneft.
Ulyukayev denies the charges.
He says he thought the bag holding the bribe was a gift of expensive alcohol.
A monstrous and cruel provocation was carried out against me, Ulyukayev told the court in his final statement before it hands down a verdict on Dec. 15.
This trial has aroused public interest similar to that of a circus, he added.
The charges are absurd, the evidence is absurd, and at its base lies the cruelty and impunity of the provocateur.
Rosneft head Sechin, a witness in the trial and a close ally of President Vladimir Putin, has not appeared in court, citing work commitments.
Russian prosecutors earlier this month sought a sentence of 10 years in jail for Ulyukayev.
