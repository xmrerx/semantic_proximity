in pa , a felony is required to justify a citizens arrest.to this , we accuse hillary rodham clinton of being an accessory to the mass election fraud that took place during the 2016 democratic presidential primary , and collusion with democratic party officials who sought to undermine bernie sanders campaign .
this was especially egregious in philadelphia where the democratic party handed out ballot listings that explicitly excluded bernie sanders and his supporters.we accuse hillary rodham clinton for being complicit in international money laundering ( through the clinton foundation ) .we accuse hillary rodham clinton of being complicit in treason by keeping sensitive state secrets on her private server , thus endangering the lives of undercover agents.to these ends , we will march into the gates of the wells fargo center during her speech .
our intent is to non-violently present hillary rodham clinton with a citizens arrest .
we request that the philadelphia police department , homeland security , and all present law enforcement agencies assist us in our citizens arrest .
should they choose to prevent us from carrying out the arrest , we are prepared to risk arrest ourselves.we stand in solidarity with other concerned citizens demonstrating in philadelphia against the criminal actions of hillary rodham clinton and the failure of the democratic party to support the needs of the people in this city and around the united states.read more : gateway pundit
