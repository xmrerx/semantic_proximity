JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - The leader of Zimbabwe s influential liberation war veterans called on Wednesday for South Africa, southern Africa and the West to re-engage with Zimbabwe after the military seized power from 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe.
Chris Mutsvangwa hailed the military s overnight move as the correction of a state that was careening off a cliff and said the military administration would usher in a better business environment after years of disinvestment and economic decline.
