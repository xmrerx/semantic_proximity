when it comes to donald trump , a lot of people have a lot of different opinions .
while some seem to think he speaks for them when trump elicits fear and anger , others see right through his shenanigans and are very well aware of where trump has come from , what he as done and said , and how much he s only in this race for himself and not the greater good.one of the people who sees right through trump and his poppycock is former president obama speechwriter , jon favreau .
he recently took to twitter to perfectly summarize trump and give us five reasons no one should ever vote for trump , especially if they re a working class american.here is favreau s summary of trump : trump:1 ) profited off of 9/112 ) rooted for the housing crash3 ) ran a fraudulent university 4 ) sued for tax dodging 5 ) is a dick jon favreau ( @ jonfavs ) may 20 , 2016and if you think he s lying , don t worry , he sourced everything as well : links:1 ) https : //t.co/alx1shhgci2 ) https : //t.co/nerh9bgiop3 ) https : //t.co/nsmmfgcbbw4 ) https : //t.co/w1htwteos05 ) duh jon favreau ( @ jonfavs ) may 20 , 2016with the duh being , by far , the most accurate .
of course , there are many , many more reasons not to vote for him as well ( racism , sexism , etc .
) , but this was a good jumping off point.the only reason trump wants to be president is to say he s president .
he doesn t care about the nation , and his actions more than prove that point .
he only cares about himself and his own ambitions .
and for goodness sake , america , realize this sooner rather than later.featured photo by joe raedle/getty images twitter
