manila ( reuters ) - a philippine college fraternity used its annual naked run on friday to protest against president rodrigo duterte s brutal war on drugs and the imposition of martial law in the south in the army s fight against islamist militants .
the masked and hooded young men sprinted in the nude through their college , holding signs reading lift martial law and stop the killings , as bystanders laughed and pointed and others took photos .
the level of violence in society is growing and the fraternity can not simply ignore that , that thousands of people are dying , alpha phi omega spokesperson thomas roca said , when asked why the fraternity picked the protest theme this year .
since taking office last june , duterte has launched a ferocious war of drugs that has left thousands of filipinos dead , and in may , he imposed martial law in mindanao , an island of 22 million people , when islamic state-linked militants took over large parts of the city of marawi .
this is not the first time the fraternity has taken a political stance with its yearly bare-bottomed event .
the society used its naked run during the rule of late dictator ferdinand marcos in the 1980s to protest against the censorship of activists at the university of the philippines .
for a finale on friday , the men gathered by a pond , arms slung over each other s shoulders , and lustily sang their fraternity song , alumni members in the audience joining in as well .
it s my first time seeing this , college student haji viado said , with a smile .
but for me what they did was effective to get people s attention on these issues .
