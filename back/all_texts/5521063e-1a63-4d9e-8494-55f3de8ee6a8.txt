Just making room for Hillary President Obama today announced his decision to commute the sentences of 22 convicted drug offenders many of them serving time after being convicted of conspiracy to distribute either cocaine, heroin, marijuana or methamphetamine.
The 22 commutations granted today underscore the President s commitment to using all the tools at his disposal to bring greater fairness and equity to our justice system, White House Assistant and Counsel to the President Neil Eggleston in a statement on the White House Website.
Further, they demonstrate how exercising this important authority can remedy imbalances and rectify errors in sentencing.
In a letter to one of the pardoned criminals Terry Barnes of Mississippi Obama explained that he was granting him a commutation to allow him to turn his life around.
It embodies the basic belief in our democracy that people deserve a second chance after having made a mistake in their lives that led to a conviction under our laws, he wrote, acknowledging that some were skeptical about his ability to change.
I believe in your ability to prove the doubters wrong, Obama concluded.
So good luck, and Godspeed.
Obama s action is part of his continued effort to highlight the harsh penalties for non-violent drug offenders and encourage reform.Full list below: Terry Andre Barnes East Moline, ILOffense: Conspiracy to distribute cocaine base; supervised release violation (distribution of cocaine base) (Southern District of Iowa)Sentence: 246 months imprisonment; 10 years supervised release (July 25, 2005)Commutation Grant: Prison sentence commuted to expire on July 28, 2015.
