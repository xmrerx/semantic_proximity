palm beach , fla. ( reuters ) - u.s. president-elect donald trump on wednesday said telecommunications group sprint corp ( s.n ) and a u.s. satellite company oneweb will bring 8,000 jobs to the united states , and the companies said the positions were part of a previously disclosed pledge by japan ’ s softbank group corp. softbank ( 9984.t ) holds stakes in both companies and its chief , billionaire businessman masayoshi son , earlier in december said he would invest $ 50 billion in the united states and create 50,000 jobs .
sprint in january said it had cut 2,500 jobs as part of its plan to cut $ 2.5 billion in costs .
on wednesday it said it would create 5,000 jobs in areas including sales and customer care by the end of its fiscal year ending in march 2018 .
sprint spokesman dave tovar said the jobs were part of the pledge made by son but would be funded by sprint .
softbank and oneweb had announced on dec. 19 that the japanese company was leading a $ 1.2 billion funding round .
oneweb plans to use the funds to build a plant in florida to produce low-cost satellites , creating almost 3,000 jobs at the company and its suppliers .
softbank described its $ 1 billion share of the funding as the first tranche of the $ 50 billion promised by son in a meeting with trump .
it is not clear whether the $ 50 billion softbank investment would be part of a $ 100 billion tech investment fund that the head of softbank and saudi arabia ’ s sovereign wealth fund had announced earlier in the year .
“ i was just called by the head people at sprint and they are going to be bringing 5,000 jobs back to the united states , they are taking them from other countries , ” trump told reporters outside his mar-a-lago estate in florida .
“ and also oneweb , a new company , is going to be hiring 3,000 people .
so that ’ s very exciting , ” he added .
shares of sprint corp , which is 82 percent owned by softbank , were barely changed in after-hours trading .
