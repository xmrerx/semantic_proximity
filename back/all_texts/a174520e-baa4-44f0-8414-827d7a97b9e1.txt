Here we go again!
What in the world is wrong with this woman?
Is it her age or something like cocktails before dinner?
Wonder how much they paid her for that hot mess!PELOSI HAS HAD HER SHARE OF RANTS LATELY HERE ARE A FEW OF THE LATEST: ATTACKS TRUMP ON THE BORDER WALL:House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi was on Meet the Press and let out another gibberish laden response to a question.
Does anyone out there understand what she meant by her comments about the wall.
How does it mean Trump is weak if he wants a wall?
Twisted reasoning is all that comes from Pelosi these days especially when in 2006 most prominent Democrats voted to build a barrier at the border.
Immoral and unwise ?
How is it immoral and unwise to want to protect your people?
You have to understand this part of the country.
There s a community going through it.
ATTACKS IVANKA TRUMP:House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) implied during a Wednesday press conference that President Donald Trump s daughter, Ivanka Trump, has been complicit in her father s actions, which the lawmaker described as not acting in the interest of the American people.
