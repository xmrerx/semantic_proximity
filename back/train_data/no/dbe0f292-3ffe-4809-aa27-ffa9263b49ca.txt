twenty-two states , including the district of columbia , allow 17-year-olds to vote in primary elections as long as they turn 18 by the time the general election is held in november .
the rule allows many youth to begin participating in the democratic process of voting for the very first time , but ohio s republican secretary of state jon husted reversed the rule in ohio , revoking the rights for 17-year-olds to vote in ohio s primaries on march 15th .
for both republicans and democrats , ohio will be a key state and every vote will matter .
for the bernie sanders campaign , the reversal is a blow , as the campaign s strongest demographic is young voters , where they have received over 80 percent support in many states from voters ages 18-29 .
it is an outrage that the secretary of state in ohio is going out of his way to keep young people significantly african-american young people , latino young people from participating , said senator sanders in a released on march 8th .
sanders campaign cited us census data which shows 17-year-old voters are more likely to be african-americans and latinos.ohio s secretary of state , jon husted , argued over the language of ohio s rule in december , claiming 17-year-olds can still vote , just not to elect a candidate .
this isn t the first time ohio republicans have tried to deter voter turnout .
in 2015 , republican ohio state representatives sponsored a bill to demand a poll tax in order to vote , despite poll taxes being unconstitutional .
the tax was tucked into a voter id bill , which was pushed for under the false assumption voter id laws prevent fraud , although voter fraud is virtually non-existent in ohio .
if a voter does not have a photo id , they will have to pay $ 8.50 for a voter id card .
in 2015 , hillary clinton s campaign sued ohio to repeal several republican voter suppression tactics which helped george w. bush win ohio in 2004.featured image via addicting info
