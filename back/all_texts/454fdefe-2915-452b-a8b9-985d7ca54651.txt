Seoul (Reuters) - North Korea s state media on Thursday dismissed as misinformation a recent media report that the North s sixth nuclear test killed many people.
Japanese broadcaster TV Asahi reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources familiar with the issue, that North Korea s nuclear test site collapsed after Pyongyang s sixth atomic test in September, possibly killing more than 200 people.
The North s official KCNA said it was a false report intended to slander the country and its advances in nuclear development.
