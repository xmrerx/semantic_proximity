MADRID (Reuters) - The regional parliament of Catalonia on Friday voted a motion to begin a constituent process to split from Spain shortly before beginning a secret vote on whether or not to declare independence from the rest of the country.
Lawmakers from the Socialist Party, the People s Party (PP) and Ciudadanos left the chamber before the vote in protest, leaving just the pro-independence groups Junts pel Si, CUP and the Podemos-associated Catalunya Si Que Es Pot to cast a ballot.
