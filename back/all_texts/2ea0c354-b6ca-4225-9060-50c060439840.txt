Tick tock!
Time is running out for Hillary Clinton and George Soros to steal the Presidency from Donald Trump.
Too bad they didn t get this little snag worked out ahead of time.
It looks like it may not be as easy as Jill Stein, (the Green Party candidate who appears to be doing Hillary s dirty work, after getting only got 1% of the vote) thought it would be to throw the election Oops!
Jill Stein forgot to mention to her donors that she cannot file a direct request for a recount in Pennsylvania.Stein would have to present a case showing voter fraud took place.Trump won Pennsylvania by 70 thousand votes.
Stein would have to prove that fraud was probable.
That does not seem likely.
Then again, we are talking about the Clintons here.
GPThe Inquisitr reported, via Free Republic:Per Pennsylvania regulations, there is only one way remaining for Jill Stein to get a recount in Pennsylvania and it is a complicated process.
BillyPenn reports that Stein would have to file for a court appeal and present a prima facie case showing that voter fraud took place.
While prima facie has a lower burden of proof threshold than beyond reasonable doubt, it is still significant.
Stein would have to prove in court that fraud was probable.
This is going to be very difficult given that even the computer specialists recommending the recount say there is no proof of hacking or fraud.
