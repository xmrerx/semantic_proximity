nairobi ( reuters ) - kenya s repeat presidential election must be held within the 60 days stipulated in the constitution after the supreme court nullified the result of a vote held last month , president uhuru kenyatta said on thursday .
kenyatta also accused the court of reaching its decision without scrutinizing and verifying the forms used to tally the aug. 8 vote and said the decision could thrust the country into judicial chaos .
the kenyan election board said earlier that it had now rescheduled the election for oct. 26 after a french firm providing the technology for the polls said it would not be ready in time for oct. 17 , the previous date set for the re-run .
