Donald Trump has made many promises to the working class citizen.
He promised he d side with them through it all and the he would make the working class thrive.
Trump said he d make the middle class of America great and make our economy better than ever by destroying the corruption within the White House and Wall Street.
Well, he was just telling everyone what they wanted to hear, and it was all a load of crap.Donald Trump is putting together his cabinet, and with every choice he makes we see that he never actually intended to make America greater for the middle class, just those who already have more money than they can spend.
His cabinet consists of nothing but Wall Street millionaires who want nothing to do with the working class.
Donald s choice of Steve Bannon as chief strategist, a man who has been tied to white nationalists, and his choice for secretary of labor, Andrew Puzder, who s worked against the working class for several years prove he cares nothing about the promises he made.The Democrats have put together a video that shows the 180 degree turn Trump s plan has taken:The people responsible for the Great Recession have a new home in the Trump administration: pic.twitter.com/nwNJTuGdtC The Democrats (@TheDemocrats) December 20, 2016Surely, many American s have began to see how badly Trump is screwing them over, and feel remorseful about their vote.
They are know figuring out what we ve been saying this entire election, Trump could never be trusted, he s only in it for himself, not for America.
