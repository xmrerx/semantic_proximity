In case you missed the total horror of seeing a woman egged by protesters at a Trump rally, we ll just say it was REALLY terrible!
We ve posted the video below for you.
She was up against a wall and was pelted with numerous eggs and took it like a champ!
She needs our help!
The woman who captured national attention Thursday night after she was egged at a Donald Trump rally and then smiled about it is asking for people to help oust the mayor of San Jose.Rachel Casey, identified by her Facebook posts, LinkedIn profile and by people who know her, posted one of at least two petitions to get Mayor Sam Liccardo to resign from his post.
As of Monday, one petition, started by a man in Texas, had 3,600 supporters.
Another petition, started by a man in Minnesota, also asks for the mayor s resignation, and had more than 7,000 signatures by Monday morning.
The mayor had criticized Trump for whipping up the nation into an antagonistic state, but also condemned protesters for getting violent mostly by harming the Trump camp.
Liccardo responded: I m not terribly persuaded by calls of resignation that are emanating from Texas or Minnesota.
I serve at the pleasure of the residents of San Jose and am accountable to the residents of San Jose.
Efforts to reach Casey, who lists herself as a physical therapist assistant and personal trainer from Florida who moved to the Bay Area, were not immediately successful on Monday.
Her former company, Boca Orthopaedics and Sports Medicine said she no longer worked there.
A message left at what appears to be her home or cell was unanswered.
She didn t immediately respond to a Facebook message request, which she saw, as she acknowleged two reporters trying to find her in her own post.
But her image persists as the face of the violent Trump rally last week, where not only was she egged, but others were injured and Trump hats and American flags were burned.Read more: NBC
