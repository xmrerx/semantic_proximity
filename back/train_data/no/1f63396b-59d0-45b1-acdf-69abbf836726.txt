washington ( reuters ) - president barack obama asked republican congressional leaders for suggestions on a supreme court nominee during a meeting on tuesday , white house spokesman josh earnest said .
obama met with senate majority leader mitch mcconnell and senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley , both republicans , in the oval office to discuss a replacement for the late justice antonin scalia .
“ the president ... gave everyone in the room , democrats and republicans , the opportunity to put forward their own suggestions for potential supreme court nominees , ” earnest said at a news briefing .
“ the president didn ’ t guarantee that he would choose that person , but the president did indicate that he would take seriously any recommendations that either democrats or republicans had to put forward. ” earnest declined to say whether any republican congressional leaders , who have said the top court seat should remain vacant until obama ’ s successor takes office next year , offered any names .
senate democratic leader harry reid and vermont senator patrick leahy , the top democrat on the judiciary panel , also attended the meeting .
