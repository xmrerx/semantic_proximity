This is really epic and just hysterical!
It s also the second time someone has trolled one of Hillary s town halls.
Remember Sticker Boy?
He s the guy who stole the show from Hillary during her speech in Iowa by eating stickers.
This takes the cake though:Several members of the audience at a New Hampshire campaign event for Hillary Clinton sported some creative t-shirts, and they made sure TV cameras could capture their t-shirts while Hillary spoke.
At least two men wore Settle For Hillary t-shirts that utilized the official logo and font of Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign.Check out the guy in the baseball cap: Settle for Hillary Jeff Bechdel, the communications director for America Rising, a Republican PAC focused on conducting and distributing opposition research, posted a television screenshot of the t-shirts on Monday night.
Bechdel screencapped ABC News footage of Hillary s event and posted a picture on Twitter:Via: The Federalist
