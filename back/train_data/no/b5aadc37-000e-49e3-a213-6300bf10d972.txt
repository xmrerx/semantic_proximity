there s something about these sassy ladies that makes you just makes you want to cheer for them the two ladies , lynette diamond hardaway and rochelle silk richardson , better known as the trump-for-stump girls , have become a youtube sensation with their hilarious rants.this weekend the duo was scheduled to go on msnbc with steve kornacki but they were cancelled at the last second .
the ladies said msnbc wanted to know where they live , the names of their children and names of their employers .
then msnbc cancelled their segment when they wouldn t disclose the information .
this set them off.at the very last second , he uninvited us when we wouldn t provide the name of our employers , and deep personal information .
why he need that ?
so he could do a hit piece on us !
so after dedicating 4 hours to be on his show , he cancelled us because we want to protect our privacy .
they try to spread hate about trump at msnbc , and now they try to do it to us .
but we don t play that game , we fight fire with fire ! the two trump supporters at webesisters.com vented their frustration in a new video , msnbc screws us over because we stump for trump .
