it appears clinton s post convention bump has not ended quite yet .
in a new national poll released from quinnipiac , hillary clinton is trouncing donald trump by 10 points , which has been consistent with her post-convention spike in the polls.not only is clinton beating trump by 10 points in this stage of the game , she has nabbed 51 percent of the vote , a milestone not reached in polling until now .
with now a majority of the country supporting clinton , trump will have to work hard to overcome his self-inflicted controversies and multiple shakeups that have hardline conservatives anxious.the poll shows clinton winning with the support of the obama coalition : the democratic nominee drew wide levels of support from women ( 60 percent to 36 percent ) , those between the ages of 18-34 ( 64 percent to 29 percent ) , and 35-49 ( 53 percent to 39 percent ) .
trump , meanwhile , holds a smaller advantage among men ( 48 percent to 42 percent ) and a large lead over clinton among whites who do not have a college degree ( 58 percent to 35 percent ) .independent voters prefer clinton slightly , 46 percent to 41 percent , while likely voters between the ages of 50-64 are split , with 46 percent behind clinton and 47 percent backing trump .
voters 65 and older supported trump 49 percent to 45 percent.clinton also holds a lead of 62 points among non-white voters , 77 percent to trumps 15 percent .
looks like his african american outreach and immigration flip-flopping is going swimmingly.the poll , which was conducted on aug. 18-24 , surveying 1,498 likely voters , and with a margin of error of 2.5 percent , shows that nine of ten voters surveyed said they have made up their mind about who they were going to vote for.even when factoring in third party candidates gary johnson and jill stein , clinton still beats trump by 5 points.the time for trump to appeal to undecided , independent voters is quickly coming to a close , as early voting begins mid september.clinton s realclearpolitics average has her up by 5 points , and nate silver s fivethirtyeight gives her an 84 percent chance of winning the election , so the poll conducted by quinnipiac is not an outlier.featured image via jeff swensen/getty images
