As many of us could have predicted would be the outcome, a White Lives Matter rally broke out in chaos and a brawl ensued.The rally was held in South Buffalo, New York on Saturday afternoon, organized by the neo-Nazi National Socialist Movement.
When the rally took place in Cazenovia Park, only one neo-Nazi official was among the other supporters white supremacist Karl Hand.
Hand, who is also the chief of the Racial Nationalist Party of America, revealed he d had little involvement in organizing the rally: I didn t organize it.
I was just invited to speak.
But that didn t stop him from p*ssing people off and spewing his racist views.
One video of the event even shows a woman scolding Hand and telling him that nobody is going to take your sh*t in this day and age, you are sick people the rest of the United States is going to trample you out.
In protest of the event, over 300 activists came out, which outnumbered the White Lives Matter supporters tremendously.
The protesters held signs that said, Not Here, Black Lives Matter and, We promote unity in Buffalo.
Bridget Marren, one of the protesters in attendance and a South Buffalo native, said: We live here.
We don t want that hate spread here.
But what the White Lives Matter rallygoers lacked in attendance numbers, they made up in offensiveness.
The Buffalo Police had dozens of officers at the rally to help control the crowd, but they still couldn t stop another racist neo-Nazi wearing a green White Pride t-shirt from getting into a fight with counter-protesters.
The situation had eventually escalated so much that his shirt was ripped off when he got into a scuffle.You can watch the rally devolve into chaos in the videos below:But really, what else could we expect from a White Lives Matter rally?Featured image is a screenshot
