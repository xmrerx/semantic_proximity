civil rights icon , rep. john lewis , recently announced that while he has attended every presidential inauguration for three decades , he s going to forego the dubious pleasure of attending donald trump s. lewis says that trump , who received the benefit of a hostile foreign government s team of hackers , propagandists , and a massive fake news campaign headed by often-shirtless , journalist-killing , homophobic leader of said nation , is not a legitimate president and that the donald is all talk , talk , talk no action or results .
in response to lewis remarks , trump decided to spend the weekend preceding martin luther king day hate-trolling a man who was violently beaten in selma while fighting for equality.congressman john lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district , which is in horrible shape and falling apart ( not to donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 14 , 2017just to put things in perspective , trump s father was arrested at a ku klux klan rally and the only thing trump has ever done for black people is to make a tyler perry movie come to life by giving these two idiots attention : on saturday , trump continued his assault on lewis , urging the congressman to finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the u.s .
