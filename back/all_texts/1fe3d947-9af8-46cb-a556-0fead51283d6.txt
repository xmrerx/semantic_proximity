WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump, in a tweet on Tuesday, reiterated his call for the U.S. Senate to loosen its rules to make it easier to pass legislation by simple majority, and urged lawmakers to pass healthcare and tax overhauls.
“The U.S. Senate should switch to 51 votes, immediately, and get Healthcare and TAX CUTS approved, fast and easy.
Dems (Democrats) would do it, no doubt!” Trump wrote in a post on Twitter.
Earlier this month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected the idea.
