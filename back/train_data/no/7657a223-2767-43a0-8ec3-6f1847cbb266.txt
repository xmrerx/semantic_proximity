london ( reuters ) - britain and its nato allies must defend deep sea cables against a potentially catastrophic attack by the russia navy that could disrupt trillions of dollars in financial transactions , the head of britain s armed forces warned .
the cables which crisscross the world s oceans and seas carry 95 percent of communications and over $ 10 trillion in daily transactions .
there is a new risk to our way of life , which is the vulnerability of the cables that criss-cross the seabeds , the bbc quoted stuart peach , chief of the defense staff , as saying .
peach said the russian president vladimir putin s modernization of the once mighty soviet navy now posed a serious threat to western communications .
russia in addition to new ships and submarines continues to perfect both unconventional capabilities and information warfare , peach said .
russia has repeatedly dismissed western concerns about its renewed assertiveness as cold war hysteria , though kremlin supporters praise putin at home for putting restoring russia s clout after the 1991 collapse of the soviet union .
