And when somebody says, like the person you just mentioned, I m not gonna advertise for.
That he s gonna bring all of these jobs back.
Well how exactly you gonna do that?
What are you gonna do?
There s no answer to it.
He just says, Well, I m gonna negotiate a better deal.
How exactly are you gonna negotiate that?
What magic wand do you have.
And usually the answer is, he doesn t have an answer.'
