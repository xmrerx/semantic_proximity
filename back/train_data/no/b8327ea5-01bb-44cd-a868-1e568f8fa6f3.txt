london ( reuters ) - britain will fail to agree a free trade deal with the eu before it plans to leave the bloc in 2019 and should seek a transition period to avoid a worst-case scenario of crashing out without an agreement , lawmakers from parliament s upper house said .
the house of lords eu committee s report brexit : deal or no deal said on thursday britain should consider extending membership of the european union or set a later date for leaving to give the government longer to negotiate a trade deal .
the overwhelming weight of evidence suggests that no deal would be the worst possible outcome for the uk , in terms of the economy , security , the environment and citizens rights , said michael jay , a member of the lords eu committee and former head of britain s diplomatic service .
britain s prime minister theresa may s hopes of progressing the brexit talks collapsed at the last minute on monday as her northern irish allies denounced a proposed offer on the border with ireland .
may has found it difficult to come up with a formula that satisfies both eu member ireland , which wants to avoid creation of a hard border , and northern ireland s dup party , which says the british province must quit the eu on the same terms as the rest of the uk .
with the clock ticking down to the march 2019 exit date , the report says the biggest risk factor that there may be no trade deal is the shortage of time .
despite scepticism in brussels over the tight timetable , may and her chief negotiator david davis have been clear they want to have a full post-brexit free trade deal sealed by the time britain leaves .
while we support david davis ambition to secure a comprehensive agreement by 29 march 2019 , almost nobody outside the government thinks this will be possible , jay said .
