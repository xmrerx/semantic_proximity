Just one more reminder of why President Trump chose the no-nonsense General John Kelly to be his chief of staff On Thursday, Nov. 9, when President Trump and his team visited Beijing s Great Hall of the People, Chief of Staff John Kelly and a U.S. Secret Service agent skirmished with Chinese security officials over the nuclear football.I ve spoken to five sources familiar with the events.
Here s what happened, as they describe it:The whole scuffle was over in a flash, and the U.S. officials told about the incident were asked to keep quiet about it.
Trump s team followed the normal security procedure to brief the Chinese before their visit to Beijing, according to a person familiar with the trip but somebody at the Chinese end either didn t get the memo or decided to mess with the Americans anyway.I m told that at no point did the Chinese have the nuclear football in their possession or even touch the briefcase.
I m also told the head of the Chinese security detail apologized to the Americans afterward for the misunderstanding.
