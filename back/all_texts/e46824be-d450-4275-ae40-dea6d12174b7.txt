During President Obama s final National Security speech as president, he took a moment to let President-Elect Trump know that it s imperative citizens are able to criticize authority without fearing they ll get in trouble.It was clearly a remark aimed at Trump because of the president-elect s inability to be able to take criticism and will often lash out in some way shape or form against whoever dare to speak up against him or have a different opinion.President Obama said: freedom can never be taken for granted.
Each of us has a responsibility to sustain it.
The universal right to speak your mind protest against authority.
To live in a society that s open and free.
That can criticize a president without retribution.
If Trump actually wants to be president, he s going to have to learn how to handle criticism, and he s going to have to learn fast.
He s not only going to get criticized by both sides of the aisle, but by the public at large and the rest of the world.
He needs to be able to handle that and not do anything to threaten our national security nor the freedom of American citizens to speak their mind.President Obama has been one of our most criticized national leaders in a long time, and he, more than most, knows that you must keep a level head, and he clearly wants Trump to learn how to do that too.Watch President Obama throw major shade at Trump here:Obama says the US is a country where citizens have a right to protest against authority and criticize a president without retribution pic.twitter.com/8XQAw0BdAt Brianna Sacks (@bri_sacks) December 6, 2016Featured image via video screen capture
