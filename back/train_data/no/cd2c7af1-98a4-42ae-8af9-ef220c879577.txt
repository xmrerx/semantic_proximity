dakar ( reuters ) - air traffic controllers ended a strike at senegal s main airport on friday , a union leader said , after shutting it down for most of the day over demands for more training and transportation stipends .
the government says the new $ 680 million airport , which was inaugurated on dec. 7 , will help make senegal a transport hub in west africa and boost the tourism sector .
but air traffic controllers complained that they had not been adequately trained to work at the new facility before it opened and said they launched their walkout for people s security .
they also wanted increased stipends for employees transport to the airport , which lies some 45 km ( 28 miles ) outside the city center .
late on friday , however , mame alioune sene , the president of the union representing the workers , said that it was suspending the strike .
our decision was motivated by security issues .
we think that the authorities have understood , he said .
we re going back to work to allow planes to take off and land .
sene did not say if the workers specific demands had been met .
the airport is senegal s busiest and is used by international carriers including air france , ethiopian airlines [ etha.ul ] , brussels airlines , iberia , south african airways , tap portugal and kenya airways .
an airport management official said the strike meant around 30 flights serving some 5,000 passengers had to be canceled or delayed .
