NEW YORK (Reuters) - Eighty percent of the power lines in Puerto Rico are down, the U.S. commonwealth s electric utility PREPA said on Monday, after Hurricane Maria blew through the island last week.
PREPA spokesman Carlos Monroig said the utility is evaluating all of Puerto Rico s electrical infrastructure by air.
