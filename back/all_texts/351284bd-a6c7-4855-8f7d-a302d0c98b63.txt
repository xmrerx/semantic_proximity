After Trump spokeswoman Kellyanne Conway had the gall to defend blatant Trump administration lies as alternative facts, Dan Rather, one of the few real journalists left in our country, took to Facebook and called for action.
These are not normal times, Rather said.
These are extraordinary times.
And extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures.
Conway wasn t the only person who suffered Rather s wrath, but he called her phrase Orwellian, which it was.
Rather also talked about Sean Spicer, who, as he said, threatened, bullied and lied to reporters before walking out of the briefing room without even answering a question.
He also called out the administration for its lies.Rather remarked that we ve never seen this before, but he has some suggestions for the media.
The first of which is to not be afraid to call a lie a lie.
Even more than from the press, though, Rather wants to see that kind of bravery come from Congress.There is one group of people who can do a lot very quickly.
And that is Republicans in Congress.
Without their support, Donald Trump s presidency will falter.
So here is what I think everyone in the press must do.
If you are interviewing a Paul Ryan, a Mitch McConnell, or any other GOP elected official, the first question must be what will you do to combat the lying from the White House?
If they dodge and weave, keep with the follow ups.
And if they refuse to give a satisfactory answer, end the interview.Facts and the truth are not partisan.
They are the bedrock of our democracy.
And you are either with them, with us, with our Constitution, our history, and the future of our nation, or you are against it.
Everyone must answer that question.It s true.
If the media does its job, the truth will win out and alternative fact will be called simply, lies.
