If Donald Trump had sent proper New Year s greetings to the American people to begin with, he wouldn t be getting humiliated.But he royally f*cked up on New Year s Eve morning by referring to millions of Americans as his enemies.
Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don t know what to do.
Love!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 31, 2016Insulting the American people in this way only serves to further divide, and outrage understandably ensued.Fast-forward about 12 hours later and Trump apparently decided that he needed a mulligan.
So he took another shot at it by wishing all Americans a happy new year without referring to anyone as a loser or an enemy.TO ALL AMERICANS-#HappyNewYear & many blessings to you all!
Looking forward to a wonderful & prosperous 2017 as we work together to #MAGA??

@realDonaldTrump America Resurgent (@ProgressOutlook) January 1, 2017@realDonaldTrump This message leaves out all the passive aggressive shit you sent this morning about losers and haters.

MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) January 1, 2017@realDonaldTrump Wait, are your many enemies included in this #HappyNewYear too?
Ian Boothby (@IanBoothby) January 1, 2017@realDonaldTrump All Americans???
I thought we were the enemy.
You can stuff your #MAGA where the sun doesn t shine.
#TinyFingeredPuppet pic.twitter.com/TVVqYoqZQO Jaly (@JalyIV) January 1, 2017Yeah, it definitely was not a good idea to call millions of Americans enemies.
But it s an even worse idea for Trump to pretend he didn t send that first tweet and to assume that Americans will just forgive and forget.Clearly, Donald Trump is unfit to be president.
He is incapable of being a president for all Americans.Featured image via Jeff J Mitchell/Getty Images
