oslo ( reuters ) - norway said on friday it planned to send an armored battalion near its arctic border with russia and buy more tanks and artillery to respond to growing threats .
defence minister ine eriksen soereide did not mention russia as she described her minority government s defense plan , and said she did not see a specific , current military threat .
but the nato member and other nearby countries have grown increasingly alarmed about moscow s ambitions , particularly following its annexation of ukraine s crimea region in 2014 and its naval and air force maneuvers in the region .
the security situation has become more challenging and less predictable .
this has consequences for how we organize the military , soereide told journalists .
the plan calls for the armored unit - still referred to as a cavalry battalion - to be stationed in the remote porsanger district , in the far north on the edge of a long fjord leading into the barents sea , which also borders russia .
it also includes more investment in tanks , artillery and long-range precision weapons in the area and other locations further south , together with an extension of the time people have to spend in some national service positions to 16 from 12 months .
we must be able to defend all parts of our country ... this is a clear signal that we have a particular responsibility in the north , soereide said .
the russian embassy in oslo was not immediately available for comment .
norway s minority government will need to get support from other parties to get the proposals through parliament , but there is a broad consensus on strengthening defenses in the arctic north .
in june , russia said norway s decision to extend the presence of u.s. marines on its soil would worsen relations and could escalate tensions on nato s northern flank .
