Israeli First Lady Sara Netanyahu: I talk every place about her, how great she is.
And how great you are.
I can testify to that.
Because a majority of the people in Israel, unlike the media, they love us.
So we tell them how you are great so they love you.
We have very much in common.
We ll talk about it over dinner.The advice and reassurance reflects a fondness for our first lady and President Trump.
