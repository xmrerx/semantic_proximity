this is probably not an untypical muslim taxpayer supported family .
once a government makes the decision to open its borders to anyone who cares to come in and to support them , regardless of the size of family , or age of the wife ( or in many cases multiple wives ) , it s very hard to turn off the government spigot politicians in denmark have condemned the asylum seeker policy which will allow daham al hasan to rake in thousands in benefits once his huge family is reunited.the 47-year-old fled war-torn syria two years ago with a wife and eight children before arriving in denmark.the unemployed migrant , who claims to be too sick to work , has now been granted family reunification for his remaining 12 children and two wives who are still in syria.the migrant also said the pain was so overwhelming that he could not learn danish yet.the approval will see the danish taxpayer fork out 214,128 danish kroners ( 21,883 ) in child support for the family each year.outraged officials have raised concerns about the policy and suggested the syrian man is exploiting the country s welfare system.integration spokesperson for the conservatives , naser khader , said : it is highly problematic that a syrian refugee can be allowed to call himself sick to avoid working and learning danish , so he can support 20 children .
the politician added it should not be possible for someone who does not intend to work to be given such vast sums and called for denmark to implement an upper limit for the number of children a person can claim contributions for.shader said : we need to save and it can t be right that a man , who has not contributed , is granted hundreds of thousands in child support .
