Trump supporters and the so-called president s favorite network are lashing out at special counsel Robert Mueller and the FBI.
The White House is in panic-mode after Mueller obtained tens of thousands of transition team emails as part of the Russian probe.
Ironically, it will quite possibly be emails that brings Trump down.A lawyer for the Trump transition team is claiming that the emails had been illegally turned over by the General Services Administration because the account owners never received notification of the request and he s claiming that they were privileged communications.
In a letter, Trump s attorney requested that Congress act immediately to protect future presidential transitions from having their private records misappropriated by government agencies, particularly in the context of sensitive investigations intersecting with political motives.
Mueller spokesman Peter Carr defended the special counsel s work in a statement issued just past midnight on Sunday, several hours after claims of unlawful conduct by Trump s attorney were made, according to Politico.
When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner s consent or appropriate criminal process, he said.The words that pop out in the statement are criminal investigation, the account owner s consent and criminal process.
While on the campaign trail, Donald Trump asked Russians to hack Hillary Clinton s emails.
After the election, Trump s team is claiming that Mueller obtained the transition teams emails illegally, even though that s not the truth.
We see a pattern here.Team Trump thought Mueller was on a fishing expedition.
Turns out, he was actually reeling in the fish.
The White House was not aware at the time that he had the emails.
Mueller got them through GSA so that team Trump could not selectively leave any out if they were requested.Merry Christmas, Mr. Trump.Photo by Ann Heisenfelt/Getty Images.
