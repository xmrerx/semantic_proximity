GENEVA (Reuters) - Britain s opposition Labour party wants a close relationship with the rest of Europe after Brexit, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn told an audience at the United Nations in Geneva on Friday.
We want to see a close and cooperative relationship with our European neighbors outside the European Union, based on solidarity as well as mutual benefit and fair trade, along with a wider proactive internationalism across the globe, he said.
My own country, Britain, is at a crossroads, he said.
The vote last year to leave the European Union meant hard thinking had to be done about Britain s role in the world, he said.
There are some who want to use Brexit to turn Britain in on itself, rejecting the outside world, viewing everyone as a feared competitor, he said.
Others want to use Brexit to put rocket boosters under our current economic system s insecurities and inequalities.
Turning Britain into a deregulated corporate tax haven, low wages, with limited rights, cut-price public services, in a wholly destructive race to the bottom.
Corbyn said his party stood for a completely different future, drawing on the internationalist traditions of the Labour movement and of Britain.
In a wide-ranging speech about human rights and multilateralism, he did not immediately comment on the Brexit divorce deal struck by Britain s Prime Minister Theresa May and the European Commission earlier on Friday.
The European Commission said that enough progress had been made in Brexit negotiations to allow a second phase of talks on future relations to begin.
