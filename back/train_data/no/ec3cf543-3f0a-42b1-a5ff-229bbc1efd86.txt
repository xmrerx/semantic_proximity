this story is a perfect example of why barack and hillary are in such a big hurry to bring foreigners into our country .
it doesn t matter if american citizens are on the hook to support them and their extended families for decades to come .
what matters is how they vote , and it s pretty clear by this discovery about this muslim immigrant , he not only supports hillary , he s been illegally voting in the last 3 elections ! the cascade mall shooting suspect , arcan cetin , may face an additional investigation related to his voting record and citizenship status.federal sources confirm to king 5 that cetin was not a u.s. citizen , meaning legally he can not vote .
however , state records show cetin registered to vote in 2014 and participated in three election cycles , including the may presidential primary.cetin , who immigrated to the united states from turkey as a child , is considered a permanent resident or green card holder .
while a permanent resident can apply for u.s. citizenship after a certain period of time , sources tell king his status had not changed from green card holder to u.s. citizen .
