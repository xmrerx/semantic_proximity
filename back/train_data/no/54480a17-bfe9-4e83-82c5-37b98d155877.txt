university of virginia professor and political scientist larry sabato has just released his map predicting the electoral vote outcome of the 2016 election , and it forecasts a blowout win for the democratic party.based on the likely nominees being hillary clinton and donald trump , sabato currently forecasts a 347-191 electoral college victory for clinton .
candidates need a majority of the 538 electoral votes in the united states to win , currently that number is 270.sabato notes : election analysts prefer close elections , but there was nothing we could do to make this one close .
the predicted map looks very similar to 2012 s electoral map , but with north carolina flipping from republican to democrat .
in 2012 , mitt romney won north carolina , but just by 2.2 % .sabato also predicts a close race in other states that were previously republican territory : arizona , missouri , indiana , and georgia .
notably , president obama won indiana in 2008 , and the large black population in georgia has had many thinking it could soon become a swing state.addressing the storyline that has surfaced in the media , that trump could appeal to blue-collar voters in some states and flip democratic votes , sabato throws cold water on the idea : trump supporters and some independent analysts assert that his appeal to many blue-collar whites in rust belt states ( such as michigan , ohio , pennsylvania , and wisconsin ) could pull these states electoral votes into the republican column .
the problem is , there is little evidence that the non-college voters supporting trump in the primaries are defectors from the democrats ; most have been backing gop candidates fairly consistently , so the net addition for trump could be small.sabato is no random crank or egghead .
his crystal ball forecasts are highly cited and in the past he accurately predicted the results of the 2002 , 2004 , 2006 , 2008 , 2010 , and 2012 elections within a few electoral votes or senate/house races.in 2006 on msnbc , anchor lester holt told sabato , he predicted democrats would pick up the six seats needed to take over the senate .
it appears they have done just that you ve got an impressive record and i m going to call you later ; we re going to go over stock picks .
so when he predicts a big electoral college win for the democratic party , republicans should be very worried.featured image via public domain
