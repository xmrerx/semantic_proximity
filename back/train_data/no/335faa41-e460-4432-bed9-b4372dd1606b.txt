cairo ( reuters ) - egypt hanged 15 men convicted of attacks that killed security forces in the sinai peninsula , security sources said on tuesday , in what appears to be the largest number of executions on a single day since president abdel fattah al-sisi took office in 2014 .
the hangings took place at two prisons in the north of the country early on tuesday , the sources said .
a military court issued the sentences and interior ministry officials carried out the executions simultaneously at borj al-arab and wadi al-natroun prisons , the sources said .
most of the militants were from sinai region and were accused of joining militant groups and taking part in carrying out , planning and assisting in killing a number of army and police personnel in sinai , the sources said .
islamic state s sinai branch has waged attacks against security forces in a years-long insurgency in north sinai , and in the past year expanded targets to include christians and other civilians .
an attack on a mosque last month which killed more than 300 people , the deadliest in egypt s modern history , was widely attributed to islamic state , but the group did not claim responsibility for it .
in 2015 , six people were executed for killing two soldiers during a raid in qalyubiah province , north of cairo .
