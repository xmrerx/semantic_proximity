the fsb said in a statement on its website that the detentions had occurred on sept. 30 and that the cell included russian citizens from the north caucasus region who it said were committed to trying to set up a global islamic caliphate and were directed by foreign militants .
it said the cell had been planning to set off explosives in crowded public places and to target transport infrastructure .
