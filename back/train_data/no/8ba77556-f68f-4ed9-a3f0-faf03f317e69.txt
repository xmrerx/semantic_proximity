beirut ( reuters ) - u.s.-backed syrian militias have taken the historic old city of raqqa and its ancient mosque as they press their offensive to defeat islamic state , the u.s.-led coalition said on monday .
the syrian democratic forces , an alliance of kurdish and arab militias , said last week it had captured the final districts in raqqa s old city from islamic state .
with the help of u.s.-led jets and special forces , the sdf has been battling to capture raqqa city , which islamic state used as a base of operations in syria .
the sdf pushed into the city in june after fighting for months to encircle it .
the walled old city lies in the heart of raqqa , but islamic state militants still control districts in the west of the city .
the sdf says it holds 65 percent of raqqa in total .
the sdf have made consistent incremental gains in the urban terrain of the city , fighting block by block , said u.s. army colonel ryan dillon , a spokesman for the united states-led coalition against islamic state .
the statement said the sdf has cleared the great mosque of raqqa , its oldest mosque , describing the advance as a milestone in the raqqa battle .
sdf fighters have waged fierce battles with slow progress against islamic state in raqqa s old city since early july , when the u.s. coalition breached its walls with air strikes .
a war monitoring group , the britain-based syrian observatory for human rights , said last week that the sdf held more than 90 percent of raqqa s old city .
