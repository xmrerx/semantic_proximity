https : //youtu.be/e2kfe_htbsa and i think the forensic computer experts have raised serious questions .
what we do know is that this was a hack-riddled election .
we saw hacks into voter databases , into party databases , into individual email accounts .
ironically , while talking to the station who helped to provide fake polls showing hillary crushing trump in the general , stein blamed her suspicions in part on the fake polls .
so it s extremely vulnerable , she continued .
americans deserve to have confidence in our vote .
berman followed up by asking if she has evidence that a hack took place .
no , she replied .
we do not have a smoking gun .
daily callerwell , let s just turn our democratic voting process upside down and spend millions on a recount with no basis other than hillary lost and we re gon na do everything we can to steal this election back from trump .
