As Donald Trump continues to attack Mexicans, with his recent comments surrounding the Trump University lawsuit judge, Mexico s former president has one message for the GOP frontrunner: debate me.After chickening out of a debate with Bernie Sanders, Vicente Fox, who served as president of Mexico from 2000 to 2006, challenged the frontrunner to a televised encounter in San Cristobal, Mexico (with a free lunch included).
In an interview on Rita Crosby s radio program Election Central, Fox said: I m willing to come here, to come here, to the States, if it s for a debate.
A direct personal debate with him.
Yes, we can use national broadcasting, public broadcasting.
With you, we can do that debate.
Fox then went on to jab Trump over his $10 million request for a debate, and said that a debate would be focused on ideas and not the overly sensationalist: One condition that it s done in Mexico because I need him to see what Mexico is all about, to see what we Mexicans are all about.
He will change his attitude toward Mexico would expect that he would listen to my arguments, that he would put his arguments on the table, but we both are obliged to document, to sustain with facts and numbers what we re saying, and not just lying or cheating to people.
So, let s see if Trump will take his first opportunity at being presidential and have a cordial, factual conversation with a foreign leader.
When he s not busy praising Putin or Jong-un, maybe he can take the time to actually listen to a real leader (one that doesn t rule with an authoritarian fist).But seeing how Trump is a chicken, and doesn t like to engage in a mature manner, the debate with Fox will be as likely as the one with Sanders.
And of course Trump wouldn t dare take the bait, because once Fox proves that his people aren t what Trump paints them out to be, there goes his best talking point to his racist supporters.Featured image via Flickr
