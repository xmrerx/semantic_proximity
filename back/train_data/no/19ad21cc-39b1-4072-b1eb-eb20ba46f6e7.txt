ankara ( reuters ) - a turkish court has ordered the release of a parliamentarian who was the former spokesman for turkey s pro-kurdish opposition party , a party official said on friday .
the court ruled that ayhan bilgen be released after a monthly review of his detention since he was arrested in the southern city of diyarbakir over accusations that he was a member of an armed terrorist group , the official told reuters .
bilgen had served as spokesman and head of the pro-kurdish peoples democratic party s ( hdp ) parliamentary group .
the ruling comes amid growing concern among opposition parties , human rights groups and turkey s western allies that president tayyip erdogan is using a crackdown on suspected supporters of last year s failed coup to muzzle dissent .
since the failed coup , some 50,000 people have been arrested and more than 150,000 sacked or suspended from the military , civil service and private sector .
nine hdp deputies are jailed pending trial , more than 70 elected mayors from the hdp s southeastern affiliate have been remanded in custody in terrorism-related investigations , and their municipalities taken over by state officials .
thousands of party members have also been arrested .
the turkish government says the hdp is an affiliate of the militant kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) , which has waged a three-decade insurgency against the turkish state and is considered a terrorist organization by turkey , the united states and the european union .
the hdp denies direct links .
turkey s parliament has also stripped four hdp lawmakers , including the party s co-chairwoman figen yuksekdag , of their parliamentary status , reducing the presence of the country s third-largest party in the 550-seat assembly .
the hdp had 59 lawmakers elected to parliament in the november 2015 general election .
the party s co-leader selahattin demirtas has also been in jail since november 2016 .
