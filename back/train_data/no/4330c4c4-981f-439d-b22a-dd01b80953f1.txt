# adorbsit s soooo obvious that the clintons keep pushing this couple out there to promote chelsea for some sort of political office .
it s truly laughable because every time she s on social media she gets hammered !
she just doesn t have the it factor and the comments below should be proof of that harsh !
chelsea hasn t had much luck on twitter either .
every tweet is met with a blow back from someone who actually has a memory of all of the clinton crime families misdeeds : conservative talk radio host dana loesch reminded chelsea clinton on thursday that her mother , hillary clinton , misled the public on what initiated the 2012 benghazi terror attack after the former first daughter knocked president trump for discussing what dessert he ate during his meeting last week with chinese president xi jinping.chelsea clinton tweeted wednesday afternoon that she found it disturbing trump remembered what dessert he ate with xi at his mar-a-lago estate in west palm beach , florida , but not what country he ordered missile strikes against last thursday night.disturbing that trump remembers what he ate ( chocolate cake ) but not where he sent missiles ( syria , not iraq as he says until corrected ) https : //t.co/fitavmanca chelsea clinton ( @ chelseaclinton ) april 12 , 2017during an interview with fox business host maria bartiromo that aired wednesday morning , trump said , we had the most beautiful piece of chocolate cake that you have ever seen , while discussing when he told xi that he ordered u.s. military strikes on a syrian government airfield.just seeing this watch : trump told pres .
