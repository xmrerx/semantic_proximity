Last night, during the official White House Correspondents Dinner, Samantha Bee hosted her own event.
Entitled the Not the White House Correspondents Dinner, the special featured a lot of surprises.

George W. had a lot of good advice for President Donald Trump from what he should eat ( Eat a salad. )
to providing sensible fashion tips ( Your tie should stop at your belt buckle ).
Ferrell s W. also noted that before Trump moved into the White House, the 43rd president was considered to be the worst president in history.In addition to performances by Will Ferrell and Samantha Bee, the show also featured appearances by Allison Janney, Carl Reiner, Billy Eichner, Paula Pell and Norman Lear.Here s the video:Featured image via TBS
