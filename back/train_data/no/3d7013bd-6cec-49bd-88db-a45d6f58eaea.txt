house speaker paul ryan has sour grapes about trump isn t this about the will of the people and not the party ?
instead of embracing the movement that is so amazing with the trump campaign , ryan says he just isn t ready to endorse trump .
this is just ridiculous ! trump responds : donald trump responds to paul ryan : i am not ready to support speaker ryan s agenda .
perhaps in the future we can work together and come to an agreement about what is best for the american people , trump said .
they have been treated so badly for so long that it is about time for politicians to put them first !
