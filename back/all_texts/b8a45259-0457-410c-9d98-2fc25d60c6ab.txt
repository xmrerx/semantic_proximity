NAIROBI (Reuters) - A presidential election scheduled for Thursday will take place as the Supreme Court was unable to hear a petition to delay it, said a lawyer for the election commission on Wednesday.
It means elections are on tomorrow.
There is no order stopping the election, lawyer Paul Muite told Kenyan television station Citizen TV.
