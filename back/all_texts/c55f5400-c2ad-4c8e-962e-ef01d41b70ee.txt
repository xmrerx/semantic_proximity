There aren t very many black Republican Party officials in the United States, but somehow one was too many for Donald Trump s presidential campaign at an event in Atlanta.Buzzfeed reports that Michael McNeely, the first vice chair of the Georgia Republicans, was given the heave-ho by Team Trump.Michael McNeely, the first vice chair of the Georgia Republicans, was escorted out of Atlanta s Fox Theatre by Secret Service after being told there was no more room for you by Trump campaign state director Brandon Phillips, according to a party official briefed on the incident.
The official requested anonymity said they were not authorized to speak on behalf of the party.McNeely was stopped while trying to enter an area where Trump had been greeting supporters, the sources said.
Neither Phillips, the Trump campaign, nor the Georgia Republican Party returned messages seeking comment.Trump s campaign has been continually plagued with racial problems, largely brought on by the candidate and his belligerent attitude towards everyone who isn t a white male.
Trump recently caused heads to shake when he singled out a black man at a rally as my African-American, and again prompted furrowed brows by indicating that only blacks in America were in dire financial straits.Over his media career, Trump has had racist incidents.
He argued in favor of the death penalty for The Central Park Five, a group of black men accused of rape who were eventually all proven innocent after serving time in prison for most of their lives.
Even when the men were found innocent, Trump took out ads calling for them to be executed.Trump was also accused by the federal government of engaging in discriminatory housing practices when operating his apartment buildings.The candidate also has an odd verbal tick in which he often refers to the blacks, rather than blacks, black people, or African-Americans.
He is also the most well-known practitioner of the racist conspiracy theory that President Obama was not born in the United States, and even financed a birther posse that supposedly investigated Obama (but found nothing).Featured image via YouTube
