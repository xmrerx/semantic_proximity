chisinau ( reuters ) - the european union will not transfer a final tranche of loans worth 28 million euros ( $ 33 million ) to support moldovan justice reforms as the authorities have not fulfilled the required conditions , the eu delegation to moldova said on wednesday .
the european union is the ex-soviet nation s largest external donor , but payments have been frozen or repeatedly delayed by slow reform progress and political upheaval .
the eu has closely observed the reform process and noted that the moldovan authorities showed insufficient commitment to reforming the justice sector , the delegation said in an online statement .
the moldovan authorities have not fulfilled the eu s conditions for receiving the last financial transfer under the justice reform program , which amounts to 28 million euros , it said .
the disbursement of other eu funding , including a 100 million euro ( $ 117 million ) macro-financial assistance package of loans and grants for 2017-2018 , has also been delayed .
last week , prime minister pavel filip said moldova would not receive any financing under the agreement this year .
the eu has said a basic precondition for the financial assistance is a respect for the democratic process and the rule of law .
nevertheless moldova this year introduced a new electoral law that a pan-european rights body ruled could make the system more susceptible to undue influence by vested interests .
moldova s economy grew 4.1 percent last year , recovering from a contraction of 0.4 percent in 2015 due in part to an economic crisis in nearby russia that hit exports and remittances from moldovans working there .
the country , europe s poorest , has also been rocked by a scandal that saw the equivalent of an eighth of its gross domestic product stolen from three of its largest banks between 2012-2014 .
the world bank and international monetary fund have forecast growth of between 4 and 4.5 percent in 2017 .
