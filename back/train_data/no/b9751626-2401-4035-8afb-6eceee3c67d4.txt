now , you d think after calling mexicans rapists and murderers , donald trump would have the latino community bending over backwards to support him , but alas , they just don t seem to like him very much .
wonder why ?
it s really a thinker.in fact , trump holds a 77 % unfavorable rating with the latino community , and hillary clinton is currently leading by 48 points among hispanic voters.so , what s a guy to do at the republican national convention to show the world watching at home that latinos really want trump after all ?
play make-believe ! sure , out of the 2,482 delegates in attendance at the rnc 133 were latino , but for the cameras , that s not nearly enough , sooooo have white people hold up latinos para trump signs !
! which is even incorrect grammar , it should have read latinos por trump , but i digress .
they probably didn t have anyone to ask.here are some of the latinos right here : seems to me like some of these texas delegates w/ latinos for trump signs are not latino someone is passing them out pic.twitter.com/z8kucdyqny eliza collins ( @ elizacollins1 ) july 22 , 2016rnc botches grammar on spanish sign claiming hispanics support trump : https : //t.co/tpuz9xfvba pic.twitter.com/5nepx2y9a9 the hill ( @ thehill ) july 22 , 2016stupid cameras getting too close to show what s actually going on .
someone s gon na get fired for sure.in reality , this is the general reaction from the latino community , although , i m sure there are some who genuinely like trump .
`` latinos for trump '' bish where ? ? ?
