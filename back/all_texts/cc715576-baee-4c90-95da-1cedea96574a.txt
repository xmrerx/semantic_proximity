Barack Obama has somehow managed to inspire the worst kind of hate in these petulant college students.
This latest hashtag campaign against a country in mourning is really incomprehensible.
These spoiled young adults have no concept of how blessed they are to be living in the most amazing country in the world.
They are truly an embarrassment to our great nation.Resentful black activists and their comrades started a backlash against the huge public sympathy for the Parisian victims of the Islamist terror war.
On Sunday, they used Twitter s hashtag #FuckParis to reveal their emotional reaction to their loss of attention.Breitbart News Milo Yiannopoulos reported, the social media backlash began almost immediately by Black Lives Matters activists upset about how the historic terror attack by ISIS that left over 120 dead had stolen the media spotlight overnight on Friday.A small sampling of the tweets show no sympathy towards the killed and wounded in Paris.
Instead, the left-wing activists described the slaughter in France as retribution for the Western colionialist, imperialist, racist, and white culture.
The tweets cited included France s long history with Haiti and Africa, as well as France s popular ban on Muslim s Afghan-style face-covering niqab cloaks.If only white lives mattered to white people smh #ParisAttacks #ParisShooting #paris #FUCKPARIS #FUCKFRANCE pic.twitter.com/muss901RA4 Feminist Witch (@LOLatWhiteFear) November 15, 2015The #FuckParis hashtag also was retweeted by radicals in both America and Europe who supported the Islamist attack and open borders for refugees.https://twitter.com/JohnnyACE562/status/665723350698713088https://twitter.com/JohnnyACE562/status/665723459465379840You really expect us to support a Country that still taxes Afrika for Colonial expansionism?
Yeah, #FuckParis pic.twitter.com/MaJF4nDEDP Neo Fawkes III (@iiiogical420) November 15, 2015Some activists realized their posts are counterproductive, and hid them from outsiders.
Most others, however, let their emotions fly.Via: Breitbart News
