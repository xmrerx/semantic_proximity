LONDON (Reuters) - British lawmakers defeated Prime Minister Theresa May s government on Wednesday, voting to change her Brexit blueprint in a move which could complicate her efforts to sever ties with the European Union.
The parliament voted 309 to 305 in favor of an amendment to demand parliament pass a separate bill to approve any final deal with the EU.
