Following Covfefe-gate, in which Trump made an absolute fool of himself and Spicer managed to make an even bigger fool of the whole White House, Trump decided to get back down to business by taking aim at a truly pressing issue Hillary Clinton.
Because of course he did.
She gave an interview in which she discussed her electoral college loss, and because Trump can t do anything but attack his imaginary enemies, he took to Twitter to call her Crooked Hillary once again.However, Hillary appears to have been ready for that.
Covfefe apparently isn t going away anytime soon, and she used it to hit him back on his sheer hypocrisy, saying, People in covfefe houses shouldn t throw covfefe.
It s not the content of her tweet that s remarkable, though.
What she did was outshine Trump on Twitter by nearly 10 to 1 on retweets, and 5 to 1 on likes.
Take a look below:If Trump s popularity is of such concern to him, this will have him livid if he sees it.
She owned him right after he tried to tell all of Europe that he s the most important person on the planet.
And the popularity of her tweet plays right into Trump s ongoing insecurity about the legitimacy of his presidency, since she won the popular vote by nearly 3 million.It s actually shocking that he didn t pass out electoral maps in Europe to prove how beloved he is here.
But then again, he doesn t know what that map actually shows all he sees is all the red and assumes that means everyone in America, with a few isolated exceptions, is behind him.Hillary is by no means perfect, and she wouldn t have been the perfect president.
But she also wouldn t be humiliating us repeatedly the way that Trump does.
