Nate Silver is great at predicting the outcomes of political races.
He predicted all 50 states correctly in the last presidential race, which involved presumptive nominees Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.
In the race before that when John McCain unleashed Sarah Palin upon us, he correctly predicted the outcomes of 49 out of 50 states.
Well, the legendary political analyst has now weighed in on the 2016 presidential race, and he predicts overwhelmingly that Hillary Clinton will be the next Commader-in-Chief.While appearing on Good Morning America with George Stephanopoulos, Silver said: Here s how to think about it: We re kind of at halftime of the election right now, and she s taking a seven-point, maybe a 10-point lead into halftime.Good Morning America.
There s a lot of football left to be played, but she s ahead in almost every poll, every swing state, every national poll.
Silver isn t, poll-wise, wrong, either.
According to a recent poll, Clinton beats Trump in Iowa, Michigan, Florida, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Ohio and Virginia.
These aren t small wins, either they are from 4 to 17 points.
So, in other words, the nation definitely appears to favor Clinton over Trump.
Silver said of the numbers: It s been a crazy year, politically.
For example, Arizona looks like a toss-up.
Maybe Georgia.
Maybe Missouri, North Carolina again.
Likewise, if Trump gains ground on Clinton then maybe a state like Maine used to be a swing state, not so recently could be in play, too.
In other words, Trump is in trouble, as he should be.
The nutjobs who are uneducated and uninformed who helped Trump rise to claim the Republican presidential nomination do not represent the nation.
This is where the GOP messed up they lined up behind a charlatan who is running the greatest reality television show scam the American people have ever seen, and he s gonna lose.Remember, if you realize how dangerous Trump is, vote blue, no matter who.Featured image via Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images
