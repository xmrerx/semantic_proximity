kiev ( reuters ) - five ukrainian servicemen were killed when pro-russian rebels attacked government positions mostly in the luhansk region on thursday , the ukrainian military said .
an almost three-year-old peace agreement has failed to stop fighting in eastern ukraine with each side accusing the other of violating the terms of a ceasefire on a near-daily basis .
the ukrainian military said in a statement they suffered losses during an eight-hour clash near the small village of krymske , 30 km ( 20 miles ) west of luhansk .
the situation in the luhansk region had escalated after a conflict between separatist factions controlling the city .
