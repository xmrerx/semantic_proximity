War veteran Johnny Joey Jones praised President Trump for dropping the mother of all bombs on ISIS, saying the last administration failed to take appropriate action.Jones, who lost both his legs in an IED explosion, said he might still have his legs if the Obama administration wasn t concerned with public relations backlashes.He said he felt expendable because he lost his legs clearing a empty town on-the-ground, because the White House did not want to be seen in the press as dropping bombs on villages.Jones said Trump instead gave his generals the tools to make the decision best for their troops.
FOX NewsHere s Jones tweet that went viral:I lost my legs because my gov't was afraid to use the tools they had and saw me as expendable.
I wish I'd had this admin.
