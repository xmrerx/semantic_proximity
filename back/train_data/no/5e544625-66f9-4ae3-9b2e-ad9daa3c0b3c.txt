this story is for everyone who believes hundreds of thousands of muslim syrian refugees will assimilate once they re dumped in america .
here s a newsflash these mostly muslim men are not going to come to america and assimilate .
the body of a 20-year-old syrian woman , rokstan m. , was unearthed from a shallow grave in the small saxon town of dessau last week .
her father and brothers stabbed her to death on her mother s orders , after she was gang-raped by three men .
the rape left her unclean and the mother allegedly demanded the killing to restore the family s honor .
german police are seeking the father and brothers .
that by itself is not newsworthy ; what is newsworthy is the news itself , which appeared in not one of germany s major daily newspapers or websites .
the tabloid bild-zeitung ran the story , along with the regional press , while the arbiters of enlightened opinion buried it .
der spiegel , the country s biggest news site , and the frankfurter algemeine zeitung , the newspaper of record , made no mention.the case of rokstan m. is heart-rending .
she had found work in germany as a translator for the government , but she knew her family would track her down and kill her .
i am awaiting death .
but i am too young to die , she had written on a social media profile .
her story deserves a line or two in the quality press .
but it s one of many that german leaders want to ignore.political leaders in germany which may absorb 1.5 million migrants this year are struggling to respond to reports of a sex crime epidemic among newly-arrived muslims .
interior minister thomas de maiziere urged germans not to believe rumors of widespread rape at refugee centers , while germany s police union chief rainer wendt warned , there is a lot of glossing over going on .
but this doesn t represent reality .
wendt added , it is understandable that there is the desire to calm things down politically .
germany s elite knows perfectly well that the migrants bring social pathologies , because they have already seen the world s worst sex crime epidemic unfold in scandinavia .
sweden now has the highest incidence of reported rape outside of a few african countries , and nearly ten times the rate of its european peers and all this has happened in the past ten years .
sweden ranks near the top of the world economic forum s gender gap index , yet it has become the most dangerous country for women outside of africa , with an incidence of rape ten times that of its european peers .
sweden s political leaders not only refuse to take action , but have made it a criminal offense to talk about it.even in liberated , feminist , gender-neutral sweden , there is something more horrible than rape , something horrible enough to persuade the political elite to sacrifice the physical and mental health of tens of thousands of swedish women .
that is the horror of social disintegration in the muslim world .
sweden opened its borders to refugees twenty years before the migrant flood arrived on germany s doorstep , and the foreign born rose from 9 % of the population in 1990 to 15.4 % in 2012 .
foreigners have a higher birth rate , so the percentage is higher including second-generation immigrants.there have been protests , to be sure , and nationalist parties like the sweden democrats have gained support on an anti-immigration platform , but sweden will remain supine as its social fabric unravels .
so , i expect , will germany .
europe is transfixed by the horror unfolding from libya to afghanistan , as one of the world s major civilizations unravels in real time .
in its moment of agony , the muslim world s most potent weapon is its own weakness .
the human cost of the collapse of libya , yemen , afghanistan , iraq and syria is horrendous , but it is small thus far compared to the horrors that would attend instability in turkey , saudi arabia , pakistan and bangladesh .
the west can t bear to look at it .
