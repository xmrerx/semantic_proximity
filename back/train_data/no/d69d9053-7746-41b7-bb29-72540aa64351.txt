maybe it s time for muslim citizens and immigrants to start assimilating .
what a concept texas has just made a move that is sure to have many people cheering , and a select few angry .
as the march to sharia law presses on , it appears texas is fighting back.over the past few years , texas has been quick to take a stand against president obama and implement the laws necessary to protect its citizens .
now , the texas legislature has just passed a law designed to permanent bar muslims from instituting sharia law in the lone star state.while state sen. donna campbell doesn t specific measure islamic law in the bill , her measure guarantees that no laws from foreign courts will be admissible by texas civil court judges .
it s just to provide some belt and suspenders to make sure that , with judicial discretion , we don t trump texas law , american law , with a foreign law regarding family law , campbell told reporters.muslim groups have already criticized the bill , calling it a solution looking for a problem .
they also argue that the bill will only perpetuate islamophobia .
what do you think ?
do you support the measure ?
