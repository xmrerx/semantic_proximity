Does that mean Islam is not considered a faith in America?A school in Minnesota is at the center of controversy right now because the holiday concert included a song in Arabic which contained the phrase Allahu Akbar.CBS News reported:Parents Question Choice To Sing Allahu Akbar At Holiday ConcertSome parents in the Anoka-Hennepin School District are questioning a choir teacher s decision to use a song about Ramadan performed in Arabic at a holiday concert.At Thursday night s concert at Blaine High School, one of the songs students will be singing includes Arabic words, including the phrase Allahu Akbar, which means God is great.
Christian and Jewish songs will be performed as well, but the Ramadan song is getting all the attention.It started with a post on Facebook.
A parent of a ninth-grade Blaine choir student posted the lyrics to the song the choir has been practicing.
When others learned students would be singing the song on Thursday, the comments took a turn.One person posted, No child should be forced to sing a song about the Muslims and the religion of hatred.
Another parent, who didn t want to be identified, told WCCO phone that considering the recent events in Paris and San Bernardino, singing a song about Allah would be insensitive.
The Anoka- Hennepin School District said they have received about a dozen complaints about the song.
Some are from parents, some are from people not even affiliated with the school.In light of recent events.
this was a pretty dumb move on the school s part.
