johannesburg ( reuters ) - retired south african cleric and anti-apartheid campaigner archbishop desmond tutu urged myanmar leader and fellow nobel laureate aung san suu kyi on thursday to intervene to help rohingya muslims fleeing her country .
western critics have accused suu kyi of not speaking out for the rohingya , who have been fleeing to neighboring bangladesh , following an army counter-offensive against militant attacks .
tutu said in an open letter to suu kyi that : i am now elderly , decrepit and formally retired , but breaking my vow to remain silent on public affairs out of profound sadness about the plight of the muslim minority in your country , the rohingya .
my dear sister : if the political price of your ascension to the highest office in myanmar is your silence , the price is surely too steep ... we pray for you to speak out for justice , human rights and the unity of your people .
we pray for you to intervene , tutu wrote .
tutu , 85 , has been living with prostate cancer for nearly two decades and has largely withdrawn from public life .
the rohingya comprise some 1.1 million people who have long complained of persecution and are seen by many in buddhist-majority myanmar as illegal migrants from bangladesh .
we have to take care of our citizens , we have to take care of everybody who is in our country , whether or not they are our citizens , suu kyi said earlier on thursday in comments to reuters television s indian partner , asian news international .
suu kyi , who won the nobel peace prize in 1991 as a champion of democracy , did not refer specifically to the exodus of the minority rohingya .
