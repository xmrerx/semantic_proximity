detroit ( reuters ) - detroit may sue some of the consultants who worked on its historic municipal bankruptcy over a $ 490 million pension funding shortfall that will result in bigger-than-expected city payments starting in 2024 , according to mayor mike duggan .
in his state of the city address on tuesday night , duggan said he is seeking advice from the city ’ s legal department to review any possible claims against consultants .
the mayor blamed the projected deficit on outdated mortality tables used by the consultants that assume retirees will not live as long .
the consultants were hired under the city ’ s former emergency manager , kevyn orr .
orr , an attorney at law firm jones day , who was tapped by michigan governor rick snyder in 2013 to run detroit , declined to comment .
a representative of milliman , the city ’ s actuarial consultant , could not be reached for comment .
detroit exited the biggest-ever u.s. municipal bankruptcy in december 2014 , shedding about $ 7 billion of its $ 18 billion of debt and obligations .
the city paid $ 177 million in legal and consultant fees to dozens of firms .
the city ’ s court-approved debt adjustment plan contained money to pay for pensions over the first 10 post-bankruptcy years , according to john naglick , detroit finance director .
the plan also projected contributions by the city starting in 2024 needed to amortize the unfunded pension liability which was understated by $ 490 million , he added .
detroit ’ s contribution to its two retirement systems is expected to total $ 194.4 million in 2024 , which is $ 84.4 million more than anticipated in the debt adjustment plan , according to a nov. 24 report by detroit ’ s financial review commission .
to start addressing the shortfall , duggan said $ 10 million in surplus money will be tapped for pensions for this year and next .
