Mike Webb is a conservative Christian who is running for office in the hopes that he can represent Virginia s 8th district in the United States House of Representatives as an Independent.
Just days after Webb s announcement, his career may already be over due to a careless screenshot that he took and posted to his campaign s Facebook.
That s because Webb accidentally left a couple of porn sites open in his browser which can be seen in the image he shared.Here s the screenshot that Webb shared:Here s a closer look at the screenshot:The story gets even more hilarious, considering that Webb was already involved in another controversy.
Webb had failed to file his FEC report on time, which he claims that he could not do because of a virus that had infected his computer.The post has been up for 11 hours at the time of this writing.
Since Webb posted the screenshot, he has made two more posts to his Facebook page.
In the first one, he writes a very long letter of condemnation towards those mocking him.
He begins the post by writing, SEE HOW DIRTY YOU ARE?
In the post, Webb writes after that one is far more bizarre.
He begins the post by saying THANKS FOR THE TAB CHECK, RANGER BUDDIES!
This is followed by a Bible verse: For the Lord is good; his mercy is everlasting; and his truth endureth to all generations.
Psalm 100:5The post is accompanied with a screenshot that shows his page s reach.
That s because he is proud of the negative attention he has received.
Webb goes on to write that the the Lord has lifted him up.
Apparently, in Webb s mind Jesus has the same mentality as a public relations agent who holds true to the theory that no publicity is bad publicity.Featured image from screenshot via Mike Webb s campaign site
