WHO KNEW HE HAD IT IN HIM?
Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) pushed back against a reporter who asked a question critical of the Republican tax reform bill early Wednesday morning by pointing out it was the reporter s job to use Democratic talking points.
McConnell held a press conference shortly after the Senate passed the $1.5 trillion package of tax cuts and tax code revisions in the chamber s 51-48 vote.
The vote was at about 1:30 a.m. after much debate on the floor of the Senate.
The Democrats are throwing everything but the kitchen sink at the Republicans.
They are putting politics before what s best for America.
Pro-growth is the way to go!
