CAIRO (Reuters) - Arab League Secretary General Ahmed Aboul Gheit said on Tuesday that the United States should not take any measures that would alter Jerusalem s legal and political status, Egypt s state news agency MENA reported.
He said the possible move of the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem or recognition of Jerusalem as Israel s capital reportedly being considered by President Donald Trump would be a dangerous measure that would have repercussions across the region.
