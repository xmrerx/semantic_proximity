paris ( reuters ) - french cosmetics giant l oreal sacked its first transgender model to appear on a british advertising campaign after she described all white people as racist on facebook .
london-based model munroe bergdorf had announced on her facebook page on august 27 that she was to be part of the french cosmetics brand s new advertising campaign celebrating diversity .
in an online message that later appeared on friday to have been deleted , bergdorf said , according to the daily mail newspaper : honestly i don t have energy to talk about the racial violence of white people any more .
yes all white people .
l oreal s uk unit said on its twitter page it had decided to terminate her contract : l oreal champions diversity .
comments by munroe bergdorf are at odds with our values and so we have decided to end our partnership with her .
in a post on her page on friday , bergdorf criticized the daily mail article and sought to defend her comments , which she said were a reaction to the violence of white supremacists in charlottesville in the united states .
when i stated that all white people are racist , i was addressing that fact that western society as a whole , is a system rooted in white supremacy - designed to benefit , prioritize and protect white people before anyone of any other race , she said .
