in case you missed the total horror of seeing a woman egged by protesters at a trump rally , we ll just say it was really terrible !
we ve posted the video below for you .
she was up against a wall and was pelted with numerous eggs and took it like a champ !
she needs our help !
the woman who captured national attention thursday night after she was egged at a donald trump rally and then smiled about it is asking for people to help oust the mayor of san jose.rachel casey , identified by her facebook posts , linkedin profile and by people who know her , posted one of at least two petitions to get mayor sam liccardo to resign from his post .
as of monday , one petition , started by a man in texas , had 3,600 supporters .
another petition , started by a man in minnesota , also asks for the mayor s resignation , and had more than 7,000 signatures by monday morning .
the mayor had criticized trump for whipping up the nation into an antagonistic state , but also condemned protesters for getting violent mostly by harming the trump camp .
liccardo responded : i m not terribly persuaded by calls of resignation that are emanating from texas or minnesota .
i serve at the pleasure of the residents of san jose and am accountable to the residents of san jose .
efforts to reach casey , who lists herself as a physical therapist assistant and personal trainer from florida who moved to the bay area , were not immediately successful on monday .
her former company , boca orthopaedics and sports medicine said she no longer worked there .
a message left at what appears to be her home or cell was unanswered .
she didn t immediately respond to a facebook message request , which she saw , as she acknowleged two reporters trying to find her in her own post .
but her image persists as the face of the violent trump rally last week , where not only was she egged , but others were injured and trump hats and american flags were burned.read more : nbc
