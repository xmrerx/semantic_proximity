HAMBURG (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Saturday she was pleased that all Group of 20 members besides the United States had agreed in a communique that the Paris climate accord was irreversible.
“I think it’s very clear that we could not reach consensus, but the differences were not papered over, they were clearly stated,” Merkel told reporters at the end of the two-day meeting.
She said she did not share the view of British Prime Minister Theresa May who said on Friday that she thought Washington could decide to return to the climate agreement.
Merkel sharply condemned what she described as the “unbridled brutality” exhibited by some protesters in the northern city of Hamburg after violent clashes injured hundreds of police officers.
