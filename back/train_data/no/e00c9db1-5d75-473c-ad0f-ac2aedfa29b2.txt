it doesn t get much more anti-american than forcing the removal of american flags from an american owned business a florida car dealership is facing fines for displaying its patriotism.the kia dealership in west palm beach faces penalties of up to $ 1,000 per day for a code-enforcement violation it received from palm beach county for displaying six american flags on its property , wptv reported.the county said the dealership is violating a that prohibits the display of pennants , balloons , banners and other signs made of lightweight fabric , plastic or similar substances .
we re just trying to show our patriotism , dealership general manager mike wangle told wptv.the notice said the dealership must remove the flags by the fourth of july or the fine will be imposed .
you would think they they would let us leave it up during the fourth and then say , take them down after the holiday , wangle said.he told wptv he understands the code , but doesn t understand why the flags don t fall under the flags category.// < !

those are banners , he said .
but when you re displaying the american flag , that s a little different .
that s why we re kind of upset about it .
he added that he will keep the banners flying until july 5 to display patriotism on independence day , even if he has to pay the fine himself.via : biz pac review // ] ] >
