toronto ( reuters ) - canadian police told a news conference on sunday that a suspect arrested following saturday night s attacks in edmonton was a somali national with refugee status in canada .
police declined to provide his name but said authorities had investigated a complaint in 2015 that he was espousing extremist ideology and had determined that he did not pose a threat at the time .
( this version was corrected officially to change the first paragraph after the police corrected original statement to say suspect is a refugee , rather than seeking refugee status )
