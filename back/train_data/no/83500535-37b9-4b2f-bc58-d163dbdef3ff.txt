colombo ( reuters ) - a sri lankan court on thursday jailed and fined two top officials in former president mahinda rajapaksa s government for misappropriation of funds , a lawyer said , the first convictions in a series of investigations into official corruption .
the government of president maithripala sirisena unseated rajapaksa in 2015 on promises to expose corruption and is under pressure to follow through .
sirisena s administration has been probing money laundering and misappropriation of state property in more than 50 cases , but no one had been convicted until thursday .
colombo high court sentenced lalith weeratunga , former secretary to rajapaksa , and anusha palpita , ex-head of the state-run telecommunication regulatory commission , to three years of rigorous imprisonment , or jail with hard labor , and fined them 52 million rupees ( $ 340,760 ) each .
election monitors had complained that the state fund was used to influence voters ahead of 2015 presidential polls .
kalinga indratissa , the lawyer who appeared on behalf of weeratunga and palpita , told reuters the two would appeal .
two of rajapaksa s sons , namal and yoshitha , have been arrested and released on bail over money laundering allegations .
his brother , basil , who headed the economic development ministry , has also been arrested at least three times - twice over suspicion of misuse of anti-poverty funds and a once over suspicion of laundering money and released on bail .
rajapaksa and his family deny any wrongdoing .
rajapaksa was president for a decade until january 2015 and is popular among ethnic majority sinhala buddhists who credit him with ending the 26-year-war against minority tamil separatist rebels in 2009 .
