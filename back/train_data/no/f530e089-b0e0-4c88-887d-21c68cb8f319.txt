a voice of reason speaks out !
mike huckabee told fox news host judge jeanine pirro that he has a special repulsion for white supremacists and that trump did the right thing in his statements about charlottesville .
it s part because i m white , he elaborated .
it s part because i have seen this evil and hateful attitude that elevates some people above others .
and as a believing christian , i m especially offended because anybody who believes the bible , especially the gospels , will have to accept that there is no way that god is a respecter of persons- as scripture makes clear , he doesn t love some people more than others because of their color , because of their affiliation , even with him .
he mentioned that because he believe in the gospels that every person has equal worth , that makes him pro-life.pirro asked huckabee if the outrage over the president s remarks are just trump haters who will look for any reason to dump on him .
well it seems like a lot of them are , i don t know what they expect the president to do , huckabee responded .
at the time that he made the comment , the driver of the car had not even been identified .
that s exactly right !
pirro exclaimed .
and so what is he supposed to say ?
huckabee continued .
is he supposed to do what barack obama used to do and jump to conclusion and make a decision like he did in ferguson .
missouri , which turned out to be totally untrue ?
the president has to be careful in taking steps .
i thought what he condemned was what we all could immediately condemn and that was the violence , the car some coward in a car drove into innocent people to try and kill them .
and he condemned that !
what else is he supposed to do at that point ?
