A mystery man gives Univision anchor Jorge Ramos a major tongue lashing after Ramos was kicked out of the Trump presser.
I think that American is 100% FED Up!
like the rest of us.
The most important part of the video is a moment that proves that Trump was fair to Ramos.
Notice how an assistant to Trump comes up and says Trump would be happy to take a question from Ramos BUT he needs to be chosen for a question.
The assistant then is seen taking Ramos back into the presser.
