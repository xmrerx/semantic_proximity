on thursday , fox news hack and donald trump testicle-buffer sean hannity decided to use the new wikileaks release to formulate his most ridiculous defense of trump s connections to russia yet they don t exist , and the cia did it all.according to hannity , vladimir putin s goons didn t , as is confirmed by 17 intelligence agencies , hack the dnc and the dncc in an effort to help donald trump win .
the cia did it so they could frame vladimir putin and trump .
is it possible , likely or can you confirm instances where the cia used malware to attribute cyberattacks to other nations ?
possibly russia , hannity asked wikileaks.is it possible , likely or can you confirm instances where the cia used malware to `` attribute '' cyberattacks to other nations ?
possibly russia https : //t.co/ay1ms84tpt sean hannity ( @ seanhannity ) march 9 , 2017hannity s question , presented more as a statement than anything else , was just awful .
effectively , he was asking a group that has shown themselves to be an arm of the russian government ( wikileaks ) to discredit one of our intelligence agencies on behalf of a hostile foreign power because he has a raging hard-on for vladimir putin and donald trump .
naturally , the internet was not very pleased with this rather treasonous-sounding statement : did @ seanhannity actually just ask wikileaks to discredit the cia , possibly thru use of stolen classify info ?
and on behalf of russia ? !

# trumprussia heather johnson ( @ heather07191972 ) march 10 , 2017 @ seanhannity so the `` deep state '' that apparently hates trump did something to elect him and make it look like russia did it ?
cameron ( @ cameron_durkin ) march 9 , 2017hannity says that the cia s decision to hack our election to get trump , whom they ( as part of obama s deep state ) hate , elected so they can blame russia and trump is an important thing to expose because now the donald can purge people he imagines to be part of this ridiculous plot.it 's time for the trump administration to purge the deep state saboteurs from the government hear more at 10pm # hannity sean hannity ( @ seanhannity ) march 10 , 2017seem stupid ?
it is , but this is the desperate sh * t the right has decided to believe in their effort to absolve trump and his administration of very real crimes .
