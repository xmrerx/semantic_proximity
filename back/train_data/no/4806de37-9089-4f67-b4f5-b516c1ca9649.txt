chrissy teigen is a model .
she s not expected to be particularly intellectual , but a series of tweets shows that she s intellectually miles ahead of someone you d expect to have a brain donald trump spokeswoman katrina pierson .. teigen began her twitter attack on pierson on sunday .
pierson , apparently not getting sarcasm , retweeted some of the insults , and no , it was not ironic.i relate to @ katrinapierson in the way that i would also be an incredibly horrible choice of campaign spokesperson christine teigen ( @ chrissyteigen ) august 28 , 2016 i get it , @ katrinapierson .
get that $ .
sell that soul .
i personally could not go to bed sobbing into my pillow but you re just so strong .
christine teigen ( @ chrissyteigen ) august 28 , 2016can you imagine giving up as hard as @ katrinapierson ?
christine teigen ( @ chrissyteigen ) august 28 , 2016 not many of us could wake up and do what @ katrinapierson does every day with a straight face .
what an inspiration .

christine teigen ( @ chrissyteigen ) august 28 , 2016 it took about 35 years .
# nevergiveup https : //t.co/3emih2whwb katrina pierson ( @ katrinapierson ) august 28 , 2016of course , none of this should be a surprise .
to her , words are meaningless at least that s what she said on thursday when she was asked about trump s immigration flip-flop : # trump surrogate @ katrinapierson : he hasn t changed his immigration position , he has changed the words he is saying .
pic.twitter.com/clkveh2yp4 correct the record ( @ correctrecord ) august 25 , 2016katrina pierson should be hated by republicans .
she was born to a teenage mom who * gasp * collected welfare .
she has a criminal record for shoplifting .
she voted for barack obama in 2008 .
but she has turned against everything that helped make her who she is today .
she accuses other mothers who collect welfare of redistributing wealth .
she decided she hates obama because he didn t wear a lapel pin .
she also loves sarah palin , which explains so , so much .
i doubt palin has the sarcasm gene either.featured image via video screen capture .
