Jesus f*cking Christ our President* is a moron.
Not satisfied with simply wasting billions of taxpayer dollars on a border wall, The Donald wants it to be see-through too not to preserve the view of scenery but because he s afraid people might be killed by gigantic sacks of drugs that are totally going to be thrown over it on a regular basis (thus negating his argument that the wall will somehow curb drug trafficking).
As horrible as it sounds, when they throw the large sacks of drugs over, and if you have people on the other side of the wall, you don t see them they hit you on the head with 60 pounds of the stuff?
It s over, the President said aboard Air Force One Wednesday according to the official White House transcript.
As cray as that sounds, you need transparency through that wall.
Trump says border wall with Mexico should be transparent so that people aren't killed when drug couriers throw 60-lbs.
bags over it.

Now, Trump could have argued that there are a number of reasons for transparency to see those dirty brownish people he hates coming, for instance.
But he chose the dumb one that involves throwing a 60-pound bag of heroin over a 20-foot fence.Naturally, Americans find this hilarious:The bad hombres are very strong.

Tinz (@TinzRules) July 13, 2017Likelihood that Trump heard someone say We need transparency on the building of the Wall and didn t understand?

Just Dessert (@Love_CrimeDrama) July 13, 2017Crushed by Giant Bag of Dope was, in my opinion, Giant Bag of Dope s best album.
David J Britton (@Tyburn_Cross) July 13, 2017I want to meet the dealer that can toss a 60 lb bag over the wall or, do they use catapults?

Carly (@whatstudentloan) July 13, 2017The beauty of this, though, is if the bag misses your head Hey!
Free heroin!

Some parts of the border are far away from the border?

WTF is he talking about?
John Daws (@grajillas) July 13, 2017Who the F*ck is throwing 60lb sacks of drugs over the wall?

R Goldman (@sttrzangel) July 14, 2017Where would Trump get the idea to tell Americans that criminals across the border are killing people with giant sacks of drugs?
North Korean propaganda of course or what seems like North Korean propaganda until you realize it s a parody account:Six innocent children killed by south Korean criminals hurling huge sacks of illegal drugs over inter-Korean demilitarized zone wall.
