kuala lumpur ( reuters ) - malaysian authorities thwarted the hijacking of a thai oil tanker on thursday and arrested 10 suspected indonesian pirates on board the ship , a maritime security agency commander said .
a special team from the malaysian maritime enforcement agency ( mmea ) stormed the mt tanker mgt1 , off the coast of the northeastern state of terengganu , nearly 10 hours after it was reported missing on wednesday .
while the 10 were detained on the tanker , three suspects on a smaller boat nearby managed to escape , and an mmea vessel has been sent to find them , the agency s chief , maritime admiral zulkifli abu bakar , said in a statement .
the boat was spotted near the tanker by a surveillance aircraft .
warning shots were fired from the aircraft when the boat tried to escape but the attempt to stop them failed as the aircraft was running low on fuel , zulkifli said .
zulkifli identified the 10 suspected pirates that were arrested as indonesian nationals .
none of the 14 crew members on the tanker , all thais , was hurt .
the tanker , which was transporting 2.2 million liters of diesel valued at about 7 million ringgit ( $ 1.66 million ) , had been escorted to the town of kuala terengganu to help with the investigations into the case .
piracy in southeast asian waters , including its busy international shipping lanes , has been a problem for years .
