islamabad ( reuters ) - pakistan s finance minister ishaq dar has been relieved of his duties , local media said on wednesday , following speculation about his future after he failed to appear in court to answer corruption charges .
documents seen by reuters show prime minister shahid khaqan abbasi granted dar sick leave on wednesday , while local tv channels geo and samaa said he had been relieved of his portfolio .
dar would keep his status as a minister for the time being , geo reported .
dar , who is receiving medical treatment in london for a heart condition , has an arrest warrant issued against him after he missed multiple court appearances on charges that he had amassed wealth beyond his known sources of income .
the case had , along with pakistan s worsening economic outlook , led to mounting calls for him to resign .
the country is battling to stave off balance of payments pressures due to a dwindling foreign currency reserve and a widening current account deficit .
a spokesman for the ruling pakistan muslim league-nawaz could not immediately be reached for comment , nor could dar .
he has missed more than three weeks of court hearings conducted by the anti-graft agency , the national accountability bureau .
dar s absence had come at an awkward time for pakistan , which has been trying to woo international investors as it looks to raise in excess of $ 1 billion on debt markets through a sukuk and a eurobond in coming months .
