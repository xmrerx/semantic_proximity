LONDON (Reuters) - Britain does not want to see one tyrant take over from another in Zimbabwe after the military seized power in Harare, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Wednesday.
Nobody wants simply to see the transition from one unelected tyrant to a next.
Noone wants to see that.
We want to see proper, free and fair elections, Johnson told the British parliament.
