washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. navy dismissed two senior officers on monday after a series of collisions involving seventh fleet warships in asia , citing a loss of confidence in their ability to command .
rear admiral charles williams , commander of task force 70 , and captain jeffrey bennett , commander of destroyer squadron 15 , were fired by seventh fleet commander vice admiral phil sawyer , the navy said .
in august , sawyer replaced fleet commander vice admiral joseph aucoin , who was fired after the accidents .
both reliefs were due to a loss of confidence in their ability to command , the navy statement said .
the shakeup in the seventh fleet command followed a pre-dawn collision between guided-missile destroyer uss mccain and a merchant vessel east of singapore and malaysia on aug. 21 , which killed 10 sailors and was the fourth major incident in the u.s. pacific fleet this year .
in june , another destroyer , the uss fitzgerald , collided with a philippine cargo ship , killing seven u.s. sailors .
several other officers have also been relieved , with administrative action taken against other members of the ship s watch teams .
