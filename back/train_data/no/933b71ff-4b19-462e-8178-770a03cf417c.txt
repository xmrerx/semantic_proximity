washington ( reuters ) - senate judiciary committee chairman chuck grassley has invited judge merrick garland to breakfast , but absent from the menu will be any promise of hearings on president barack obama ’ s nominee to the u.s. supreme court .
a spokeswoman for grassley said that the republican senator spoke with garland late on monday and extended the invitation “ where they could discuss the nomination and why the senate will not consider a nominee until the next president takes office. ” the senate judiciary committee is in charge of holding hearings on supreme court nominees chosen by the president and deciding whether to recommend full senate confirmation .
most of the senate ’ s 54 republicans have indicated opposition to confirming any high-court nominee of obama ’ s , saying the choice should be made by the next president , who would be elected on nov. 8 and sworn in on jan. 20 , 2017 .
despite the wall of republican opposition to garland , who is considered a moderate federal appeals court judge , obama and his fellow democrats continue to push for senate confirmation this year .
garland already has made several “ courtesy calls ” to senators , mostly democrats , and will continue his visits to capitol hill this week .
if he were to be confirmed , garland - nominated to fill the vacancy created by the feb. 13 death of conservative justice antonin scalia - would tilt the supreme court to the left for the first time in decades .
the race for a replacement for obama , who is completing his second and final term as president , is in full swing now with billionaire businessman donald trump leading two other republican candidates and former secretary of state hillary clinton the front-runner for the democratic nomination .
but it could be weeks or months before the two political parties settle on their respective candidates .
a date for the breakfast meeting has not yet been set , grassley ’ s spokeswoman said .
