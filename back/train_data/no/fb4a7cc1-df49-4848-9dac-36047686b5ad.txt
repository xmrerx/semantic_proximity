washington ( reuters ) - president barack obama will have the chance to decide on whether to increase the number of u.s. forces in iraq in the “ coming weeks , ” the top u.s. general said on wednesday .
the extra troops would bolster the capabilities of iraqi forces preparing for a major offensive against the islamic state militant group in mosul , u.s. marine general joseph dunford , chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , told a news briefing .
u.s. and iraqi military officials have been discussing a plan to retake mosul , which fell to islamic state in june 2014 , and how u.s. forces could support their efforts , dunford said .
“ those recommendations are being made and the president will have an opportunity to make some decisions here in the coming weeks , ” dunford said .
“ i brought it to the secretary ( defense secretary ash carter ) .
the secretary will engage with the president. ” dunford said last week he expected an increase in the level of u.s. forces in iraq from the current 3,800 , but that those decisions had not been finalized .
u.s. officials have said they hope to capitalize on recent battlefield successes against islamic state , such as the retaking of ramadi by iraqi forces late last year .
“ the timing really now is focused on the next phase of the campaign , which is towards mosul , and maintaining the kind of momentum that we had in ramadi , ” dunford said .
