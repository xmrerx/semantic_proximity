this is a must watch ! according to american news , raso began by calling clinton out for a lie she told an audience in order to make herself appear as courageous as american soldiers .
of course , he was referring to the lie clinton told about dodging enemy fire in bosnia .
i remember landing under sniper fire , clinton once said .
there was supposed to be some kind of a greeting ceremony at the airport but instead we just ran with our heads down to get into the vehicle to get to our base .
it was a moment of great pride for me .
raso pointed out that video footage proves clinton was greeted warmly with handshakes that day .
she tried to blame her lie on a mistake , calling it a misstatement .
in my 12-year military career , i never heard an excuse like that from my leadership , raso told reporters .
it s impossible to even imagine that happening .
only someone completely arrogant , ignorant and disrespectful of what happens in war could say something like that , he concluded .
hillary was willing to lie in order to take advantage of that feeling of gratitude and awe americans have for those who serve .
