Donald Trump just got caught lying again and there is video to prove it.When former FBI Director James Comey testified under oath in the Senate on Thursday, he recalled that Trump demanded loyalty from him before he was asked to drop the investigation of Michael Flynn and Trump s ties to Russia.
The President said, I need loyalty, I expect loyalty, Comey testified.But when asked by ABC reporter Jon Karl if he had demanded Comey s loyalty, Trump denied the whole thing and pretended that he has never demanded loyalty from anyone in his entire life.
So he said those things under oath, Karl began.
Would you be willing to speak under oath to give your version of those events?
One hundred percent, Trump replied.
I didn t say under oath I hardly know the man.
I m not going to say, I want you to pledge allegiance.
Who would do that?
Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath?
I mean, think of it.
I hardly know the man.
It doesn t make sense.
No, I didn t say that, and I didn t say the other.
If Trump were to say this under oath he would he would be committing perjury.
And CNN proved it by playing video of Trump on the campaign trail in Florida asking people in the crowd to raise their hands and pledge their loyalty to him.
Keep in mind that Trump had never met anyone in that audience.
But he had several discussions and meetings with Comey.
In other words, Comey was not a complete stranger to him.
If he was willing to ask a crowd of random people to pledge their allegiance to him, he would certainly be willing to demand loyalty from Comey.Here s the damning video via YouTube.This is yet more proof that Trump is a liar who has zero credibility.
He will say anything to save his own ass.Featured image via Olivier Douliery Pool/Getty Images
