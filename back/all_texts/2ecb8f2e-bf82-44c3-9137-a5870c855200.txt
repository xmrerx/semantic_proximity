When listening to Congress discuss matters of importance lately, you d think you were listening to children on the schoolyard fighting over who should have more time in the sandbox.
It s almost obscene how both sides are unable to get along and work together to get the job they were elected to do done.Clearly noticing how childlike both Republicans and Democrats are behaving, The Daily Show put together a correspondent s piece featuring a play-at-home game for children depicting what it s really like within the walls of Congress trying to get anything done.The segment features children reading a giant rule book and trying to understand the rules, but then it shows one player not wanting to follow any of the rules in favor of how they want to play the game.
That one side likely being an example of Republicans who lately have made it impossible to get anything done, including using their own interpretation of the Constitution on when and how Supreme Court Justices should be confirmed.By the end of the segment it shows one child utterly frustrated with the other kid s absolute inability to play the game by the rules, so they both end up giving up.
This unfortunately is all too accurate of a depiction of the way the real United States Congress has been working lately.
That s why it s VERY important to make sure we re voting the right people into Congress and not just focusing on who s in the White House, but rather in every branch of government.All in all, The Daily Show absolutely nailed the reality of Congress.
