Last night, Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in Philadelphia and gave a powerful speech that was the perfect celebratory end to the Democratic National Convention.
Her speech portrayed her accurately as a candidate far more qualified to lead America than Donald Trump, and broke down the barriers with not only Bernie Sanders supporters, but Republican voters as well.Clinton s acceptance speech was a massive success for those reasons alone, but something even more surreal was taking place we all witnessed an historic moment as Clinton had shattered America s highest glass ceiling by becoming the first woman to be nominated by a major party.
And the sad thing was, that while Clinton set new ground for women in America, all conservatives could do was complain about her voice and appearance.Apparently, nothing brings out blatant GOP sexism like a strong, intelligent, accomplished woman achieving something monumental.
Instead of recognizing that history was literally being made before our very eyes, conservatives made sure to take Clinton down a notch by insulting her on the most minor things.
One of the first sexism offenses came from Brit Hume on Fox News, who reduced Clinton to her voice and mouth when he said: She has a habit, when speaking, of breaking into a kind of a sharp, lecturing tone, makes you feel like.
She has a great asset, as a public person, which is a radiant smile, but she has a not so attractive voice.
