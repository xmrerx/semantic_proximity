TOKYO (Reuters) - Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, whose new conservative party is challenging Japan s ruling bloc in an Oct. 22 election, said on Friday there was no need for a major change in the Bank of Japan s hyper-easy monetary policy and there should not be any sudden change under the next central bank chief.
In an interview, Koike told Reuters the BOJ had adopted a hyper-easy monetary policy, adding: Unfortunately, this has not cured deflation.
But I think there is no need for a big change in direction.
Asked about desirable policy under the next BOJ governor, she said, There will probably be parts that are an extension of current policy.
If there were a sudden change, I think that would have an impact on the stock market.
BOJ Governor Haruhiko has been the main architect of monetary policy under Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, and his 5-year term expires in early April 2018.
