the super bowl had not yet begun and trump fans were already throwing a tantrum not over something lady gaga did , but because of what is normally one of their favorite songs : america the beautiful.the song was performed by three members of the cast of hamilton , phillipa soo , ren e elise goldsberry and jasmine cephas jones , and it was just as excellent as one would expect .
but there was a problem at least , there was a problem according to the stupid part of america .
when the trip reached the line and crown thy good with brotherhood , two of the women added and sisterhood .
now to most people , recognizing that women are people and americans is not a huge deal .
the move was largely celebrated on social media as an attempt to stand up to republicans bullying of women and repeated attempts to deprive them of healthcare and control their bodies .
but it was for that very reason that trump fans went nuts on twitter following the song .
what the fuck instead of and sound thy good with brotherhood the liberal super bowl singers said brotherhood and sisterhood im so done , one enraged conservative who apparently doesn t even know the original lyrics writes .
another complains that the women changed the words for their polical correctness agenda .
no , it s just brotherhood .
not sisterhood .
stupid cunts .
you don t remix the shit .
just sing like you re told , one man added , apparently unaware that the did sing just as they were hired to do. # americathebeautiful does not contain the word sisterhood .
do n't change the words for your polical correctness agenda .
