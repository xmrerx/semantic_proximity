a former muslim and donald trump supporter who fled islam-controlled kuwait years ago has a warning for americans this election cycle.sarah , an ex-muslim who bravely denounced islam at a milo yiannopoulos speech , said she would absolutely hate it if america started to embrace islamic culture , the exact culture which led her to flee her native country.she suggested that if american women want to support this oppressive lifestyle , they should go there to experience it .
in a nutshell , she s saying , don t bring it here she came here to escape the intolerance and submissive lifestyle .
they [ western feminists ] show me they really don t care about me by welcoming my attackers into the place that i now call home . '
* * * language warning * * * i found home in america and i would really hate it if the values that made me find america as my home would be destroyed , so i m with the trump campaign , i m with the republican campaign .
keep people out of america that would change america for what we love it for and milo is just another part of that which is why i support him , sarah said.sarah said she fled kuwait after her very muslim husband told her that getting a college degree would do nothing for her because she is a woman .
if you want to learn about something , go and learn about it , sarah said of americans who are embracing islam .
you re more than welcome .
become a hostage in saudi arabia .
maybe that ll teach you something .
