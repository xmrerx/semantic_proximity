Donald Trump doesn t read that s a well-known fact.
Nor, apparently, does he google before he tweets.
Then again, considering his maniacal obsession with negative coverage of himself, it s actually quite likely that he knew the following statement was 100% a lie:The Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Council's 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N. Korea!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 7, 2017 The Fake News Media will not talk about the importance of the United Nations Security Council s 15-0 vote in favor of sanctions on N. Korea!
There s only one small problem with that statement: literally every mainstream outlet commonly referred to by Trump and his followers as fake news has given the sanctions vote considerable coverage.
Trump knows he can get away with this lie because his followers are low-information voters that don t actually read, preferring to get their information from conservative headlines and twitter memes.
Take this fine fellow here, for example: Dishonest #MSM is sinking #Bigly ?

Korea over missile testsWell whaddaya know.
It s almost as if Donald Trump is completely, totally, and demonstrably full of shit yet again, while his brainless hordes of followers scream #MAGA and ignore the most obvious of evidence.
But not everyone is letting Trump off the hook so easily hundreds of displeased American citizens are letting their thoughts be known in the comments.
