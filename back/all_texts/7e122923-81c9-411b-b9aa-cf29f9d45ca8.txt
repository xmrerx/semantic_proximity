Tucker goes on to call out the hypocrisy of rich, liberal elitist actors, Liberals used to believe in democracy, that legitimacy was conferred by the people who live in the country, only they can choose their leaders.
Maybe one of the reasons Hillary lost in the first place, is that rich people including you, no longer believe that.
They think that we should pick someone I like and it doesn t matter how we pick em we re just gonna pick em and they ll be great.
I mean, that is the message you re sending right?
Farrell responded, Let me demure about rich people, I m not one of them says the guy whose net worth is reportedly estimated at $10 million.
Is this liberal who s trying to tell us who we should elect, so out of touch that he thinks having a net worth of $10 million is not considered rich by the standards of 99% of America?https://youtu.be/N9u6ECFPFJY
