rome ( reuters ) - the leader of the anti-establishment 5-star movement , luigi di maio , said on monday that italy should quit the euro zone unless it manages to change the bloc s rules on public finances .
5-star , which leads in opinion polls ahead of an election expected in march , says if it wins power it will lobby italy s eu partners to loosen the so-called fiscal compact which imposes steep budget cuts for high-debt countries like italy .
the maverick party threatens to hold a referendum on italy s euro membership unless it is allowed to boost public investment and raise the budget deficit above the current limit of 3 percent of gross domestic product .
di maio has recently softened the party s anti-euro rhetoric , saying 5-star is pro-europe and calling the euro referendum a last resort to be used only if italy is unable to win any concessions .
if we should arrive at the referendum , which for me is a last resort because first i want to go to europe and try to change a series of rules ... it s clear that i would vote to leave , because it would mean europe hasn t listened to us on anything he said in a television interview on monday .
but today i see an opportunity for europe ( to reform ) , he told the private station la7 .
former prime minister matteo renzi , the leader of the ruling democratic party ( pd ) , said in a tweet that this time di maio has been clear ... he would vote to leave the euro .
i say it would be madness for the italian economy .
the pd , which has split under renzi s leadership , lags 5-star by some 4 percentage points in most opinion polls , but no party or coalition is seen winning an outright majority at the election , which is expected to result in a hung parliament .
