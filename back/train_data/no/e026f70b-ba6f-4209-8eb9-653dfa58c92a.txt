brussels ( reuters ) - austria s likely next chancellor assured european union leaders on thursday of his support for the eu , allaying concerns that his country would become a dissonant voice in the bloc with the far right expected to enter its government .
sebastian kurz of the mainstream conservative ovp party won a parliamentary election on sunday after campaigning on an anti-immigration platform , and a coalition with the far-right freedom party ( fpo ) is widely anticipated .
arriving at a meeting of conservative eu leaders , the 31-year-old kurz said he would speak to all parties in the austrian parliament before deciding on a governing partner .
any government i form will be a pro-european one , kurz , who has been the alpine republic s foreign minister since 2013 , told reporters .
i m not just glad we have this european union , but i also see it as the responsibility of my younger generation to actively engage and shape the eu in a positive way .
kurz , who will not represent austria at regular eu summits until he forms a government , also met european council president donald tusk and european commission chief jean-claude juncker .
tusk , a former polish prime minister , hailed kurz on twitter as a truly pro-european winner of the austrian elections .
austria became a member of the european union in 1995 after a two-thirds majority voted to join the bloc .
recent opinion polls show three-quarters of austrians want the affluent country to remain a member of the eu .
the fpo , which won over a quarter of austria s vote to the conservatives nearly 32 percent , gained from public unease over a large influx of mostly muslim migrants into europe in 2015 .
once anti-eu , the fpo now professes to be pro-europe but wants brussels to hand back more powers to member states .
