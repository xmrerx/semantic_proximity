bangkok ( reuters ) - hotels in bangkok s bustling old town , home to a backpacker enclave favored by foreign tourists , are booked up as thailand prepares to host the lavish funeral of its revered king bhumibol adulyadej next week , the hotel association said on monday .
the funeral of king bhumibol , who died on oct. 13 last year after seven decades on the throne , will run for five days next week , with most events centering on the grand palace and sanam luang , a public square in the historic quarter .
about 250,000 mourners are expected to attend the funeral , which will feature gold-tipped pavilions built for the occasion , and oct. 26 , the day of the cremation , has been declared a national holiday .
many thais wishing to attend the cremation feel it would be more convenient having a place to stay nearby , so most hotels have been booked out already , supawan tanomkieatipume , president of the thai hotels association , told reuters .
a reuters survey of three hotels on the khao san road , the main artery of the banglamphu backpacker area , found no rooms were available .
we are fully booked during the royal cremation , said preechaya amngeun , 23 , a guest services agent at the ibis styles bangkok khaosan viengtai , part of french hotel group accor .
around 80 percent of the guests we have are thais .
the other 20 percent are foreign tourists .
thailand s tourism industry , which accounts for 12 percent of gdp , has been a rare bright spot for an economy that has struggled since a 2014 coup .
it has weathered political turbulence and a major natural disaster over the past decade .
