Donald Trump is about as a racist as they come, no matter his claims to the contrary.
His entire campaign has been a nod to the most vile elements of white supremacy and all manner of bigotry that the bowels of American culture has to offer.
After all, he kicked off his circus of a campaign by declaring that all Mexican immigrants are rapists, and later called for a ban on all Muslims entering the United States even those who are citizens but simply traveling abroad.These examples are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Trump s racist rhetoric, and some brilliant person decided to call Trump out for what he is in an amazingly brilliant way: by defacing his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with a swastika.
The vandalism apparently occurred on Friday and has since been cleaned up but not before someone snapped a photo of it and uploaded it to social media site Reddit.

Trump s rhetoric is definitely reminiscent of the tone that was the preamble for the horrors that occurred in Nazi Germany, and it needs to be called out for what it is.To the anonymous brave American who did this sincerely, thank you.Featured image via video screen capture
