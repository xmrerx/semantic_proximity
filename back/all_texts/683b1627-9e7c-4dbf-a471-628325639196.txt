President Obama pretty much trolled Donald Trump earlier by saying that he could have defeated the alleged billionaire and former reality show star.
Obama spoke of his hope and change campaign and confirmed what we all know already.
His insight was that we just have to say no to that then that will puncture the balloon, that all this talk about hope and change and no red state and blue state is is proven to be a mirage, a fantasy, the President said.
And if we can if we can puncture that vision, then we have a chance to win back seats in the House and win back seats in the Senate.
If I had run again and articulated it, I think I could ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it, he continued.
In the wake of the election and Trump winning, a lot of people have suggested that somehow, [my vision] really was a fantasy, he continued.
What I would argue is, is that the culture actually did shift, that the majority does buy into the notion of a one America that is tolerant and diverse and open and full of energy and dynamism.
Well, that nugget of information was too much for the thin-skinned president-elect to handle so after not tweeting for 24 hours, he unleashed a nonsensical tweet in response to Obama s interview.
President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me.
He should say that but I say NO WAY!
jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc, Trump tweeted with his tiny hands.President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me.

Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) December 26, 2016The fact is that Obama s approval rating is soaring and Trump has the lowest approval rating of any president-elect in modern history.
He s just not popular.
