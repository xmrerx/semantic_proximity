black and brown people accounted for 86.5 percent of new york city s misdemeanor arrests , during the first three months of 2016.according to the most recent statistics from the police reform organizing project ( prop ) between january 1 and march 31 of this year the nypd arrested 46,600 citizens for misdemeanor crimes.out of those 46,600 arrests , more than 43,300 were people of color.the population of new york city is at least 44 percent white , according to the most recent data from the 2010 census .
in spite of the population demographics , less than 14 percent of misdemeanor arrests have involved a white person.those numbers are staggering.if that s not enough , it appears that the disproportionate rate of misdemeanor arrests involving people of color is getting worse.during the same three month time period in 2014 , people of color made up 84.5 percent of nypd misdemeanor arrests .
in 2015 the percentage of minority arrests increased to 85.4 percent .
in 2016 the number rose again , to where it now stands at 86.5 percent.during an interview with new york daily news , robert gangi of prop said the statistics that stand out for us involve arrests for misdemeanor marijuana offenses .
as new york daily news reports here : on nov. 11 , 2014 , police commissioner bill bratton announced that people caught with less than 25 grams of marijuana would no longer be arrested , effective immediately .
instead , they were to be issued a noncriminal violation in the form of a summons .
repeat offenders would get a fine .
anyone caught smoking on the street , however , would still wind up in jail.initially the number of marijuana arrests declined throughout the city , following the announcement.as the most recent data shows , the number of people arrested for marijuana has been inching its way back up since the announced 2014 policy change.during the first three months of 2016 , 4,225 people were arrested for pot possession .
that s a big increase over the same period last year , when 2,960 people were arrested on the same charge.the disparity in the rate of misdemeanor arrests is only the tip of the iceberg.according to their website , from june 3 , 2014 through august 11 , 2015 , prop recorded information on 1351 cases presented in manhattan , brooklyn , bronx , and queens criminal courts .
during that time period the organization monitored 1351 cases .
the group reports that of those cases 1247 , or 92.3 percent , of defendants were people of color.as stated in the group s latest court monitoring report : everyday new york s district attorneys aggressively prosecute cases against black and brown people for engaging in mainly innocent or innocuous activities .
everyday our city s courts devote considerable resources to the administration of injustice , applying sanctions in hundreds , if not thousands , of cases where the charges involves , at worst , petty infractions and where the defendants are almost always people of color , some of whom live on the margins of society .
