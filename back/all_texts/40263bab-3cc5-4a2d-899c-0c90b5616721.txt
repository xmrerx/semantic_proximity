DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland s minister for social protection said she expects the government and main opposition party to avoid a snap election that a dispute between the two has left them 24 hours away from triggering.
I think we all know an election is coming but it just isn t right for the country to have that election right now and I do expect us to come back from the brink, Regina Doherty told the Newstalk radio station on Monday.
