Just what America needs another President who makes up laws to fit his radical agenda, with no regard for the actual laws the rest of America must abide by Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders ripped into Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio at a rally in northern Arizona on Thursday, after facing criticism from the Clinton campaign for an encounter Sanders wife had with the immigration-hardliner sheriff.The U.S. senator from Vermont said Arpaio s arrests of undocumented immigrants, often separating families, were outrageous and unconscionable.
It s easy for bullies like Sheriff Arpaio to pick on people who have no power, Sanders said.
If I am elected president the president of the United States does have power.
So watch out, Joe.
