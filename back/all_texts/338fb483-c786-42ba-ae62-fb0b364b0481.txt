Bobby Jindal s worst nightmare has come true: poor people are going to get the healthcare they deserve, and it s all thanks to a Democrat.Louisiana s Democratic Governor John Bel Edwards has delivered on his promise to expand Medicaid.
As of June 1, the state s Department of Health and Hospitals will begin to enroll over 375,000 eligible citizens into Louisiana s expanded program.
The state hopes to enroll half the individuals by July 1.Ruth Kennedy, who heads the DHH s Medicaid enrollment program, says the department will be implementing an all hands on deck approach, in an effort to get as many people into the program as possible: I am confident, and I am ready, and this is not my first rodeo.
The governor, you ll remember, said at a press conference that people would have cards in their hands on July 1.
That s a big difference from starting enrollment on July 1.
Well, we won t have 375,000 cards in people s hands, but I m absolutely certain we ll be more than halfway there.
Look at that, government that works efficiently to ensure everybody has access to healthcare.
What a concept.
And to make the operation run more smoothly, Louisiana will set up over 204 application sites all across the state with workers from the University Medical Center in New Orleans.
In an effort to reduce headache, the DHH will use the income data it has already gathered, rather than having to collect new information, and food stamp numbers can also be used on an annual basis to reaffirm eligibility when the time comes.
This practice is a big deal according to Kennedy because it won t all for an eligibility purge from bureaucratic mistakes.So what happens when a Democrat governor, a Medicaid advocate, nurses and employees with the state s universities and department get together?
