Pittsburgh s head coach Mike Tomlin showed his solidarity for players who took a cowardly stand against our President after Trump said NFL owners should fire players who disrespect our flag during the national anthem.
The Pittsburg Steelers team and coaching disrespected our flag and our veterans who have sacrificed so much by hiding in a tunnel instead of joining the fans to honor our flag.
After the game, coach Tomlin took it a step further, and openly criticized the Army Ranger and 3-time Afghan war vet Alejandro Villanueva, for standing during our National Anthem.Fans rewarded the brave offensive lineman buy snatching up so many of his jerseys, that Villanueva s jersey sales surpassed the previous record held by Patriots QB Tom Brady.
Today, that vision of a hero Americans watched yesterday, who stood alone on the field, undeterred by angry leftists, determined to promote division and hate for our law enforcement, has been shattered.NYP Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Alejandro Villanueva, who broke with his team to stand for the national anthem on Sunday, became the best-selling NFL player Monday, according to a report.The former Army Ranger, who served three tours of duty in Afghanistan, was the only Steeler to appear for The Star-Spangled Banner before the game against the Chicago Bears.Alejandro Villanueva was the only Steeler to come out for the National Anthem, standing in the tunnel.

Unfortunately I threw my teammates under the bus, unintentionally, Alejandro Villanueva said on Monday.
Every single time I see that picture of me standing by myself I feel embarrassed.
Villanueva then explained that he had asked to stand in the front of the team with the captains of the squad at the last second so that they showed some respect for wounder veterans.That plan backfired though when he did not stop to check that the captains were by his side as he walked to the opening of the tunnel, which is how the 6ft 9in lineman ended up in plain view on the field as the national anthem began to play.Watch:His admission comes after thousands across the country declared him a hero for his actions, and began purchasing his jersey in record numbers to show support for what they thought was a calculated move.Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger also said on Monday that he was meant to be by Villanueva s side at the time, but got held back by the melee in the tunnel after the tackle walked too far out.
Daily MailSocial media isn t buying Villanueva s story:Villanueva has now been pressured to apologize, after his coach criticized him.
So much for HIS free speech.
