geneva ( reuters ) - britain s opposition labour party wants a close relationship with the rest of europe after brexit , labour leader jeremy corbyn told an audience at the united nations in geneva on friday .
we want to see a close and cooperative relationship with our european neighbors outside the european union , based on solidarity as well as mutual benefit and fair trade , along with a wider proactive internationalism across the globe , he said .
my own country , britain , is at a crossroads , he said .
the vote last year to leave the european union meant hard thinking had to be done about britain s role in the world , he said .
there are some who want to use brexit to turn britain in on itself , rejecting the outside world , viewing everyone as a feared competitor , he said .
others want to use brexit to put rocket boosters under our current economic system s insecurities and inequalities .
turning britain into a deregulated corporate tax haven , low wages , with limited rights , cut-price public services , in a wholly destructive race to the bottom .
corbyn said his party stood for a completely different future , drawing on the internationalist traditions of the labour movement and of britain .
in a wide-ranging speech about human rights and multilateralism , he did not immediately comment on the brexit divorce deal struck by britain s prime minister theresa may and the european commission earlier on friday .
the european commission said that enough progress had been made in brexit negotiations to allow a second phase of talks on future relations to begin .
