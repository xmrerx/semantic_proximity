VIRGINIA governor Terry McAuliffe decided to get political today when he spoke out during the presser for the Virginia shooting of Congressman Steve Scalise.
Leave it to a political hack like McAuliffe to bring gun control into the discussion: There are too many guns on the street.
We lose 93 million Americans a day to gun violence.
CONFUSION: VA Gov.
Terry McAuliffe: There are too many guns on the street.
We lose 93 million Americans a day to gun violence.

He eventually corrected himself to say that it s just 93 people a day who are victims of gun violence.
How many are saved BECAUSE they are armed with a gun?
Lives were saved today because the Capitol Police were armed.
That s all thanks to Steve Scalise who is a leader in Congress and gets protection.
It they hadn t been there, who know how many would have been killed!McAuliffe is a Clinton crony who has always been a snake in the grass.
He will do anything to get ahead politically.
He s been involved in a questionable redistricting in his state and prior to the 2016 election he made it possible for thousands of felons to vote.
