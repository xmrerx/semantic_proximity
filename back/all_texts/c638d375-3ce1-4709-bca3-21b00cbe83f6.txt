Donald Trump is throwing a hissy fit because Democrats are blocking many of his Cabinet nominees.
But he should be blaming Republicans instead.Trump has chosen nominees who want to destroy the departments they have been picked to lead and they are mostly unqualified to hold the positions.But those are not the only reasons why Democrats are putting up a fight.For eight years, Republicans frequently obstructed President Obama s nominees and any legislation Democrats proposed.
And for nearly a whole year, Republicans blocked Obama s Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland from taking his rightful place on the high court.The obstruction was unprecedented in American history, yet Republicans and Trump are whining because Democrats are doing the exact same thing to them.
.On Tuesday, Trump took to Twitter to complain like a hypocrite.It is a disgrace that my full Cabinet is still not in place, the longest such delay in the history of our country.
Obstruction by Democrats!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 8, 2017Again, Republicans blocked Garland s nomination for nearly a year even though he was totally qualified and had received praise from GOP lawmakers.
Garland was also considered a moderate choice for the court.
Furthermore, Republicans blocked an Obama nominee for years from taking her place as Ambassador to the Bahamas and she died waiting to serve her country.So while Republicans are throwing a temper tantrum over Democratic obstruction, they really only have themselves to blame.
For eight years, they viciously blocked legislation and nominees because they hated President Obama.
And they hated him because he has black skin.
If Donald Trump wants to bitch about obstructionism he should blame Republicans for setting the precedent.Also, Trump is lying because President Obama didn t have his full Cabinet in place until April.And Twitter was quick to remind him of it.
@realDonaldTrump This is what happens when your party sets a new standard for obstructionism the other side has to escalate to compensate.
