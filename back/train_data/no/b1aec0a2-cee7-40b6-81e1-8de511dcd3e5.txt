berlin ( reuters ) - none of the german parties involved in exploratory coalition talks support french president emmanuel macron s idea to create a separate budget for the euro zone , a negotiator for the greens party told reuters on wednesday .
reinhard buetikofer , who participated in a late-night negotiating session on european policy on tuesday with german chancellor angela merkel s conservatives and the free democrats ( fdp ) , said the greens supported the idea of more investment in infrastructure but not a new budget .
none of the participating parties support a euro zone budget , buetikofer , a member of the european parliament said .
we greens fully support the idea of finding ways , within the framework of the existing eu budget , to boost investment in infrastructure .
we share macron s aim of increasing investment .

the greens are seen as the biggest supporters of macron s ideas among the german parties considering a coalition .
