baghdad/dubai ( reuters ) - iran on sunday shut its border crossings with iraq s kurdistan in support of measures taken by the iraqi government to isolate the kurdish region , the iraqi foreign ministry said .
at the request of the iraqi government , the islamic republic of iran closed today the border crossings with the kurdistan region of iraq , the iraqi foreign ministry said in a statement in baghdad .
earlier in the day , iranian foreign ministry spokesman bahram qassemi had indirectly dismissed claims these crossings were shut .
as far as i know , nothing new has happened in this area , the iranian students news agency ( isna ) quoted him as saying .
an iranian mp mohammad-javad nobandegani said tehran did not want to publicize the closing of the border .
there is no need for explicit publicity , the mp was quoted as saying by iran s ilna news agency .
the closure would negatively impact residents who depend on border trade , he said , adding that national interests sometimes require us to act this way .
iran last month halted flights to and from kurdish regions in northern iraq over the independence referendum by the autonomous kurdistan regional government ( krg ) .
tehran also carried out war games at the kurdish border in september .
tehran fears the spread of separatism to its own kurdish population , which is around 8 million .
iran backs shi ite groups which have been ruling or holding key security and government positions in iraq since the 2003 u.s-led invasion which toppled saddam hussein .
