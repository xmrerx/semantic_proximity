( reuters ) - colorado voters rejected a ballot measure on tuesday to create the nation ’ s first statewide universal health insurance program , according to local nbc news affiliate 9news .
the proposition , called amendment 69 , would have created one of the most dramatic overhauls to a public healthcare system in u.s. history .
colorado ’ s 9news reported that the amendment was defeated on tuesday night , after early results showed an overwhelming defeat .
dubbed coloradocare , the program would have been funded largely through a new 10 percent payroll tax increase intended to raise $ 25 billion in 2019 , the first year the program could launch , according to the colorado health institute .
coloradocare was intended to greatly reduce the number of uninsured residents in the state , but opponents feared the tax hike and sweeping changes to public policy would ripple through the state ’ s economy .
james merilatt , 43 , an unaffiliated voter who supported democratic presidential candidate hillary clinton in tuesday ’ s election , said he opposed the single-payer healthcare measure .
“ it ’ s way too complicated and would have opened up a pandora ’ s box , ” said merilatt , who works in the publishing industry .
