The term fake news has become attached to some of America s major news outlets.
Now a YMCA in Valparaiso, Ind., has decided to ban CNN from its TVs after customers complained the news network falsifies stories.
In order to eliminate perceived political bias associated with national news outlets, the Valparaiso Family YMCA will only be showing local news channels in the future, the Valparaiso YMCA said in a statement.Chicago Tribune reporter/columnist Jerry Davich said he asked Valparaiso YMCA CEO Robert Wanek to elaborate on why the decision was made, and Wanek responded, I cannot pinpoint the change origins, only to add that we get dozens of requests to change channels every day from numerous interest groups.
We just want the Y to be a haven for wellness where people come together and have a sense of belonging, gain new relationships and achieve their personal goals, Wanek added.
We will display local news moving forward.
Davich complained that the Y s decision to remove all national news outlets from its televisions says more about its leaders than its members.
You d think this story would be just another example of fake news.
Sadly, it s not.
He said he wondered if the company was simply exercising its right to appease as many members as possible, or is the new Donald Trump-led America already flexing its muscles?
YMCA member Greg Quartucci told CBS Chicago the decision to remove CNN from wellness center TVs was made shortly after Trump confronted CNN White House correspondent Jim Acosta, calling his network terrible and fake news.
