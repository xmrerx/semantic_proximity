Hell has frozen over!
CNN is actually reporting the truth!
CNN legal analyst Paul Callan agrees with the assessment that the FBI and DOJ need to be purged .
They refer to Rep. Rooney s (see below) take that the FBI and DOJ are off the rails:OUR PREVIOUS REPORT ON REP ROONEY S TAKE ON THE CORRUPT DOJ AND FBI:THIS IS PRICELESS!
The video below shows just how out of control the left is when it comes to the corruption within the FBI and DOJ.When a Republican lawmaker called for a purge of what he said are deep state elements within the FBI and Justice Department, the MSNBC host Hallie Jackson was clearly agitated and shocked: I m very concerned that the DOJ and the FBI, whether you call it deep state or what, are off the rails, Florida Rep. Francis Rooney stated then cited reasons behind his concern.
The anti-Trump bias and the demotion of Bruce Ohr were just two of the examples Rooney gave.Jackson shot back, Congressman, you just called the FBI and the DOJ off the rails.
Something that you re okay with talking about here?
How does that not sort of undermine the work that the agencies are doing?
I don t want to discredit them.
I would like to see the directors of those agencies purge it, said Rooney.
And say look, we ve got a lot of great agents, a lot of great lawyers here, those are the people that I want the American people to see and know the good works being done, not these people who are kind of the deep state.
Jackson responded: Language like that, Congressman, purge?
Purge the Department of Justice?
Rooney responded, Well, I think that Mr. Strzok could be purged, sure.
Ms. Jackson might want to read up on the corruption that s been uncovered so far with the FBI and DOJ.
