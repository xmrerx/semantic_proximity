if donald trump had sent proper new year s greetings to the american people to begin with , he wouldn t be getting humiliated.but he royally f * cked up on new year s eve morning by referring to millions of americans as his enemies .
happy new year to all , including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don t know what to do .
love !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) december 31 , 2016insulting the american people in this way only serves to further divide , and outrage understandably ensued.fast-forward about 12 hours later and trump apparently decided that he needed a mulligan .
so he took another shot at it by wishing all americans a happy new year without referring to anyone as a loser or an enemy.to all americans- # happynewyear & many blessings to you all !
looking forward to a wonderful & prosperous 2017 as we work together to # maga ? ?

i thought we were the enemy .

# tinyfingeredpuppet pic.twitter.com/tvvqyoqzqo jaly ( @ jalyiv ) january 1 , 2017yeah , it definitely was not a good idea to call millions of americans enemies .
but it s an even worse idea for trump to pretend he didn t send that first tweet and to assume that americans will just forgive and forget.clearly , donald trump is unfit to be president .
he is incapable of being a president for all americans.featured image via jeff j mitchell/getty images
