moscow ( reuters ) - a senior official in the russian parliament will discuss north korea s missile and nuclear program in separate talks with parliamentarians from seoul and pyongyang on monday , tass news agency said .
valentina matviyenko , speaker of the senate upper house , will discuss the issue with a deputy head of north korea s legislature and the head of south korea s parliament on the sidelines of a congress of parliamentarians in st petersburg , tass quoted a senior russian lawmaker as saying .
both meetings will take place on oct. 16 , tass cited konstantin kosachev , head of the senate s international relations committee , as saying .
quoting an unnamed source , ria news agency said earlier on saturday the meetings would take place on oct. 15 .
i believe that during the meetings the russian side will call ( on north and south korea ) to hold direct contacts .
this would be quite natural , but of course we can not , and should not , force anyone to do so , kosachev told tass .
north korea s nuclear tests and missile launches have stirred global tensions and prompted several rounds of international sanctions at the u.n. security council .
a de-escalation plan , which is backed by russia and china , would see north korea suspend its ballistic missile program and the united states and south korea simultaneously call a moratorium on large-scale missile exercises , both moves aimed at paving the way for multilateral talks .
