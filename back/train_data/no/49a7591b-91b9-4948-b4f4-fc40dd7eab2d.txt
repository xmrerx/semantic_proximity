there is a stark difference between these two veterans .
perry o brien , the crybaby veteran who has organized a group against trump is put in his place more than once during their interview with cnn s don lemon .
former navy seal carl higbie brilliantly calls out and embarrasses conscientious objector perry o brien for attempting to label him a racist because he doesn t agree with a particular religious ideology.we re not really fans of cnn , but they actually do america a favor when they bring guests like the conscientious objector , perry o brien onto their show to go head to head with a brave and passionate defender of america .
this interview provides a pretty good representation of the how the left has wussified the male vs. the strong conservative male who stands ready to defend his nation .
if i were trump i d pick the latter to be on my team .
the reality is , when the sh * t hits the fan 99 % of americans are going to want veteran carl higbie on their team .
we re not going to give a damn about whether or not he s passed a sensitivity course we just want to keep our nation safe from those who would like to take away our freedoms and destroy our way of life anti-trump and pro-trump veterans debate donald trump 's record https : //t.co/u52ea97ny8https : //t.co/jpuvhlw2zn cnn tonight ( @ cnntonight ) june 1 , 2016
