Donald Trump has some very scary authoritarian instincts.
He regularly makes it his mission to discredit and attack the free press, has nothing but contempt for our Constitution and our system of checks and balances, and he and his officials regularly lie and spread propaganda to the American public.
Now, in his most autocratic move yet, Trump has threatened the FBI Director he just fired via Twitter.
This, after he just fired the man who was investigating him.Supposedly, Trump is upset because fired FBI Director James Comey s associates disputed Trump s account of what happened during a dinner meeting between the two.
According to the New York Times, Trump asked for Comey s loyalty, and Comey refused to give it.
Therefore, Trump threatened Comey with the leaking of supposed tapes of their meetings.James Comey better hope that there are no "tapes" of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017Trump has also threatened to stop the White House tradition of daily press briefings, since the media is reporting on the continuously changing story with regards to the reasoning behind Comey s firing: Maybe the best thing to do would be to cancel all future "press briefings" and hand out written responses for the sake of accuracy???
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 12, 2017This is beyond anything we have ever seen.
Even Richard Nixon wasn t this much of a dictator in the making.
This so-called presidency is nothing more than a dictatorship.
We are literally devolving into something more like Russia or Turkey than the United States of America.
This is not normal, this is not safe, and this is not healthy.The people in Congress with the power to do something about Donald Trump and his band of incompetent authoritarians better wake up and do their jobs before it s too late.
The very soul of our republic depends on it.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images
