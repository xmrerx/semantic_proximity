A campaign ad for Donald Trump attacking rival Republican presidential candidate John Kasich has been pulled off the air in Ohio for violating federal election law.The ad, John Kasich All Talk No Action Politician, is designed to cut into the lead of Kasich, the current sitting governor in the state and the odds-on favorite to win the Republican primary coming up there.But it won t be seen on TV, and it is because the people employed by Trump s presidential campaign are very inept at their jobs.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iibsiauLgOoNew Day for America, the super PAC supporting Mr. Kasich, sent complaints to stations about the ad, saying that it was falsely attacking Ohio Gov.
John Kasich, and that it did not comply with federal regulations for political advertising.
No disclaimer appears at the end of the advertisement paid for by Donald Trump, Matt Carle, executive director of New Day for America, wrote in the complaint.
Consequently, this advertisement is in violation of the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971, and it must be removed from the air.
It is amazing in this day and age, when almost any sort of political advertising is allowed for the highest bidder, that an ad would get pulled like this.As the New York Times explains:The Federal Election Commission says that political ads must include a clearly readable written statement that appears at their end for a period of at least four seconds with a reasonable degree of color contrast between the background and the disclaimer statement.This is a standard thing to do for any real, serious presidential campaign, but it is a symptom of the sort of basic failure that happens every day with Trump.His campaign often issues conflicting positions on basic issues, contradicting what is said in a speech with a press release or a statement by a campaign spokesperson on TV.
They issue inaccurate press releases, with wrong or misspelled names and locations, and the candidate himself has often misstated the dates and times when instructing his supporters on where and when they should be voting.Trump is already months into his campaign and still making amateur hour screw-ups.
He has such a lead on the rest of the Republicans, this won t hurt.
But if he makes these kinds of mistakes in the fall against the Democrats, it will weaken his already shaky campaign.Featured image via YouTube
