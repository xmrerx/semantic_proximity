i heard mr. mclellan on the radio yesterday and he was very unsure about getting his money back from the seizure by the irs .
he sounded like he was pretty defeated and still shocked that via civil asset forfeiture laws he could have his life savings taken from him forever .
we ve reported on this before and feel it s a law that s certainly being abused .
bravo to mr. mclellan for standing up for himself !
after publicly humiliating the internal revenue service , a north carolina man received more than $ 100,000 from the agency.lyndon mclellan had the bank account for his convenience store seized by the irs , and at first he wasn t even sure why .
the agency used civil asset forfeiture laws to take mclellan s money without convicting or charging him of a crime.the irs said it suspected mclellan was violating federal structuring laws , which prohibit making multiple cash deposits of less than but near $ 10,000.the federal government has taken criticism for stretching the bounds of structuring laws to seize property from well-intended people.but even after policies were changed in 2014 to not seize property in these kinds of cases , it still wouldn t relent on mclellan.u.s .
attorney steve west threatened mclellan that going public would only make things worse for him .
he told mclellan it just ratchets up feelings in the agency .
my offer is to return 50 % of the money .
mclellan went to the press anyway .
the irs quickly changed its tune and gave lyndon mclellan back all $ 107,702 of his money.read more and photo courtesy of : institute for justice
