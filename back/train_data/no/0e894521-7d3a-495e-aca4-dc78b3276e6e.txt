danang , vietnam ( reuters ) - china will work with southeast asian countries to safeguard peace in the south china sea , president xi jinping said on saturday in a meeting with philippine president rodrigo duterte , who pledged to handle issues with beijing in those waters bilaterally .
china claims almost the entire strategic waterway through which about $ 3 trillion worth of goods pass every year , building and militariszing artificial islands .
brunei , malaysia , the philippines , taiwan and vietnam also have conflicting claims there .
china will continue to work with asean countries to safeguard peace , stability and prosperity of the south china sea region , china s official xinhua news agency cited xi as saying to duterte .
the two met on the sidelines of the asia-pacific economic cooperation ( apec ) summit in the vietnamese resort city of danang .
the philippines will , according to a consensus reached by both sides , work through bilateral channels to appropriately handle maritime issues , xinhua cited duterte as saying .
it did not elaborate .
duterte said earlier in the week that he planned to ask china to make clear its intentions in the south china sea .
since coming to office 16 months ago , the firebrand leader has been conciliatory to beijing , despite a ruling by an international arbitration court favoring the philippines in its territorial dispute with china .
in the past , duterte has repeatedly said he will raise the sea dispute at the proper time and avoided the issue when manila hosted two regional meetings this year .
the united states has criticized china s construction of islands and its build-up of military facilities in the sea , and is concerned they could be used to restrict free nautical movement .
u.s. navy ships have also carried out freedom of navigation patrols in the area , angering china , which says the territorial issues should be handled directly between countries in the region .
