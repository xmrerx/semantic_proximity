mouscron , belgium ( reuters ) - a belgian teenager who blamed the local mayor for his father s suicide after he was fired from a town hall job has confessed to slashing the politician s throat in a cemetery on monday night , public broadcaster rtbf said .
the murder of alfred gadenne , 71 , the mayor of mouscron and a former lawmaker in the regional parliament , has shocked the country , with the prime minister expressing his horror .
the public prosecutor told reuters that a man was under arrest after giving himself up to police at the scene after dark in mouscron , an industrial border town of 57,000 close to the french city of lille .
he declined comment on media reports .
rtbf , citing sources including the suspect s lawyer , said he was 18 and told police he was avenging his father , who killed himself two years ago after losing his job as a local council employee .
a box-cutter was found at the scene , where the young man had calmly called police to attend around 8 p.m. gadenne , a conservative whose death prompted tributes from across the national political spectrum , acted as caretaker for the cemetery next to his home and was killed after going there to lock up for the night , as he did every evening .
media reporting of this spare-time occupation during his decade as mayor had allowed the suspect to find gadenne alone , rtbf said .
it added that the man waited until he reached the age of majority so his mother , also a municipal employee , could not be held liable for his actions under belgian law .
mourners left flowers at the cemetery gates and visited the town hall to sign a book of condolence for the mayor .
