harare ( reuters ) - zimbabwe s robert mugabe may have been deposed as president , but some of the ruling party s senior officials are struggling to stop mentioning the man who dominated their country for 37 years .
two government ministers were left embarrassed at a party congress on friday when they used the name of the veteran leader when referring to the man who replaced him after last month s de facto coup , new president emmerson mnangagwa .
energy minister and zanu-pf spokesman simon khaya-moyo chanted forward with president mugabe !
in the native shona language before hastily correcting himself to forward with president ed mnangagwa .
mnangagwa , who was sworn in as president of the southern african country on nov. 24 , initially sat stony-faced before breaking into a smile when another official whispered to him .
finance minister patrick chinamasa also started referring to mugabe as the party s candidate for elections due in 2018 before correcting himself .
mnangagwa was endorsed as the zanu-pf leader and candidate for the top job for the vote which he said on thursday said could be sooner than expected .
mugabe himself was out of the country .
sources said he visited a hospital in singapore this week , apparently for medical checks .
