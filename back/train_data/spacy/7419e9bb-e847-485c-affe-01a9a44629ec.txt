alzheimer disease devastating type dementia account 60 80 percent dementia case currently affect 5 million americans
accord alzheimer association -PRON- 6th lead cause death united states someone us develop disease every 66 second
2050 number case project reach 138 millionscientist researcher grapple understand disease search cure since 1906 german neurologist dr alois alzheimer discover plaque tangle brain woman die unknown mental illness symptom memory loss difficulty language erratic behavior
progression disease amyloid plaque deposit neurofibrillary tangle build brain disrupt connection nerve cell ultimately death nerve cell brain tissuea recent study lead scientist university glasgow scotland hong kong university science technology produce potential breakthrough alzheimer disease treatmentin mice progressive disease similar alzheimer researcher inject protein call il33
within week memory cognitive function affected mouse improve normal level
daily protein injection clear exist amyloid plaque brain mouse stop -PRON- development
result yet test human guarantee protein similar result human trial
2014 study estimate positive result experiment mouse translate success human rate 8 percentnonetheless study promising cure treatment currently available alzheimer disease
alzheimer care form dementia estimate cost united states 236 billion 2016working mice scottish chinese researcher find protein il33 promote development microglia immune cell brain direct -PRON- towards plaque form alzheimer disease
relevance finding human alzheimer present unclear
encourage hint say professor eddy liew lead researcher study university glasgow press release
example previous genetic study show association il33 mutation alzheimer disease european chinese population
furthermore brain patient alzheimer disease contain less il33 brain nonalzheimer patient
enough false breakthrough medical field caution -PRON- hold -PRON- breath rigorous clinical trial
researcher soon begin first phase clinical trial human test toxicity protein il33 dose use mouse global medical community anticipate hope favorable resultsfeature image courtesy flickr
