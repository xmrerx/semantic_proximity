Donald Trump, the pathetic man who has yet to apologize for all the hateful and divisive things he said throughout his campaign, is demanding an apology from the media.Seriously.Trump has been lashing out at the media and the intelligence community all weekend over a dossier revealing that he paid prostitutes to pee on the bed in the presidential suite of the Ritz Carlton hotel in Moscow, and also reveals that his campaign colluded with Russia to win the election.He whined about the media during his first press conference in six months, resorting to calling CNN and Buzzfeed fake news for running the story.Now Trump is crowing because legendary reporter Bob Woodward, who shall now be known as a sell-out, agreed with him that the dossier should never have been reported on, which would have hidden information from the American people.
His demand for an apology was written in all caps, even though he has failed to apologize for any of the insults and offensive statements he said during his campaign.Thank you to Bob Woodward who said, That is a garbage document it never should have been presented Trump s right to be upset (angry) Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017about that Those Intelligence chiefs made a mistake here, & when people make mistakes, they should APOLOGIZE.
Media should also apologize Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 15, 2017And because Trump is being a hypocrite when it comes to apologies, Twitter told him to go to hell.
@realDonaldTrump We are sorry you are such a douche.

@realDonaldTrump You MUST stop fixating on the pee story.
The more you bring up the pee story the more people will think about it, Donald.

@realDonaldTrump And if you continue to vilify the media, it s very unlikely they ll apologize to you about anything, dear.

Almost as if he is guilty of something?

He is five days away from taking over the White House.
It s time for him to grow up and start acting like an adult instead of the petulant child he has been his entire life.Featured image by Jeff J Mitchell via Getty Images
