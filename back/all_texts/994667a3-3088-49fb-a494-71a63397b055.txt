Donald Trump is trying his best to blame the violence associated with his presidential campaign on anyone but the person who instigated it in the first place: himself.Reacting to criticism from the public, the media, and even his fellow Republican presidential candidates (who were largely silent on the violent rhetoric at Trump events before), Trump blamed the violence on the protesters who came out against his Chicago rally on Friday night and on Democratic candidate on Bernie Sanders.In response, the Sanders campaign absolutely crushed Trump s big lie.The campaign released a statement to reporters that began, as is the case virtually every day, Donald Trump is showing the American people that he is a pathological liar.
Sander then said, While I appreciate that we had supporters at Trump s rally in Chicago, our campaign did not organize the protests.
That is a most likely a reference to video taken inside the rally showing loud cheers for Bernie!
after it was announced that the Trump rally would be canceled (a decision, by the way, that Trump claimed came from police but which they denied).The statement continues, What caused the protests at Trump s rally is a candidate that has promoted hatred and division against Latinos, Muslims, women, and people with disabilities, and his birther attacks against the legitimacy of President Obama.
Sanders previously referenced those same birther attacks and their racially loaded nature during the Democratic debate on Univision earlier in the week.Then Sanders returned to the instigator of the violence, Donald Trump himself, and wrote, What caused the violence at Trump s rally is a campaign whose words and actions have encouraged it on the part of his supporters.
Sanders points out that Trump recently said he d like to punch a protester in the face and yearned for the days when a protester would be carried out on a stretcher.
Sanders campaign also pointed out that Trump s campaign manager has been accused of assaulting a female reporter, Michelle Fields of the conservative Breitbart News.Sanders concludes his release with a demand of Trump and his campaign: What Donald Trump must do now is stop provoking violence and make it clear to his supporters that people who attend his rallies or protest should not be assaulted, should not be punched, should not be kicked.
In America people have a right to attend a political rally without fear of physical harm.
