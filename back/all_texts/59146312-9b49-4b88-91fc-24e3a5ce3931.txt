Many Republicans believe that if Donald Trump s presidential campaign is as unsuccessful as it is ramping up to be, that they can contain the damage.
The thought process goes that if Trump is a failure, it is best to keep him at an arm s length, and Republicans won t have to suffer too much for it.But the Trump containment strategy is facing a test, as evidence emerges that Trump s controversial Trump University may have dodged criminal prosecution thanks to a relationship between Trump and Florida attorney general Pam Bondi.Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi is denying that a $25,000 donation from Donald Trump is in any way connected to her office s decision not to pursue action against Trump University, despite dozens of complaints in Florida, her spokesman said.Bondi, who endorsed Trump in March, received the donation in 2013 via a political action committee raising money for her re-election.Bondi, who rose to fame within conservative circles thanks to repeated appearance on Fox News, reportedly received multiple complaints about Trump University s business practices, as new documents released in the fraud litigation against Trump University recently revealed.Instead of doing her job and being an advocate for consumers bilked by Trump University, Bondi s office decided against prosecuting the organization.The complaints show several unsatisfied customers called the course a scam and one man claimed it forced him in to personal bankruptcy.Trump has recently announced a campaign event in Florida where Bondi, who supports his nomination, will appear.Texas governor Greg Abbott, who served as state attorney general when legal action was heating up on Trump University, declined to announce that the company was facing a $5.4 million penalty for how they had conducted business in the state.
