mogadishu ( reuters ) - the african union s plan to trim its somalia peacekeeping force ( amisom ) will hurt the mission unless extra equipment is found to offset the troop decrease , the mission s leader told reuters on monday .
the force of 22,000 deployed a decade ago is set to lose 1,000 soldiers this year as part of a long-term plan to pull out of the country and hand security to the somali army .
amisom is confronting the islamist militant group al shabaab , whose ranks have been swelled by islamic state fighters fleeing military setbacks in libya and syria .
militants killed more than 500 people in an attack in the capital mogadishu last month .
it was the deadliest such attack in the country s recent history .
amisom deployed to help secure the government of a country that since 1991 has struggled to establish central control .
the peacekeepers helped push al shabaab out of mogadishu but the group still frequently attacks civilian and military targets .
unless we have a proportionate forces multiplier in terms of equipment ... intelligence , electronic intelligence , that ( withdrawal ) will have a very considerable effect on our mission , amisom head fransisco madeira told reuters .
we believe the u.n. will find ways and means of covering or making up the gap that might result .
the diplomat from mozambique was speaking on the sidelines of a security conference in mogadishu .
he said it was hard to estimate the number of al shabaab fighters .
somalia s minister of internal security mohamed abukar islow told reuters the government wants the lifting of an arms embargo so that our forces get enough weapons and military equipment .
the united nations imposed an arms embargo on somalia shortly after the nation plunged into civil war in the early 1990s .
it partially lifted the ban in 2013 to help equip government forces .
