Hacktivist group Anonymous has now commenced their war on Donald Trump, which has begun with a huge data dump on the most popular fascist in America.
The dump includes Trump s social security number, multiple cell phone numbers of him, his bratty kids, and a few of his business associates.
Also included are email addresses and website information for his businesses.Reports indicate that the attack is being led by Anonymous Red Cult, who are the ones responsible for #OpISIS and #OpAnonVerdict in the past.
They have a long history of fighting back against entities, from individuals to entire governments, which they view as being oppressive against the common people.
Red Cult also says that they are narrowing their current focus towards Trump and away from other fronts, promising that this is only the beginning of their attacks on him.The full Trump doxxing release can be viewed HERE.
The name of the operation, white rose, was inspired by a resistance movement that started against the Nazis during World War 2.
Anonymous has confirmed that more chapters are cropping up and forming a collective under the name White Rose Society, ensuring what will be an interesting 2016 election cycle.Trump s fascist rhetoric has already been responsible for multiple assaults on peaceful protesters at and around his political rallies, as well inflaming racist and xenophobic sentiment across the nation.
We have already seen cases of hate crimes experiencing an upswing since his rise to dominance of the Republican party.
Since the Republican party is unwilling and incapable of dealing with Trump, perhaps Anonymous will finally be able to bring an end to the credible threat of terrorism he personifies.Addicting Info is presenting this for informational purposes only and does not endorse in any way the misuse of the information released by Anonymous.Watch the official statement by Anonymous Red Cult at the beginning of #OpWhiteRose below:Featured image via ghostbin
