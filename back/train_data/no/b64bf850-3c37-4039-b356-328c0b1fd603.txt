the one-state wonder sides with the left on a number of issues from his views on gay marriage , his flip-flopping on gun control to his support for communist common core .
sheriff clarke has now unearthed a video showing us the anti-cop side of governor john katich.most of us have been pulled over by law enforcement and many of us have been frustrated after receiving a ticket we didn t think we deserved .
we re not all governor s however , and we don t stand up in front of a crowd where we likely have some influence , and call law enforcement officers idiots .
too bad this video wasn t exposed before he narrowly won his home state of ohio .
have you ever been stopped by a police officer that s an idiot ?
he s an idiot !
you just can t act that way .
and what people resent is people who are in the government who don t treat the client ( client ? )
with respect .
who knew that the person being pulled over by the police for potentially breaking the law is considered a client ?
here is the original tweet from the awesome milwaukee sheriff david clarke : https : //t.co/lxdirztj3r @ johnkasich is anti gun and anti cop and people , say trump is not conservative ?
