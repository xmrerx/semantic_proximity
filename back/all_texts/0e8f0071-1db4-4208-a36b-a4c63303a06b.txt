You know how the NRA constantly tells us that their army of good guys with guns are ready to swoop in at the first sign of danger to save those in distress?
Well, as an incident from Hollis, Maine, shows us, sometimes it may be better if they just don t.30-year-old Joshua Weldon had good intentions when he saw a woman s boyfriend assaulting her and made the decision to step in and stop it.
According to police, 32-year-old Andria Richardson was being attacked by her boyfriend, 30-year-old Ryan Gilliken, on Wednesday when Weldon drew a firearm in an attempt to defend the woman.
Unfortunately, his bravado did not work out well for anyone but the assailant.Weldon fired his weapon multiple times, hitting Richardson in the stomach twice and the leg three times.
Richardson is recovering from her wounds, but family members say she is lucky.
Notably, neither the attacker nor the savior were injured by the gunfire.Last year, another good guy with a gun made headlines when he tried to help a carjacking victim by shooting the people stealing her car.
He missed the criminals, but shot the victim in the head.It s nice to think of people with a firearm as heroes who will be there to save us when things go bad but the thing is that the average gun owner is not trained or conditioned to handle, say, close-range combat against an unarmed attacker (with a victim nearby), without causing some form of collateral damage.
In this case, our hero almost killed the person he was trying to save.Gilliken has been charged with domestic violence assault, a Class C felony.
Weldon has not been charged with a single crime.Watch a report on the shooting below:Featured image via screengrab
