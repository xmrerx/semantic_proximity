bogota ( reuters ) - a bomb attack by colombia s leftist eln rebel group has halted pumping operations along the country s second-largest oil pipeline , the cano-limon covenas , sources from the military and state oil company ecopetrol said on monday .
the attack took place in rural el carmen municipality in norte de santander province , near the border with venezuela , the sources said .
the bombing caused a crude spillage into a nearby river .
the sources spoke on condition of anonymity because an official announcement has not yet been made .
production at the cano limon oilfield , operated by u.s.-based occidental petroleum corp , and exports have not been affected , the sources said .
ecopetrol officials said a team from the company was in the area to carry out clean-up operations .
repairs are expected to take several days , they said .
attacks against the pipeline have left 751 victims over the last 17 years , including 167 deaths .
since 1986 the pipeline has been out of service 3,800 days , or 10.4 years , 30 percent of its life .
some 66 million gallons of crude have been spilled since 2000 , according to ecopetrol figures .
the 485-mile ( 780-km ) pipeline can carry up to 210,000 barrels per day .
the national liberation army ( eln ) , considered a terrorist group by the united states and european union , has frequently attacked colombia s oil infrastructure during the group s five-decade war with the government .
despite peace talks begun with the government in february , the eln has continued pipeline attacks .
it opposes the presence of multinational companies in the mining and oil sector , claiming that they seize natural resources without leaving benefits to the country s population or economy .
