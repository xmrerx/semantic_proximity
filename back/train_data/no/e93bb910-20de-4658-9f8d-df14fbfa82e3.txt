riyadh ( reuters ) - saudi arabia announced on tuesday a $ 500 billion plan to create a business and industrial zone extending across its borders into jordan and egypt , the biggest project yet in a series of efforts to free the kingdom of its dependence on oil exports .
the 26,500 square km ( 10,230 square mile ) zone , known as neom , will focus on industries including energy and water , biotechnology , food , advanced manufacturing and entertainment , saudi crown prince mohammed bin salman said .
adjacent to the red sea and the gulf of aqaba and near maritime trade routes that use the suez canal , the zone will power itself solely with wind power and solar energy , said the public investment fund , saudi arabia s top sovereign fund .
neom is situated on one of the world s most prominent economic arteries ... its strategic location will also facilitate the zone s rapid emergence as a global hub that connects asia , europe and africa .
the saudi government , the pif , and local and international investors are expected to put more than half a trillion dollars into the zone in coming years , prince mohammed said .
there was no immediate comment on the plan from jordan and egypt , both of which are close allies of saudi arabia .
