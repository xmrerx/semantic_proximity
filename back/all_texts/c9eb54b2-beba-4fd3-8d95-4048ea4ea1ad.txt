CNN host Don Lemon asks guest Simone Sanders, former Press Secretary for Bernie Sanders: How can you say it s not a hate crime against a white person?
Simone answers Lemon s question by suggesting that this is NOT a hate crime.
She goes on to say that if the 4 black thugs that beat and tortured this mentally disabled teen did it because they hated Trump, it shouldn t be a hate crime.
Sanders explains, Motive here matters.
So was this for hate of Donald Trump, the President-elect because of things that he has said, or was this for pure hate of white people?
Yeah, so torturing another human being you kidnapped for hours is okay, as long as it was just about something Trump said.
