PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday he would strike numerous bilateral trade deals, as opposed to multilateral accords like the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and they would include clauses to allow a 30-day termination notice.
“Believe me, we’re going to have a lot of trade deals,” Trump told a gathering of Republican lawmakers.
“If that particular country doesn’t treat us fairly, we send them a 30-day termination, notice of termination.”
