it s no secret that cnn is very biased when it comes to politics if you ve watched much of the coverage of the dem convention , you know that the coverage has been very selective .
the protesters and bernie sanders supporters were a huge presence and made lots of noise but main stream media outlets went out of their way to hide and censor angry protesters .
they even went so far as to bring in white noise machines and hired phony delegates to fill seats of bernie supporters who bailed on the convention .
working hand in hand , cnn and the dnc literally choreographed a phony convention made for tv and the low information voters .
here we have a clip of the chief political analyst for cnn and anchor wolf blitzer celebrating and clapping with the dems do you think if a fox anchor did the same thing it wouldn t be all over the place ?
this is modern journalism for you blatant disregard for the appearance of bias while shoving propaganda down the mouthes of low info voters sickening !
favorite moment of @ cnn coverage @ wolfblitzer @ gloriaborger dancing to sweet caroline ! !
