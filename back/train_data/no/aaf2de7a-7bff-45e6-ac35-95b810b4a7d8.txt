attendees made some of these comments during official presentations , and others directly to undercover cmp investigators.dr .
lisa harris , the medical director of planned parenthood of michigan : given that we actually see the fetus the same way , and given that we might actually both agree that there s violence in here .

ann schutt-aine , the director of abortion services for planned parenthood gulf coast ( which has been referred to local law-enforcement for criminal charges related to fetal-tissue trafficking ) : if i m doing a procedure , and i m seeing that i m in fear that it s about to come to the umbilicus [ navel ] , i might ask for a second set of forceps to hold the body at the cervix and pull off a leg or two , so it s not pba [ partial-birth abortion ] .dr .
stacy de-lin , the director of abortion services for planned parenthood of new york city : but we certainly do intact d & es [ dilation and extraction , otherwise known as partial-birth abortion , a method that is illegal under federal law ] .dr .
uta landy , the founder of the consortium of abortion providers ( caps ) , planned parenthood federation of america ( ppfa ) : an eyeball just fell down into my lap , and that is gross !
[ laughter from the crowd ] talcott camp , the deputy director of the aclu s reproductive health freedom project : i m like oh my god !
i get it !
when the skull is broken , that s really sharp !
i get it !
i understand why people are talking about getting that skull out , that calvarium .
dr. susan robinson , an abortion provider at planned parenthood mar monte : the fetus is a tough little object , and taking it apart , i mean , taking it apart on day one is very difficult .
.
.
.
you go in there , and you go , am i getting the uterus or the fetus ?
oh , good , fetus .
[ robinson makes a stabbing sound effect ] what have i got ?
nothing .
let s try again .
below are some comments from the footage that provide further evidence of planned parenthood s involvement in illegally profiting from fetal-tissue trafficking.dr .
leslie drummond , an abortion provider at planned parenthood mar monte ( a ppfa affiliate that contracted with a biotech firm to be paid per fetal organ provided ) : i get a lot of oohs and ahhs from stemexpress [ biotech firm ] .
you know , they re wanting livers .
.
.
.
last week i was in sacramento , and she said , i need four intact limbs .
and i said , you want what ? this part of the video should dispel any doubt americans had about planned parenthood selling baby parts for profit : dr. stacy de-lin , the director of abortion services for planned parenthood of nyc : but i think a financial incentive from you guys [ cmp investigators posing as tissue buyers ] is going to be like .
.
.
the people who we have to get this approved from will be very happy about it .
dr. paul blumenthal , the former medical director for pp of maryland : i know planned parenthood sells a lot of stuff [ fetal organs ] to people .
both the naf and planned parenthood sought and obtained a preliminary injunction against the center for medical progress to prevent the release of these undercover videos .
that civil suit is currently on appeal .
but california s attorney general took matters into his own hands in late march , charging cmp investigators david daleiden and sandra merritt with 14 felony counts of illegally recording confidential communications .
the state refuses to name the 14 accusers in the criminal case , even though daleiden and merritt have themselves been charged publicly.read more at : national review
