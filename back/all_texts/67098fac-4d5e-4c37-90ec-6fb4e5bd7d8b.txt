In the wake of Tom Koppel telling Sean Hannity to his face that he is bad for America, Eric Trump came to the Fox News host s rescue.
Eric Trump, who has never served in the military just like his father and Sean Hannity, declared on Fox and Friends that there is no better patriot in the world than Sean Hannity.
adding, I think he s just a great, great man.
He said that beliefs are what get America to a great place.
He has strong beliefs, Eric Trump said.
And you know, beliefs are what get America to a great place, beliefs on quite frankly, both sides of the aisle.
He then demonized the tolerant left, saying that they re very tolerant until they disagree with you.
Watch: There s no better patriot in the world than @seanhannity.

I know E2s who enlisted last month with more patriotism.
@seanhannity is a joke.
@EricTrump tay (@SensiblySecular) March 28, 2017@foxandfriends @seanhannity @EricTrump Ummm.
Literally ANY member of the military-active, reserve or vet-is a better patriot.

orlando pride fan (@3UGAHokies19) March 28, 2017@foxandfriends @seanhannity @EricTrump Forget the men and women serving our country right now.
Hannity is the patriot.

vaishali deshpande (@valdeshpande) March 28, 2017Sean Hannity s net worth is about $80 million.
He lives a lavish lifestyle, owning several homes, each worth millions.
But yeah, Hannity is more of a patriot than a man or woman who puts their lives on the line to protect our country and for very little pay.
Eric Trump is a trophy hunter and he probably thinks he s a brave patriot, too.The two have much in common.
Both of them will justify anything alleged president Donald Trump does, even if he marched into a high school and opened fire.In response to his interview with Mr. Koppel, Hannity tweeted that it was fake edited news, because of course he did.Hannity is no patriot.
Those that served in the military must be cringing right now.
Donald Trump s son just threw them under the bus for a wealthy Fox News host who has been sucking up to the amateur president on his show while calling liberals snowflakes.
By the way, Sean, 2016 called and they want that ineffective word back.An interesting tidbit about Koppel: The legendary journalist s Jewish parents fled Germany following the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazism.Image: screen capture with added tweets.
