If you haven t noticed, Donald Trump isn t quite the epitome of the average working American.
He s a guy who was born into wealth, got his start through his father, and claims he s a terrific businessman.
As the old saying goes, he was born on third base but thinks he hit a triple.Out on the campaign trail pointing out this utter disconnect between Trump and working America is none other than President Obama.
The president can t seem to quite wrap his head around the fact that people would choose a man who can t relate whatsoever to the plight of working America to represent them.While speaking at a rally for Hillary Clinton, Obama said: Really, this is the guy you want to be championing working people?
This guy who spent 70 years on this earth showing no concern for working people.
This guy s suddenly going to be your champion?
He spent most of his life trying to stay as far away from working people as he could.
And now this guy is gonna be the champion of working people.
Huh?
I mean, he wasn t gonna let you on his golf course.
He wasn t gonna let you buy in his condo.
And now suddenly, this guy s gonna be your champion?
And the answer to that would be, no, he s not.
Trump is only in this race for Trump and no one else.
That s been made clear from the start.Watch the president go after Trump and his bold claims to be best for American workers here:Obama says Trump has never been a champion for working people: He wasn t going to let you on his golf course.
