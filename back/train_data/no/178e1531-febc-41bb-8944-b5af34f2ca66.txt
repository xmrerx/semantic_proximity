our first lady has taken time out from her self-appointed role as america s food nazi to fulfill her new role as first propagandist in obama s coordinated race war on america first lady michelle obama used a speech monday that was supposed to be celebrating the opening of a new museum to instead dig deeper the racial divide that s been growing ever wider during her husband s presidency .
museums and concert halls , she said , just don t welcome non-white visitors especially children the way they welcome whites .
speaking at the new whitney museum in new york city s meat packing district last week , obama said she grew up thinking that museums were not places for someone who looks like me .
you see , there are so many kids in this country who look at places like museums and concert halls and other cultural centers and they think to themselves , well , that s not a place for me , for someone who looks like me , for someone who comes from my neighborhood .
in fact , i guarantee you that right now , there are kids living less than a mile from here who would never in a million years dream that they would be welcome in this museum .
and growing up on the south side of chicago , i was one of those kids myself .
so i know that feeling of not belonging in a place like this .
and today , as first lady , i know how that feeling limits the horizons of far too many of our young people .
according to twitchy , obama s remarks went largely unnoticed outside of the event , until a local radio host reported on museums as white spaces .
the first lady likely won t be answering that question any time soon .
the tone of her speech was eerily similar to her husband s remarks during the launch of my brother s keeper alliance in new york city on monday .
in the wake of racial tension and turmoil that has prompted riots throughout the country , president obama unleashed some of his most overt commentary on race yet , as documented by twitchy .
