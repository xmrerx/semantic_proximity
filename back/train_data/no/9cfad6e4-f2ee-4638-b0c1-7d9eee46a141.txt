no actual verifiable evidence is available , but hey in a world where pc rules the day who needs to verify a story ?
* * * * strong language warning ( video ) * * * * here s the wwe s statement : wwe terminated its contract with terry bollea ( aka hulk hogan ) .
wwe is committed to embracing and celebrating individuals from all backgrounds as demonstrated by the diversity of our employees , performers and fans worldwide.why is not completely clear yet , although obviously the statement points to him saying or doing something that they found offensive.some have speculated that it is due to this video from 2012 , in which he talks about people s use of the term nigga : https : //youtu.be/ovytgh_kbd0one would hope that they would not act so thoroughly and completely to sever the 30 year relationship over something as benign as that .
but in present pc climate , one wouldn t doubt it.others are pointing to another story , that he supposedly used the terminology fucking n * * gers repeatedly on a tape filed in a deposition in a florida court , this one would be much more problematic , where he calls himself a racist : at that point on the tape , the former hogan knows best star bemoaned how a black billionaire guy had offered to fund his 27 year old daughter brooke s music career.he also attempts to use bizarre , twisted logic in an attempt to justify his bigotry at the man .
i don t know if brooke was f * cking the black guy s son , hulk raved , the sources add .
i mean , i don t have double standards .
i mean , i am a racist , to a point , f * cking n * ggers .
but then when it comes to nice people and sh * t , and whatever .
then , in a tirade to rival the racism embarrassments suffered by mel gibson and dog the bounty hunter , hulk unloaded even more hatred ! according to sources , he said : i mean , i d rather if she was going to f * ck some n * gger , i d rather have her marry an 8-foot-tall n * gger worth a hundred million dollars !
like a basketball player !
i guess we re all a little racist .
fucking n * gger .
of course , according the original news source , the national enquirer , these records are sealed in a florida court so there is no actual evidence available to the public that can be used to verify this story.via : weasel zippers
