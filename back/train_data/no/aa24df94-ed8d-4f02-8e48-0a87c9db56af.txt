will the state department ever tell the truth and prove that careless , reckless , lying hillary was responsible for his death ?
a state department spokeswoman dodged questions monday about whether the discussion of shahram amiri , an iranian scientist who was executed by the iranian government for working with the u.s. , in a pair of hillary clinton s private emails may have played a role in his recent fate .
we re not going to comment on what may have led to this event , said elizabeth trudeau , a state department spokeswoman .
i couldn t speak to iranian judicial procedures related to this specific case , trudeau said .
we ve made our concerns known writ large around iranian due process .
she noted the state department had been very public about this case when [ amiri ] chose to return to iran , pointing to a press conference clinton gave in july 2010.in those remarks , clinton compared amiri s ability to leave the u.s. on his own free will with iran s decision to hold three young americans against their will .
she did not reference the scientist s work with the u.s. government.but emails made public in august show state department aides referring to amiri as our friend .
an iranian official was quoted attributing amiri s execution to his collusion with the great satan , america .
