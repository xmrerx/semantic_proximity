lima ( reuters ) - previously uncalculated damage caused by severe flooding in peru this year has pushed up the cost of rebuilding infrastructure by 28 percent to 25.65 billion soles ( $ 7.92 billion ) , a government official said wednesday .
pablo de la flor , who was appointed by president pedro pablo kuczynski to lead the reconstruction effort , said 38 percent of the new total will pay for rebuilding highways , roads and bridges .
the rest will be used to help build homes , schools , health clinics , sewage systems and farms affected by the floods .
without a doubt this is the most important fiscal effort in peru s recent history , de la flor told a press conference .
finance minister fernando zavala said the cost increase would be included in the budget in 2019 or 2020 .
the rebuilding plan was approved by kuczynski s cabinet on wednesday and does not need a green light from congress .
early this year an unusually brutal rainy season due to a sudden warming of pacific waters killed 162 people , slowed economic growth sharply and caused damage equivalent to 2 percent of peru s gross domestic product .
de la flor said the government would likely start awarding contracts at the end of the year .
