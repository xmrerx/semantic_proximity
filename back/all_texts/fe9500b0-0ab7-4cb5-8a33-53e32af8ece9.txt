What in the world has become of the Democrat Party?
Hillary snubs the largest police union in America and then her VP candidate promotes Black Lives Matter in his speech to the Urban League.
Is the Democrat Party the new party of lawlessness?
Rudy Giuliani weighs in on this and jumps all over Hillary:Rudy Giuliani joined the Fox and Friends Weekend co-hosts today to react to the revelation that Hillary Clinton has snubbed the largest police union in the country.Giuliani said the fact that Clinton isn t seeking the endorsement of the National Fraternal Order of Police is indicative of a shift among Democrats.
The Democratic Party has become an anti-law enforcement party, Giuliani said.
And this is the best demonstration of it.
He accused the Democrats of stoking the flames of anti-police sentiment across the country, leading to the rise of groups like Black Lives Matter and an increase in violence against law enforcement officers.
It comes right from the top, it includes Hillary, Giuliani said.
You don t even go talk to and seek the endorsement of one of the major police unions in the country?
He noted that Democrats didn t allow uniformed police officers on the floor of the DNC, calling the party s treatment of law enforcement outrageous.
