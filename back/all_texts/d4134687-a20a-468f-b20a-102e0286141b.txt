(Reuters) - The following table lists each stateâ€™s poll closing time for the U.S. presidential election.
Times are shown in U.S. eastern standard time (US EST), Greenwich mean time (GMT), Singapore time and Tokyo time.
Several states have two poll closing times because the state straddles two U.S. time zones.
In addition, the number of electoral votes (EV) for each state is listed next to its name.
