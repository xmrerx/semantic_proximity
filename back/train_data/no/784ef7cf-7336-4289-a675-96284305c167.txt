patrick henningsen 21st century wirejudging by both the words , and deeds of the obama white house and its political diplomatic appointees led by perfidious john kerry and caustic samantha power all evidence to date points to the us wanting to escalate its war on syria while happily baiting a military confrontation , and world war scenario with russia and its allies in the process .
if this latest leak is indeed true and time will certainly tell whether or not it is , it would constitute one of the most egregious violations of both us and international law by the united states government and its theocratic dictator partner in saudi arabia.washington s own anti-terror legislation expressly forbids colluding to provide logistical or material support for terrorist groups , and this us-saudi venture would be the latest in a long list of violations according to news released today ( see report below ) , us president barack obama has been briefed that the operation to liberate the isis stronghold in mosul in iraq is scheduled for the second half of october .
here s what makes this a potential shocker : the operation allows for safe passage for 9,000 isis fighters on the proviso that they are transferred from iraq to eastern syria in order to help us plans for regime change there .
at the time of the assault , coalition aircraft would strike only on a pre-agreed detached buildings in the city , which are empty , the source said .
according to him [ the source ] , the plan of washington and riyadh also provides that the rebels move from mosul to syria for the attack on the government-controlled town of troops .
essentially , washington and saudi arabia , will allow 9,000 isis ( islamic state ) fighter free passage into syria if they agree to join washington s regime change operations there .
this could also include , eastern regions of syria to follow a major offensive operation , which involves the capture of deir ez-zor and palmyra , the source added.before you write this story off as some ornate russian psychological operation , consider the long trend arch .
the us along with its generous gulf sidekicks , have already established a solid track record of aiding and abetting isis not just in syria , but in iraq too.the record shows that the us is guilty on a number of counts if the mosul leak is true , then it wouldn t be the first time that the us has provided cover in the military pantomime the world has come to know as the fight against isis .
when large isis convoys crossed the syrian desert to invade and occupy the ancient syrian city of palmyra in may 2015 , the us coalition airforce did nothing , and allowed isis to take and destroy part of the world s great historic cultural heritage , along with the murder of scores of innocent civilians.professor tim anderson from sydney university states : u.s. weapons with israeli ammunition were used by islamic state group when taking over palmyra .
the extremists also had u.s. military rations .
the u.s. , which since 2014 claimed to be conducting a war against isis in iraq and syria , and which had air power and sophisticated surveillance of the region , did nothing to stop the huge isis advance on palmyra .
the us isn t even shy about its laissez-faire policy with isis in the field , with the new york times openly boasting , any airstrikes against islamic state militants in and around palmyra would probably benefit the forces of president bashar al-assad .
so far , united states-led airstrikes in syria have largely focused on areas far outside government control , to avoid the perception of aiding a leader whose ouster president obama has called for .
following the derelict incident , new york times reporters hwaida saad and kareem fahim , were still kicking and screaming for regime change like petulant children at the news of isis fleeing and palmyra being liberated by the syrian army and russians .
they said that , mr. assad s contention that his government is a bulwark against the transnational extremist group has been bolstered , but added that his foes and some allies argue that he must leave power as part of a political settlement to end the war in syria .
in other words : we still want regime change !
this says volumes about who is really enforcing new york times editorial lines ( either the us state dept , or the cia , take your pick ) .more importantly however , is what kind of message an us statement like that sends to isis , as well as al nusra and other terrorist brigades inside syria , which is basically , we do not need to worry about us air strikes , only syrian army and russian strikes .
this situation really sums up the utter fraud and contempt of the us deception in syria , and it s no surprise that the russian foreign ministry are reticent to extend themselves any more where the us is concerned.then , in march 2016 , when isis fled palmyra , back across the desert towards deir ez-zor and raqqa the great and powerful us coalition airforce actually helped isis in a number of ways , including allowing them free passage once more.in late august , we were told that the turkish army , alongside allied syrian rebels ( terrorist group faylaq al-sham ) backed by the us air cover , invaded syria in order to capture the isis-held town of jarabulus , syria , this supposedly to cut off isis s last open route into turkey .
but what happened to isis ? the nyt even admitted that , it appeared that most of the militants had fled without a fight .
here , isis appears to have been given advanced warning by either us or turkish intelligence , as they left the contested town of jarabulus quietly , but in droves .
in reality , turkey twisted this operation in order to attack and degrade kurdish militias including the us-backed artificial construct called the syrian democratic forces ( sdf ) , and pro-kurdish people s protection units ( ypg ) and kurdish democratic union party ( pyd ) , the syrian affiliate of the militant kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) in iraq and turkey all of whom are meant to be fighting isis .
instead , they are now busy dodging turkish artillery rounds .
confusing , yes , but true nonetheless.it s also common knowledge now , that top of the line us weaponry is being used by isis , both in iraq , in afghanistan and in syria as well .
in fact , if not for us weapons and supplies ( along with us air intervention , or noninterventions ) , isis would have struggled to maintain many of the strategic positions it enjoys today .
for the last 3 years , us officials have been dodging this issue , and when they do admit this is true , their patronizing party line is that , this must be a mistake , if they do have us weapons , we didn t mean it .
as if the world was born yesterday.perhaps the most flagrant violation by the us-led forces in aiding and abetting isis took place on sept 17 , 2016 , when the us-led coalition bombed syrian army positions outside of deir ez-zor near al-tharda mountain , killing some 80 soldiers and injuring 100 more .
as if by design , an isis offensive began immediately following the us massacre of syrian soldiers .
clearly , this bold move by the pentagon paved the way for a major isis advance.to any normal observer , the us attack was a belligerent act of war that effective destroyed an already fragile bilateral ceasefire agreement , and yet the us response was to somehow blame russia for calling an emergency unsc meeting to discuss the incident .
judging by this response , it s pretty clear that us wants to see the syrian conflict carry on for a while , and it will need groups like isis to make that happen .
the other problem with washington s hollow righteousness in the middle east is that there are key members of the us-led coalition who are financing isis , al nusra front , nour al din zinki , and arar al sham ( all moderate terrorists we re told ) militants in syria , iraq and beyond .
this fact was recently admitted by former us secretary of state and democratic candidate hillary clinton , as revealed in this week s batch of wikileaks emails .
clinton writes : while this military/para-military operation is moving forward , we need to use our diplomatic and more traditional intelligence assets to bring pressure on the governments of qatar and saudi arabia , which are providing clandestine financial and logistic support to isil and other radical sunni groups in the region .
add to that the multiple exposures over the last 3 years of the us cia illegally trafficking lethal arms to al nusra and other terrorists through covert operations like timber sycamore.still , us and nato member state officials and their media gatekeepers continue to deny it and play dumb , rather than come clean that the united states and its partners in the region are helping , not hindering isis terrorism.some might ask : why would they do a thing like that ?
by now , the answer should be simple , but threefold : what s so comical yet even more tragic , is how prominent the topic of isis factors into all of the vapid national security debates and media panels in this year s us presidential election , and in the dumbed-down coverage of the delusional us mainstream media , led by pentagon surrogate cnn , and hopeless fox news .
judging by their prosaic coverage , neither the networks , nor hillary clinton or donald trump have the slightest clue of what the reality on the ground is .
instead we here , my isis plan is better than yours !
the us political conversation has gone beyond ridiculousness.the corps of us military and cia media spokesman aren t much better .
the sad part is some of them do know what is really happening , but would rather lie to the american public.with so much double dealing , who can you trust ?
certainly not anyone in washington.more on the white house s latest dangerous proposition .rtthe us and saudi arabia have agreed to grant free passage to thousands of islamic state militants before the iraqi city of mosul is stormed .
the jihadists will be redeployed to fight against the government in syria , a military-diplomatic source told ria novosti .
more than 9,000 islamic state ( is , formerly isis , isil ) militants will be redeployed from mosul to the eastern regions of syria to carry out a major offensive operation , which involves capturing deir ez-zor and palmyra , the source said.according to the anonymous diplomatic source , us president barack obama has already sanctioned an operation to liberate mosul , due to take place in october.during the storm of the city in northern iraq the us-led coalition s planes would only strike detached , vacated or uninhabited buildings , while keeping terrorists as targets , he said.in september , us secretary of defense ashton carter confirmed that washington would send an additional 600 troops to iraq to help liberate mosul at the request of the local authorities.the source suggested that redeployment of is militants is necessary because washington must somehow counter russia s achievements in syria , try to diminish their importance .
apart from the purely political dividends , the other purpose of this operation , obviously , will be to discredit the success of russian airspace forces .
and , of course , it s an attempt to undermine syrian president ( bashar ) assad , he said.the leadership of saudi arabia s general intelligence directorate will be the mediators and guarantors of the agreement on safe passage for the jihadists from mosul , he claimed.the source added that a similar scheme had been used by the us and its allies during the liberation of the iraqi city of fallujah continue this story at rtread more syria news : 21st century wire syria filessupport our work by subscribing & becoming a member @ 21wire.tv
