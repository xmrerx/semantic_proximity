It s not just Canada that Donald Trump seems to be starting unnecessary battles with today, Mexico has responded to his continued persistence of the border wall.In fact, Mexico is now considering Trump s insistence of the wall, and the lie that Mexico will pay for it, a hostile act.According to Reuters Politics: JUST IN: Mexican foreign minister says Mexico considers construction of border wall a hostile act, will not contribute in any way JUST IN: Mexican foreign minister says Mexico considers construction of border wall a 'hostile' act, will not contribute in any way Reuters Politics (@ReutersPolitics) April 25, 2017This comes shortly after Trump recommitted his efforts to build the wall.According to the New York Times: President Trump insisted on Tuesday that he remained committed to his hotly disputed plan to build a wall along the Mexican border, despite backing off a demand that the project be funded in a short-term spending measure that must be passed by Friday to avoid a government shutdown.
Trump has also tweeted this over the past few days:Eventually, but at a later date so we can get started early, Mexico will be paying, in some form, for the badly needed border wall.

If Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 24, 2017 .the wall is not built, which it will be, the drug situation will NEVER be fixed the way it should be!#BuildTheWall Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 24, 2017Don't let the fake media tell you that I have changed my position on the WALL.
It will get built and help stop drugs, human trafficking etc.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 25, 2017With Trump clearly not backing down off his inflammatory rhetoric surrounding the border wall, it has left Mexico needing to respond.
The fact that they are calling Trump hostile isn t only terrible, but dangerous.
They seem to be seeing Trump as a foe rather than a trusted ally.Trump s isolationist actions aren t only harmful to the United States and our closest allies, but to geopolitics as a whole.Featured Photo via Getty Images
