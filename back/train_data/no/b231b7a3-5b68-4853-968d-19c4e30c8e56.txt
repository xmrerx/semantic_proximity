sprinting towards a likely win in new york s republican primary , donald trump made the kind of flub about the september 11th terrorist attacks that would cause heartache for most other campaigns but is sort of what we ve now come to expect from the reality tv star turned presidential frontrunner.appearing at a campaign event in buffalo , ny , trump referred to the 9/11 attacks as 7/11 .
donald trump , who has made his advocacy for new york city after the 9/11 attacks central to his candidacy , accidentally referred to it on monday as 7/11 the ubiquitous convenience store .
i wrote this out , and it s very close to my heart , he said at the outset of his remarks on buffalo on monday evening .
because i was down there and i watched our police and our firemen down at 7/11 , down at the world trade center right after it came down .
and i saw the greatest people i ve ever seen in action .
this weird flub of course comes from the candidate who has claimed that he has a photographic memory and bragged a few months ago that he had the best words : i m telling you , i used to use the word incompetent .
now i just call them stupid .
i went to an ivy league school .
i m very highly educated .
i know words , i have the best words but there is no better word than stupid .
right ? but trump s respect for what happened on 9/11 has always been about an inch thick , despite his long time association with new york city.a conservative anti-trump pac aired an ad showing that trump exploited a loophole in the law to access $ 150,000 in funds targeted towards small businesses who had suffered due to the attacks , even though as he has gone on about at length trump has hundreds of millions of dollars at his disposal , along with businesses ( well the ones who haven t gone bankrupt ) generating considerable income.featured image via youtube
