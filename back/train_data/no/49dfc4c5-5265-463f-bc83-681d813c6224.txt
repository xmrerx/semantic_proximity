astana ( reuters ) - the next round of talks between russia , turkey and iran on settling the syrian civil conflict will take place in kazakhstan on sept. 14-15 and focus on forces that the three nations plan to deploy there , the kazakh foreign ministry said on friday .
kazakhstan hosts the talks which have in the past few months focused on establishing de-escalation zones in syria .
according to the information from the guarantor states , during the upcoming meeting they plan to review several documents covering the work of de-escalation control forces , and continue work on agreeing the make-up of control forces in idlib , the ministry said in a statement .
moscow , ankara and tehran plan to map out de-escalation zones in idlib , homs and eastern ghouta , and discuss other matters such as prisoner exchange , it said .
at the most recent astana meeting , in july , the three nations failed to finalize an agreement on creating four de-escalation zones in syria after ankara raised objections .
the talks , which began in january , have so far produced no breakthrough .
some western diplomats have described them as russia s attempt to hijack u.n.-led peace talks in geneva involving the government and opposition .
