Throughout Donald Trump s entire campaign cycle, many conservatives have spoken out against the business mogul/reality television star and expressed their opposition to his candidacy.
However, now that his competition is out of the race and Trump is the Republican party s presumptive nominee, right-wingers are desperately seeking a way to make sure Trump doesn t further ruin America.
For many of them, this means supporting Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton by any means possible.On CBS Face The Nation, Clinton revealed that over the past few days basically ever since it became clear that Trump will likely be representing the GOP in the general election she s been getting a lot of Republicans asking to help her campaign.
Many of these conservatives are passionate #NeverTrump voters who would rather abandon their party and vote blue in the election than vote one of the most terrible people in the United States into the White House.During the interview, John Dickerson asked Clinton how she plans to handle conservatives who are still skeptical, but embracing the idea of voting for her.Clinton simply replied that she is not only more than qualified to be the next President, but has a track record of getting results.
The former Secretary of State said: I am asking people to join this campaign and I ve had a lot of outreach from Republicans in the last days who say they are interested in talking about that.
You can watch the interview below:The speed at which Trump has pulled the Republican party apart is impressive to say the least.
We could have predicted that some conservatives would be jumping ship by the party s reaction when Trump was first announced as the party s presumptive nominee.
The sheer rage from conservatives was priceless many of them not only burned, tore up or destroyed their voter registrations cards by other measures, but many changed their party entirely.
So while Trump has risen amongst his own supporters for being more vulgar and offensive than ever, he is only helping to unify the rest of the country against him.Featured image via Justin Sullivan / Getty Images
