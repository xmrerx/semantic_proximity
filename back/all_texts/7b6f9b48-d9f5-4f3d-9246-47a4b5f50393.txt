These people are sick and evil.
They will stop at NOTHING to get their way.
Laws mean nothing to them, because they mean nothing to their President and his regime A California man says a stranger hurled expletives and set his truck on fire Thursday after seeing a pro-Donald Trump sticker on the bumper.Hao Lee had taken his 2-year-old son fishing on a pleasant November afternoon in Sacramento.
He parked his white Dodge Ram truck with a pair of Trump stickers on the bumper along Garden Highway.
About a couple hours into fishing I heard someone yelling out F Trump, Lee told KTXL.Lee and his son were only about 50 yards from where his truck was parked, near the edge of the river.Their peaceful fishing trip was about to take an abrupt and scary turn.
After that I heard glass breaking, I called 911 and a couple of minutes later I saw smoke, he said.Lee said his first concern was the safety of his son, so he decided to stay put, near the water.
When the voices and commotion were gone, Lee approached his truck.
But it was too late.
Flames were shooting out the windows.
The truck was a complete loss.
I didn t think anyone would do this kind of stuff over bumper stickers.
It s not right, he said.
