dubai ( reuters ) - king salman has appointed or promoted 56 judges , saudi arabia s state news agency spa reported on thursday , a step coinciding with an anti-corruption crackdown in the kingdom .
the king issued a royal order that promoted 26 judges and appointed 30 others at different levels of the judiciary , spa said .
saudi authorities have arrested dozens of royal family members , officials and businessmen in the anti-graft purge that began on saturday .
they face allegations of money laundering , bribery , extortion and exploiting public office for personal gain .
it was unclear if the judges will have any role in the widening crackdown .
regulators in the united arab emirates have asked banks for information about citizens detained in the investigation , a possible prelude to freezing their accounts .
saudi arabia has announced it will confiscate assets improperly acquired , and while riyadh has set no timetable for any such confiscations , banking sources say more than 1,700 domestic bank accounts have already been frozen at the request of the central bank .
huge amounts of money may be at stake .
corruption has over the years siphoned off $ 800 billion from saudi state revenues and bankers believe much of it is held abroad , in countries including switzerland and britain .
