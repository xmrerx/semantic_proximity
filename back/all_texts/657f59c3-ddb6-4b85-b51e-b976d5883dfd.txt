HYSTERICAL!A US Marine enters the Catholic Church confessional booth in Jacksonville, FL.He tells the priest, Bless me, Father, for I have sinned.
Last night, I beat the s**t out of a flag burning Hillary supporter.
The priest says, My son, I am here to forgive your sins, not to discuss your community service.
