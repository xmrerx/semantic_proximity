today we were excited to have @ flotus visit our girls group home in lake worth.thank you for taking the time to listen & talk with the girls pic.twitter.com/v0oqecxqda homesafe ( @ homesafefla ) april 14 , 2017here is an excerpt from the homesafefl press release : home safe s description of their agency on twitter : homesafe is preparing children and families for safer , more productive lives through child abuse and domestic violence prevention and intervention programs.the media s decision to ignore this story only proves they really don t care much about the plight of women or of young girls , what they care about is destroying the enemy .
the media s transparent hate for anything trump has forced them to show their cards , and as a result the mainstream media will likely never be trusted again by americans who once bought everything they were being told hook , line and sinker .
