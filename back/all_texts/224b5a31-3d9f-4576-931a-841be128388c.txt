Oops!
Hillary and her race-baiting campaign team are NOT going to want the Black community to see this video Donald Trump doesn t want to give the Black and minority communities a hand-out he wants to give them self-respecting JOBS.
He wants to see every American reach their full potential regardless of the color of their skin.
This is a concept so foreign to the Democrat Party that the only response they re able to come up with is falsely accusing Trump of being a racist and hoping it sticks.
For decades, the Democrats have been able to get away with falsely labeling Republicans But Donald Trump is NOT your average Republican, and he s about to bring down the Democrats false narrative like a house of cards.Enjoy:https://youtu.be/7U6Pp5iflTs
