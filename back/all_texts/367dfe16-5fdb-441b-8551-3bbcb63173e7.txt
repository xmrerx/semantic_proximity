We now have verifiable proof that it is true.Well, well, well.. now verifiable proof has surfaced that Comey drafted Hillary's exoneration letter 2 months prior to his public statement.

Disturbing indeed!Grassley and the Senate Judiciary sent a letter of concern after reviewing transcripts that were heavily redacted.
This stinks to high heaven!
More lawlessness from the Obama administration and the Clinton grifters COMEY CONCLUDED EARLYThe Judiciary Committee reviewed transcripts, which were heavily redacted, indicating Comey began drafting the exoneration statement in April or May 2016, before the FBI interviewed up to 17 key witnesses, including Clinton and some of her close aides.PART OF THE STATEMENT (SEE BELOW) FROM THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE:Comey s work on the statement also came before the Justice Department entered into immunity agreements with Cheryl Mills, Clinton s chief of staff while she was Secretary of State, and Heather Samuelson, who served as the State Department s White House liaison.Comey announced in July 2016 the FBI wouldn t recommend criminal charges against Clinton.Democrats in Congress alleged last fall that Comey s actions in the FBI s investigation into Clinton s email use violated the Hatch Act, which caused the Office of Special Counsel to launch an investigation.
