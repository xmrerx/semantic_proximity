Democrats stood up for the American people but Republicans shouted them down and voted to strip health care from millions.Senate Republicans voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, in the middle of the night early Thursday morning.Even though Republicans don t have any plan to replace it with, they used budget reconciliation rules to prevent Democrats from blocking the vote and took the first step toward ending critical patient and consumer protections Americans have been enjoying for a few years since the Affordable Care Act went into effect, including protections for women, young people, and people with pre-existing conditions.During the roll call vote, Democrats stood up one by one when called to voice their strenuous objections, only to be shouted down by Republicans.Senator Elizabeth Warren can be heard trying to deliver an emotional defense of the landmark healthcare law, but Republicans disrespected her and others by repeatedly declaring them to be out of order.Republicans went on to pass the budget resolution by a simple majority vote.
And they did it in the most cowardly way possible in order to keep Americans in the dark about what they just did.Here s the video via Twitter.Al Franken, Elizabeth Warren among the parade of Democrats drowned out when defending Obamacare.

People are going to die because of them and their hatred.
And that should end all of their careers once and for all.
Just remember, folks, if your family members and friends die because they don t have insurance, Republicans are to blame.
Because while President Obama s health care law was not perfect, at least it did not kill people.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images
