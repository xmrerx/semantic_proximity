washington ( reuters ) - u.s. air force b-1b lancer bombers escorted by fighter jets flew in international airspace over waters east of north korea on saturday , in a show of force the pentagon said demonstrated the range of military options available to president donald trump .
the flight , which was disclosed shortly before north korea s foreign minister was due to address the united nations , was the farthest north of the demilitarized zone separating north and south korea that any u.s. fighter jet or bomber has flown in the 21st century , the pentagon said .
this mission is a demonstration of u.s. resolve and a clear message that the president has many military options to defeat any threat , said pentagon spokeswoman dana white , calling north korea s weapons program a grave threat .
we are prepared to use the full range of military capabilities to defend the u.s. homeland and our allies .
the flight follows a week of heightened rhetoric from washington and pyongyang , with trump and kim jong un trading insults .
trump called the north korean leader a madman on friday , a day after kim dubbed him a mentally deranged u.s. dotard .
pyongyang conducted its sixth and largest nuclear test on sept. 3 and has launched dozens of missiles this year as it accelerates a program aimed at enabling it to target the united states with a nuclear-tipped missile .
the north has threatened to test a hydrogen bomb over the pacific .
the pentagon said the b-1b lancer bombers came from guam and the u.s. air force f-15c eagle fighter escorts came from okinawa , japan .
it said the operation showed the seriousness with which it took north korea s reckless behavior .
