Just when you thought Donald Trump s constant stream of offensive comments had died down, he goes and calls for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton to be shot.Trump s specific advice to his followers was, in the event that Clinton wins the election and can choose her own liberal Supreme Court Justices, that they should perhaps shoot her: Hillary wants to abolish essentially abolish the Second Amendment.
If she gets to pick her judges, nothing you can do folks.
Though the second amendment folks, maybe there is If a citizen had made a death threat like this against a government official, they would receive criminal charges and Trump should be no different.
Soon after those shocking words left Trump s mouth, the former head of the CIA went on CNN to drive the point home that Trump should not be given a free pass on this.In an interview with Jack Tapper, retired four-star general Michael Hayden made it perfectly clear that if anyone else had said this about the Second Amendment, they d be in hot water.
Hayden said: If someone else had said that outside the hall, he d be in the back of a police wagon now with the Secret Service questioning him.
Hayden recalled the advice that he used to give his seniors at the CIA: You re not just responsible for what you say.
You are responsible for what people hear.
Then, he tore Trump a new one: That was more than a speed bump.
That is actually a very arresting comment.

That is a topic that we don t ever come close to, even when we think we are trying to be lighthearted.
