Here s a question for the anti-Trump media: If Putin and Trump have such a strong history of working together, why take such drastic actions against the US?
Why doesn t Putin just pick up the phone and call his old buddy Donald Trump and get those sanctions lifted?
Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Sunday that 755 US diplomats must leave the country by Sept. 1.Putin s order comes after a threat he issued on Friday about slashing US diplomatic staff in Russia and seizing two American properties in retaliation after Congress approved a vote to slap new sanctions over Moscow s interference in the 2016 presidential election.Remember when President Trump used Twitter to mock the media for suggesting Putin wanted to see Trump elected over the very weak Hillary Clinton?In other words, Russia was against Trump in the 2016 Election and why not, I want strong military & low oil prices.
Witch Hunt!

We waited for quite some time that maybe something will change for the better, had such hope that the situation will somehow change, but judging by everything, if it changes, it will not be soon, Putin said in a television interview with the Rossiya 1 network, according to Interfax news agency.
