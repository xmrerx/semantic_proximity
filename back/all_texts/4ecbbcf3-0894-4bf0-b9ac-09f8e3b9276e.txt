From the ABC News report:Hillary Clinton Will Hold Press Conferences as President, Press Secretary VowsIt s been 272 days since Hillary Clinton s last press conference.
But Clinton s lead press secretary, Brian Fallon, vowed that if elected, Hillary Clinton will hold press conferences.
But the frequency of them is something that would just play out as time went on, he added.On this week s Powerhouse Politics podcast, Fallon promised greater interaction between Clinton and the press on the campaign trail and said he expects the Democratic nominee to hold a press conference soon.
The amount of interaction can only go up, he said, noting that the traveling press will soon be flying with Clinton on her new campaign plane.
I m sure that will bring with it a lot of opportunities for additional access to the candidate and interactions between her and the traveling press corps that covers her every day, Fallon told ABC News chief White House correspondent Jonathan Karl, and political director Rick Klein on the podcast.
We are very respectful of the press and the job that they have to do, Fallon continued.
We have done a lot of interviews, but I know that no matter how many questions we answer in a variety of formats, it is the press s job to always demand more access.
We respect that, and so we re going to seek further ways to accommodate that in the remaining months of the campaign.
