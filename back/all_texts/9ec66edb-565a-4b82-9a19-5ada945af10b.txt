WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trumpâ€™s top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, said on Tuesday that the White House and congressional Republicans are working to get a tax reform bill to the floor of Congress during the first two weeks of September.
Speaking to a group of executives from the technology sector at the White House, Cohn said Republicans do not want to negotiate the tax bill on the floor, but instead will work out a deal beforehand.
