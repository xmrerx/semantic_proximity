MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin is following the situation in Ukraine s rebel-controlled Luhansk region, where there is a standoff between the head of the rebel administration and a sacked police chief, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Wednesday.
Peskov said he was not ready to disclose the Kremlin s views on what was happening in Luhansk, where armed men were on Tuesday blocking access to the centre of the regional capital.
