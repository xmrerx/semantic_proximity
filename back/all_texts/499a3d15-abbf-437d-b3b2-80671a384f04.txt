Greg Gutfeld scored a priceless TV moment during The Five .
He mocked the CNN box-wearing trend that started with the WWE mocked-up wrestling video where President Trump was wrestling with the CNN logo (see below).
@greggutfeld IS THE BEST EVER.
OPENS @TheFive WITH A @CNN BOX ON HIS HEAD!!!
HE S A SAVAGE!!!
BLESS YOU GREGG.
