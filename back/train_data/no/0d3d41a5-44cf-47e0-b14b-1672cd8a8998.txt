copenhagen ( reuters ) - prime minister lars lokke rasmussen s liberal party suffered losses in denmark s local elections , a possible bellwether for the next national election , which is to be held no later than mid-2019 .
the center-right liberal party received 23.1 percent of the votes in tuesday s election , 3.5 percentage points less than in 2013 .
the social democrats gained 3 percentage points to 32.5 percent .
the social democrats won the leadership of four of denmark s five regions , and in at least 40 of the 98 municipalities , including the four largest cities .
coalition talks are still ongoing in some municipalities .
the results are seen as a boost for mette frederiksen who took over the social democratic leadership after former prime minister helle thorning-schmidt failed to extend her rule at the 2015 national election .
the danes have said that it is more important to take good care of our welfare , rather than to get tax cuts , social democrat spokesman nicolai wammen said , alluding to the government s plans to cut taxes next year .
rasmussen was relatively satisfied with the result , he told broadcaster tv2 .
a spokesman for his party said the election results were mainly driven by local agendas rather than national level politics .
the support for government ally danish people s party fell 1.3 percentage points to 8.8 percent , contrary to some predictions ahead of the elections .
