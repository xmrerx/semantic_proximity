Biden said Trump s taunting of the judge was a direct threat to defy the court if he were elected president, and a clear sign of a tyrannical mindset proving Trump cannot be trusted to respect the independence of the Judiciary as a president.

It is the strongest condemnation to come from the executive branch on Trump s behavior.Biden also pointed out that despite Republicans condemning Trump, they are still holding up the nomination of Merrick Garland for the Supreme Court seat vacated after the death of Antonin Scalia.
Biden specifically mentioned that even the Republicans who admitted Trump was being racist are still working on behalf of him being the one to choose the next justice.The remarks come on a day of major Democratic unity, as President Obama announced that he was endorsing Hillary Clinton and would begin campaigning with her.
Sen. Elizabeth Warren said she would endorse Clinton and Governor Martin O Malley also announced that he would back the former Secretary of State.
While Sen. Bernie Sanders did not yet concede the nomination, he met with President Obama and said he had spoken with Secretary Clinton and would be working with her to stop Trump s quest to be elected president.Featured image via Twitter
