conservative actor rob lowe has somehow managed to continue working in an industry ruled by radical leftist activists who are notorious for punishing anyone with an opposing view .
we commend lowe for taking a stand on 9-11 against these multi-millionaire athletes who feel the need to disrespect our national anthem as a way to protest their oppression and disdain for our law enforcement officers .
rob lowe had a request for the nfl on saturday night concerning the recent protests by some players over the national anthem.during the preseason , san francisco 49ers backup quarterback colin kaepernick refused to stand for the national anthem before games in which his team played , saying his actions were a protest against the oppression of minorities in america .
i am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color , kaepernick told reporters .
his protest relates to videos showing unarmed african-americans around the country being fatally shot by white police officers.kaepernick s jersey has since become the best-selling in the nfl , which has been attributed to both supporters of his cause and those he has upset , some of whom have shared videos burning the jersey .
via hollywood reporterhere s lowe s tweet and how responded to his critics : dear @ nfl any player wants to boycott the anthem on 9/11 should be asked to remain in the locker room until kick off .
it 's not their moment .
rob lowe ( @ roblowe ) september 11 , 2016one follower told lowe he didn t have to like what kaepernick was doing , but it is his right to not stand.other leftists on twitter replied in the manner in which you would expect : us troops who defend & respect our flag were fighting tonight & they wo n't all live through it # oppressedmillionaires 100 % fed up !
( @ 100percfedup ) september 14 , 2016this is incredibly stupid and lacks analysis .
just like a white man .
