yangon ( reuters ) - one person was killed on thursday in a massive fire that destroyed one of yangon s best-known hotels , sending dark smoke billowing over the center of myanmar s largest city and triggering an hours-long battle to put out the flames .
it was not immediately clear what caused the fire , which broke out around 3:20 a.m. at the teak-and-stone kandawgyi palace hotel overlooking a picturesque inner-city lake , authorities told reuters .
an unidentified body was found in a guest room and two people were injured , said htay lwin , a spokesman of hotel owner htoo group .
authorities were investigating the cause of the fire and the cost of the damage was not immediately clear , he added .
the fire had been mostly extinguished by 7 a.m. , and more than 140 guests were shifted to nearby hotels .
htoo group is chaired by business tycoon tay za , who , until last year , was on the list of united states sanctions for his close links to myanmar s former military regime .
myanmar s civilian-led government , helmed by nobel laureate and former dissident aung san suu kyi , is grappling with the aftermath of a harsh military crackdown that has driven out more than 500,000 of the country s rohingya muslim minority .
