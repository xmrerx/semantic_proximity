Are they kidding?
This was even a lead story on FOX News tonight!
A former Trump adviser made a very general comment against Hillary Clinton and the Secret Service jumped all over him.
You WILL NOT believe what he said!
He stated that, Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason Does that sound like a credible threat to you?
No, that s total BS!
The things that have been said against Trump are unbelievable and yet nothing happens to those who threaten violence that s much more specific than Mr. Baldasaro s statement.
Might we also mention Farrakhan who s constantly spewing hate speech and violent threats.
The Secret Service is investigating a Donald Trump adviser who said in a radio interview that presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton should be shot for treason on a firing line.
Al Baldasaro, a New Hampshire representative who serves on Trump s veterans coalition and as a Trump delegate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, said in an interview with a Boston talk radio host that Clinton should pay for the 2012 Benghazi attack.
She is a disgrace for any, the lies she told those mothers about their children that got killed over there in Benghazi, he said on the Jeff Kuhner Show Tuesday.
She dropped the ball on over 400 emails requesting back up security.
Something s wrong there.
