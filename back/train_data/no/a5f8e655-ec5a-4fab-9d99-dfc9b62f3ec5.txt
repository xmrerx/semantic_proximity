amsterdam ( reuters ) - the netherlands will hold a referendum on legislation giving law enforcement authorities far-reaching surveillance powers , the dutch voting commission said on wednesday .
a range of activists , politicians and media groups want to overturn the tapping law , which was passed by parliament in july and allows agencies to gather data covertly from large groups of people at once .
dutch law obliges the government to hold a non-binding referendum if a petition with at least 300,000 signatures is submitted to the voting commission .
the agency said it had received more than 384,000 valid signatures and that the referendum would be held on march 21 together with municipal elections .
opponents argue that innocent civilians will be dragged into the sights of intelligence agencies , while the government says the powers are needed to counter national security threats .
the referendum law is itself controversial and may be repealed by the newly appointed right-of-centre government under prime minister mark rutte .
after it was passed in 2015 , a referendum was used to block the dutch government from ratifying an economic treaty it and other european union countries had negotiated with ukraine .
a large no vote on the referendum embarrassed the hague and forced rutte to seek minor amendments to the treaty with the other eu states , eventually leading to the dutch ratifying it .
it later emerged that the signatures to hold the ukraine referendum were gathered via the internet and never vetted .
