Obama didn t appear to be very pleased when CNN ally, Jim Acosta confronted him on his feckless role as Commander In Chief an international stage during the G2 Summit.
Acosta first mocked him about his reference to ISIS as Jayvee Team then lobbed some friendly fire: Why can t we take out these bastards?
Obama s answer is arrogant, condescending and makes no sense whatsoever.
His behavior is so predictable and completely unbecoming as the leader of our nation.
This is exactly what we ve come to expect however, from this dangerous Commander in Chief.
