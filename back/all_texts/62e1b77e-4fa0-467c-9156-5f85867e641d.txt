What could Hillary be saying that s so top secret she doesn t want us to hear.
The people at the fundraiser had to pay a whopping $27,000 to hear this top secret info that the regular folk like you and me don t get to hear.
Aaaahhhh, a woman of the people who s just like us Hillary Clinton s campaign team reportedly used a static noise machine on Thursday to block reporters outside of a fundraiser in Denver from hearing her remarks.That s according to Stan Bush, a reporter for Denver s CBS-4, who was stationed outside of the event, which was held outdoors at the home of Colorado Gov.
John Hickenlooper, a superdelegate who has endorsed Clinton.Bush said that the noise interference machine was turned on after a band later identified as Big Head Todd and the Monsters finished playing music and before Clinton spoke.
The device was placed inside of a fence on the property and aimed in the direction of the press, Bush wrote.
He posted video showing what it sounded like outside of the event before and after the machine was turned on.
The device produced a low-intensity throbbing noise, much like a helicopter off in the distance.Read more: Daily Caller
