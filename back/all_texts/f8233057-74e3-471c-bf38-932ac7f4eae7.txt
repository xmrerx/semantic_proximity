There aren t too many stories that are more shameful or disturbing than this one.
What has been done to fix the horrible quality of care our veterans have been receiving during Obama s eight years in office?
What would the VA look like today if Obama spent as much time trying to fix this broken health care system for our veterans as he spent trying to improve his golf swing or organizing with Black Lives Matter terrorists?
If anyone thinks Hillary would do a better job with our vets and their health care, they only need to do is look at Benghazi to see how much she cares about members of our US Military.
