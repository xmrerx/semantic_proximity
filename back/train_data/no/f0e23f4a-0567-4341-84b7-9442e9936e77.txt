watch the video and you be the judge .
was piers morgan correct or was he out of line ? piers morgan poked the hornets nest sunday when he highlighted a double standard among muhammad ali s fans that the late boxer espoused more radical views on race than donald trump.muhammad ali said far more inflammatory/racist things about white people than donald trump ever has about muslims .
# fact piers morgan ( @ piersmorgan ) june 5 , 2016the tweet quickly brought a swarm of social justice outrage , but morgan did not back down .
he argued that ali was an important voice in the civil rights movement , but that is no reason to whitewash statements far more radical than trump s on race and immigration .

he did .
piers morgan ( @ piersmorgan ) june 5 , 2016piers morgan shared this clearly racist interview with muhammad ali on twitter to back up his claim : along the way , piers picked up a few twitter users who were willing to tell the truth about boxing legend ali : https : //twitter.com/nordicimports/status/739845621289517056honesty is the new `` being racist '' fyi michael ( @ socalmike_sd ) june 6 , 2016in the end , piers morgan knew he could never walk into another room filled with liberal crybabies if he didn t do the obligatory leftist , even though i m correct here is my apology : i 'm sorry for 'saying inflammatory things for attention'.that 's the last thing muhammad ali would have condoned .
