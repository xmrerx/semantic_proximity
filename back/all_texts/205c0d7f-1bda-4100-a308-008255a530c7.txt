If you haven t heard by now, gospel singer Kim Burrell, featured with Pharrell Williams, decided to go on a homophobic rant.Burrell spoke of the perverted homosexual spirit, and then just tried to walk it back by calling LGBT individuals sinners.
Well, slated to appear on the Ellen DeGeneres show with Williams, many were wondering if she would still be on the show after these hateful remarks, and it looks like we have our answer.Ellen tweeted out: For those asking, Kim Burrell will not be appearing on my show.
For those asking, Kim Burrell will not be appearing on my show.
Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) January 3, 2017And that answers that question.
Good on Ellen for standing up against hatred wherever it stands.It looks like Pharrell Williams is also taking a stand against the hateful remarks because he tweeted this out:pic.twitter.com/d8jGbP4TOD Pharrell Williams (@Pharrell) December 31, 2016The fact that Burrell said, I make no excuses or apologies.
My love is as pure as it comes, is about as hateful and hypocritical as it comes.Thankfully, people aren t standing by her remarks, nor allowing her to proceed with appearances.
Hate can not be rewarded, and hopefully, Burrell gets that message sooner rather than later.With a new administration filled with hate entering the Oval Office, we, as a people, now more than ever, need to make sure hatred is not allowed to take hold.Featured Photo by Jason Kempin via Getty Images
