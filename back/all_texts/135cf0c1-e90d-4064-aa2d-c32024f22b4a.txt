Conservative commentator and devout Trump lover Ann Coulter let her bigotry all hang out on Monday when she attacked Khizr Khan, the father of a slain American soldier, calling him a snarling Muslim.
During an appearance on Sky News Australia s The Bolt Report, Coulter attacked the father of Humayun Khan, who gave his life fighting for the United States in Iraq.
His heroism saved the lives of the men serving by his side.But conservatives like Coulter could care less and have sought to crucify the grieving father ever since his speech at the Democratic National Convention.
During his fiery DNC speech, Khan blasted Donald Trump for the blackness of his character.
He then asked if the GOP nominee if he had ever even bothered to read the Constitution and offered to lend the bigoted billionaire his copy.Australian commentator Andrew Bolt, host of the show, told Coulter that he thought it was wrong for anyone, including Donald Trump, to viciously go after the parents of a soldier who died in battle.
At this point, Coulter complained about the media s endless attack on Trump and then went full-on bigot, calling Khizr Khan a snarling Muslim.
I don t know America very well if they want to listen to a snarling Muslim lecture them and tell us we re not allowed to have opinions on important public policy issues unless we had a son die in Iraq, she said.Watch Ann Coulter flaunt her bigotry here:.
@AnnCoulter says Americans don't want a 'snarling Muslim' to lecture them.
