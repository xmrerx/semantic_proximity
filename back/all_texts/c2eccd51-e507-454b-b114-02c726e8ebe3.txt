Hillary Clinton has revealed the person she would love to appoint to the U.S. Supreme Court if she becomes president in 2016 is none other than current President Barack Obama.The prospect of a Justice Obama reared it s head during a campaign event in Deocorah, Iowa on Tuesday.
A voter asked Mrs. Clinton is she would consider appointing Obama to SCOTUS if she were made President, and it put a huge smile on her face.
She told the 450-strong crowd: Wow what a great idea I love that!
Wow!
Adding later, I mean, he s brilliant, and he can set forth an argument, and he was a law professor.
So he has all the credentials.
Now we do have to get a Democratic Senate to get him confirmed so you re going to have to help me on that, OK?
This isn t the first time that a future place on the Supreme Court for Mr. Obama has been raised.
Sadly, he was a little cold on the idea, put to him by The New Yorker in 2014: I love the law, intellectually, he said at the time.
I love nutting out these problems, wrestling with these arguments.
I love teaching.
I miss the classroom and engaging with students.
But I think being a Justice is a little bit too monastic for me.
Particularly after having spent six years and what will be eight years in this bubble, I think I need to get outside a little bit more.
But who knows?
Once he s had a chance to get some quality time with the Obama women, played a lot of golf, and wound down from the presidency that hunger that drove him to the White House might propel Obama onto the Supreme Court.What is certain is that the prospect of Justice Obama is going to strike fear into the heart of every gun-loving, woman-hating, gay-bashing, conservative in the country.
