CAIRO (Reuters) - Arab foreign ministers on Sunday urged the United States to abandon its decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital, saying the move would increase violence throughout the region.
The announcement by President Donald Trump on Wednesday was a dangerous violation of international law and had no legal impact, the Arab League said in a statement after several hours of meetings attended by all its members in Cairo.
