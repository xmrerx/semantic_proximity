Donald Trump is attacking Obamacare instead of the greedy insurance companies who are jacking up the price of coverage, and he got a severe beat down for it.Trump has been talking about repealing Obamacare throughout his campaign and he continued to do so on Twitter Tuesday morning by blaming the program itself for the price increase of insurance premiums.People must remember that ObamaCare just doesn t work, and it is not affordable 116% increases (Arizona).
Bill Clinton called it CRAZY Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017He then took a statement made by Minnesota Governor Mark Dayton out of context and calling Obamacare lousy healthcare.
The Democrat Governor.of Minnesota said The Affordable Care Act (ObamaCare) is no longer affordable!
And, it is lousy healthcare.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 3, 2017But Trump is ignoring the real culprit of these price increases.
Because it s not the government raising the prices, it s the greedy insurance companies.The reason the cost of Obamacare is being hiked up is because insurance companies care more about profits than they do about people.
Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota even pulled its most popular insurance plan from the marketplace in order to force people to buy the more expensive packages.But Trump would rather strip millions of Americans of their health insurance instead of blasting the insurance companies.
And Americans slammed Trump on Twitter for it.He also called you crazy, @realDonaldTrump.
And he didn t want to scrap O-care, unlike you: he wanted to reform it.

#EndTheFarce The Socialist Party (@OfficialSPGB) January 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump Republicans hate Obamacare so much they plan to keep parts of it for four years https://t.co/qYNQKcaelD Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) January 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump and most Americans want to keep large parts of it.
https://t.co/c7EZymhdve Justin Hendrix (@justinhendrix) January 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump Yet it helped millions who never could get coverage before.
I guess that couldn t fit into your tweet.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) January 3, 2017But how will you fix it @realDonaldTrump?
Can t just leave millions without healthcare.
Share your vision not just your opinion please Uncle Louie G (@UncleLouie) January 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump so what s your solution then?
Leave 22 million people uninsured?
Jesse B-H (@mrjessebh) January 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump Thanks to the ACA people with preexisting conditions can now receive healthcare.
Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) January 3, 2017@realDonaldTrump Do you plan to replace ObamaCare with the if something happens it happens plan?
pic.twitter.com/7jOaJFuGrw RIP My Mentions (@TimDuffy) January 3, 2017Seriously, it s the insurance companies we should all be enraged at.
Not the program itself.
The program has done a lot of good.
The mistake was trusting the insurance companies.
That s why we should just pass universal healthcare in this country so that we pay for our healthcare with our tax dollars instead of paying insurance companies every month for plans they ll only raise the cost of when they feel like it.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
