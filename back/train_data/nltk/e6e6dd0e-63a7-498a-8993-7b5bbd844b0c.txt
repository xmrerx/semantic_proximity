case clear noncontestable current provision u international law yemeni resident taiz lose everything another saudi airstrike trevor thrall john glaser reasonafter almost year bombing yemen humanitarian catastrophe
6000 yemeni kill extremely conservative estimate half civilian
accord recent united nation report saudiled coalition conduct airstrikes target civilian civilian object include refugee camp hospital wedding mosque
saudi bombing reduce large tract several city rubble
attack accord un panel could amount crime humanityas month two million people yemen internally displace million lack access potable water thanks ussupported saudi blockade import 14 million yemeni risk starvationthroughout u quietly dutifully lend saudi weapon logistics assistance diplomatic cover
time stopthe civil conflict yemen root overthrow 2011 longtime ussaudi ally ali abdullah saleh
midst unrest saudi arabia u support political transition government head president abedrabbo mansour hadi candidate ballot
yemen shiite houthi rebel wag insurgency hadi government capture capital city sanaa 2014the civil war morph intractable proxy war march last year saudi arabia decide wage vicious bombing campaign pretext destroy houthi rebellion reinstate hadi beleaguer government
riyadh view houthis proxy iran peaceful diplomatic settlement u iran latter nuclear program u official apparently felt oblige reassure saudi arabia support war yementhe problem saudi arabia war yemen compromise u interest moral standing
interest harm undermine houthis contribute power vacuum country benefit position alqaeda arabian peninsula aqap happen share saudi distaste houthisthe saudi succeed garner u support part characterize war fight terrorism
saudi alqaeda actually awkward alliance fight make u help even misguidedas moral standing support saudi arabia military action party serious war crime indirectly fault devastate humanitarian crisis people yemen facethe saudi intervention clearly violate war tenet jus ad bellum
tenet dictate nation cause go war also resort military force option exhaust
despite saudi claim contrary intervention clearly case selfdefense
notion yemen poorest country middle east keep afloat primarily saudi fund represent military threat saudi arabia absurd
argue saudi bomb justify prevent future terrorist attack argue preventive war violate war theory un charterthe saudi insist action legal legitimate yemeni government invite military intervention
hadi government hardly deserve label legitimate
hadi elevate presidency serve saleh autocratic regime vice president
president hadi use position consolidate power houthis saleh loyalist misappropriate billion dollar
better description would call hadi government tool saudi arabia since saudi arabia broker deal allow replace saleh also enable return yemen houthis drive country
argue saudi respond call help essentially argue saudi ask intervene yemenso saudi arabia argument intervention weak u excuse
claim part parcel war terror dubious consider bombing yemen anything bolster islamic extremist
