there was a heavy push and big-time lobbying from g7 leaders but president trump said no to endorsing the paris climate agreement .
we hope this means another nail in the coffin of obama s legacy .
obama set america up to pay a fortune to other nations in this major boondoggle of a redistribution of wealth to other nations .
american taxpayers do not want to pay for this ! trump has stated in the past that he would like to renegotiate the deal but we think he needs to get out of it .
he tweeted he ll make his decision next week after saying that the discussion on climate was very unsatisfying : whole discussion on climate was very unsatisfying # merkel says after # g7taormina .
no indication whether us will stay in # parisagreement .

the paris deal isn t just any other deal .
it is a key agreement that shapes today s globalization , merkel said , describing discussions with trump about climate change very unsatisfying .
merkel doesn t understand that globalization is exactly why we don t like this boondoggle ! for opponents of the agreement , the decision is a welcome development after the president s economic adviser , gary cohn , told reporters that trump was evolving on the issue .
trump needs to evolve his way out of this agreement .
pull out ! read more : breitbart
