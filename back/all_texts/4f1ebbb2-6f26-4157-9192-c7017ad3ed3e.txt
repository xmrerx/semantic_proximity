Despite the racial outbursts, the insistence that he keep attacking his former primary rivals even though the primaries are over, and the overall haphazard way he is campaigning, Republican chairman Reince Priebus insists that all is well between him and nominee Donald Trump.Of course, like so much in this campaign, that isn t the truth.
Behind the scenes, Trump is making a critical error that could doom his attempt to win the presidency more than a simple racist comment, and it is driving the party chairman nuts.Meanwhile, the Trump high-dollar fund-raising operation is showing signs of duress, people here say.
A joint fund-raising agreement was hatched last month to split proceeds between the RNC and the Trump campaign.
And while the first joint fund-raisers have gone well, RNC chair Reince Priebus has phoned some associates expressing frustration that Trump wants to direct dollars to his own ambitious plans, according to a person who has spoken directly with Priebus, which includes quixotic bids to win deep blue states like California and New York.The RNC did not respond to a request for comment.There isn t any data to indicate that a win in traditionally blue states is remotely possible for Trump to pull off.
Most polling has shown that his best shot would come with a winning streak in so-called purple states, the same states that both John McCain and Mitt Romney tried to target against President Obama that have swung between both parties with a difference of one percentage point or less.By comparison, no Republican has won California and New York since Ronald Reagan s epic landslide victory in 1984, which was 32 years ago.
Both states have delivered huge, lopsided victories to Democratic presidential candidates for decades, and both also consist of the diverse electorates Latino, black that are the most opposed to Trump.Republican insiders know and understand this.
Trump s ego insists that he should contend in the blue states, especially his home state of New York, but using any money to campaign there is a fool s errand for the Republican Party, made even worse since the GOP is so far behind the Democrats and Secretary Clinton on raising money.It has all the ingredients for an election disaster.Featured image via YouTube
