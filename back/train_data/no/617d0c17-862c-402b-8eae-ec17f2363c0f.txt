bogota ( reuters ) - colombia s president juan manuel santos on tuesday named gustavo bell as the government s chief negotiator in peace talks with marxist eln rebels and said the government will work toward extending a ceasefire with the insurgent group .
bell , who was vice president under president andres pastrana from 1998 to 2002 and is currently ambassador to cuba , replaces juan camilo restrepo , who guided talks with the national liberation army ( eln ) since they began in february .
santos said in a televised address the government hopes to extend a ceasefire that began in october and ends on jan. 9 .
with the eln , we have for the first time achieved a stoppage of hostilities that , while not perfect , has been positive .
we will work toward improving it and extending it in january , santos said .
the eln on sunday said it is willing to continue the ceasefire if there is sufficient progress in peace talks .
it said it would assess the government s willingness to overcome hurdles .
the eln and the government have been in negotiations in quito for 10 months , after a long and secret exploratory phase , in a bid to end more than 53 years of war .
santos , who leaves office next year , signed a peace accord in late 2016 with the revolutionary armed forces of colombia ( farc ) , which has now become a political party and hopes to fight the government at the ballot box .
the eln s first-ever ceasefire is being supervised by the roman catholic church and the united nations .
the 2,000-strong eln , which has regularly bombed oil infrastructure and taken hostages , has continued kidnapping despite the ceasefire .
an indigenous leader in choco province died in october after being taken by the group .
