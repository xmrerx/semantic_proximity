london ( reuters ) - a financial transaction tax proposed by britain s opposition labour party would risk the competitiveness of london s financial center , the city of london corporation said on sunday , calling for the proposal to be scrapped .
the leftist labour party , which is holding its annual conference in southern english town of brighton , has advocated a so-called robin hood tax to levy charges on bond and derivative trades .
it says the tax could raise 4.7 billion pounds ( $ 6.34 billion ) to fund higher public spending .
but the city of london corporation , the body which administers policy in the central london financial district , criticized the policy .
a financial transactions tax , however described , would be a unilateral policy which would weaken our hand and undermine our competitiveness , said the corporation s policy chairman , catherine mcguinness .
labour lost a general election in 2017 , and one is not scheduled until 2022 , but labour is banking on prime minister theresa may s government falling sooner and has briefed financial institutions on its plan in recent months .
on the first main day of his party s conference , labour leader jeremy corbyn was asked about his approach to taxation said : i don t think i m worried about taxing the super rich and the super wealthy .
the objective surely has to be stronger economic base for everybody in this country and dealing with the waste of poverty and inequality , he told the bbc .
