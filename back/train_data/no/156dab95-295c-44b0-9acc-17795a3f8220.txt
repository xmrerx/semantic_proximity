merkel s christian democratic union ( cdu ) and their bavarian sister party , the christian social union ( csu ) , would hold talks with the fdp and greens separately next wednesday , she said .
then on friday , october 20th we will have a first round of exploratory talks with all partners , merkel told a joint news conference with csu leader horst seehofer on monday .
merkel s cdu appeared to make a concession to the csu on sunday by agreeing to put a number on how many people germany would accept per year on humanitarian grounds .
merkel said she was pleased with the compromise , which was a very , very good basis to go into exploratory talks .
