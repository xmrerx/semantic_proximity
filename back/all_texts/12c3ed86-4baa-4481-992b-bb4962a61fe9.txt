The GOP likes to pretend that they have no issue with women, but it couldn t be clearer that this is a bold-faced lie.
The issue was brought front and center when Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) invoked an obscure, rarely used Senate rule in order to silence Senator Elizabeth Warren when she was reading a letter from the late civil rights icon and wife of Martin Luther King Jr Coretta Scott King.
The letter was entered into the Senate record in 1986, when Senator Jeff Sessions (R-AL) was rejected by the Senate for a federal judgeship because he is clearly a racist.
Now, Sessions is on the cusp of becoming the Attorney General the chief law enforcement officer and the person charged with protecting the civil rights of all.When rebuking Senator Warren in the most sexist terms imaginable, McConnell said: She was warned.
She was given an explanation.
Nevertheless, she persisted.
Of course, in the age of social media, McConnell s appalling actions and remarks spread like wildfire.
#ShePersisted immediately went viral on Twitter and Facebook, as did #LetLizSpeak.
#CorettaScottKing trended as well.
Of course, it is not lost that McConnell s sexist Senate Floor behavior comes just a couple of weeks after the women of this nation marched in solidarity in what is perhaps the biggest protest in United States history.
Surely he didn t mean to, but McConnell just gave us all an awesome feminist rallying cry, and his own words are already being used against him, and will likely be seen on protest signs around the nation this weekend.Hell, they are already on t-shirts and iPhone covers.
Here are just a few tweets from the #ShePersisted hashtag:Hey @SenateMajLdr, just wanted to say fuck you before I went to bed.
Fuck you.

But, I suppose, despite your disgusting, bigoted conduct, we should be thanking you, because you just rallied us even harder and exposed your party s bigotry even further.VOTE THEM OUT in 2018, folks.
This will not be forgotten.
