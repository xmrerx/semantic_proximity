BUDAPEST (Reuters) - Hungary is facing a frontal assault from U.S. financier George Soros who is attacking the country via his non-government organizations and European Union bureaucrats, a top ruling party politician said on Monday.
Fidesz Vice Chairman Gergely Gulyas said Soros claims that the Hungarian government lied in its campaign against him were not substantial , adding the billionaire and the European Union pushed the same pro-migrant agenda.
He rejected charges by Soros that the government s campaign stoked anti-Muslim sentiment and employed anti-Semitic tropes.
