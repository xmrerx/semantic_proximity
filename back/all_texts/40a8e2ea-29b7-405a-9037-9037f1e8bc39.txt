WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama intends to brief, rather than lobby, President-elect Donald Trump about the Obama administration’s policies during the transition of power, the White House said on Wednesday.
Speaking at a news briefing, White House spokesman Josh Earnest added, however, that viewing some policies from inside the government “gives you a new appreciation for the benefits of those policies.” “President Obama is committed to an effective transition that helps bring President-elect Trump and his team up to speed on the current status of U.S. policy, including foreign policy,” Earnest said.
