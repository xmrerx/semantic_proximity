Video quickly went viral of Trump supporter George Lindell, a resident of Phoenix, Arizona.
Lindell could be seen and heard chanting to the media pen Jew-S-A Jew-S-A which is clearly an anti-Semitic slur.Watch Lindell do his chant here:However, that s not the end of the story.
After Lindell was called out on his clear anti-Semitism, he tried to clear things up and explain what he was actually saying.According to The Arizona Republic: The Phoenix man spent Monday trying to explain why his chanting what sounded like Jew-S-A at the Saturday rally was not meant as a slur.
I want to talk to everybody, Lindell said Monday.
He s a painter for hire and had a job scheduled, but he put it off so he could respond.
Local television stations were calling, so were national websites.
He said CNN was trying to arrange something.Lindell needed to do the interviews, he said, to counter what people are saying about him.
They re calling me racist, calling me all kinds of names.
He s now saying that he wasn t going after Jewish people or the religion, but rather just saying USA in a heavy Spanish accent.The Arizona Republican reports: Lindell said he has a rational explanation for his chant.
What sounded like Jew, was in fact, he said, a chance to show allegiance with Spanish speakers who chant the country s initials with a heavy accent.
So, really, Lindell would like everyone to know that he s not anti-Semitic, but rather just a good old fashioned racist.And while Trump campaign manager KellyAnne Conway says Lindell s speech does not reflect the campaign s values, a visit to any Trump rally with show you otherwise.Donald Trump has built his entire campaign around racism, Islamophobia, misogyny and xenophobic demagoguery.
It s not really surprising to hear this sort of speech coming from the crowd.
Not surprising in the least.Featured image via video screen capture
