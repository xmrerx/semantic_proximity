the usda is spreading the wealth like crazy with the green energy giveaways of thousands to farmers .
we know from past experience that these farmers are given grants and loans for supposed green energy projects only to see the scam of pocketing money .
the usda had previously spend billions of taxpayer dollars on a project called pigford that was proven to be nothing but an effort to redistribute money to thousands of minorities .
the u.s. department of agriculture ( usda ) is spending millions on green energy projects for farms , including putting solar panels on the tops of chicken coops.the federal agency announced friday that its rural energy for america program ( reap ) will spend $ 63 million on solar panels and wind turbines for the farming industry.one project , totaling $ 16,094 , was awarded to blue sky poultry , inc. , of bainbridge , ga. , to install a solar array on the roof of poultry houses .
other projects announced by the usda included $ 18,000 for solar panels for a fruit farm in ohio , and $ 19,750 for a wind turbine for a farm in minnesota.the majority of funding is going toward similar small projects .
the agency is also financing larger solar projects through loan guarantees in the amounts of $ 3 to $ 4 million , and funding a $ 5 million project to turn wood into gas.agriculture secretary tom vilsack said the $ 63 million in funding would create jobs , reduce greenhouse gas pollution , and helps usher in a more secure energy future for the nation .
the usda pointed out that the obama administration has spent more than $ 291 million in grants and $ 327 million in loan guarantees on green energy projects for farmers through the program since the president took office.via : wfb
