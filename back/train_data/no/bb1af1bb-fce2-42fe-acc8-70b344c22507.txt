johannesburg ( reuters ) - south african president jacob zuma said on saturday allegations of private businesses wielding undue influence in his government will be investigated by a judicial commission of inquiry .
the country s high court ruled on wednesday that zuma must set up a judicial inquiry into state influence-peddling within 30 days , upholding the findings of a graft watchdog report entitled state of capture .
the report focused on allegations that zuma s friends , the businessmen and brothers ajay , atul and rajesh gupta , had influenced the appointment of ministers .
zuma and the guptas have denied all accusations of wrongdoing .
zuma was speaking on saturday at the start of a weekend conference of his african national congress that will vote on a new party leader .
