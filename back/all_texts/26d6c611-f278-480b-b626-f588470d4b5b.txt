Sometimes, politics can get so ridiculous that one is forced to wonder if what he or she is seeing is really happening.
One of those moments occurred on the second day of the GOP convention.
After Melania Trump blatantly plagiarized part of Michelle Obama s 2008 Democratic convention speech, the GOP leaped into action, offering every ridiculous excuse they could muster to defend the prospective next First Lady including the Trump campaign s official hamburger delivery boy Chris Christie s well-she-didn t-plagiarize-all-of-it-so-it-wasn t-plagiarism defense.But the most insane thing to come out of this scenario is perhaps Republican National Committee communications director Sean Spicer s My Little Pony defense.
Melania Trump said, You work hard for what you want in life.
Akon said, Work hard for what you get in life.
John Legend said, Work hard, Spicer offered during an interview on MSNBC.
You re quoting Akon and John Legend?
asked host Craig Melvin.
Hold on, it s getting better, Spicer continued.
And he was right it did get better: Melania Trump said, The strength of your dreams and your willingness to work for them.
Twilight Sparkle from My Little Pony said, This is your dream, anything you can do in your dreams.
A simple Google search of three phrases comes up with everything from Sparkle Pony to John Legend to Akon, Spicer said, ignoring that an entire paragraph was quoted by Mrs. Trump nearly word-for-word.Naturally, the internet had a lot of fun with this:A presidential campaign quoting from MY LITTLE PONY.
There just isn't enough popcorn in all the world for this.

#PlagiaristMelania Souad (@minouche_tlm) July 19, 2016Oh well if she was just paraphrasing My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic then it s totally less idiotic https://t.co/P64WN0iUtr Rebecca Marie Kocsis (@BeccaMarie82) July 19, 2016@CNN so your future First Lady has the same mindset as my little pony!!
Is that what you're saying?!?
_______ (@DontCare_w) July 19, 2016Why couldn't Twilight Sparkle from My Little Pony save me when I handed in that paper in 9th grade?
Adam Parker (@goatsonparade) July 19, 2016GOP's Sean Spicer defends Melania Trump against accusations she plagiarized Michelle Obama by suggesting Melania plagiarized My Little Pony.
I, Hoebot.
(@eclecticbrotha) July 19, 2016So she has also plagiarized My Little Pony and Kid Rock.
What noble leaders to emulate.
https://t.co/YMTR3TrGj8 Cassie Gibbs (@trojan_roo) July 19, 2016I bet this is one My Little Pony the RNC isn't down with.

https://t.co/9ccPz4LMsm Angels4Autism (@Angel4Autism) July 19, 2016If Republicans are now messing with My Little Pony, I m pretty sure that crosses a line.
They re at risk of losing the key brony vote.
Mike Knell (@mpk) July 19, 2016With the My Little Pony defense of Melania Trump s plagiarism, GOP proves Partisanship is Magic.
https://t.co/4a4ObPrau8 Jeet Heer (@HeerJeet) July 19, 2016Please tell me the RNC did NOT just go into My Little Pony oh what a year!
Diz Foley (@DizFoley) July 19, 2016You know how all those guys were like "Girl Ghostbusters ruined my childhood?
"Well the RNC quoting My Little Pony is doing nothing for mine Marla Rosenthal (@half_shiksa) July 19, 2016Let s say Spicer is 100% correct in that Michelle Obama lifted the phrases from My Little Pony.
He s not, but let s pretend that this is some alternate universe where rabid, tentacular beasts rule the planet, the sky is constantly on fire, and a smart, classy woman like Michelle Obama needs to dip into the brilliant and thought-provoking scripts of My Little Pony in order to write a speech.Does it really make it any better that Melania Trump lifted quotes third-hand from a children s TV show?
Is the fact that Mrs. Trump couldn t steal from someone more respectable than a show about magic horses actually comforting?Here s the thing, though.
While Spicer really had to reach to connect Trump s (and Obama s) to My Little Pony, the difference in wording between the two speeches was minimal.
In any case, this tweet from California Senate candidate Thomas Del Beccaro keeps getting more hilarious by the minute.#MelaniaTrump proved tonight she is total opposite of #MichelleO.
No anger.
No complaints.
Just about what can happen through opportunity.
