Pathetic New Age guru and alternative medicine activist Dr. Deepak Chopra attacked Donald Trump Tuesday in an interview on Fox News The Alan Colmes Show, during which he called the presumptive GOP presidential nominee both emotionally and mentally retarded.
Chopra, 68, said that Trump epitomizes, among other things, the darkest demons of America s collective psyche.
I would never say this unless I believed it was 100% true, but he represents the racist, the bigot, the one who s prejudiced, the one who is full of fear and hatred, the one who represents emotional retardation of a three-year old, Chopra said of Trump.
And yet he s so popular because he s given permission to our collective psyche to express their darkest demons.
Radio host Colmes asked Chopra if Trump is himself a racist and bigot, or whether he just represents those ideologies to his supporters.
I think he is, Chopra said, adding: I think he s racist, he s bigoted, he s prejudiced.
He s full of fear.
He is angry.
He has a lot of hatred.
He pouts, he s belligerent, he s emotionally retarded.
