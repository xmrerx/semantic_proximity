We re thinking Trump shouldn t give the ratings to Megyn Kelly.
Here is our suggestion in a tweet to Donald:@realDonaldTrump If you agree to interview w/ @megynkelly give HUGE ratings to someone you don't offend like @seanhannity or @oreillyfactor 100% FED UP!
(@100PercFEDUP) August 10, 2015Donald Trump and the Fox News Channel are in talks about Trump possibly appearing on Fox on Monday night, according to a source with knowledge of the talks.Trump has been lambasting Fox for days, ever since he was challenged in last week s GOP debate.It is highly unlikely Trump would appear at 9 p.m. with host Megyn Kelly, the source said, and that s probably an understatement.
Trump has repeatedly and personally insulted Kelly in recent days.
It amazes me that other networks seem to treat me so much better than @FoxNews.
I brought them the biggest ratings in history, & I get zip!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 9, 2015But talks are underway about a Trump interview with another prime time host, like Sean Hannity, the source said, adding that nothing had been confirmed as of Monday morning.In the meantime, Fox has dramatically ratcheted down its coverage of Trump.
It hasn t covered Trump s criticisms of Kelly and the two other debate moderators, Chris Wallace and Bret Baier.Via: Free Republic
