( reuters ) - pennsylvania governor tom wolf signed two anti-discrimination executive orders on thursday aimed at safeguarding rights of transgender people , countering efforts by other states forcing them to use public bathrooms that match their gender at birth .
one order bans the state from discriminating against any employee or job applicant based on a host of criteria including “ gender expression or identity. ” it also bans discrimination based on race , color , religious creed , ancestry , union membership , age , gender , sexual orientation , national origin , aids or hiv status , or disability .
the second seeks to eliminate discrimination in contracting , requiring any company doing business with the state to eliminate bias in hiring and promotion .
