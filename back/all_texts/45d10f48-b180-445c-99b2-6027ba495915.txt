Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is not a fan of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump.
The justice, who is considered by many to be the preeminent progressive currently on the court, made the unusual step of opining on the election in an interview.
I can t imagine what this place would be I can t imagine what the country would be with Donald Trump as our president, she said.
For the country, it could be four years.
For the court, it could be I don t even want to contemplate that.
It reminded her of something her husband, Martin D. Ginsburg, a prominent tax lawyer who died in 2010, would have said.
Now it s time for us to move to New Zealand, Justice Ginsburg said, smiling ruefully.Justice Ginsburg also scolded Senate Republicans for refusing to hold hearings on Merrick Garland, President Obama s nominee to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia.
Ginsburg noted that he is about as well qualified as any nominee to this court and pointed out that for the Senate, vetting justices is their job and Republicans are avoiding that.Responding to Republicans who say they can t hold hearings while Obama is still in office, Ginsburg notes, There s nothing in the Constitution that says the president stops being president in his last year.
Ginsburg is 83, and it is highly possible that the next President will have to choose her successor.
Justice Kennedy is 79, while Justice Breyer is 77.
The next President is highly likely to have to consider multiple judicial appointments to the Supreme Court, a position with the potential to have enormous ripple effects not only on millions of American citizens, but billions of people around the world who are affected by what happens here.In the interview Ginsburg said she would like to see the decision in Citizens United overturned.
That decision effectively said there were no limits on how much money can be spent on elections, and have led to the rise of super PACs.Featured image via Flickr
