in a desperate attempt to make steve bannon seem less like a crazed , apocalypse-obsessed maniac , fox news played a little game with usa today s deputy editorial opinion editor , david mastio , who suggested in a recent piece that steve bannon and isis leader abu bakr al-baghdadi shared similar world views , including apocalyptic visions of a clash between muslims and the united states.it is true that both men share these viewpoints , but fox took things to ridiculous levels in an effort to appear to disprove this theory .
apparently , because bannon ( unlike he and trump s friend putin ) has not slaughtered journalists or used chemical weapons , he s a swell dude.tucker carlson quickly went through the chart , ticking off many of baghdadi s more horrible actions : see ?
there you have it bannon , who until recently ran a website aimed at a white supremacist audience and who describes himself as a leninist who wants to destroy the state is just a-ok ! this cringeworthy attempt to make bannon seem appealing by comparing him to one of the few people in the world who is worse than he is wasn t lost on the internet .
twitter users flocked to mock the right-wing news organization for this whatever this was.here 's another graphic you can use @ foxnews @ tuckercarlson pic.twitter.com/mme56zg1qk not my president ( @ missmayn ) february 9 , 2017breaking : steve bannon a pretty good guy when compared to aids @ foxnews @ tuckercarlson pic.twitter.com/8wty3srgle not my president ( @ missmayn ) february 9 , 2017 @ missmayn pic.twitter.com/gorzckbjnh chris rywalt ?

pic.twitter.com/4ekazdzf32 jm ( @ undersilverlake ) february 9 , 2017 @ missmayn you can thank @ andybeckerman for this pic.twitter.com/3qatwhp1do nightscientist ( @ nightscientist ) february 9 , 2017 @ missmayn this is like putting `` if nothing else i am not ( currently ) a serial killer '' on your online dating profile .
( ( ( dan north ) ) ) ( @ drnorth ) february 9 , 2017 @ missmayn that fox news felt the need to make this hilarious graphic at all says a lot about the undercurrent of public sentiment .
nick stewart ( @ nickstewarting ) february 9 , 2017 @ missmayn @ melissajpeltier so now not beheadings people and using child soldiers is the bar for a 'good person ' ?
@ foxnews you are pathetic fadi antoun ( @ fadiantounn ) february 9 , 2017 @ missmayn @ cafedotcom wow , when you put it that way , i 'm glad he 's our potus .
peter drake ( @ peterjdrake ) february 9 , 2017 @ missmayn those are all super specificlike , maybe he has n't beheaded any journalists , but maybe there are a few less fast food employees thompson kaa ( @ thompson_kaa ) february 9 , 2017 @ missmayn i feel like they added the `` on kurds '' qualifier after realizing there 's a possibility bannon has used chemical weapons before .
matthew byrd ( @ silvertuna014 ) february 10 , 2017 @ missmayn interesting degree of specificity here , eg .
`` on kurds '' , `` of chrstians '' sith justice warrior ( @ sithjw ) february 9 , 2017at no point was it suggested that bannon has done any of the things baghdadi has done .
the editorial speaks only of their ideological similarities , which carlson carefully avoided mentioning but what else can expect from fox news ?
honesty ?
