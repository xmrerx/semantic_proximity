TRUMP IS RIGHT ON HIS CLAIM THAT THIS ELECTION IS THE GLOBAL ELITES VS AMERICANS GEORGE SOROS COMES TO MIND!Ratcheting up his mockery of Donald Trump, President Obama said Friday that the Republican nominee is behaving like a crybaby who knows he s losing the race for president and intends to drag this election as low as it can possibly go.
C MON MAN!
HERE S OUR PRESIDENT ACTING LIKE A COCKY COMMUNITY ORGANIZER: It s always interesting for me to see folks who talk tough, but then don t act tough, Mr. Obama said.
If you re tough, you don t make excuses.
You just play the game.
He poked fun at Mr. Trump for the Republican s claim in a speech Thursday that Mrs. Clinton is benefiting from a power structure of global elites at the expense of the working class.
This is a guy who spent all his time hanging around trying to convince everybody he was a global elite, talking about how great his buildings are, how luxurious, and how rich he is, Mr. Obama said, laughing.
All he had time for is celebrities.
And now suddenly he s acting like he s a populist?
Come on, man!
