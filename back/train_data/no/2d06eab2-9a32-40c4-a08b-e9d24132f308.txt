the irony of the tweet put out on mother s day by planned parenthood is certainly not lost on us .
the cognitive dissonance of a baby killing , baby parts seller promoting motherhood is a nutty comment !
planned parenthood , the nation s largest abortion provider , on sunday celebrated mother s day with a tweet picturing two mothers holding their children .
planned parenthood is committed to building a world that values , respects , and supports safe and wanted motherhood , a caption on the picture reads .
social media users were quick to point out the cognitive dissonance of an abortion provider celebrating mothers .
does anybody else see the irony of abortion provider planned parenthood wishing a happy mother s day ?
angel c tweeted .

chimed in jana allen .
but i guess not all unborn babies matter , another twitter user said .
the unborn are innocent victims murdered at pp .
