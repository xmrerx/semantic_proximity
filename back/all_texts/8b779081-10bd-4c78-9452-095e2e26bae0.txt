MADRID (Reuters) - Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy s decision to fire Catalonia s government and force a new election is a coup and an attack against democracy , the speaker of the Catalan parliament said on Saturday.
Prime Minister Rajoy wants the parliament of Catalonia to stop being a democratic parliament, and we will not allow this to happen, Carme Forcadell said in a televised speech.
