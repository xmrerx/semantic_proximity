21st century wire says late last year , search engine giant google announced its plans to protect users from the horrors of fake news by changing the way it presents search results .
according to corporate officials , they hope to shelter readers by limiting access to what the company deems as low-quality information while promoting what it calls established mainstream sources .
critics believe that the company , which now has a virtual monopoly on internet traffic , is now playing god over the info-sphere .
while its known that eric schmidt , the head of google s parent company , alphabet inc , is regular attendee at the annual secretive bilderberg meeting which charters the globalist agenda , not much is known about new google ceo sundar pichai and what his personal ideology is , or whether he personally believes that google s role is to control what the public think about any given issue by fixing the search results on the world s number one search engine .
judging by the culture of conformity at google , it s not likely that pichai would be allowed to express any dissenting views if he had them.as 21wire pointed out last week regarding the controversy over the recent google memo and the firm dismissing employees who are seen to divert from the company s prescribed group think , this same repressive political culture at google is reflected in its broad new automated censorship program administered by algorithms on its google search engine a bold move which effectively disappears political views and articles it does not like , and wishes to bury.watch this segment from rt america , with guest andre damon , editor of the world socialist web site , to explain why he believes his site and other alternative sources are being unfairly targeted in google s new reordering of visible information through its portal .
