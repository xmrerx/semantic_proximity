Well, this is Marc and Chelsea Mezvinsky.That s right; Ed Mezvinsky is Chelsea Clinton s father-in law.Now Marc and Chelsea are in their early thirties and purchased a 10.5 million dollar NYC apartment (after being married in George Soros mansion).Has anyone heard mention of any of this in any of the media?If this guy was Jenna or Barbara Bush s, or better yet, Sarah Palin s daughter s father-in- law, the news would be an everyday headline and every detail would be reported over and over.And yet say there are no double standards in political reporting.
And people are already talking about Hillary as our next President!
And then there is possibly Chelsea for president in our future!The cycle never ends!Via: Before It s News
