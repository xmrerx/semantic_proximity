berlin ( reuters ) - greens want the next coalition government to push for the removal of all nuclear warheads stationed in germany , a document seen by reuters showed on wednesday .
the discussion paper on defence and foreign policy did not mention the united states , which is believed to have 20 nuclear warheads at a military base in buechel in western germany , according to unofficial estimates .
chancellor angela merkel is trying to secure a fourth term through an unlikely coalition with the ecologist greens and pro-business free democrats ( fdp ) after her conservative bloc lost support to the far-right in an election in september .
nato member germany is not a nuclear power and in 2011 a merkel-led government announced plans to shut all nuclear reactors by 2022 after the fukushima disaster in japan .
within nato , we want to ensure that the remaining nuclear weapons in germany are withdrawn and we want to suspend the modernization programme , read a section in the document stating the greens position .
before leaving office former u.s. president barack obama announced plans to modernize nuclear bombs , delivery systems and laboratories .
his successor , donald trump , has said he wants to strengthen and expand his country s nuclear capability .
the conservatives , greens and fdp are hoping to end exploratory discussions on thursday and move on to proper negotiations on forming a government .
they remain divided on several key issues , including immigration , reforming the euro zone and climate policy .
