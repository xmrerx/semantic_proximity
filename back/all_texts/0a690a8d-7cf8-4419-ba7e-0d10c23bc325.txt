America s First Black President continues to destroy employment opportunities for the black community We ve got a bad guy in the family, but protect him because he s family.
We ve got to wake up, slap ourselves and wake up.
This is America and everybody s involved in this and if our children are hurting, it s our responsibility to find someone who understands that pain, feels it like Bill Clinton would say.
This guy doesn t feel it.
In fact he issues a lot of that pain, with a smile.
Harry Alford, Black Chamber of Commerce President (Hannity, February 26, 2013)
