Saturday Night Live is having a high old time ruthlessly mocking the governmental train wreck that is the fledgling, incompetent Trump administration.
First, they returned Alec Baldwin to his role as Trump, and re-enacted his absolutely disastrous first two weeks in office.
Then, they debuted Melissa McCarthy as White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer specifically his bizarre meltdown where he scolded the press regarding Trump s continuing obsession with having a smaller inaugural crowd size than President Obama did.McCarthy appeared in an ill-fitting suit, much like the one Spicer wore to tear into the press during his very first official appearance as Press Secretary, and yelled and screamed, and even swallowed bunches of gum, in a mockery of the report that Spicer has a problem where he eats and swallows copious amounts of Orbit cinnamon gum daily.
As he does this, McCarthy/Spicer says: I m here to swallow gum and take names!
When challenged by a reporter at one point, McCarthy/Spicer took out a super soaker gun and shot the reporter with water.
The spoof even had McCarthy/Spicer pick up the press podium and attempt to attack reporters with it.
The erratic press secretary insisted on apology from the press for how they are treating Trump and him: Apologize to me!
That apology is NOT accepted!
This is hilarious, but it is also scary, considering how close it is to the person who is currently serving as the actual White House Press Secretary.Watch the clip below:Featured image via video screen capture
