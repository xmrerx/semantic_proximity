First Amendment supporting conservatives are once again up in arms over what they perceive to be political correctness run amuck.Lisa Greenwood, a loan officer from Loan Point Financial, posted on her twitter calling Michelle Obama an ugly black bitch.
Luckily, her Facebook showed where she worked, and complaints to the company quickly poured in.Lisa s company responded by firing her.
They posted on their Facebook page explaining why:The individual who made reprehensible comments regarding last night s speech by the First Lady is no longer employed with Home Point Financial.
Home Point Financial does not agree with nor condone such comments, which were made on the individual s Twitter account.
We hold true to our We Care philosophy our responsibilities extend beyond the workplace and into our communities.Ever since the announcement, the company s Facebook page has blown up with support, with hundreds, possibly thousands, of people now looking for a new home loan.
Luckily, Home Point Financial is licensed in 46 states.This is a perfect example to set for today s youth (and apparently adults): be very careful about what you post on social media, you never know who may be watching or what your company may think.Thankfully, Home Point Financial doesn t tolerate racism and sheer disrespect for our nation s First Lady.Conservative s love to accuse Democrats of playing the race card.
Yet time and time again, they are the ones who bring up the Obama s race and make racially charged statements like calling them monkeys, gorillas, Africans, Panthers, the list goes on and on.The company should scrutinize Greenwood s cases, to find if there was ever any racial discrimination in her loan process.
Judging by her charge against Michelle Obama, it wouldn t be far-fetched that she completely undermined black Americans trying to get a home.Kudos to the company for stamping out hate.
Let this be a lesson to conservatives and Trump supporters alike that racism is no longer being tolerated.Featured image via Joe Readle/Getty Images
