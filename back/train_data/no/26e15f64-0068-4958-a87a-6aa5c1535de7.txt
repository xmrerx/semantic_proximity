former democratic national committee chairman howard dean hinted that president donald trump would not make it through his first term friday on msnbc s morning joe .
discussing sen. jeff flake s ( r. , ariz. ) remarks that trump could be inviting a 2020 republican primary challenger with his conduct in office , dean suggested trump could no longer be president by then anyway.watch : who knows if trump is going to be around in 2020 ?
of his own volition , i think it s unlikely he ll be impeached , even if the democrats take over [ the house ] , although [ robert ] mueller could unearth some stuff that could lead to that , dean said .
i think this is unpredictable .
