lahore , pakistan ( reuters ) - a christian man has been sentenced to death on blasphemy charges by a court in eastern pakistan after a close friend accused him of sharing anti-islamic material , the defendant s lawyer said on friday .
blasphemy is a criminal offence in muslim-majority pakistan , and insults against the prophet mohammad are punishable by death .
most cases are filed against members of minority communities .
nadeem james , 35 , was arrested in july 2016 , accused by a friend of sharing material ridiculing the prophet mohammad on the whatsapp messaging service .
lawyer riaz anjum said his client intended to appeal against the verdict , passed on thursday by a sessions court in the town of gujrat .
there was widespread outrage across pakistan last april when student mashal khan was beaten to death at his university in mardan following a dorm debate about religion .
police arrested over 20 students and some faculty members in connection with the killing .
since then , parliament has considered adding safeguards to the blasphemy laws , a groundbreaking move given the emotive nature of the issue .
there have been at least 67 murders over unproven allegations of blasphemy since 1990 , according to figures from a research center and independent records kept by reuters .
and in 2011 , a bodyguard assassinated punjab provincial governor salman taseer after he called for the blasphemy laws to be reformed .
taseer s killer , executed last year , has been hailed as a martyr by religious hardliners .
