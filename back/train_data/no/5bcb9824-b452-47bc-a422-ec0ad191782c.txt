spewing falsehoods has become the favorite pastime of democrats it s really pitiful to watch last night , following the release of the washington post fake news on trump and russia , several videos immediately came out repeating the same fake news .
it s uncanny that the media could be so coordinated in their reports on president trump of course , we believe there s something to that.two congresscritters have come out to call for the impeachment of president trump .with zero evidence of any wrongdoing , it s laughable one of our favorites is maxine waters but this next congressman runs a close second .
al green claims trump was hobnobbing with the russians haha ! congressman al green just released a statement on why he believes president trump should be impeached .
this statement is laughable .
was al green elected because of his name ?
voters can be that way , ya know this guy is the definition of clueless !
who elects these brainiacs ? rep .
maxine waters ( d-ca ) has suggested impeachment during tv interviews , but green is the first member of congress to formally call for impeachment hearings.green said trump s own public statements showed he fired comey over the russia investigation , which he said was grounds for impeachment : waters and green are a total joke !
these are just two of the jokers running washington .
this is truly scary .
