NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will meet with Lockheed Martin Corp Chief Executive officer Marillyn Hewson on Friday, a Trump transition officials said.
Trump, who takes office next Friday, said last month he viewed costs for the aerospace companyâ€™s F-35 fighter as too high and would ask Boeing to price out an upgraded F-18.
