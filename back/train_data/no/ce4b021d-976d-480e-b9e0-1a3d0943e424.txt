the train and one of the vehicles collided , killing three soldiers aboard the truck and a passenger on the train , officials said .

the soldier who had driven the truck will face charges for endangering traffic safety and manslaughter , he added .
four people were taken to helsinki with severe injuries and seven others were treated at a local hospital for minor injuries .
