WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee said on Thursday he felt his House of Representatives counterpart had stepped away from that panel’s investigation of possible links between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia because he felt it was necessary.
“Chairman (Devin) Nunes has made the move he felt necessary to protect the viability of his Committee and its investigation going forward,” Republican U.S.
Senator Richard Burr said in a statement.
