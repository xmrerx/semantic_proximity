You will not believe this whopper!
Hillary Clinton is dealing in vague answers that are really downright lies.
She claims in an interview that it was the fog of war that made her lie to the families of the Benghazi victims.
I say it was cover your a@@ time and that s what they came up with.
These people are sickening!
Sunday on ABC s This Week, while discussing the uncovered email showing Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton had told the Egyptian prime minister that we know the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film, prior to telling them it was a YouTube video that caused the terror attack, Clinton said she did not lie to them but instead was caught up in the fog of war.
When confronted by video clips of family members of Benghazi victims, Clinton said, I understand the continuing grief at the loss that parents experienced with the loss of these four brave Americans.
I did testify as you know for 11 hours and I answered all of these questions.
Now, I can t I can t help it that people think there has to be something else there, I said very clearly, there had been a terrorist group that had taken responsibility on Facebook, between the time that I, you know, when I talked to my daughter, that was the latest information, we were giving it credibility, and then we learned the next day, it wasn t true.
In fact, they retracted it.
This was a fast-moving series of events in the fog of war.
I think most Americans understand.
