Way before the election ever took place, the left had strapped on their battle gear and were preparing for the ultimate war against Donald Trump.
Democrats, their media allies and George Soros, chief financier of violent anti-Trump protests, were all preparing for what they believed was the remote possibility Trump would win the presidential election.
Trump stunned the world when he pulled off a stunning victory against the anointed Democrat candidate Hillary Clinton and now, the desperate left has been reduced to using character assassination of Trump, his family, anyone in his administration and even his supporters as a means diminish his immense popularity with American voters.Here s a sampling of the left, hard at work trying to destroy our new president: Unfortunately, despite their best efforts, the left has been unable to turn Americans against President Trump and his new poll numbers are proving he s only becoming more popular as he continues to do what he promised during his campaign.Today, Rasmussen Reports daily Presidential Tracking Poll for Monday, April 17, shows that 50% of Likely U.S.
Voters approve of President Trump s job performance.
Fifty percent (50%) disapprove.This is the first time the president s overall approval rating has been back in the 50s in nearly a month.
Just after his inauguration, Trump s job approval peaked at 59% and remained in the 50s every day until early March.
It s gone as low as 42% since then.Here are former President Obama s approval ratings by comparison.On April 17 2009 the allegedly wildly popular Barack Obama s approval rating was at 55% after accomplishing absolutely nothing in office.
The latest figures for Trump include 30% who Strongly Approve of the way Trump is performing and 39% who Strongly Disapprove.
This gives him a Presidential Approval Index rating of -9.
