ankara ( reuters ) - turkish prosecutors said on thursday they were investigating allegations that president tayyip erdogan s family moved millions of dollars abroad to avoid taxes , saying there were doubts about the authenticity of documents behind the claims .
the chairman of the main opposition republican people s party ( chp ) , kemal kilicdaroglu , accused members of erdogan s family earlier this week of transferring $ 14 million to a company in the isle of man , holding up documents he said proved the transactions had taken place .
[ nl8n1nz43i ] erdogan dismissed the allegations as lies and said on thursday kilicdaroglu would pay the price .
erdogan has dominated turkish politics for almost 15 years and remains by far the country s most popular leader .
opponents accuse him of increasingly authoritarian conduct , especially since a failed military coup last year ; but the chp struggles to rally support in challenging the president .
the chp has not accused erdogan or his family members or any companies it says were involved in transactions of any criminal activity .
the ankara prosecutor s office said it was launching an investigation into the allegations and that an official from the company which kilicdaroglu named as the destination of erdogan family funds , bellway ltd , had called the documents fake .
it also asked the chp to hand over all documents .
ozgur ozel , deputy chairman of the chp , said the party would comply with the request from prosecutors .
the chp has also filed a parliamentary motion requesting an investigation into its allegations , but the assembly , dominated by erdogan s ruling ak party , rejected the motion on thursday .
