An elderly Jewish woman living in Paris was not even safe in her own apartment from a Muslim man who scaled the wall of her apartment and violently murdered her.
While the authorities have not yet named the motive, it s highly likely the Muslim man who killed the Orthodox Jewish woman while yelling, Alluha Akbar may have been motivated to commit such a hateful crime by the religion of peace In a violent attack causing trepidation amongst Paris Jewish community, a 66-year-old Orthodox woman, Sarah Halimi, was murdered to the cry of Allahu Akbar early Tuesday morning, pushed from the window of her top-floor apartment in Paris 11th arrondissement.The accused, a 27-year-old of Muslim origin known to police for a string of offenses, had broken into the apartment of his victim reportedly scaling the exterior wall from the floor below where he lived with his parents to stab his victim before throwing her to her death.The lifeless body of Ms. Halimi was found on the ground beneath her apartment, having been pushed to her death from her third story window during the attack which took place at approximately 4:30am.Three armed police were on the scene prior to the murder, according to neighbors, who also reported hearing the cry of Allahu Akbar at the moment of the crime.
Unconfirmed reports circulating on social media also suggest that Ms. Halimi had previously been harassed by a relative of the accused, and that she had been subjected to verbal abuse in the days leading up to the incident.
Neighbors claim that the accused had been radicalized and that police were waiting for an anti-terrorist unit to deal with the situation.French media have been covering the event with limited reference to the background of either the victim or the accused, instead characterizing the crime as the act of an unhinged individual.
Further details of the incident have been emerging in the local Jewish media, with the story now gaining traction in Israel.Whilst the motives behind this crime are not yet 100% clear, it represents a growing phenomenon of criminal acts being preceded by cries of Allahu Akbar ( Our God is Greater ) consistently explained by French media as the acts of d s quilibr s , the unbalanced a word fast entering the lexicon for such circumstances.
