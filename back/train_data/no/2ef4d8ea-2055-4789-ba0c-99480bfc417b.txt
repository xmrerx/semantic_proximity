london ( reuters ) - a british teenager was found guilty on monday of planning to drive a car into a crowd in the welsh capital cardiff , with a justin bieber concert and a shopping center among the list of possible targets for his islamic state-inspired attack .
the 17-year-old boy , who can not be named for legal reasons , wrote a martyrdom letter in which he said he was a soldier of the islamic state .
police found the letter in a rucksack in his bedroom which also contained a large knife and a hammer .
the crown prosecution service ( cps ) said he was planning an attack of a similar type to one near britain s parliament in march , where a man in a van drove into pedestrians on london s westminster bridge before stabbing a policeman .
this teenager s behavior over many months leaves no doubt that he intended to kill and maim as many people as possible in an attack reminiscent of the incident on westminster bridge , said sue hemming , head of the special crime and counter terrorism division at the cps .
he was also posting extremist content online that could have encouraged others to commit terrorist acts and downloading instructions on how to carry out lone wolf attacks .
the westminster attack was one of five major attacks this year that british authorities are treating as terrorism incidents .
five people including the policeman and the attacker , khalid masood , died in the westminster incident .
the cps said the welsh schoolboy had posted islamic state propaganda on his instagram account , and his instagram password was truck attack .
he researched possible targets including cardiff castle , a theater , a library and a shopping center , as well as the bieber gig , which took place in june .
the teenager admitted that he owned the knife and hammer and had written the letter , but denied intending to harm anyone .
he will be sentenced in january .
