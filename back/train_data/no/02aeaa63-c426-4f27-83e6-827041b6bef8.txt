stockholm ( reuters ) - sweden s center-right opposition no longer plans to bring a vote of no confidence in defence minister peter hultqvist over a botched it outsourcing deal , after new information came to light , the alliance said .
losing hultqvist , one of the government s most popular ministers , would have been a blow to prime minister stefan lofven , with sweden due to hold elections in just a year s time .
other parties can still go ahead with a vote , but they would not get the majority necessary to oust him .
lofven has already replaced two ministers in his minority center-left government over the it deal , and the opposition had also demanded the removal of hultqvist , who has maintained he has done nothing wrong .
however , the liberals and the center party have now changed their minds , saying new information showed hultqvist s involvement was not as serious as previously thought .
this new information means that we can t support a vote of no confidence , liberal party leader jan bjorklund told a news conference .
votes of no confidence are not common in sweden .
since 1980 , only seven have taken place and none of them has been successful .
