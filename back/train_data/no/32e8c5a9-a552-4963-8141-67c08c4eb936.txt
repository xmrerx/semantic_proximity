islamabad ( reuters ) - pakistan s anti-corruption agency will open a criminal investigation into former prime minister nawaz sharif and current finance minister ishaq dar , it said on thursday .
sharif was ousted in july after the supreme court deemed him unfit to hold office for not declaring a small source of income , and ordered the agency , the national accountability bureau ( nab ) , to instigate a criminal investigation into him , his family and dar .
the agency said its investigation would rely on the evidence collected by a supreme court-appointed six-man panel that was investigating the sharif family s wealth and included officers from powerful military intelligence agencies .
the chairman ( of ) nab directed that the prosecution of the cases will be followed up vigorously in the concerned accountability courts , the agency said in a statement .
sharif , his family , and dar have denied any wrongdoing .
the three-time premier said he never received the income that investigators said he did not declare .
sharif has said there was a conspiracy against him but did not identify anyone .
instead , he named long-time loyalist shahid khaqan abbasi as his replacement as prime minister until the next election , expected in mid-2018 .
pakistan has for decades been plagued by pervasive graft , as well as by rivalry between the military and civilian politicians .
the nab s conviction rates are notoriously low and sharif has multiple investigations by the agency pending against him , including one dating back to 1999 .
