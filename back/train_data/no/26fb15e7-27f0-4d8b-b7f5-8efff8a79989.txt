washington ( reuters ) - republican presidential candidate donald trump on tuesday won the endorsement of evangelical christian leader jerry falwell jr. for the party ’ s 2016 presidential nomination , the trump campaign said .
falwell , the president of liberty university in virginia and son of late televangelist jerry falwell sr. , picked trump because he believes the billionaire businessman could “ lead our country to greatness again , ” the campaign said in a statement .
trump has been vying with his chief rival , u.s .
senator ted cruz of texas , for the evangelical vote as the nomination race nears its first contest , the iowa caucuses , on monday .
on tuesday , trump celebrated the endorsement on twitter .
“ great honor- rev .
jerry falwell jr. of liberty university , one of the most respected religious leaders in our nation , has just endorsed me ! ” tweeted trump , who is a presbyterian .
the endorsement came a week after falwell introduced trump before a speech he gave at the christian university .
in his introduction , falwell said he saw similarities between trump and his father , including a penchant to “ speak his mind. ” trump ’ s speech at the university was not without controversy .
trump was criticized by many evangelicals for mistakenly referring to a book of the bible as “ two corinthians ” instead of “ second corinthians. ” critics said the misstep called into question trump ’ s christian credentials .
cruz , the son of a baptist preacher , made a joke of his opponent ’ s flub during a speech on monday with a riff on an old chrysler auto commercial : “ two corinthians walk into a bar - ah , yes , ricardo montalban - genuine corinthian leather ! ” ( reporting by megan cassella ; additional reporting by amy tennery and eric beech ; editing by doina chiacu and jonathan oatis ) sap is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of reuters news agency .
