vienna ( reuters ) - austria s anti-immigration freedom party ( fpo ) expelled one of its officials in tyrol province over reports that he had displayed nazi paraphernalia in the back of his pharmacy , a party spokesman said on wednesday .
the fpo , which is fighting with the social democrats for the second place in parliamentary elections on oct. 15 , has on previous occasions expelled provincial officials for owning nazi-related objects , which is illegal in austria .
in germany s election on sunday , the fpo s sister party afd won 12.6 percent of the vote , becoming the third-largest group in parliament and the first from the far right to win seats in the bundestag since the 1950s .
austria s fpo is poised to become kingmaker as a junior coalition party , with conservative front-runner sebastian kurz expected to gain around a third of the vote with his tough rhetoric on fighting immigration and islamic parallel societies .
martin hochstoeger stepped back from his post as a member of the fpo tyrol party executive after pictures were spread in austrian media of a marble slate engraved with a quote by adolf hitler , a swastika and a tally of a local vote in 1938 favoring austria s annexation by nazi germany .

i had to expel dr martin hochstoeger last night after internal deliberations , said the head of the fpo in tyrol , markus abwerzger , citing potential danger for the party s ethos .
a spokesman for prosecutors in tyrol s main city , innsbruck , said they were looking into the case .
public broadcaster orf said on its website hochstoeger had declined to comment .
austria long presented itself as the first victim of the nazis , a narrative initially supported by the allies , even though large parts of austrian society celebrated the 1938 annexation and many took on roles in the nazi war effort and the holocaust .
