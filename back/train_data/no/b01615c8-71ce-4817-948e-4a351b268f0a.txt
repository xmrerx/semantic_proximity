kampala ( reuters ) - at least one person died as police fired bullets and teargas to disperse a crowd of opposition supporters rallying on wednesday against plans to extend ugandan president yoweri museveni s rule .
police have broken up a series of protests in recent days against a bill to let the 73-year-old president stand again in 2021 elections - the constitution currently sets an age limit for candidates at 75 .
rights organizations and activists have criticized moves by several other long-serving african rulers , notably in rwanda , burundi and burkina faso , to stay in power by extending term limits .
police spokesman elly maate said one person died after officers fired bullets in the air to disperse a crowd gathering for what he called an illegal rally near a stadium in the southwestern town of rukungiri .
opposition party member ingrid turinawe and a local government official both said two men died .
turinawe said a bullet also struck a vehicle carrying opposition leader kizza besigye .
he was not hurt but an image showed a gaping hole in the rear window of his vehicle .
a museveni-allied legislator introduced the bill to remove the presidential age limit last month .
museveni met mps backing the measure last week and for the first time openly expressed his support for the legislation , several local media outlets reported .
