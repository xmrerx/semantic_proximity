this is it this is our last chance to turn the conservative ship around and put america first !
chances are really great that if hillary is elected in 2016 that she ll spend not 4 but 8 years in the white house .
get ready for 8 more years of the obama policy .
want gun control ?
want soft socialism ?
if you want these two devastating things then vote hillary but if you don t then you need to back our candidate and fight hard as hell for a win in november .
there is no perfect candidate so get over the things that you don t find perfect about trump .
i honestly had a difficult time at first when i looked into romney s past political positions but felt he was a bright ray of conservative sunshine compared to obama .
please listen to the fantastic speech on unity given by andrew breitbart that ll hit home .
if you don t back our candidate then you are giving us liberal supreme court justices , gun control and soft socialism .
please listen and share !
