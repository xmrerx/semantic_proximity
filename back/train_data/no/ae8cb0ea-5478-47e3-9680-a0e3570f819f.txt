brasilia ( reuters ) - a supreme court injunction on friday temporarily blocked the extradition of cesare battisti , an italian left-wing former guerrilla convicted of murder in his country .
the decision by justice luiz fux prevents the brazilian government from extraditing battisti until the full court can rule on habeas corpus request from battisti s lawyers , a ruling that is expected within two weeks .
the former guerrilla was briefly arrested this month when trying to leave the country .
battisti faces life in prison in italy , where he was convicted of four murders committed in the 1970s , when he belonged to a guerilla group called armed proletarians for communism .
he escaped from prison in 1981 and lived in france before fleeing to brazil to avoid being extradited to italy .
brazil s supreme court authorized battisti s extradition in 2009 , but he was not sent back to italy because former leftist president luis inacio lula da silva granted him refugee status on his last day in office in 2010 .
