Senators from both parties were frustrated with the intel chiefs who refused to answer their most important questions during Wednesday s Senate Intelligence Committee hearing.
Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz), like many of his colleagues, was clearly fed up with their silence.McCain asked Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats about a recent article published in the Washington Post that said he told his associates that Donald Trump had asked him to intervene in the Russia probe on his behalf.
Coats insisted that he couldn t talk about what had already been published by the Post, and everywhere else at this point, in a public hearing.
Obviously irritated, McCain couldn t help but notice the Orwellian nature of the world we are living in today.
You know, it just shows what kind of an Orwellian existence that we live in, McCain exclaimed.
I mean, it s detailed as you know from reading the story as to when you met, what you discussed, et cetera, et cetera.
And yet, here in a public hearing before the American people, we can t talk about what was described in detail in this morning s Washington Post.
Coats again argued that he couldn t talk about private conversations publicly, but this didn t take away McCain s aggravation at the current state of affairs.
I m certainly not blaming you but it certainly is an interesting town in which we exist, McCain said.He then added that whether the information published by the Post was classified or not, it really makes no difference now as it has already been made public.
So, it s kind of a moot point.You can watch John McCain marvel at the Orwellian existence that we live in, here:Featured image via video screen capture
