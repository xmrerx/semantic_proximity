oh the irony , of our nobel-peace-prize-recipient-in-chief standing in front of a building representing some of the worst oppression and human rights violations in the world .
i don t know , maybe it s just me , but does obama look like he s imitating a certain someone , that he likely holds up as an icon in that photo ?
only 273 days one of the first places i visited on a government-sanctioned educational tour to cuba several years back was the plaza de la revolucion , a hideous expanse of concrete at the center of havana that makes , say , tiananmen square look positively charming .
it was there that president obama was featured in that now-infamous photo in front of a giant mural of che guevara.it was unfortunate that the president lent his imprimatur to guevara , a totalitarian who was responsible for the death of thousands .
but , in some ways , the photo-op was even worse than it looked .
because as we learned on our tour , the building that guevara s face adorns is home to the cuban ministry of the interior.unlike our own ministry of the interior , cuba s is not charged with innocuous tasks like protecting endangered waterfowl .
rather , it operates the national revolutionary police , which , in addition to keeping law and order on the streets , harasses and arrests dissidents , and suppresses counter-revolutionary activities .
in other words , it s cuba s version of the stasi.president obama boasted on his trip that he wasn t going to tell cubans to tear something down , a reference to president reagan s famous exhortation to tear down the berlin wall .
of course , there s no wall only ocean separating cuba from the rest of the world to tear down .
but obama could have at least told castro to tear down the monument to repression that he was happily photographed in front of.by ethan epstein weekly standard
