john podesta is the guardian of the clintons just like valerie jarrett was for the obamas .
he was instrumental during the 2016 election as the clinton campaign chair and was exposed when the wikileaks hack happened .
he was just interviewed by the house intel committee regarding the russia scam and was asked about it in the heated debate below : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=z9u5zxvytqajohn podesta is not just the former chairman of the hillary clinton s presidential campaign , but also a central figure in the ongoing narrative of russian meddling in the us election of 2016 .
his hacked emails were at the heart of what some have called a coordinated news campaign led by wikileaks , and so he met with the house intelligence panel yesterday behind closed doors.this morning he appeared on fox business to discuss the russian interference , allegations of collusion with trump campaign and more with host maria bartiromo in what became a testy debate that perfectly exemplifies the divided positions that so many americans hold right now.bartiromo showed skepticism over the russia claims rightfully so ! .
and there may be no other individual that best embodies the clinton s web of influence for good and bad than mr. podesta .
he s the definition of a weasel.bartiromo aggressively attacked podesta and democrats for what she said were deeper ties with russia , specifically asking about podesta s investment portfolio : this is just one example of a deep tie to russia : russia gave john podesta 35 millions dollars ( 1 billion rubles ) while he advised hillary clinton and barack obama.russia gave john podesta 35 millions dollars ( 1 billion rubles ) while he advised hillary clinton and barack obama .
