united nations/washington ( reuters ) - the united states has given china a draft resolution for tougher u.n. sanctions on north korea and is hoping for a quick vote on it by the u.n. security council , a western diplomat said on tuesday .
a senior official of the trump administration confirmed efforts were under way to negotiate a new u.n. resolution , but added that there had been no agreement .
we re trying to get another one , said the official , who did not want to be identified .
they re not there yet .
details of the draft given to china last week were not immediately available , but the united states is keen to step up global sanctions to pressure north korea to give up a weapons program aimed developing nuclear-tipped missiles capable of hitting the united states .
among the steps it wants is a tightening of restrictions on north korea s supply of refined petroleum , which is capped by previous u.n. sanctions at 2 million barrels a year .
china , which supplies most of north korea s oil , has backed successive rounds of u.n. sanctions but has resisted past u.s. calls to cut off supplies to its neighbor .
its embassy in washington and foreign ministry in beijing did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
the united states has also called on the u.n. security council to blacklist 10 ships for circumventing sanctions on north korea , documents seen by reuters on tuesday showed .
the documents said vessels had been conducting ship-to-ship transfers of refined petroleum products to north korean vessels or transporting north korean coal in violation of existing u.n. sanctions .
earlier on tuesday , china responded to the announcement of a new u.s. national security strategy this week that branded beijing a competitor seeking to challenge u.s. power by saying that cooperation between it and washington would lead to a win-win outcome for both sides , but confrontation would bring mutual losses .
