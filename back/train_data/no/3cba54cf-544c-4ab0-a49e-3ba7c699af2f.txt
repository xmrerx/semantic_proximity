beirut ( reuters ) - iran said on saturday that the resignation of lebanese prime minister saad hariri would create tension in lebanon and the region .
hariri accused iran and its lebanese ally hezbollah of sowing strife in the arab world in his resignation statement earlier on saturday .
the resigning lebanese prime minister s repetition of the unrealistic and unfounded accusations of the zionists , saudis and americans against iran is an indication that this resignation is a new scenario for creating tension in lebanon and the region , iranian foreign ministry spokesman bahram qassemi said in a statement published on the ministry website .
but we believe that the resistant people of lebanon will pass this stage easily .
hariri s resignation comes only a day after he met ali akbar velayati , an advisor to iranian supreme leader ayatollah ali khamenei , in beirut .
the sudden resignation of mr. hariri and his statement in another country is not only surprising and regrettable but is also an indication of his playing a game designed by those who want ill for the region , and the winner of this game is not arabic or muslim countries but the zionists , qassemi said .
