phnom penh ( reuters ) - cambodian prime minister hun sen encouraged the united states and european union on friday to freeze the assets of cambodian leaders abroad in response to his government s crackdown on the opposition and civil society .
hun sen , the strongman who has ruled cambodia for more than three decades , has taken a strident anti-western line ahead of a 2018 election and has dismissed donor criticism of the dissolution of the main opposition party .
the united states and european union have suspended funding for next year s election and washington has put visa curbs on some cambodian leaders .
there is no current proposal for asset freezes by either the united states or european union , but some lawmakers have floated the idea .
i encourage the european union and united states to freeze the wealth of cambodian leaders abroad , hun sen told a group of athletes in phnom penh , the capital .
hun sen said he has no money abroad and any actions by the eu and the u.s. would not hurt him .
the u.s. embassy made no comment .
eu ambassador george edgar said on friday there had been no decision on further measures by the bloc .
the supreme court dissolved the opposition cambodia national rescue party ( cnrp ) last month at the request of the government , on the grounds it was plotting to seize power .
hun sen accused kem sokha , the leader of the cnrp of a u.s.-backed anti-government plot .
the opposition leader and the united states denied that .
china , cambodia s largest aid donor , has leant its support to hun sen , saying it respects cambodia s right to defend its national security .
