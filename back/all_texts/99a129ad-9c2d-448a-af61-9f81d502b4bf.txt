If there s one news organization that Donald Trump can usually always rely upon to be in his corner, it s Fox News.
The media branch of the Republican party will pretty much always show bias towards any Republican candidate or conservative ideal.
Most of the time even without trying to find any facts of any kind.However, it looks as though Trump is going to hate the new poll that Fox News revealed showing who, according to them and their viewers, won the first presidential debate.Winning with 61% of viewers polled was none other than Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton.In fact, Trump was only able to garner 21% of those polled to say that he won, with 12% saying it was a tie.New Fox Poll: Who won first debate?
#SpecialReport https://t.co/lmsmO06yfj pic.twitter.com/coMvS84lCj Fox News (@FoxNews) September 30, 2016If you re any good at math, that s not even close.
Not even remotely close.
Hillary got well more than half of those polled saying that she definitively won, while Trump probably held onto the few who were going to say that he won no matter what.The bar is set so incredibly low for Trump, too.
If he kept his pants on, those 21% pulling for Trump were still going to say that he won.
So, for Hillary to sweep up this debate as a win in her column with even Fox News viewers, well, that s bad news for Trump and his floundering campaign.It will be interesting to see how he behaves in the next debate to try to sway viewers.Featured Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images, Twitter
