manchester , england ( reuters ) - gibraltar is very concerned by violence in catalonia after spanish riot police burst into polling stations and seized ballot papers to prevent a banned referendum on a split from spain , the chief minister of the rock said .
police hit people with batons , fired rubber bullets into crowds and forcibly removed would-be voters from polling stations in actions that were condemned internationally but were described by the government as proportionate .
the referendum , declared illegal by spain s central government , has thrown the country into its worst constitutional crisis in decades and deepened a centuries-old rift between madrid and barcelona .
catalan officials said over 460 people had been injured in the police crackdown and the spanish interior ministry said 12 police had been hurt .
