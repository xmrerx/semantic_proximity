The 20th season of South Park was largely centered around Donald Trump s campaign, with the show heavily mocking him at every turn.
But there was a problem, according to the show s creators it just wasn t funny compared to the actual stupid things The Donald (and his administration) does.
It s tricky now because satire has become reality, Parker recently told Australian TV show 7.30, adding that Trump is always eight steps ahead of them in terms of wacky behavior: It s really hard to make fun of and in the last season of South Park, which just ended a month-and-a-half ago, we were really trying to make fun of what was going on but we couldn t keep up and what was actually happening was much funnier than anything we could come up with.
Parker says that in future seasons, the intend to back off and let them do their comedy while the pair do theirs because Trump is just too hard to mock.In a world where the Trump administration has threatened to invade Mexico, started an international incident with Australia, and even invented a term intended to normalize lies alternative facts it s easy to see their point.
No matter how hard anyone tries, the Trump team somehow manages to stay one step ahead of comedy.Watch Stone and Parker discuss the difficulty of mocking Trump below:Featured image via screengrab
