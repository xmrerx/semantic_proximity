skopje ( reuters ) - a senior official of macedonia s secret police was sentenced to 18 months in prison for destroying evidence that could have helped identify who was behind a wiretapping scandal that brought down a previous government .
goran grujevski , who ran the secret police department conducting the wiretapping operations , was found guilty of destroying documents from the period when the wiretapping took place .
he is awaiting extradition after being arrested in greece last month .
macedonia was thrown into political turmoil in 2015 , when opposition parties accused then-prime minister nikola gruevski and his counter-intelligence chief of orchestrating the wiretapping of more than 20,000 people .
the political crisis led the european union to broker an agreement in which parties agreed to hold early elections and set up a special prosecutor to investigate the wiretappings .
wednesday s verdict is the first ruling in a case the special prosecutor opened two years ago .
in june , macedonia s special prosecutor filed charges against 94 people , including former high government officials , over their involvement in possible crimes revealed by the surveillance scandal .
macedonia s new government , which took over in may , said it would assist in investigating and bringing to justice the perpetrators of the wiretapping scandal .
