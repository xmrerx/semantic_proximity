Just when you thought Ann Coulter couldn t be any more vile than she s shown herself to be, she showed herself yet again to be the lowest form of human scum.The 50-something washed up Trump supporter decided that the only way her miserable self could get attention was to make fun of a slain soldier s dad, simply because he s Muslim.I thought Republicans were all about supporting the troops and their families?
I guess not.This is the tweet the mean spirited New Yorker sent out:You know what this convention really needed?
An angry Muslim with a thick accent like Fareed Zacaria.
Ann Coulter (@AnnCoulter) July 29, 2016Coulter is referring to Khizr Khan, whose son, a Purple Heart recipient, died in 2004 while fighting for his country in Iraq after a suicide bomber attacked his unit.And still, after all that, Republicans found a way to make fun of someone who dares to be different than them.In the eyes of conservatives, it doesn t matter who someone is and why they re on stage the only thing they focus on is their race, their religion, and their skin color.If this is the best Republicans can do, attacking military families, they are in for a rude awakening come November.
They are finally being exposed as the faux patriotic, racist demogauges they have always truly been.Congrats, GOP.
A 10 times New York Times bestseller has sunk so low as to be worst than pond scum.
You have a truly great ally in this fight not.November can t come fast enough.
Once Trump loses (assuming Democrats are inspired enough to actually get out and vote) racism can be finally put on the back burner as the country will move on and continue to progress, and loser conservatives like Ann Coulter will no longer have any legitimacy.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
