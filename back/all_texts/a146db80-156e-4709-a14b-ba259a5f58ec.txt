As a Catholic, I m not sure what offends me more, my fellow Catholics who would vote for an anti-LIFE, lying criminal who has put our entire nation s security in jeopardy, or a Catholic who would vote for a woman whose campaign team mocks my faith WikiLeaks has released another 1,000+ hacked emails from Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta.
The anti-secrecy organization announced part three of their leak on Tuesday afternoon:RELEASE: The Podesta Emails Part 3 (1190 new emails) #HillaryClinton #PodestaEmails #PodestaEmails3 https://t.co/wzxeh70oUm pic.twitter.com/75jVhpvtX8 WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 11, 2016Amongst the newly released documents, one email exchange in particular should draw the ire of conservatives and American Catholics specifically.The 2011 email, entitled Conservative Catholicism , comes from John Halpin, a senior fellow at the left-wing Center for American Progress (CAP), and is addressed to Jennifer Palmieri, formerly of the CAP and current Director of Communications for the 2016 Hillary Clinton presidential campaign, and John Podesta.
The email, in which traditional Catholic beliefs are derided as backwards , drips with contempt for Catholic Americans.
Many of the most powerful elements of the conservative movement are all Catholic (many converts) from the SC and think tanks to the media and social groups, Halpin writes to Podesta.
They must be attracted to the systematic thought and severely backwards gender relations and must be totally unaware of Christian democracy.
Palmieri piles onto the Catholic bashing in her response.
I imagine they think it is the most socially acceptable politically conservative religion, Palmieri writes.
Their rich friends wouldn t understand if they became evangelicals.
Imagine the same had been written about Muslims.
