WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Wednesday said the hurricane moving toward Florida and Puerto Rico looks to be record-breaking and said a meeting with congressional leaders would show whether they could work out challenges the country faced.
“We have many many things that are on the plate.
Hopefully we can solve them,” he said during a meeting with Republican and Democratic congressional leaders.
“Maybe we won’t be able to,” he said.
Asked if he would accept a three-month debt ceiling increase tied to disaster relief funding, Trump said: “We’ll see.”
