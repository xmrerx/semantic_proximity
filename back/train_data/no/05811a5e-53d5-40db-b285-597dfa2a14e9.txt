the film came under heavy criticism in the us media at the time , with democratic party officials and mainstream media labelling it as a partisan hit piece .
while clinton proponents and critics of this film maintain that it s part of a vast right-wing conspiracy , this film produced by citizens for honest government does cover actual events which took place in and around arkansas during the clinton s reign as governor there , and contains numerous facts and revelations regarding those events including a massive cocaine smuggling operation into mena , arkansas under the watch of the clinton governorship .
