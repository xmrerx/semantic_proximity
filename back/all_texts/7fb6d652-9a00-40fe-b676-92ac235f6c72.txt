A backlash ensued after Donald Trump launched a sexist rant against Kirsten Gillibrand Thursday morning, saying that the Democratic Senator would do anything for a campaign contribution.
Trump was calling Gillibrand a whore.White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders somehow denied that Trump s tweet was sexist.
There is no way that is sexist at all, Sanders told reporters.Then Sanders tried to explain what Trump really meant (we all know what he really meant).
According to Sanders, Trump was merely accusing Gillibrand of being controlled by contributions, and hammering home his pledge to drain the swamp in Washington, according to The Hill.
I think that the president is very obvious, she said.
This is the same sentiment the president has expressed many times before when he has exposed the corruption of the entire political system.
Sanders claims that Trump does not owe Gillibrand an apology if his words were taken as sexist.
I think only if your mind is in the gutter you would have read it that way, so no, she said.Watch:Gillibrand called on Trump to resign after Trump s accusers came back into the spotlight by hosting a press conference in which they called for an investigation into his past behavior.
Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office begging for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump.
Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED!
Trump tweeted this morning.Gillibrand responded to Trump s attack, saying that she won t be silenced.
You cannot silence me or the millions of women who have gotten off the sidelines to speak out about the unfitness and shame you have brought to the Oval Office, she tweeted.Yeah, Trump, you called her a whore.Image via screen capture.
