WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland s new prime minister, Mateusz Morawiecki, said on Tuesday in his first policy speech that he was opposed to a multi-speed Europe and that Warsaw wants to have a say in forming the future of the bloc.
Deeper euro zone integration is sometimes called a multi-speed Europe because it would lead to different rates of convergence within the 28-member bloc.
