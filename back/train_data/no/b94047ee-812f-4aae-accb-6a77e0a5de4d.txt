it s a free country , and the nineteen ( and counting ) members of congress who are planning to boycott president-elect trump s inauguration are certainly within their rights .
so even is rep. john lewis , d-ga. , who said over the weekend that trump s election ( or his presidency ) is illegitimate .
that doesn t make his comment true or honorable or helpful to the nation s well-being , but he is free to say it.reps .
lewis , jerry nadler , d-n.y. , barbara lee , d-calif. , katherine clark , d-mass. , and the other inaugural boycotters are certainly not alone in finding trump uniquely awful .
they are not alone in believing the president-elect has gone out of his way to offend people .
probably they also recognize that , in the safe districts they all represent , an inaugural boycott might even be a political winner.but this is also part of a pattern .
lewis and lee , along with some other democratic lawmakers at the time , also boycotted to make a point when president george w. bush was inaugurated in 2001 .
the washington post reported at the time that lewis thought it would be hypocritical to attend bush s swearing-in because he doesn t believe bush is the true elected president .
maybe they had a better excuse that time , as there was so much lingering acrimony surrounding the florida recount .
but we re talking about elected members of congress who have refused to accept two republican presidencies in a row .
is there always a good enough excuse whenever a republican wins ?
at what point is it fair to ask whether some people are just not committed to democratic or legal processes at all unless the results come out as they hope ?
