While it s not nice to criticize people, per se, for attempting to sing one of the hardest songs ever to sing, one person s rendition of the Star Spangled Banner at a Donald Trump rally in Eugene, Oregon, was flawlessly criticized without words.Zach Lapidus posted a video to Facebook of a split screen of himself on piano pretending to accompany the person singing the National Anthem.To be honest, once the key modulations were hit they were on point, but there were modulations on nearly every line of the song.
In fact, almost every key seemed to have been hit at one point or another during the song, and Lapidus seemed to nail every single one of those key changes.The Star Spangled Banner is a tough song to play by any musician, and even harder for vocalists, because the range from the lowest notes to the highest notes are nearly two octaves.
Credit should always be given to those who attempt to sing the National Anthem, and even more credit given to those who can do it well.
Unfortunately, this was not one of those times.This article isn t so much to make fun of the singer although, she is at a Trump rally and that should be ridiculed, but rather this is to compliment Lapidus on his accompaniment and ability to pick up on all the modulations.
Well done.Maybe this is the version of the National Anthem taught at the Trump School of Music.
