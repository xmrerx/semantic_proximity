the bipartisan congressional language creates a headache for trump and his deputies because it flips the politically difficult problem from congress to the department of homeland security of deciding whether to provide extra wage-cutting h-2b contract workers to companies or else to improve job opportunities for trump s blue-collar voters.the new rule helps business groups offset rising pressure for wage increases , just 18 months before the mid-term elections when voters will vet the success or not of trump s buy american , hire american policies.the h-2b language was hidden deep in the draft 2017 supplemental budget which is to face house and senate votes this week and it surprised opponents of the legislation .
in december 2016 , ryan had agreed to trim the program when the partial 2017 budget deal was announced just one month after blue-collar voters backed donald trump s campaign promise of a low-immigration , high-wage national economic policy.apparently nothing is going to change , as long as speaker ryan remains at the helm .
