on friday night s episode of hbo s real time , host bill maher responded to guest sen. ben sasse s question , would you like to come work in the field with us ?
with the n-word .
this man is beyond disgusting in his past comments but this is the absolute worst .
he responded to the audience groans by saying it was a joke .
so this jackwagon jokes at the expense of those in the black community shame on him !
he s in the same boat with kathy griffin when he makes a joke at the expense of others.remember when maher mocked ann coulter for supporting trump ? they laughed at us when we said @ realdonaldtrump would win this morning they 're too devastated to get out of bed. # maga # trumptrain pic.twitter.com/a0xapdid7k harlan z. hill ( @ harlan ) november 9 , 2016let s hope bill maher is treated just as any other person in entertainment has been treated if they go down this path .
the left has a double standard when it comes to this so we doubt anything will happen to punish maher for his racist comment on live tv .
