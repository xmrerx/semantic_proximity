watch barack obama identify himself as the leader of the black lives matter terror group in video below : in a movement like black lives matter , there s always gon na be folks who say things that are stupid or imprudent .
and i don t think you can hold well-meaning activists who are doing the right thing and peacefully protesting responsible for everything that is uttered at a protest site .
i would just say that everyone who s concerned about police shootings or racial bias in the criminal justice system that maintaining a truthful and serious and respectful tone is going to help mobilize american society to bring about real change .
and that is our ultimate objective .
spoken like a true leader of a radical , disruptive , chaotic movement there are legitimate issues that have been raised .
and there s data and evidence to back up the concerns that are being expressed by these protesters.was barack referring to this data ? or maybe he was referring to this data : we d love to see barack s data , since every legitimate data we ve seen clearly shows more whites with a gun are killed by police than blacks with a gun .
