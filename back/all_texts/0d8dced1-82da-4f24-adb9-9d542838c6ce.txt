Yep the guys who is caught on tape openly advocated for killing cops is the same guy MSNBC hired to host his own show.
It s the same guy who makes regular visits to our White House to discuss strategy with our Race Baiter In Chief.
Imagine if this was a white man calling for a group of people to kill cops.
Would his presence at the White House be tolerated by a single American?
Yet, in the crazy world of the Left, his presence is not only tolerated, it is deemed necessary to stir up the vote for Democrats in the black community in 2016.
We all know that without a single black candidate running for President, the only way to get the same voters to the polls that came out in droves for Barack is to stir it up on the streets.
By pitting whites against blacks and and blacks against cops they believe their giving the black voter a compelling reason to vote for Hillary or Bernie.Here s Watters interview with Sharpton where denies saying he believes in offing the cops.
Here s the clip showing Al Sharpton saying the things he denies saying: I don t believe in marching.
I believe in offing the pigs.
Well they got pigs out here!
What I believe in, I do!
Sharpton exclaimed, encouraging the laughing audience to physically take on law enforcement.
He added, Do what you believe in.
Or shut up and admit you ve lost your courage and guts to stand up.
Ain t nobody holding you.

Well off him.
Plenty of crackers walking right around here tonight.
