WASHINGTON (Reuters) - National security adviser H.R.
McMaster said on Tuesday that U.S. President Donald Trump did not have an inappropriate conversation or one that caused a lapse in national security when he met with senior Russian officials last week at the White House.
“I stand by my statement that I made yesterday,” McMaster told a White House briefing.
“What I’m saying is really the premise of that (Washington Post) article was false, that in any way the president had a conversation that was inappropriate or resulted in any kind of lapse in national security.”
