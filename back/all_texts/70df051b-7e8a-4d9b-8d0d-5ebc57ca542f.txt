YES mainstream fake news media, there is a clear connection between violent, anti-white #BlackLivesMatter rhetoric & the #BLMKidnapping.

Do they really have no business injecting their political views on their audiences?
Do their audiences really care about their political positions?For crying out loud, this story should rock every human being to the core, but that s not how the Left sees it.
Instead of focusing on the nightmare this young man endured at the hands of 4 racist, hateful thugs who have been emboldened by a movement inspired by our current President, they obsess over the damage Black Lives Matter may endure over bad press by conservatives who brought this story to light on Twitter.Here is Gizmodo s contribution to the story of this poor mentally disabled young man:Alt-right trolls use Chicago kidnapping to make some shit up https://t.co/WP3L7MdBQh pic.twitter.com/oSlRP5m0vP Gizmodo (@Gizmodo) January 5, 2017
