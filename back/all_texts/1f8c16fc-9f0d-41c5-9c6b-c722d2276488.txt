BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday welcomed French President Emmanuel Macron s speech on European Union reform, which contained a lot of material for necessary debate on the issue, her spokesman said.
Germany shares Macron s view that the EU needs reforms.
The details of reforms must be discussed, added the spokesman, Steffen Seibert.
This discussion is necessary and sensible, Seibert told a regular government news conference in Berlin, adding that the leaders would have a chance to talk at an EU meeting in Tallinn on Thursday.
