While Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. s life and legacy are deservedly well-celebrated now, that was not always how he was viewed.
Especially by those in authority.King was shaking up business as usual, and many, many people didn t like that.
You can t change the world without ruffling a few feathers, and he definitely did that.In fact, here s an uncensored letter from the FBI to Dr. King that was posted by The New York Times from the National Archives.It read: KING,In view of your low grade, abnormal personal behavior I will not dignify your name with either a Mr. or a Reverend or a Dr. And, your last name calls to mind only the type of King such as KingHenry the VIII and his countless acts of adultery and immoral conduct lower than that of a beast.

You know what it is.
They are basically telling Dr. King to kill himself, and giving him a deadline or they ll out him, so to speak for all these allegedly evil doings.
It s absurd, to be blunt.
Absolutely disgusting, to be honest.While the nation praises Dr. King today, we cannot forget how ugly the past truly was, and horribly he was treated.
This letter was sent only about 50 years ago.
So, we ve come a long way in a short amount of time, but we still have such a long way to go.Featured image via J. Wilds/Keystone/Getty Images
