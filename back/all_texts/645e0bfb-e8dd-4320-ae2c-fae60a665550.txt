Rep. Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, just double dog dared the White House to let Sally Yates testify.Speaking to MSNBC s Andrea Mitchell on Wednesday, Schiff said, the person that is in the best position to talk about the events that led up to his [Mike Flynn s] firing is Sally Yates.
Schiff told Mitchell that he has asked for Yates, who was the acting attorney general until Donald Trump fired her for defying him, to testify on what she told the White House regarding the disgraced former national security adviser s interactions with Russia.
She is more than willing to testify, we have asked her to testify, the White House says at least publicly they want her to testify, Schiff said.
There is a letter sitting on the desk of my chairman that I ve signed, requesting that hearing to be rescheduled, and we are waiting for a response.
Yates was scheduled to testify last month but Rep. Devin Nunes (R-CA), chairman of the committee, suddenly canceled the hearing without warning.
White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer keeps claiming that Trump wants Yates to testify and Schiff called their bluff on Wednesday.
Sean Spicer has said he would like Sally Yates to testify, so let s hold Sean Spicer to his word, Schiff said.
Let s bring her in and allow her to tell the American people just what led to Michael Flynn s firing and what she may know about any conversation he had with the Russian ambassador on the subject of relief from Obama sanctions on Russia over its intervention to help Donald Trump.
According to Schiff, the only thing keeping her from testifying is that Nunes hasn t rescheduled the hearing yet.
