wow !
a chinese artist decided it would be a great idea to exploit the refugees by having pillars decorated with the lifejackets used by them .
this nut job flew in thousands of life jackets for this obscene display .
you have to wonder what this guy was thinking when he had all guests at the charity event don emergency blankets .
yes , that s charlize theron taking a selfie with her gold blanket on .
unreal !
the liberal elites don t get how horrible this has been for all of europe and for those who ve died trying to get to the shores of greece .
a film charity event held alongside an installation in berlin by the chinese artist ai weiwei has sparked anger.according to artnet , the cinema for peace fundraiser took place at the berlin konzerthaus , whose pillars the artist decorated as part of his installation safe passage with 14,000 lifejackets flown in from lesbos , greece , where almost 450,000 refugees arrived in 2015 on their way into the eu : fundraiser guests , including actor charlize theron and pussy riot member nadya tolokonnikova , were encouraged to don emergency thermal blankets similar to those given to refugees.in a facebook post , tim renner , berlin s culture secretary , was highly critical of the sight of dinner guests at a star-studded gala posing in the blankets at the party.there are better ways for ai weiwei to take a political stand than posing as a drowned infant when ai weiwei illustrates the dimensions of terror outside [ the gala ] with 14,000 life jackets from lesbos , it is perhaps not subtle but effective and justified ; but when the guests of cinema for peace are prompted by the organiser to don emergency blankets for a group photo , even if understood as an act of solidarity , it has a clearly obscene element , he said.ai weiwei , whose recent work has focused on the migration crisis , was criticised two weeks ago for recreating a photo of the drowned syrian toddler alan kurdi for the magazine india today in which the artist lies face down on a beach .
he maintained that his work was intended to defend the dignity of the refugees.via : the guardian
