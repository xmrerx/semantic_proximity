JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s former vice president Emmerson Mnangagwa, who was fired by President Robert Mugabe this week, is safe and will travel to South Africa very soon , the head of the war veterans Chris Mutsvangwa said on Wednesday.
Mnangagwa s removal on Monday was a boost for Mugabe s wife, Grace, who has been a vocal critic of the former vice president and is seen as a potential successor to her husband.
Mutsvangwa, a close ally of Mnangagwa, told reporters in Johannesburg that Grace was behind the purge of Mnangagwa and his allies.
