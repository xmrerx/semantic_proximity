WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has offered the post of secretary of housing and urban development to former presidential candidate Ben Carson, who will consider it over the Thanksgiving holiday, a Carson spokesman said on Tuesday.
“The president-elected asked him to consider it and he’s considering it,” Carson spokesman Armstrong Williams said.
Carson, a retired surgeon, dropped out of the 2016 presidential race in March and backed Trump.
