Tennessee Titans Delanie Walker just turned off thousands of NFL fans by dissing anyone who objects to the players kneeling during the national anthem Delanie Walker: First off, I m going to say this: We re not disrespecting the military, the men and women that serve in the Army.
That s not what it s all about, Titans tight end Delanie Walker said.
If you look at most of the guys in here I ve been in the USO.
I support the troops.
This is not about that.
It s about equal rights, and that s all everyone is trying to show, is that we all care about each other.
And the fans that don t want to come to the game?
I mean, OK. Bye.
I mean, if you feel that s something, we re disrespecting you, don t come to the game.
You don t have to.
No one s telling you to come to the game.
It s your freedom of choice to do that.
After his comments were reported he tweeted out Y all mad??
and got mostly angry responses from over 300 fans:Y all mad??

That s their choice.
That s the beauty of this country, Ryan said.
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and everyone s opinion is equal.
So right, wrong or indifferent, that s the beauty of this country that everyone should have equal rights and equal opinions on what they want.
If they don t want to watch, that s their choice.
That s perfect.
