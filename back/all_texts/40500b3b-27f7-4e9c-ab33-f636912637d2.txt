Arizona Senator John McCain seems to be the lone patriot left in the GOP right now, along with perhaps South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham.
It seems McCain has had just about enough of the shady shenanigans regarding the so-called investigation into the Trump campaign s ties to Russia and possible collusion.
During an interview on Wednesday, McCain called for a new, independent commission, saying to Greta Van Susteren on MSNBC: It s a bizarre situation, and what I think, the reason why I m calling for this select committee or a special committee, is I think that this back-and-forth and what the American people have found out so far that no longer does the Congress have credibility to handle this alone.
And I don t say that lightly.
These tough remarks come as things heat up on Capitol Hill regarding Russia, with the Republican Chair of the House Intelligence Committee, Devin Nunes (R-CA), and the Ranking Democrat, Adam Schiff (D-CA), now openly feuding over how things are being handled.
This is especially true since Nunes decided to brief Trump the very subject of this investigation before briefing his own committee.It s high time the rest of the Republican Party grew a pair and put country before party and put a stop to this nonsense.
Impeach Trump, investigate his entire administration, and if/when criminal wrongdoing is found, prosecute them.Watch the video below:Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
