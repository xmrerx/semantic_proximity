harvard law professor emeritus alan dershowitz was on msnbc to make a statement on the 9th circuit opinion : he stated that the 9th circuit court of appeals ruling against president trump s immigration order is not a solid decision .
and looks like it s based more on policy than on constitutionality .
look , this is not a solid decision .
this is a decision that looks like it s based more on policy than on constitutionality .
there are many , many flaws .
he added , i think this court opinion will not ultimately be sustained by the supreme court .
take , for example , the argument that it s an establishment of religion , because it favors christians or other religious minorities .
in 1944 we passed the war refugee act , which specifically was designed to rescue a hundred thousand jews , and everybody knew the purpose was to rescue jews .
that didn t establish judaism as the state religion of the united states .
i think the establishment argument will fail in the supreme court .
i think the standing arguments may fail in the supreme court .
