Donald Trump is so petty about not getting his way on healthcare that he is literally hoping that our healthcare system fails.On Friday, House Republicans were forced to cancel a floor vote on their Trumpcare bill for the second time because it was heading for a massive defeat.It was a humiliating blow for a party that controls the House, Senate, and the White House.The Republican healthcare plan would have repealed the Affordable Care Act.
Over 20 million Americans would have lost their health insurance and premiums would have skyrocketed.Only 17 percent of Americans supported the bill, which makes it far less popular than the Affordable Care Act.Trump immediately reacted by blaming Democrats, but again, Republicans control Congress so that excuse won t fly.On Saturday morning, Trump reacted again by expressing his hope that the healthcare system will collapse and told everyone not to worry because he will create a plan for the people, even though his previous attempt would have hurt millions.ObamaCare will explode and we will all get together and piece together a great healthcare plan for THE PEOPLE.
Do not worry!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 25, 2017What you just witnessed is a sitting president literally desiring the failure of our healthcare system.
Also, notice that Trump has stopped saying that the Affordable Care Act is imploding and is instead now saying that it will explode.
It sounds like Trump just admitted that the Affordable Care Act was not crumbling as he previously claimed.
Now he is just making a prediction.Of course, Twitter users responded by humiliating Trump for failing to gut the Affordable Care Act and torched him for hoping that healthcare fails in America.
@realDonaldTrump To be clear: Trump s plan at this point is to try to slowly degrade health care then blame the ACA.

@realDonaldTrump gleefully hoping the current health plan explodes shows what a truly heartless, disturbed man you actually are Roland Scahill (@rolandscahill) March 25, 2017.
@realDonaldTrump So, we should not worry, because the health insurance market will collapse ?
Great logic.

Mike P Williams (@Mike_P_Williams) March 25, 2017@realDonaldTrump Trumpcare exploded first.
Mark Pygas (@MarkPygas) March 25, 2017@realDonaldTrump Maybe make a better plan now and work with both sides?
This isn t a reality show, you turd.
Ben Berkon (@BenBerkon) March 25, 2017@realDonaldTrump Great leadership!
Hoping a program that insures millions will fail cause you COULDN T CLOSE THE DEAL!
Erich McElroy (@erichmcelroy) March 25, 2017u r a creep @realDonaldTrump ROSIE (@Rosie) March 25, 2017@realDonaldTrump The fact that you re so gleeful about the possibility of millions of people dying if healthcare does fail, speaks volumes.
Nick Bilton (@nickbilton) March 25, 2017@nickbilton @realDonaldTrump to be clear, it was imploding earlier this month.
Why the change in talking points?

@realDonaldTrump so, just to recap, you d like Americans to die from losing health insurance or terrorism just so you can yell TOLDYA!
Jess Dweck (@TheDweck) March 25, 2017A lot of people will die if Trump s wish comes true and he ll likely try to make it come true by killing regulations and funding in order to sabotage the Affordable Care Act.
Trump is not a patriot and he s definitely not a human being.
He s a f*cking monster.Featured image via Mario Tama/Getty Images
