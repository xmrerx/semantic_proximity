Here s what we ve got with the new e-mails and it s a doozy:The internet is blowing up over a document regarding Supreme Court Justice Scalia.A new theory has emerged that Hillary Clinton and her lackeys are linked to Justice Scalia s death.TMN Today reported:The theory comes from a WikiLeaks email from Hillary s Chairman John Podesta to DC lobbyist Steve Elmendorf.
Elmendorf was also the former chief of staff to Democratic leader Dick Gephardt.Podesta writes, Didn t think wet works meant pool parties at the Vineyard.
Elmendrof responds, I am all in Sounds like it will be a bad nite , we all need to buckle up and double down The theory goes that Podesta s use of wet work implies an assassination.
And the references to pool and Vineyard refer to the Cibolo Creek Ranch where Scalia s body was found.
The Ranch does have a pool and it is believed that a vineyard is just down the road.
The email was also written just four days before Scalia was found dead on February 13, 2016.Via: GP
