ZURICH (Reuters) - Nuclear proliferation watchdog CTBTO said on Saturday it had detected two seismic events in North Korea on Saturday but they were probably not deliberate explosions in the isolated country.
Two #Seismic Events!
0829UTC & much smaller @ 0443UTC unlikely Man-made!
Similar to collapse event 8.5 mins after DPRK6!
Analysis ongoing, CTBTO Executive Secretary Lassina Zerbo said in a Twitter post.
China s earthquake administration said it had detected a magnitude 3.4 earthquake in North Korea that was a suspected explosion , while an official at South Korea s meteorological agency said the initial view was that it was a natural quake.
