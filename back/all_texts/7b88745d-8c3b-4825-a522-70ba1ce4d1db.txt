Kellyanne Conway met with NBC s Meet The Press to discuss the findings by US intelligence agencies about Russia and their alleged hacking into the DNC and John Podesta emails.
Throughout his interview, crybaby host Chuck Todd tries without success to pin this alleged hacking by Russia on Trump.
He also tried to convince his viewers that Hillary lost the election because of the emails that exposed the dirty dealings and the hate the Democrat Party and Democrat operatives have for everyday Americans.
Kellyanne Conway won t allow him to distort the truth and control the narrative however, and Todd becomes visibly agitated with her, which likely is the reason they wouldn t air the entire interview.
After all, why would they want to have their viewers witness the meltdown of their premier Sunday morning host.In a brilliant move, Trump called out NBC this morning for editing her interview on Meet The Press on Twitter:Kellyanne Conway went to @MeetThePress this morning for an interview with @chucktodd.
Dishonest media cut out 9 of her 10 minutes.
Terrible!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 8, 2017Although NBC aired the edited version of the interview to their viewers, they have posted the full version on their website.
The interview in its entirety can be seen here:NBC Meet the Press host Chuck Todd has a wife who s active in Democratic Party strategic communications, and sometimes donates to Democrats.
In 2012, Kristian Denny Todd contributed $2,500 to Sen. Tim Kaine.
Todd never felt any need to disclose this during his three recent Kaine interviews on NBC (August 7, September 18, and October 23).
