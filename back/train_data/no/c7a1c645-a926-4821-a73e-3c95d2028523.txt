washington ( reuters ) - democratic presidential candidate martin o ’ malley , a former maryland governor , is under investigation for buying furniture from the state executive mansion at sharply discounted prices as he left office , the washington post reported on friday .
the o ’ malley family paid $ 9,638 for beds , chairs , desk lamps , mirrors and other items from the mansion ’ s living quarters after the administration declared them “ excess property , ” the paper said .
the furnishing originally cost $ 62,000 , according to the baltimore sun , which first reported the furniture purchase and the investigation , the post said .
the post cited haley morris , a spokeswoman for o ’ malley ’ s presidential campaign , as saying the investigation by the anne arundel county state ’ s attorney office was “ a bogus political attack that the maryland republicans have tried to make stick. ” morris said o ’ malley bought the furniture under the same procedures used by his predecessor when he moved out of the executive mansion , the post reported .
o ’ malley has said he followed the procedures outlined to him by the state and paid the depreciated rate for the furniture as laid out by the state ’ s department of general services .
o ’ malley is lagging far behind hillary clinton and bernie sanders in the race for the democratic presidential nomination .
