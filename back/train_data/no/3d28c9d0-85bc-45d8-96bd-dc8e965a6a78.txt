beirut ( reuters ) - lebanon s prime minister saad al-hariri , who sparked a political crisis on saturday by declaring his surprise resignation in riyadh , has traveled to the uae , saudi-owned media said on tuesday .
his resignation has thrust lebanon back onto the front line of the middle east s most biting rivalry , pitting a mostly sunni bloc led by saudi arabia and including the uae against shi ite iran and its allies .
on monday saudi arabia accused lebanon of declaring war against it because of aggression by iran s lebanese ally hezbollah , dramatically escalating the crisis and threatening to destabilize tiny lebanon .
the ratings agency moody s has said that any return in lebanon to the political paralysis that existed before hariri joined a national unity government last year would harm its credit rating .
the sudden nature of hariri s resignation has also fueled speculation in lebanon that he was coerced into quitting and has been held against his will .
saudi arabia has denied this .
hariri , a political ally of saudi arabia , left riyadh early on tuesday for abu dhabi to meet the united arab emirates crown prince mohammed bin zayed al-nahyan , the hariri-owned future tv and saudi-owned al-arabiya reported .
saudi arabia s crown prince mohammed bin salman said on tuesday that iran s decision to supply rockets to militias in yemen constitutes a direct military aggression against the kingdom .
a rocket fired from yemen intercepted on the outskirts of riyadh hours after hariri s resignation on saturday .
on monday , saudi foreign minister adel al-jubeir told cnn the rocket was an iranian missile launched by hezbollah .
