london ( reuters ) - britons who have joined the islamic state militant group in syria and iraq should be hunted down and killed , britain s new defence minister said .
gavin williamson said that britons who had gone to syria or iraq to fight for islamic state hated what britain stands for , and that air strikes could be used against the estimated 270 british citizens who are still out there .
quite simply my view is a dead terrorist can t cause any harm to britain , williamson told the daily mail in an interview published late on wednesday .
we should do everything we can do to destroy and eliminate that threat , he said , adding that he believed any british fighters who joined islamic state should never be allowed to return to the united kingdom .
williamson , 41 , has been defence minister for little over a month , replacing michael fallon after he quit in a sexual harassment scandal .
prominent british militants such as mohammed emwazi , known as jihadi john , and sally jones , have been reportedly killed by british or u.s. forces since travelling to fight for islamic state .
after the death of jones , who was known as the white widow , fallon said that british nationals who chose to leave the uk and fight for islamic state were a legitimate target .
