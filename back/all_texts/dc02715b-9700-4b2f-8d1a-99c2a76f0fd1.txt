There cannot be any bigger example of irony in American politics than Donald Trump s newest proposal for immigrants coming into the United States.According to a new report, Donald Trump will put forth a proposal that will test incoming immigrants on their support for American values as a litmus test for citizenship.
What will these questions entail?
Whether or not these immigrants support gender equality, gay rights, religious freedom and the rule of American law.The irony is rich a man who has no respect for gender equality, gay rights, religious freedom or the rule of law is going to ask hardworking immigrants if they support the things he does not.
Maybe it s a catch 22 perhaps if the immigrants answer YES to any of the following a Trump Administration would deny them entry.Suppose an immigrant comes through and is asked if he or she does not support gay rights.
Like many Christians in this country, many Muslims or Catholics from South America do not support same-sex marriage.
If a Muslim or a South American Catholic answer that they do not support same-sex marriage, would a Trump Administration brand them, ultimately, as anti-gay?Remember, Donald Trump doesn t support same-sex marriage.In other words, he himself would most likely fail his own immigration test.Trump s senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, told the Associated Press that the aim of the new litmus test was to selectively determine who our friends are and which immigrants would best be equipped to fight against radical Islamic terrorism.
So there it is this isn t a test on all immigrants; it s really a test on Muslims cleverly disguised as a legitimate part of immigration customs.I guess that whole adhering to religious freedom thing doesn t ring true for Trump or his lily white allies.
Miller also told the AP that the purpose of the litmus test is to fill the cracks left by gaps in traditional vetting from countries that are, well, predominantly Muslim (even though our vetting process is meticulous).Once again Trump s policy proposal has fallen flat.
When your own candidate couldn t pass such a subjective test, it s best not to make others take it.Featured image via Jeff Swensen/Getty Images
