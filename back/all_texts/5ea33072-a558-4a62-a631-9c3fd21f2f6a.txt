Donald Trump is considering a prominent supporter of the birther conspiracy theory from Fox News for a position in his administration, according to a report.
Trump is reportedly mulling over a spot for Eric Bolling to be part of his Commerce Department.Fox News host Eric Bolling has discussed the possibility of taking a position in Donald Trump s administration, two sources with knowledge of the discussions tell POLITICO.The position being discussed is in the Department of Commerce, though nothing has been offered yet.Bolling, a co-host of The Five and an early Trump supporter, was spotted at Trump Tower in New York City on Wednesday by the press pool and may have visited again on Friday.While at Fox News, Bolling was a proponent of the racist birther conspiracy, that falsely alleged that President Obama was born in Kenya and thus not a natural born citizen of the United States.
Even after Obama publicly released his long form birth certificate, Bolling was skeptical and used a blown-up version of the document which he believed was some sort of phony.At the time Bolling said: There is a legitimate question as to whether or not the president of the United States is allowed to be president of the United States.
Bolling also used racist language about Obama.
He referred to a visit from the president of Gabon to the White House as evidence of a hoodlum in the hizzouse.
He also once accused the president of chugging a few 40s.
Bolling is considered one of the less intelligent on-air personalities that Fox uses on its roster, that Trump is seriously considering him for a role simply because he was a big cheerleader for Trump on the most pro-Trump is troubling.Trump seems to be packing the administration full of flunkies and yes men who answer only to him and not the American people and its voters.Featured image via YouTube
