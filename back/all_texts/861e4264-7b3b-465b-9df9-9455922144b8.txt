LONDON (Reuters) - British police said reports of a suspicious package near Holborn, central London, had turned out to be a false alarm.
Pictures on Twitter had shown several police cars and officers in the cordoned-off street, but a spokeswoman later said the operation had been stood down.
Britain s threat level is currently set to severe, meaning an attack is highly likely, and 30 people were injured last Friday when a bomb on a train apparently failed to fully detonate.
