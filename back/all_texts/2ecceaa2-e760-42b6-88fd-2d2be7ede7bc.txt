CNN mostly dismisses the Clinton e-mail scandal and just brushes over it but John King makes a great point this morning:Sunday on CNN s Inside Politics, host John King pointed to a Washington Post story detailing that within 24 hours of her telling ABC news last year that she was, dead broke after leaving the White House the Clinton gave speeches making $700,000 in fees.King said, The Washington Post story this past week saying within 24 hours of saying we were dead broke to justify making some money, the Clintons combined made $700,000 in speeches.
That is going to be tee-ball for the Republicans.
Maggie Haberman of the New York Times said, What you just said, I suspect will have more residence than the emails.
