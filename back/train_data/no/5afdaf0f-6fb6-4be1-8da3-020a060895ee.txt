beijing ( reuters ) - china expressed concern on wednesday about u.s. president donald trump s reported intention to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital and relocate the u.s. embassy to the ancient city , saying it could spark new hostility .
senior u.s. officials said on tuesday that trump will recognize jerusalem as israel s capital on wednesday and set in motion the relocation of the u.s. embassy to the city from tel aviv , a decision that risks fuelling violence in the middle east .
the endorsement of israel s claim to all of jerusalem as its capital would reverse long-standing u.s. policy that the city s status must be decided in negotiations with the palestinians , who want east jerusalem as capital of their future state .
chinese foreign ministry spokesman geng shuang told a regular news briefing that the status of jerusalem was a complicated and sensitive issue and china was concerned the u.s. decision could sharpen regional conflict .
all parties should do more for the peace and tranquillity of the region , behave cautiously , and avoid impacting the foundation for resolving the long-standing palestine issue and initiating new hostility in the region , geng said .
china has long maintained that palestinians must be allowed to build an independent state , although it has traditionally played little role in middle east conflicts or diplomacy , despite its reliance on the region for oil .
the process of moving the u.s. embassy is expected to take three to four years , according to u.s. officials , though trump will not set a timetable .
the international community does not recognize israeli sovereignty over the entire city , home to sites holy to the muslim , jewish and christian religions .
