Donald Trump has a strategy to defeat Hillary Clinton, and that s to re-litigate decades of anti-Clinton conspiracy theories theories that should have been put to bed years and years ago.The ugliest of those theories is that Hillary Clinton had her friend Vince Foster murdered this despite the fact that numerous investigators, including Clinton attack dog Kenneth Starr, have said that Foster s death was suicide and now his sister is speaking out.Here s more on Trump s accusation:In an Op-Ed in the Washington Post, Sheila Foster Anthony, sister of Vince Foster, said this to Trump:It is beyond contempt that a politician would use a family tragedy to further his candidacy, but such is the character of Donald Trump displayed in his recent comments to The Washington Post.
In this interview, Trump cynically, crassly and recklessly insinuated that my brother, Vincent W. Foster Jr., may have been murdered because he had intimate knowledge of what was going on and that Hillary Clinton may have somehow played a role in Vince s death.How wrong.
How irresponsible.
How cruel.
************************************************Five investigations, including by independent counsels Robert B. Fiske Jr. and Kenneth Starr, concluded that Vince suffered from severe depression that caused him to be unable to sleep, unable to work, unable to think straight, and finally to take his own life.Anthony goes on to say that she and her brother were very close and that he called her a few days before he died saying that he needed help for depression.
She found three psychiatrists, but help wasn t early enough.
He killed himself three days later.
That was only the beginning of her nightmare.
The right took the story of Foster s suicide and tried, desperately to pin it (and everything else) on the Clintons.These outrageous suggestions have caused our family untold pain because this issue went on for so long and these reports were so painful to read.
For years, our family had to wage a court fight to prevent release of photographs of Vince s dead body.
My heartbroken mother was plagued by harassing phone calls from a reporter.Anthony has kept mostly quiet throughout the years, but Trump bringing this up again, many years after this has been settled, is too painful for her, and for her family, to endure.The fact is, that Trump will stop at nothing to appease his ego and win the ultimate political prize.
This election will be ugly.
A lot of people, who have put the past behind them, will have old wounds opened.
Hillary Clinton, like all political candidates, is flawed, but she s not a murderer and to imply so is beyond unethical.
Trump is only proving that he s not fit for office, any office.Featured sketch of Vince Foster via Wikipedia.
