Donald Trump decided to war with the one person most politicians have enough sense not to touch: The Pope.
Pope Francis was asked what he thought of Donald Trump, and said that it was not a Christian thing to do, to talk of building walls instead of building bridges.
Of course, Trump being Trump, he retaliated in fury.
Pope Francis said: A person who thinks only about building walls, wherever they may be, and not of building bridges, is not Christian.
This is not the gospel.
I would only say that this man is not Christian if he has said things like that.
Now, an idiot pastor has joined the fray, and is saying that the Pope, of all people, is confused about what it means to be a Christian.
Pastor Robert Jeffress went on-air on The Sean Hannity Show, and said to the right-wing host: Sean, I think the Pope needs to ask Donald Trump s forgiveness for making such an outlandish statement.
I want to remind our listeners that it was exactly one year ago this week that 21 Coptic Christians had their heads chopped off by ISIS on a Libyan beach and then ISIS said, we are coming to Rome next.
As if that wasn t enough, the man actually suggested that the Pope is the one who is confused here about what he should be doing as Pope.
And the fact that we have a candidate like Donald Trump who wants to protect America, that s not unbiblical.
The Pope is confused between the role of the Church, which is to show compassion, and the role of government, which is to uphold order and to protect its citizens.
And I want to make a prediction.
I think the Pope has succeeded in doing what no other man on Earth could do, and that is creating a martyr in Donald Trump.
Well, Pastor Jeffress, as many issues as I have with the Catholic Church, I think you d do well to step away from this one.
If the Pope himself doesn t know what the Church should be doing and saying here, who does?Watch the video below, via Media Matters for America:Featured image via video screen capture from YouTube
