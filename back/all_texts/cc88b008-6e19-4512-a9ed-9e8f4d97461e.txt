While most of the press is content in letting Donald Trump get away with the horrible things he says and won t hold his feet to the fire, at least one person isn t holding back Joy Behar of The View.After Trump told Matt Lauer during NBC s Presidential Forum that he s happy to be praised by Russia s Vladimir Putin, all the while putting down President Obama, Joy Behar was ready to tear him a new one.Trump even went so far to say that Putin has been a leader far more than President Obama has.
Keep in mind, Putin cares nothing about the human rights of many of his citizens, most especially gay individuals.And the only reason Putin has been praising Trump is because he knows that if Trump were in power it would be easier for him to power-grab.
Putin seems to see Trump as the weaker candidate who will be easier to manipulate due to his lack of experience.Behar started by saying: He forgets that we have checks and balances in this country.
We have a constitution.
The Russians don t have such a thing.
Then, after Candace Cameron Bure tried to spew some nonsense saying Putin makes Russians feel safe, Behar really let Trump have it.
She said: The polls in Russia.
Is he talking about Polish people?
Or is he talking about polls?
Because the dictatorship that is Putin is controlling the polls, okay?
Then after it was explained that the media doesn t even have representation in Russia, which honestly seems like something Trump would like, Behar said: It s so unpatriotic, is what it is.
And for him to say such things, in front of our military, is a disgrace.
Which is exactly what it is, and yet another reason Trump shouldn t be allowed anywhere near the Oval Office.Watch Joy Behar tear Trump a new one here:.
@joyvbehar on Trump saying Putin is a better leader than Obama: to say such things is a disgrace.
