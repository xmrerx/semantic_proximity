dubai ( reuters ) - qatar must do more to protect construction workers from heat which often reaches levels that are potentially fatal , human rights watch said on wednesday .
hrw and other rights campaigners are frequent critics of qatar s treatment of migrant laborers whose working conditions have received additional scrutiny as the country prepares to host the 2022 world cup .
the group said existing regulations only set limits on outdoor work during the period june 15 to aug. 31 , and then only from 11:30 a.m. to 3 p.m .
climate data shows that weather conditions in qatar outside those hours and dates frequently reach levels that can result in potentially fatal heat-related illnesses in the absence of appropriate rest , it said .
hrw called authorities also to investigate the causes of migrant worker deaths and publish data on such incidents .
in 2013 , health authorities reported 520 deaths of workers from bangladesh , india , and nepal , hrw said .
like other wealthy gulf arab states , qatar relies on vast numbers of migrant workers , mostly from the philippines , south asia and africa .
around 2 million migrant workers live in qatar , outnumbering the local workforce by nearly 20 to one .
some 800,000 work in the construction sector .
unions and labor protests are banned and authorities penalize dissent with jail or deportation .
the qatari government s communications office said : qatar is committed to its labor reform program and is constantly reviewing its policies to ensure that migrant workers receive the necessary on-site protections .
we continue to coordinate closely with the international labour organisation ( ilo ) and international ngos to implement reforms that will improve the health , safety and rights of migrant workers , sheikh saif al thani , head of the communications office , said in a statement sent to reuters .
