In a move that absolutely nobody could have seen coming, President Trump has lashed out about the newly-appointed special counsel tasked with looking into his campaign s dealings with Russian intelligence services.
Trump told reporters on Thursday afternoon, I believe it hurts our country terribly, because it shows we re a divided, mixed-up, not-unified country.
And we have very important things to be doing right now, whether it s trade deals, whether it s military, whether it s stopping nuclear all of the things that we discussed today.
And I think this shows a very divided country.
President Trump used his time with reporters to attack Democrats as well, blaming them for the multiple investigations into his ongoing backroom deals with Russia.
He said, It also happens to be a pure excuse for the Democrats having lost an election that they should have easily won because of the Electoral College being slanted so much in their way.
That s all this is.
President Trump s initial reaction to news that a special counsel has been appointed.That stands in sharp contrast to the statement that President Trump released yesterday, when he learned that a special counsel had been appointed.
Trump also seemed to be concerned over how investigations into his presidency look to the rest of the world, saying I think it shows division, and it shows that we re not together as a country.
And I think it s a very, very negative thing.
And hopefully, this can go quickly, because we have to show unity if we re going to do great things with respect to the rest of the world.
Perhaps the biggest shock is that Trump reportedly still wants Michael Flynn to be a part of his administration.
The President is convinced that Flynn will be found innocent, despite mounting evidence to the contrary.
Trump reportedly wants Michael Flynn back.It s hard to imagine that anyone, even Trump, could possibly think that rehiring Flynn is a good decision.
