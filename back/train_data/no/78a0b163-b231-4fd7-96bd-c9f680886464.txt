moscow ( reuters ) - russian president vladimir putin and turkish president tayyip erdogan discussed an upcoming meeting of the astana process on the syrian conflict in the kazakh capital in late october , the kremlin said on saturday .
during their phone conversation , putin and erdogan talked about joint efforts within the astana process , including the creation of de-escalation zones in syria , and further coordination towards resolving the syria situation , the kremlin said in a statement .
the astana talks are brokered by russia , turkey and iran .
in mid-september , the three countries agreed to post observers on the edge of a de-escalation zone in northern syria s idlib region largely controlled by islamist militants .
putin and erdogan also said the agreements reached between russia and turkey in ankara in late september were being successfully implemented , particularly in trade and economic relations .
overall , the conversation was business-like and constructive , directed at strengthening bilateral cooperation and interaction on the regional agenda , the kremlin said .
the russian-turkish trade relationship has been affected by their dispute over supplies of turkish tomatoes to russia which moscow is yet to fully restore .
this dispute has been adding risks to russian grain trade with turkey .
russia , once the largest market for turkish tomato producers , said this week it will allow purchases of 50,000 tonnes of turkish tomatoes from only four turkish producers from dec. 1 .
the announcement came several days after turkey , the second largest buyer of russian wheat , said it had imposed a requirement for additional approval of russian agriculture supplies by the turkish authorities .
