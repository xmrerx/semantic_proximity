On Wednesday, the Democratic party staged a powerful sit-in to protest Congress inaction on gun safety proposals after the tragic mass shooting in Orlando last week.
The sit-in was organized by Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) and received the support and recognition from President Barack Obama as well as Americans all over the country who understand that the United States must become a safer place and that we can no longer allow innocent people to die as a result of senseless gun violence and relaxed gun laws.During the sit-in, Rep. Jim McDermott took it upon himself to mock one of the GOP s most prominent leaders, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI).
Many GOPers had decided to go to lunch instead of vote on gun control measures, so the Democrats decided to have a little fun.It just so happened that the sit-in occurred on the very same day that Ryan was going to introduce his Republican alternative to Obamacare, and McDermott was reveling in the fact that the sit-in had probably ruined Ryan s day.
McDermott told his fellow Dems: You threw a bomb under the door of his rolling out this health care bill.
So if you re wondering where he is, he s up in his office crying.
I mean, he had this thing all set, he had it all ready to go and we did this to him.
You think you think there won t be payback?
You don t know the Irish.
You can watch McDermott slam Ryan in the footage below, which was posted to Facebook by McDermott s colleague Beto O Rourke (D-TX):Sadly, McDermott s insults toward Paul Ryan might have been the only tiny piece of justice the many gun violence victims and their families would get on Wednesday, considering the fact that Republicans care more about their Second Amendment rights than protecting innocent American citizens.
We commend all of the Democratic politicians who participated in the sit-in, and all who spoke out against the GOP.Featured image via Mark Wilson / Getty Images
