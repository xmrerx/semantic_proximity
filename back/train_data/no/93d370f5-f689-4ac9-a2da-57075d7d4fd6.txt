baghdad ( reuters ) - kurdish peshmerga fighters rejected a warning from an iraqi paramilitary force to withdraw from a strategic junction south of the oil-rich city of kirkuk , a kurdish security official told reuters on sunday .
popular mobilisation , formed mainly by iranian-trained shi ite groups , gave the peshmerga until midnight local time ( 2100 gmt saturday ) to leave a position north of the maktab khalid junction , the official from the kurdistan regional government s ( krg ) security council said .
the position controls the access to an airbase and some of the oilfields located in the region of kirkuk , the official said .
the city and its immediate surroundings , including the oilfields , are under kurdish control .
there were no clashes reported about an hour after the deadline , but a resident said dozens of young kurds deployed around kirkuk with machine guns as the news of the warning spread .
the krg and the shi ite-led central government in baghdad are at loggerheads since a kurdish independence referendum held last month in northern iraq .
kurdish authorities said on friday they had sent thousands more troops to kirkuk to confront iraqi threats .
iraqi prime minister haider al-abadi has repeatedly denied any plans to attack the kurds .
popular mobilisation is a separate force from the regular army and officially reports to abadi .
it is deployed alongside the army south and west of kirkuk .
kirkuk , a city of more than one million people , lies just outside krg territory but peshmerga forces deployed there in 2014 when iraqi security forces collapsed in the face of an islamic state onslaught .
the peshmerga deployment prevented kirkuk s oilfields from falling into jihadist hands .
the baghdad central government has taken a series of steps to isolate the autonomous kurdish region since its overwhelming vote for independence in the referendum , including banning international flights from going there .
