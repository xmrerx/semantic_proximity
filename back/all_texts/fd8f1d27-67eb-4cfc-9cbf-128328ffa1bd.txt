DHAKA (Reuters) - Pope Francis on Thursday called for decisive measures to resolve the political crisis causing mostly Muslim refugees from neighboring Myanmar to flee to Bangladesh.
But, just as in the first leg of his trip in Myanmar, he did not use the word Rohingya, which is contested by the Yangon government and military.
In a speech before Bangladesh s president hours after arriving, Francis instead spoke of refugees from Rakhine State .
He also called on countries to give immediate material assistance to help Bangladesh deal with the crisis.
