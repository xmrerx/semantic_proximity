baghdad ( reuters ) - the iraqi government gave the kurdistan regional government ( krg ) until friday 3:00 p.m ( 1200 gmt ) to hand over control of its airports in order to avoid an international air embargo , prime minister haider al-abadi said , according to state tv .
the measure is meant as a retaliation against the independence referendum held by the krg in northern iraq on monday .
domestic flights are not involved in the ultimatum and in the worst case , international travel to and from the krg will be re-routed through baghdad and other iraqi airports .
baghdad last week asked foreign countries to stop direct flights to the international airports of erbil and sulaimaniya , in krg territory , but only iran declared such an air embargo , halting direct flights to and from iraqi kurdistan .
humanitarian and emergency flights are exempted , provided they are pre-approved by baghdad , abadi said .
baghdad will also ask neighboring countries to shut the border with iraqi kurdistan if the krg doesn t hand over border posts to the central government by friday .
