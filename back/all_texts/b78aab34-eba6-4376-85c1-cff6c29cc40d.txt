Eight members of a family, seven adults and one teenager were shot and killed in rural Ohio in what authorities have described as an execution style homicide.
Authorities say that all of the victims appear to have been shot in the back of the head.
There were, however, three children who survived the shooting, all under the age of four.
Ohio s attorney general Mike DeWine said: What makes this particularly grisly is the fact that you have these children involved who obviously were there when the executions took.
The one mum was apparently killed in her bed with the four-day-old right there.
It s just hard to believe.
DeWine added that the killings may have taken place when the victims were in their beds adding, You have one person who is armed and dangerous and there may be more than one, there may be two, there may be three.
The victims were found Pike County, which is about 70 miles (112km) south of Ohio s capital, Columbus in separate homes.
DeWine said: All of the victims are believed to possibly be members of the same family, and they were found in three Union Hill Road homes.
The attorney general asked the public to contact authorities about any information that would lead to the capture of the suspect in the murders.Watch video here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jjlsh9oRxl4]Featured image via video screenshot.
