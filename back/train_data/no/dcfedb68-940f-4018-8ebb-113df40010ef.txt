washington ( reuters ) - republican senator mark kirk of illinois said on monday he wants the senate to vote on president barack obama ’ s eventual u.s. supreme court nominee , in a break with the republican leader of the senate .
in an opinion piece in the chicago sun-times , kirk wrote : “ i recognize the right of the president , be it republican or democrat , to place before the senate a nominee for the supreme court and i fully expect and look forward to president barack obama advancing a nominee for the senate to consider. ” senate majority leader mitch mcconnell has said the seat on the nation ’ s highest court should remain vacant until obama ’ s successor takes office in january so voters can have a say on the selection when they cast ballots in the nov. 8 presidential election .
