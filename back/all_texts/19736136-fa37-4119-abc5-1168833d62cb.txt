Recently, President Bannon s underling, Donald Trump, called the American news media the enemy of the American people in a quickly-deleted tweet.Obviously, this did not go over well, given that there are very few leaders who have classified the press as the enemy of the people and none of them were or are nice people.As most of us mock Easy D for his transparent effort to delegitimize all but himself and his approved (friendly) news sources, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg managed to shame Trump in the most classy way possible and he didn t even have to mention The Donald by name.On Monday, Zuckerberg posted that he and his wife Priscilla had spent their day stopping by local newspapers in Alabama where the folks there were working hard over President s Day weekend to keep their communities informed.
It seems like a good time to say thank you to all the journalists around the world who work tirelessly and sometimes put their lives in danger to surface the truth, Zuckerberg continues.
I don t always agree with everything you say, but that s how democracy is supposed to work.
In other words, he doesn t scream FAKE NEWS every time someone reported unflattering information about him.
I know I join many people in America and across the world in thanking you for your work, Zuckerberg confluded.
He even posted a lovely photo of the two of them in front of the Selma Times-Journal.
