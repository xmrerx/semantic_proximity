paris ( reuters ) - french president emmanuel macron on tuesday said he deliberately laid out his vision for sweeping european union reforms just after germany s election and before coalition talks there are concluded in order for his proposals to have more influence .
some had said i should wait for the coalition talks to be concluded , macron said , adding that had he done so , the reaction in berlin would have been : your proposals are great but it s too late , the coalition deal already lays out what will we do on europe for the next four years .
