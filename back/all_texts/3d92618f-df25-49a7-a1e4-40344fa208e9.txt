Two sources said that Rahami had also been shot and is on the way to a local hospital.This Saturday, a bomb exploded in the New Jersey shore town on Seaside Park, forcing a large charity race to cancel.
Later the same day, a bombing in New York s Chelsea neighborhood injured 29 people.
Officers found a possible secondary device nearby.
Then on Sunday, five additional explosive devices were found near a train station in Elizabeth, New Jersey.
Rahami, a 28-year-old Afghan-born U.S. citizen, was identified as a suspect on Monday in the bombings after authorities found a fingerprint on one of the devices that had not been detonated.The suspect was sleeping in the doorway of a local bar when the bar owner happened to recognize him and called 911.
The police approached Rahami and he sat up.
The officer recognized him and told him to put his hands up.
Rhami then shot the officer in the stomach but the officer was wearing a bullet proof vest so his injuries are thankfully minor.
Rahami ran and started shooting at cars and passersby when he was shot and then taken into custody.
