it s a win for the american legion !
atheists wanted to take down the cross but a maryland judge ruled against it .
thanks to the liberty institute for fighting the battles for conservative americans .
great job ! the u.s. constitution allows a large latin cross to stay as the centerpiece of the bladensburg world war i veterans memorial , a federal court in maryland ruled monday.in 1925 , the american legion erected the bladensburg cross as a memorial honoring 49 men in prince george s county , maryland , who made the ultimate sacrifice while serving in world war i.but in 2014 , the american humanist association attacked the memorial , filing a lawsuit against the maryland-national capital park and planning commission .
the atheists argued to the federal district court that a memorial in the shape of a cross violates the establishment clause of the constitution , which forbids the government from establishing an official religion.liberty institute , the largest law firm in the country that focuses exclusively on religious freedom , took up the case and intervened on behalf of the american legion , which became a full party to the case .
liberty institute then brought in a top global law firm , jones day , to lead the case , with noel francisco as lead counsel.today , u.s. district judge deborah chasanow ruled in favor of the american legion , and against the american humanist association.in her 36-page opinion , the clinton-appointed chasanow held that while a latin cross is a symbol often associated with christianity , it does not violate the constitution in this context .
the judge noted that courts disagree over what test they are supposed to use in these cases , but that under any of the tests modern federal courts apply , bladensburg s cross passes muster.read more : breitbart news
