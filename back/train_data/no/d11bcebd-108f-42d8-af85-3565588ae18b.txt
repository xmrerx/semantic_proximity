now , it appears , the memo was a ploy to find the white house information leak.white house press secretary sean spicer denied these rumors and called them absolutely false.via gateway pundit : there is no effort to do what is potentially suggested , he said .
spicer called the ap report 100 percent not true , adding that there was no effort at all to utilize the national guard to round up unauthorized immigrants .
sources are now saying that multiple memos were released , all with slight differences in order to smoke out the leak.multiple sources within the wh have told me that the `` memo '' on the 100k national guard soldiers was fake news designed to smoke out leaker .
