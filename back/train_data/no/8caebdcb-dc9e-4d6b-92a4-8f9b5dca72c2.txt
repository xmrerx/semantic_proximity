danang , vietnam ( reuters ) - russian president vladimir putin said on saturday that russia would respond in kind to what he said were washington s measures to restrict the freedom of speech of russian media organizations operating on u.s. soil .
putin said however that possible plans to retaliate by declaring u.s. media operating in russia as foreign agents may be a little too harsh , and that the kremlin was still formulating its exact response .
kremlin-backed broadcaster russia today has been told to register in the united states as a foreign agent .
u.s. intelligence officials say the broadcaster tried to influence the u.s. presidential election on the kremlin s behalf , an allegation the broadcaster and the kremlin deny .
on friday , the pro-kremlin speaker of the lower house of russia s parliament , vyacheslav volodin , said legislation could be introduced next week designating u.s. and some other foreign media operating in russia as foreign agents .
speaking to reporters at the end of an asia pacific economic cooperation summit in vietnam , putin said : an attack on our media in the united states is an attack on freedom of speech , without a doubt .
we re disappointed .
what is being discussed in the state duma ( lower house of parliament ) , i saw it yesterday , it might be a little too harsh but it s natural because at the level of the legislative arm you often hear extreme views , harsh judgment and tough proposals .
but we will have to formulate some kind of response and it will mirror , the measures adopted by u.s. authorities towards russian media in the united states , putin said .
i want to draw your attention to the fact that there is no and there can t be confirmation that russian media meddled in election campaigns , putin said .
being designated as foreign agents in russia would oblige foreign media to submit regular reports to the authorities about their staffing and their sources of funding .
