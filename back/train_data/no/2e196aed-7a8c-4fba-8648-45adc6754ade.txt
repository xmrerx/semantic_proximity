21st century wire says it is not looking good for clinton.watch a video of this report here : trump now sits at 45 % , with clinton at 42 % .this shows trump is only widening his lead over clinton , as held just a 2 % lead a few weeks ago.however , the more interesting statistic that the poll reveals is that bernie sanders is the only candidate in the entire presidential race that actually can beat trump.sanders leads trump by 4 % , meaning for a slightly more convincing victory than donald could pull over on hillary.bernie would come in at 46 % , and trump would trail at 42 % .with the anti-trump campaign proving to be an absolutely futile effort , it appears that those with a deep-seated hatred for donald could have had a far greater chance of beating him by putting their efforts into supporting sanders earlier on , instead of just trashing trump.will those who have completely wasted their time in the anti-trump campaign finally recognise where their efforts should be placed if they are actually serious about stopping trump ? get the full story on the 2016 election : 21st century wire election files
