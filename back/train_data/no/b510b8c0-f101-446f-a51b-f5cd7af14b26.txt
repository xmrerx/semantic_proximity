this is great !
ted cruz calls out the sierra club president on his bogus 97 % scientific consensus on global warming .
when asked about the 18 year pause in global warming , as documented by satellite data , mr. mair denied it exists .
so if the data are contrary to your testimony , would the sierra club issue a retraction ?
cruz asked .
sir , we concur with the 97 percent scientific consensus with regards to global warming , mair responded .
after some back and forth between the two , cruz sent the money shot in with this comment : you know , mr. mair , i find it striking that for a policy organization that purports to focus exclusively on environmental issues , that you are not willing to tell this committee that you would issue a retraction if your testimony is objectively false under scientific data .
that undermines the credibility of any organization .
