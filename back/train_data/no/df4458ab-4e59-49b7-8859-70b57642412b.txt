manila ( reuters ) - philippine soldiers killed nine maoist rebels in one of the fiercest clashes since peace talks to end nearly five decades of conflict broke down in may , an army spokesman said on wednesday .
an army corporal was also slightly wounded in the 25-minute firefight in rural area of nueva ecija province , some 220 kilometers ( 137 miles ) north of the capital manila , army spokesman lieutenant-colonel isagani nato said .
nato said the soldiers rushed to the village after receiving a report of armed men in the area .
confronted by a band of around 15 guerrillas from the new people s army ( npa ) , the soldiers killed nine .
more than 40,000 people have died in the long-running insurgency , and peace negotiations have sputtered on-off .
talks , brokered by norway , resumed in august last year , days after president rodrigo duterte freed senior communist figures and militants .
a ceasefire agreement held for almost four months .
but , duterte suspended talks in january after rebels resumed and stepped up attacks on security forces , as well as on businesses in the countryside , including mines , plantations and construction companies .
in may , the president scrapped peace negotiations saying he will only agree to resume talks if rebels sign a negotiated ceasefire , and stop recruitment and extortion .
