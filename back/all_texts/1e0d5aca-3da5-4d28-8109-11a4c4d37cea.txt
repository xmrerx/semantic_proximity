It s no secret that Rosie O Donnell and Donald Trump don t get along.
But O Donnell s promotion of an online game where you make the President jump off a cliff has gone too far!
Can you imagine if the tables were turned and this was Obama?Push Trump Off A Cliff Again https://t.co/YguB3aG8EP ROSIE (@Rosie) July 15, 2017Has-been Actress Rosie O Donnell was supposed to move to Canada, right?
Instead, she s decided to promote a violent game directed at President Trump.
Push Trump Off A Cliff Again, O Donnell tweeted Saturday in an apparent play on Trump s Make America Great Again slogan.
The tweet links to a game in which the player can, as O Donnell says, make the president jump off a cliff, again and again.Conservatives expressed outrage as O Donnell s weekend tweet came to their attention.Sean Hannity s blog referred to the game as gross and sick.
We couldn t agree more!
If you have a sec, please go to O Donnell s twitter page and let her know how sick this is: Rosie Twitter
