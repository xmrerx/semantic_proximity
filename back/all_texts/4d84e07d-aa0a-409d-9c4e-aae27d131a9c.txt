I wrote about this publicly.
Nice "investigative" skills.
You got a photo of the wrong guy though.

Brought guns they never shot.
Just chanted, gave #Nazi salutes, taunted.

https://t.co/shOj6FfEyl Lacy MacAuley (@lacymacauley) May 2, 2017Lacy Mccauley can be seen acting as the tolerant host at this organized LGBTQ dance party in front of Vice President Mike Pence s home.
At about the 1:40 mark, Lacy interviews Natalie, one of the peaceful protesters who warns Mike Pence, Bro .at me bro!
She continues, We re gonna fight you and dance the more you come at us.
So bring it!
We re ready.
We re gonna keep resisting in love dancing because it looks like you don t have any.
So it looks like you need to be taught.
Lacy then goes on to interview more hateful gay protesters preaching love and tolerance .
So many angry, hateful people protesting against hate The hypocrisy of a liberal exposed.
Note: the original post (seen in screen shot below) claims the protest was organized by the Islamic Center.
We re pretty sure that LGBTQ members dancing in the streets is not a sanctioned Islamic event LOL!
