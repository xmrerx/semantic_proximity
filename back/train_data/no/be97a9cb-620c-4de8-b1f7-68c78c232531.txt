london ( reuters ) - british prime minister theresa may is on the verge of making concessions around a key welfare reform that has angered opposition parties as well as members of her own conservatives , the sunday telegraph reported .
the government has signaled that it is looking at ways to reduce the waiting time for payments from its new universal credit benefits system from six weeks , the newspaper said on saturday , without citing sources .
last week some lawmakers from may s own party vented their dismay over the government s handling of universal credit , which is designed to simplify payments to claimants by consolidating six different types of state benefits into one .
the policy was first implemented for a small number of claimants in 2013 under may s predecessor david cameron , but the expansion of the program has been beset by long delays and criticism that it risks harming vulnerable citizens .
last week the opposition labour party won a symbolic vote on a motion calling for the welfare plan to be paused , but may s party avoided a full-blown public rebellion by ordering its lawmakers to abstain , thereby masking the extent of internal unrest .
may leads a minority government , propped up by a small northern irish party , faced with the task of delivering a smooth departure from the european union - something which requires a deeply split parliament to approve large amounts of new legislation .
separately , the independent reported that the government has told energy investors a proposal to cap energy bills could be ditched if it feels that major power companies are doing enough to limit high bills , citing civil servants .
may s office was not immediately available for comment on either story .
