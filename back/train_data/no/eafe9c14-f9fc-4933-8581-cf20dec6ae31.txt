it is no secret that the gop brass is less than thrilled to have donald trump as their presumptive nominee for the 2016 presidential race .
however , at this point , there is nothing they can really do about it .
so , instead of disavowing the most unqualified and reckless candidate to ever seek the white house , they are simply condemning his more outrageously indefensible comments , yet still standing behind him and telling the nation and world that everything is a-ok between the republican establishment and the annointed orange one .
in order to prove that everyone is wrong and they are just peachy , republican national committee chair reince priebus tweeted out that a politico report that there were tense relations between trump and the rnc was pure fiction , and also told the entire internet that he was on a plane with trump at that very moment.flying to dallas now with @ realdonaldtrump reports of discord are pure fiction .
great events lined up all over texas .
rs will win in nov !
reince priebus ( @ reince ) june 16 , 2016well , the people of twitter are not morons .
they gave priebus the savage mockery he deserved , as only twitter can .
here are a few of the more delicious tweets that flooded the rnc chair s @ replies : @ reince @ realdonaldtrump did trump tweet this for you ?

@ reince lol pic.twitter.com/bjbdqayrfn soapview ( @ soapview ) june 16 , 2016they can try to pretend they re all just fine with trump , but it s clear they aren t. house speaker paul ryan said , in response to trump s directive that the gopers who are condemning his nutty remarks to be quiet , that you can t make this up sometimes .
mitch mcconnell , along with others just a few days ago simply refused to speak about trump after he made outrageously inappropriate remarks following the shooting in orlando.so , no , reince , nobody is buying the line of bullshit that you and other republican leaders are fine with your current standard-bearer .
you re literally terrified , as you should be.featured image via mark wilson/getty images
