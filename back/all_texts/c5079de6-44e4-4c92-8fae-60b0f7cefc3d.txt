DHAKA (Reuters) - Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi said on Tuesday the country is ready to ease the burden of Bangladesh in dealing with Rohingya Muslims fleeing from Myanmar, but the help is likely to be only humanitarian, not financial.
We will continue to discus what sort of support Indonesia could make to ease the burden of Bangladesh government, Marsudi told a news conference after she met with the Bangladeshi PM and her counterpart in Dhaka.
Myanmar has come under pressure from countries with large Muslim populations to stop violence against the Muslim Rohingya.
At least 400 people were killed and nearly 125,000 fled to Bangladesh in the deadliest bout of violence targeting the minority group in decades.
