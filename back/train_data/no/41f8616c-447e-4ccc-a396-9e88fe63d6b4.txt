madrid ( reuters ) - a spanish judge on thursday said she had ordered nine catalan leaders , including former regional vice-president oriol junqueras , to be remanded in custody pending an investigation into catalonia s independence push and a potential trial .
one of them , santi vila , who stepped down from the catalan cabinet before a unilateral declaration of independence last friday and has since then been pushing for a negotiated solution with the government , was granted bail of 50,000 euros ( $ 58,300 ) .
