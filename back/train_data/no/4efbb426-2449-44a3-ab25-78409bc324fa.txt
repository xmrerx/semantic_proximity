moscow ( reuters ) - a court on wednesday ruled that russian airline aeroflot can not tell staff what size clothing to wear after a stewardess complained she had been taken off international routes because she did not fit into the regulation-size uniform .
the stewardess , yevgenia magurina , said she had been transferred to lower paying domestic flights because she exceeded what she said was aeroflot s maximum uniform size of 48 .
on wednesday , magurina partially won her appeal in a moscow court against an earlier court decision which had gone against her .
the court ordered aeroflot to pay magurina the amount she deemed her salary had been docked as a result of the regulation - around 17,000 rubles ( $ 296.53 ) - and to pay her compensation for moral suffering of 5,000 roubles , tass reported .
the court however did not rule that aeroflot s actions were discriminatory .
magurina said after the decision she was satisfied with what she called a victory even though the court had not found aeroflot guilty of discrimination .
thank god we have solved this issue inside our country .
we were ready to go further and of course it would have been a shame for russia to expose such things outside of the russian federation , she told reporters .
after the ruling , aeroflot said it was satisfied that the court did not rule it was discriminating against employees , tass news agency reported , and would look at amending its staff regulations once it had fully studied the court s decision .
