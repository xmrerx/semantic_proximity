there s no way to sample this extra 20 or 25 % of new voters that are trump supporters .
sid miller , texas agriculture commissioner , went on fox news on wednesday to discuss the record breaking voter turnout for donald trump in the lone star state.sid miller : we have a record number of people registered to vote in texas .
we re having record turnouts , the first day , the second day of voting .
and it s not bernie sanders supporters coming out to support hillary .
it s not barack obama supporters coming out to support hillary .
it s a new surge of trump voters , many who have never registered to vote .
many who have not voted in eight or ten elections so they re not reported in the polls i know for a fact that the polls are off because they oversample democrats by eight sometimes up to sixteen percent oversampling democrats .
they re oversampling women by five to eight percent .
so the republican vote is underreported .
plus there is no way to sample this extra twenty to twenty-five percent of new voters that are trump voters .
they re not republican , they re not democrats , they re pragmatists .
they re tired of the status quo and they want change .
