One thing you don t ever want to do is tell a woman to smile more.
It s become this thing where people feel they are entitled to tell a woman how she should or should not behave or appear.
As if a woman does this one thing, she ll appear more likable or more genuine or more pretty.
Here s the thing no one is telling men to smile more, because when men don t smile they re being serious and responsible and down to business.
God forbid it be the same thing for a woman.Pointing out this hypocrisy perfectly was none other than Ellen DeGeneres on her show.
She said: She gave a very passioninate speech, and then someone, I don t want to say it was a man, because it was a bunch of men they said that Hillary needs to smile more Here s something you should never tell a woman smile, relax, calm down, or drink less.
It s then brought up that no one is telling the male candidates to smile.
Ellen then shows photos of all the men still running for office (sans Kasich).
She also points out that it s lose-lose for women, because at the same time they re being told to smile more, they re told to wipe the smile off their face because they may look crazy.
Meanwhile, the men can pretty much do as they please.Ellen said: I know Hillary, and I know there are plenty of things that make her smile like her daughter, her granddaughter, when there s a sale on pantsuits I m not against smiling.
I think we should all do it more women, men, cats, Clint Eastwood But we should do it on our own terms.
Which is exactly right.
Telling a woman that they should smile is telling a woman what they should be doing with their body and image, and that s pretty much the epitome of misogyny.
If you don t think it s sexist that likely says more about you than it does about anything else.Featured image via video screen capture
