Who better than a man who risked the lives of his wife and children to get free dental care to ask taxpayers in Europe and America to open their doors to more freeloading Muslims?
THE father of a little boy who drowned while fleeing Syria has pleaded with the world to open its doors to refugees.Three-year-old Alan Kurdi died along with his mother Rehanna and five-year-old brother Ghalib in September.They paid cruel people smugglers thousands to reach Greece by boat after fleeing their war-ravaged homeland.But pictures of his lifeless body washed up on a Turkish beach forced politicians to tackle the refugee crisis.His father Abdullah Kurdi said: My message is I d like the whole world to open its doors to Syrians.
If a person shuts a door in someone s face, this is very difficult.
When a door is opened they no longer feel humiliated.
He added: At this time of year I would like to ask you all to think about the pain of fathers, mothers and children who are seeking peace and security.
We ask just for a little bit of sympathy from you.
