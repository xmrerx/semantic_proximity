washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. house of representatives on wednesday easily passed a bill requiring federal environmental regulators to act faster when lead contamination is found in drinking water .
the bill passed 416-2 .
it was crafted by michigan representatives dan kildee , a democrat , and fred upton , a republican , in the wake of flint ’ s drinking water crisis .
the measure requires the environmental protection agency to notify the public when concentrations of lead in drinking water rise above mandated levels and to create a plan to improve communication between the agency , utilities , states , and consumers .
in 2014 , under a state-appointed emergency manager , flint , a city of 100,000 , switched water supplies to the flint river , from detroit ’ s system as part of a plan to save money in the poverty-stricken city .
the more corrosive river water leached lead from aging pipes .
thousands of children are believed to have ingested dangerous levels of lead , a toxin that can harm brains and cause other health problems .
the bill “ wouldn ’ t have prevented flint , but it would have caught it far sooner , ” kildee , who is from flint , said after the vote .
the measure must be passed by the senate and signed by president barack obama before becoming law .
other measures in congress to provide flint with millions of dollars in aid to deal with the crisis face an uncertain future .
kildee has also introduced a bill to provide about $ 700 million in federal aid , with a match in funding from michigan .
that and other measures languished as democrats and republicans struggled to agree on where the funds would come from .
the department of agriculture said on thursday it would temporarily allow michigan to use funds from its women , infants and children program for low income citizens to conduct lead testing .
the department estimated some 3,800 people could get tested in this way .
