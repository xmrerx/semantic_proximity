Is this not considered child abuse?As birthday entertainment, a black Florida mom hired a stripper to bump and grind her 8-year old son and his friends.
I know someone who is getting one of those World s Best Mom coffee mugs this Mother s Day.According to the NY Daily News a Tampa Bay, FL mom is taking considerable flak for posting a video from her son s 8th birthday party.
The March 24th video showing a stripper shaking her big ass in a little kid s face has since been deleted, but since the Internet is forever, several others have re-posted it.Via: DownTrend
