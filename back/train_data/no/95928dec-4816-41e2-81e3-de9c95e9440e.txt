it s good to know there are still some judges in america who put the law before political correctness an attorney was removed from court and taken into custody after a judge declared her in contempt for refusing to take off a black lives matter pin.youngstown municipal court judge robert milich said attorney andrea burton was in contempt of court for refusing to remove the pin in his courtroom as instructed .
burton was sentenced to five days in jail , but she has been released on a stay while an appeal is underway.burton will stay out of jail during the appeals process as long as she obeys milich s order not to wear items that make a political statement in court .
if she loses her appeal , she will have to serve the five days in jail.milich said his opinions have nothing to do with his decision .
a judge doesn t support either side , he said .
a judge is objective and tries to make sure everyone has an opportunity to have a fair hearing , and it was a situation where it was just in violation of the law , he said.watch : the youngstown branch of the national association for the advancement of colored people ( naacp ) said its legal counsel is monitoring the case closely as it may violate burton s civil rights.the judge said his ruling is based on supreme court case law in which a judge can prohibit symbolic political expression in courtrooms , even if it s not disruptive .
there s a difference between a flag , a pin from your church or the eagles and having a pin that s on a political issue , milich said.legal analysts say judges have free reign when it comes to what s said , or worn , in their courtrooms .
