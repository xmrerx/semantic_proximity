tom hanks , tina fey , alec baldwin and amy poehler are among the notables set to appear on a telethon to benefit the aclu that will stream march 31 via facebook live .
stand for rights : a benefit for the aclu is billed as a modern-day telethon to raise funds for the venerable advocacy organization that has been working overtime with legal challenges to aspects of president trump s political agenda .
our work in the courts is essential right now to hold off the worst of the abuses , said aclu executive director anthony d. romero .
but it is also the collective will and tireless actions of we the people that serve as a bulwark against unconstitutional and wrong-headed policies and executive orders .
by supporting our work through this telethon , we can fight even harder to defend the rights guaranteed by our constitution .
here s a little facebook promo for the event : more talent is expected to sign on in the coming days .
