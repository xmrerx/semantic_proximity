Wow!
It s about time Roger Goodell stepped up to tell the players to stand for our national anthem.
Goodell released a statement today that he expects the NFL players to stand for our anthem.
He said in his statement below: We need to move past this controversy, and we want to do that together with our players.
This came after President Trump Tweeted out that the NFL should stop receiving tax dollars from their fellow Americans because they won t support the anthem: Why is the NFL getting massive tax breaks while at the same time disrespecting our Anthem, Flag and Country?
Change tax law!
PDJTGoodell also addressed the underlying issues : The controversy over the Anthem is a barrier to having honest conversations and making real progress on the underlying issues.
What do you think will happen now?
Do you think the players will give up kneeling or do you think the protests will get worse?He began his letter with: We live in a country that can feel very divided.
Sports, and especially the NFL, brings people together and lets them set aside those divisions, at least for a few hours.
The current dispute over the National Anthem is threatening to erode the unifying power of our game, and is now dividing us, and our players, from many fans across the country.
JUST IN: In letter to NFL owners, Roger Goodell says: "We believe that everyone should stand for the National Anthem."
