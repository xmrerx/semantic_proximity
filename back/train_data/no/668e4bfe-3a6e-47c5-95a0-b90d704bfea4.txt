in 2015 , former professional boxer anthony small , was been cleared of plotting to leave britain to join islamic state militants in syria.apparently it s okay to threaten the lives of british citizens as long as you re not waving an isis flag while you do it.vice small s flourishing boxing career came to an end when he converted to islam at the age of 24 .
now known as abdul-haqq , he decided the sport s lifestyle was incompatible with his hardline practice of the religion and took up preaching instead.an associate of the infamous islamic preacher anjem choudary and his banned organization al-muhajiroun , haqq used social media to share his fundamentalist views of islam .
he regularly posted controversial videos filmed in his home , justifying is beheadings and terror attacks such as the public killing of uk soldier lee rigby in 2013.here is anthony small s most recent video where he targets britain first co-founder paul golding former edl leader tommy robinson along with conservative radio host katie hopkins .
keep in mind that youtube is cracking down on conservatives for hate speech while this muslim man is using youtube to threaten the lives of 3 popular british activist .
censorship for conservatives is apparently more dangerous than death threats from professional boxers turned muslim extremists : haqq s views have led to multiple police raids on his house , as well as accusations of trying to join is in the middle east .
vice news spoke to haqq on the run up to his arrest about police raids , western foreign policy , and his faith .
we then caught up with him again outside london s old bailey court after his release.here s who anthony small boxer really is .
this video is a great reminder of why trump was correct about our need to do a better job of vetting our refugees : go here to see paul golding of britain first s reply to former professional boxer turned allah s soldier tommy .
