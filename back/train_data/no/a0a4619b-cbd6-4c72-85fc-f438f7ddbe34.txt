washington ( reuters ) - u.s. president donald trump has not yet made a decision on whether to formally recognize jerusalem as israel s capital , his adviser and son-in-law jared kushner said on sunday , a move that would break with decades of u.s. policy and could fuel violence in the middle east .
he s still looking at a lot of different facts , and then when he makes his decision , he ll be the one to want to tell you , not me , kushner said at an annual conference on u.s. policy in the middle east organized by the brookings institution think tank in washington .
a senior administration official said last week that trump could make the announcement on wednesday .
kushner is leading trump s efforts to restart long-stalled israeli-palestinian peace talks , efforts that so far have shown little progress .
past u.s. presidents have insisted that the status of jerusalem home to sites holy to the jewish , muslim and christian religions must be decided in negotiations .
the palestinians want jerusalem as the capital of their future state , and the international community does not recognize israel s claim on all of the city .
any move by the united states to recognize jerusalem as israel s capital would fuel extremism and violence , arab league secretary-general ahmed aboul gheit said on saturday .
a senior jordanian source said on sunday that amman , the current president of the arab summit , has begun consultations on convening an emergency meeting of the arab league and the organisation of islamic cooperation before trump s expected declaration this week .
