Actor and Medal of Freedom recipient Tom Hanks is doing his part to support the free press against the tyranny of Donald Trump.The White House Press Corps has had to deal with a lot of bullshit, so Hanks sent them a gift that ought to keep them going for the long haul.CNN White House producer Allie Malloy reported on Twitter that Hanks sent the White House Press Corps an expresso machine so they can keep pumping themselves full of all the caffeine and sugar they need for all the long days and late nights of keeping the American public informed on what Trump and his administration are doing.
Keep up the good fight for Truth, Justice, and the American Way, Hanks wrote before taking a clear shot at Trump.
Especially for the Truth part.

The press has had to dig deep since Trump took office to keep the American people informed and fact-check all of his claims, most of which have been debunked as lies.This isn t the first time Hanks has slammed Trump.During the campaign Hanks burned Trump for bragging about grabbing women by the genitals without their consent.
He was at work, man, Hanks said during an interview in October.
He wasn t in a locker room.
He was at work.
He was showing up to do a thing on camera.
Look I m offended as a man.
I m not offended as a husband or a father.
I m offended as a guy.
That s just not right, I m sorry.
It s not right at work, it s not right in the locker room.
It s wrong, period.
The end.
That s all.
