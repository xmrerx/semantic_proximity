You re on your feet all day b*tch.
All day Get the f*ck out of here.

THIS WOMAN SHOULD BE TOSSED IN JAIL The hardworking American taxpayers are supporting this horrible woman.
If Trump does anything at all, he should crack down on the freebies given to people like this.
A single woman can make more money by just sitting around han she can if she works!
There s something wrong with the system and it needs to be fixed pronto!The government has incentivized having children because these single mothers get more government money per child.
We ve looked at the state of New York and here s what we found:FINANCIAL HELP FOR SINGLE MOTHERS IN NY STATE: NY FAMILY ASSISTANCE CASH PAYMENT OF $789 PER MONTHFOOD STAMPS UP TO $1200 A MONTH DEPENDING ON NUMBER IN FAMILYMEDICAID AND CHILD HEALTH PLUSWIC ANOTHER FOOD PROGRAMCHILD AND AUDLT FOOD CARE PROGRAM PROVIDES MEALS FOR KIDS IN DAYCARESUBSIDIZED CHILD CARE- FREE OR LOW-COST CHILDCAREFREE PRE-K PROGRAMSECTION 8 HOUSINGUNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR 26 WEEKSTUITION ASSISTANCE UP TO $5,000That about covers it most states provide these freebies.
Is it any wonder people are cradle to grave on assistance ?
The government has made this a crutch but at whose expense?
If you guessed the taxpayers, you d be right!
The culture surrounding these freebies makes people feel entitled to them.
Why not?
They don t even think about you or your sacrifices it s a sick dependency that needs to end.
Welfare reform NOW!
