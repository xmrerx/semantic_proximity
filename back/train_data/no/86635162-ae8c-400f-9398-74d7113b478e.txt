manila ( reuters ) - philippine lawmakers on wednesday rejected the nomination of the last leftist president rodrigo duterte included in his cabinet , removing the agrarian reform minister a year after he joined the government in a bid by duterte to promote peace .
duterte , after becoming president in june last year , offered places in his cabinet to members of the outlawed communist party of the philippines to demonstrate his commitment to talks to end their long-running insurgency .
the minister , rafael mariano , was one of two people the party nominated to serve in the cabinet .
senator vicente sotto , chairman of a committee scrutinizing cabinet appointments , said it had conducted an exhaustive deliberation then held a vote .
the weight of the scales ultimately tipped the balance against the confirmation of the appointee , sotto told senate .
he did not elaborate on the reason for the rejection but it came a few months after the government canceled formal peace talks with the communist rebels .
duterte wants to strike a peace deal with the communists but has been angered by continued violence .
he says their demands are excessive and he has already made concessions .
mariano , speaking to reporters after the hearing , denounced big landlords , oligarchs , businessmen and big corporations , saying they may have prevailed with his rejection but the farmers would win in the end .
i may have failed to get the confirmation today but i will not stop serving our farmers , he said .
presidential spokesman ernesto abella expressed regret over mariano s removal , saying he had promoted farmers rights and welfare and ensured their security of land tenure .
