Who knew former CNN anchor Piers Morgan would criticize MSNBC s Chris Matthews!
Matthews keeps comparing the Trump family to the former royal family of Russia the Romanovs.It s not just one passing comment but several!
The Russian royal family lived a lavish life before being lined up and shot by the incoming communists.
It s a horrific story and Matthews keeps comparing the Trumps to the tragic royal family.
Liberal Lunacy!MORGAN RIPPED INTO THE LUNACY OF THE MATTHEWS THEORY ABOUT TRUMP: We re expected to believe that Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin get together, and they plan the mass murder of children to make some kind of point that they re no longer best buddies.
Really?
Really?
We think this a legitimate conspiracy theory flying?

The Romanovs were all slaughtered at the start of what would become the communist Soviet Union.
Whatever your view of the Romanovs, that s not really a comparison I don t think anyone in the American media should be making about the Trump family, he said.
What are we supposed to deduce from that comment that, somehow, Jared, Ivanka, and Donald are all going to be murdered by communists?
Hannity said the media is at a new low for how they portray Trump and his family, including his 10-year-old son Barron and wife Melania.Matthews has repeatedly compared the two families over the last couple months.
Matthews likened President Donald Trump s daughter Ivanka and his son-in-law Jared Kushner s White House roles to the Romanovs last week.
He also asked on Inauguration Day why the Trump family reminded him of the Romanovs.Via:WFB
