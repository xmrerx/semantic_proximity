ankara ( reuters ) - a bomb blast wrecked a bus carrying police officers on tuesday in the southern turkish province of mersin , injuring 18 people in an attack that security sources blamed on kurdish militants .
seventeen of those hurt were police officers , deputy prime minister and government spokesman bekir bozdag told parliament , branding it a terrorist attack .
turkey s battle against terror will continue under any circumstances in a strong and determined way , bozdag said .
security sources said militants of the outlawed kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) were believed to have carried out the attack .
they also said that none of those wounded were in a critical condition .
no one immediately claimed responsibility for the bombing .
local mayor burhanettin kocamaz told broadcaster haberturk the attack took place on a street where the local governor s office was located and had hit the police vehicle as it passed .
images from ntv showed smoke billowing from the area , in mersin s yenisehir district .
ambulances , police and fire trucks were sent to the site of the attack , security sources said .
turkey is battling a three-decade insurgency in its mainly kurdish southeast .
the pkk frequently carries out bomb attacks on security forces in the southeast and elsewhere .
the pkk is considered a terrorist organization by the united states and the european union as well as by turkey .
more than 40,000 people , most of them kurds , have died since it first took up arms against the state in 1984 .
