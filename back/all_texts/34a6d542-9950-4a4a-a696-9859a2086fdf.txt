All buildings now inspected..... [0826 EDT] - ...for safety.
Thank you to the Governor of P.R.
and to all of those who are working so closely with our First Responders.
Fantastic job!
[0830 EDT] - I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man... [1030 EDT] - ...Save your energy Rex, we’ll do what has to be done!
[1031 EDT] - Being nice to Rocket Man hasn’t worked in 25 years, why would it work now?
Clinton failed, Bush failed, and Obama failed.
I won’t fail.
