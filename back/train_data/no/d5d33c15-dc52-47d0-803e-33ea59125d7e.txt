the numbers are in , and over 3 million men and women of all backgrounds took to the streets all across the nation to protest donald trump and his incoming disastrous presidency.in 670 cities throughout the north , south , east and west in some of the most conservative enclaves like lubbock , texas protestors partook in peaceful demonstrations , and their decorum shined bright.not one person was arrested , and not incident of violence surfaced.in washington d.c , over 500,000 men and women gathered on the national mall , and not one violent act sullied the day , and no arrests made for any reason.in los angeles , 750,000 convened ( even though police only prepared for 80,000 ) , and like washington , not one arrest was made and not one incident of violence occurred.in new york city , 400,000 people convened , and not one was arrested.not only were the demonstrations peaceful and orderly , police officers were deeply involved with the community , expressing solidarity with men and women : dc cops posted across from white house are wearing pink pussyhats and posing for photos with marchers .
big cheers from crowd .

how amazing it is to see women , people of color , police and partisans alike come together for one common mission .
with the next four years hanging over our heads , more instances like this will be crucial to taking back power in washington and the state legislatures.to think that a demonstration organized by poc yielded the most peaceful of marches really puts a dent in the media ( and the trump administration s ) perception of minorities and those who protest.to paraphrase one attendee , it was a sea of humanism.the women s march was , arguably , the largest and most peaceful demonstration in american history .
the women of america ( once again ) showed their strength , and they should be so proud.while punches were thrown at trump s rallies , hugs and high fives were given at the women s march .
let that sink in.featured image via mario tama/getty images
