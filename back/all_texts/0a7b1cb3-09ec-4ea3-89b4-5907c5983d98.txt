ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey, whose relations with Germany have soured in recent months, will take two steps to normalize bilateral relations if Germany takes one step, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said in a television interview on Monday.
He was speaking after Germany s Angela Merkel secured a fourth term as chancellor in an election which saw her support slide and the far right making significant gains.
Germany should learn from its mistakes, Cavusoglu told broadcaster A Haber when asked about ties between the two countries, which have been hit by disagreements on a range of political and security issues.
