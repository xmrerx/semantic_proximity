Republican congressional candidates have been the source of some of the most outrageous campaign ads over the last few years.
A new ad from Kentucky 1st district candidate Mike Pape is one of the most racist examples of this that has come across in a long time.In the ad, three apparent Mexicans approach a border fence wearing t-shirts that say, Stop Trump Stop Ted Cruz and Stop Pape .
The subtitled, heavily-accented actors explain that Pape will work to build Trump s wall or help Cruz repeal Obamacare, before saying they must stop him and charge into the country illegally.
Pape then appears in the foreground to say he approves the message.The ad builds on Donald Trump s racially charged campaign rhetoric and his bizarre promise to build a wall between the United States and Mexico, paid for by the Mexican government.On the very first day of Trump s campaign, he blamed Mexicans for bringing crime like rape to America, as well as drugs.Gaskins is currently running in the Republican primary for his district against three other candidates, for the seat that will be opened up due to the retirement of Rep. Ed Whitfield.
It is a heavily Republican district, with 73 percent of the vote going to the GOP in the 2014 election.The ad is a symptom of the problems plaguing the Republican Party nationally.
As the country becomes more diverse, especially with Latinos, the GOP s hardcore base demands that candidates stick to racist and sexist appeals that reliably get voters to the polls.And when Republicans attempt to slightly moderate themselves even with candidates who are otherwise hard conservatives they are ostracized and excluded.
For instance, while former Florida Governor Jeb Bush was an orthodox conservative, he argued in favor of immigration policy that was harsh but not as draconian as other candidates.
As a result, Bush was utterly destroyed in the 2016 primaries and caucuses, even though he had more money than everyone else.This ad reflects the current state of the Republican Party, and it isn t a good look.Featured image via YouTube
