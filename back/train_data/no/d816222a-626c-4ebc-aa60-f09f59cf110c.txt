this is some pretty surreal stuff in the four years since the start of operation vigilant eagle , the government has steadily ramped up its campaign to silence dissidents , especially those with military backgrounds.the case of 26-year-old decorated marine brandon raub who was targeted because of his facebook posts , interrogated by government agents about his views on government corruption , arrested with no warning , labeled mentally ill for subscribing to so-called conspiratorial views about the government , detained against his will in a psych ward for standing by his views , and isolated from his family , friends and attorneys is a prime example of the government s war on veterans.raub s case exposes the seedy underbelly of a governmental system that is targeting americans especially military veterans for expressing their discontent over america s rapid transition to a police state .
