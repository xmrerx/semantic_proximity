as if this presidential race couldn t get any crazier rumors abound that mitt romney might jump in and stir things up a bit .
the problem is that romney failed in his strategy of being mr. nice guy and not attacking which really let obama just steamroll over him in 2012 .
not a good idea ! colorful former trump adviser roger stone thinks 2012 republican nominee mitt romney is thinking about getting back in the presidential race .
stone tweeted his suspicion , and told cnn he had heard that romney was considering a run from his sources.the move could indicate romney sees an opportunity to better confront and challenge front-runner donald trump .
some see current establishment standard bearer former florida gov .
jeb bush as flailing .
trump has mocked bush for being just flat on the campaign trail and sunday called him a low energy candidate.romney publicly considered a third run as recently as january , but decided against it , after he lost most of his valuable donor base to bush , and the massive prospective republican field proved too unpredictable.romney ran for president in 2012 , and lost the nomination to sen. john mccain in 2008 .
romney supporters point to ronald reagan s three attempts at the white house 1968 , 1976 , before his successful win in 1980 , as evidence that romney has a chance.the man who floated this rumor , trump s former adviser stone , has a history almost as colorful as that of his former boss .
stone was an aide to president richard nixon , and remains one of nixon s staunchest defenders .
he is known for his penchant for expensive but elaborate dress clothes , which are often a departure from the more understated nature of most political menswear.he has been described as a self-admitted hit man for the gop by the daily beast , is a popular presence on twitter , and allegedly , has a tattoo of his former boss nixon on his back.via : washington examiner
