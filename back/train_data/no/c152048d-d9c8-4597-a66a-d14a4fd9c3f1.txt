virginia governor terry mcauliffe decided to get political today when he spoke out during the presser for the virginia shooting of congressman steve scalise .
leave it to a political hack like mcauliffe to bring gun control into the discussion : there are too many guns on the street .
we lose 93 million americans a day to gun violence .
confusion : va gov .

he eventually corrected himself to say that it s just 93 people a day who are victims of gun violence .
how many are saved because they are armed with a gun ?
lives were saved today because the capitol police were armed .
that s all thanks to steve scalise who is a leader in congress and gets protection .
it they hadn t been there , who know how many would have been killed ! mcauliffe is a clinton crony who has always been a snake in the grass .
he will do anything to get ahead politically .
he s been involved in a questionable redistricting in his state and prior to the 2016 election he made it possible for thousands of felons to vote .
