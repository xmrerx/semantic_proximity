MUNICH (Reuters) - German police ruled out a political or religious motive behind a knife attack in the city of Munich on Saturday and said a detained man suspected of injuring eight people had mental health problems.
The arrest of the suspect in his 30s brought calm back to the streets of the Bavarian capital after a tense morning.
Police had asked residents to stay home until they find the attacker who had fled on a bicycle.
Munich police chief Hubertus Andrae told a news conference that eight people have been lightly injured in the attack and that the suspect was known to police from previous offences, including burglary.
We have no indication of a terrorist, political, or religious motive, Andrae said.
I assume it is to do with a psychological disorder of the perpetrator.
Police had earlier said they believe the man, who attacked people at several different locations, acted alone.
His victims include a 12-year-old boy and a woman.
