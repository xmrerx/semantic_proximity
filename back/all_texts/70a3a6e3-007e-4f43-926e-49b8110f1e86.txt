The video can be seen HERE.One of the organizers of the Deploraball, Mike Chernovich is a conservative author, activist and is very active on Twitter.
Here is an excerpt from his video below: When you go on video and you admit to committing an act of domestic terrorism, and then you buy tickets, that is an overt act.
It s a criminal conspiracy to commit an act of terrorism.
And they definitely picked the wrong group to try and terrorize.
Jeff Sessions is gonna be the Attorney General.
This is a new Department of Justice.
They thought they were dealing with Obama.
Because Obama would let it go.
Obama would say Oh terrorism against these people, who cares?
Well Obama isn t in charge of the Department of Justice anymore.
Obama, Eric Holder, Loretta Lynch they re out.
