The request for the temporary restraining order says BLM has been using its Facebook and Twitter pages to promote a demonstration at the Mall of America s East Rotunda at 1 p.m. on December 23, 2015.In asking for a restraining order, attorneys for MOA point to a similar protest held on December 20, 2014 involving approximately 1,000 protesters inside the mall.
A number of the demonstrators were arrested and charged with trespassing.
The legal action maintains that MOA and its tenants suffered irreparable harm, including reduced guests and sales.
The mall says traffic counts for the number of cars entering parking ramps on that day were down 15 percent from statistics from the previous five years, which translates into 24,000 fewer shoppers.
Mall attorneys maintain that many retailers reported double digit decreases in sales on December 20,2014, the date of that demonstration.
