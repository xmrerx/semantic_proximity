here s a question for the anti-trump media : if putin and trump have such a strong history of working together , why take such drastic actions against the us ?
why doesn t putin just pick up the phone and call his old buddy donald trump and get those sanctions lifted ?
russian president vladimir putin said on sunday that 755 us diplomats must leave the country by sept. 1.putin s order comes after a threat he issued on friday about slashing us diplomatic staff in russia and seizing two american properties in retaliation after congress approved a vote to slap new sanctions over moscow s interference in the 2016 presidential election.remember when president trump used twitter to mock the media for suggesting putin wanted to see trump elected over the very weak hillary clinton ? in other words , russia was against trump in the 2016 election and why not , i want strong military & low oil prices .
witch hunt !

we waited for quite some time that maybe something will change for the better , had such hope that the situation will somehow change , but judging by everything , if it changes , it will not be soon , putin said in a television interview with the rossiya 1 network , according to interfax news agency .
