Presidential candidate Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX) visited a South Carolina church on Sunday and in a message broadcast to several other houses of worship, made an argument for a government based on the principles of the religious far right, rather than the American Constitution.Echoing Middle Eastern extremists who believe that the law of God trumps existing laws, Cruz told the crowd what they wanted to hear about where a candidate like himself would take America.Cruz, an avowed evangelical, made his case in front of a packed house of nearly 2,000 churchgoers.His sermon, titled Faith in Action, pressed a range of conservative hot buttons, from religious liberty to abortion rights to the Second Amendment.Cruz warned that a radical left-wing majority on the Supreme Court could result in unlimited abortions on demand across this country with taxpayer funding and no parental notification.
He called the high court s decision to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide fundamentally illegitimate, lawless, unconstitutional and wrong.
Cruz has previously demonstrated that he believes religious faith trumps the law of the land, with his support for rogue clerk Kim Davis in Kentucky.
Cruz was among the woman s most vocal supporters as she refused to grant marriage certificates for same-sex couples, even after the Supreme Court had ruled that same-sex marriages were legal in all fifty states and the District of Columbia.Over his campaign, Cruz has tried to appeal to the faction of conservative Republican voters who have a view of the role of government that is similar to Middle Eastern sharia, where religious texts and beliefs have more sway than the written rule of law.
Cruz found success, when those voters backed him in the Iowa caucus and led to victory for his campaign.
He had a setback with New Hampshire s less religious and more independent primary voters, where he finished in third place.
Cruz is hoping that more religious extremist voters in South Carolina will allow him to regain the momentum he may have lost.Featured image via YouTube
