Ever the politician and excellent liar, Obama was asked about smoking pot during a press event in Vietnam.
He must have smoked lots of pot because he forgot about the FACT that he said he indeed did smoke pot.
He also must have forgotten that he wrote about it in his book.
Remember Choom Gang?
We re not condemning him for the pot smoking as much as we re calling him out for blatantly lying in his book or to the questioner in Vietnam.
So which is it?
Here s our president totally trying to pull a fast one in an obvious lie at a press event in a foreign country.
Nice job Obama making America look foolish on a national stage is REALLY what you re best at.Obama and his Choom Gang must have been smoking strong stuff.
Now he can t even remember if he smoked it at all.
From his recent trip to Vietnam:When a Vietnamese attendee at a town hall asked Pres.
Obama about his weed-smoking past, the U.S. president replied that he didn t know if reports of his marijuana use were true.The exchange:Q: Thank you.
I m a filmmaker, so I m very interested in personal stories.
And you said before, when you are young you re like fooling around.
And I read on Internet I m not sure if it s true or not that you also like smoking weed and things like that.
OBAMA: I don t know if that s true.
If he really doesn t remember, he ought to refresh his memory by reading his own book:In his 1995 memoir Dreams of My Father, Obama writes about smoking pot almost like Dr. Seuss wrote about eating green eggs and ham.
As a high school kid, Obama wrote, he would smoke in a white classmate s sparkling new van, he would smoke in the dorm room of some brother and he would smoke on the beach with a couple of Hawaiian kids.
He would smoke it here and there.
He would smoke it anywhere.Maybe Obama killed too many brain cells and all of a sudden he can t remember how convenient!Read more: moonbattery
