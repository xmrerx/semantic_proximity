WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan on Tuesday urged international cooperation in reacting to a series of attacks in Brussels that have left 34 people dead and many injured.
“As our countries have always done, we must confront this threat together.
We must defend democracy, and defeat terror,” Ryan told reporters.
