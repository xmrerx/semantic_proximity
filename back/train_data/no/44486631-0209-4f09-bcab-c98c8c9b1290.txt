this is spot on !
ned ryun joined tucker carlson to discuss the latest leak regarding ag jeff sessions .
do we even have evidence that the source is in fact telling the truth ?
wapo went ahead and reported it anyway .
ryun s right when he discusses the deep state and mueller subverting the will of the american voter : https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=-s8scwnogt4this is dangerous territory and is so harmful to our president and his agenda .
tucker carlson had more to say on this : what are these transactions ?
basically any commercial activity that trump or his family and associates conducted over the last decade that might pertain to russia or anyone who has ever lived in russia .
let s be clear about the politics here .
this is a massive threat to the white house .
a determined prosecutor can prove almost anything he wants .
a prosecutor with no time limit or budget or accountability to voters ?
there is nobody more dangerous than that .
the investigation has been slammed by very reputable lawyers who happen to be democrats !
this needs to end asap !
