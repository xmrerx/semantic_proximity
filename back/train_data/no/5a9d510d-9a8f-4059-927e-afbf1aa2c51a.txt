i am here to announce that i am considering a run for president in 2020 , and i thought it would be better to cut out the middleman and just tell the russians myself , colbert continued .
if anyone would like to work on my campaign in an unofficial capacity , please just let me know .
while this seems unbelievable , this wouldn t be the first time colbert has thrown his hat into the ring .
he once ran for president as his alter-ego , but the campaign ended with the primary.americans for years have been urging colbert to actually run for president preferably with jon stewart as his running mate and if there s one thing we have learned from the reality show host currently in the white house it s that anything is possible.watch colbert s announcement below : featured image via screengrab
