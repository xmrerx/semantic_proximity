Republicans are no friend to women, that much is obvious.
They have been steadily passing anti-choice laws in red states for some time now; in fact, many women in these states have literally no access to reproductive health services due to these draconian bills.
Well, one entrepreneur has an awesome way for women everywhere to be able to take out their frustrations on anti-woman Republicans: By bleeding all over them every month.Etsy shop Cute Fruit Undies has come out with a line of period panties meaning panties that can be used in the place of tampons or sanitary pads that feature the faces of anti-choice GOPers right on the crotch.
You can choose from many different politicians Donald Trump, Ted Cruz, Sarah Palin, and more.
Here are the photos used for the design: The panties themselves are super cute, and they even come with heat packs to help with the cramps so many women suffer through during menstruation.The makers of the panties say that they are made up of the faces of politicians who have actively worked to pass legislation that will hinder women s access to abortions, birth control, and Planned Parenthood, and therefore you should bleed all over em.
The panties are also super healthy, as they are absorbent and anti-bacterial.
You can also buy sets that include crop tops that match as well.I don t know about you ladies, but I ll definitely be getting some of these.
Oh, and the best part?
Three dollars of each sale goes to Planned Parenthood locations in states affected by these politicians crazy laws.All images via Cute Fruit Undies/Facebook/Buzzfeed
