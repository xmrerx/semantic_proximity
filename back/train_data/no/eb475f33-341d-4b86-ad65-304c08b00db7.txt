yola , nigeria ( reuters ) - muslim cattle herders are suspected of killing four police officers in the northeastern nigerian state of adamawa , a police official said on friday .
the four officers were killed on thursday night defending a village in the numan region from the herdsmen , who attacked the settlement as a reprisal for an earlier deadly clash , said othman abubakar , a police spokesman for the state .
in the earlier clash , unidentified attackers killed more than 30 cattle herders in numan .
numan has recently become a flashpoint for clashes between the herders and christian farmers , which occur frequently across broad swathes of nigeria , as each group contests the other s rights to land for pasture and agriculture .
