kuala lumpur ( reuters ) - two malaysian teenagers were charged with murder on thursday , for setting fire to an islamic boarding school that killed 23 people , mostly boys .
the fire in kuala lumpur on sept. 14 was the deadliest of its kind in two decades , and the tragedy sparked public outrage , with calls for greater safety and tougher regulation at religious schools .
[ nl4n1lw1ls ] the blaze had broken out in a top-floor dormitory at the three-storey boarding school where most of the students were sleeping in bunk beds , with many of the windows barred by metal grilles .
the two accused were part of a group of seven youths , all male and aged between 12 and 18 , who police said had started the fire after feuding with students from the boarding school .
they lived in the neighborhood and did not attend the school .
[ nl4n1lx062 ] prosecutors declined to provide the suspects names or ages , citing malaysia s child protection laws , but said both the accused boys were minors .
they are being tried jointly and are facing 23 counts of murder , one for each victim of the fire , prosecuting lawyer othman abdullah told reporters outside a juvenile court in kuala lumpur .
malaysia carries a mandatory death penalty for murder , but authorities have said it will not apply to the youths as they were underage .
they could instead face jail time , whipping , fines or detention at an approved school .
the two , along with four others , are also facing drug use charges .
all but one were minors , while another youth was released due to insufficient evidence , othman said .
those charged had tested positive for drugs , including marijuana and methamphetamine , according to a charge sheet sighted by reuters .
the court has set nov. 28 as the date for the next hearing , othman said .
