tokyo ( reuters ) - japanese prime minister shinzo abe s coalition is on track for a roughly two-thirds majority in sunday s general election , a survey by kyodo news agency showed , as its conservative rival led by tokyo governor yuriko koike appeared to lose momentum .
japanese go to the polls on sunday to elect representatives for the country s 465-member lower house , the more powerful of japan s two-chamber parliament .
the kyodo poll , conducted by telephone between oct. 15-17 , showed abe s liberal democratic party ( ldp ) poised to win about 280 seats in the 465-member lower house .
combined with its junior coalition partner komeito , it is likely to retain about two-thirds of the seats , kyodo said .
the ruling bloc held a two-thirds super majority before the chamber was dissolved for the snap election .
about two-fifth of voters polled were still undecided , suggesting they could still sway the results , it said .
the party of hope , which tokyo governor koike launched last month as a reformist , conservative alternative to the ldp , has lost momentum since the previous survey , kyodo said .
the constitutional democratic party of japan ( cdpj ) , formed this month by liberal members of the democratic party , is set to beat out the party of hope to become the leading opposition party , at least doubling its representation , kyodo added .
a reuters corporate survey published on wednesday showed japanese companies overwhelmingly want abe s coalition to stay in power but also want it to lose seats , suggesting they want political stability but don t want to hand him a landslide victory .
