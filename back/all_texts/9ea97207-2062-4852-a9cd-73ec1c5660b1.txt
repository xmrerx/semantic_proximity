Assimilation or respect for the host country is not a strong suit for Muslim migrants/rapefugees Asylum seekers have left an asylum home and have smeared blood, vomit and feces all over the walls according to police.In preparation for the visit of U.S. President Barack Obama, riot police in the German town of Hameln needed somewhere for the officers to stay overnight.
The police were offered a barracks that previously held migrants but were shocked to discover that the past residents had smeared faeces, vomit and blood all over the walls of the former asylum home reports Junge Freiheit.North Rhine-Westphalia police refused the accommodation due to the unsanitary conditions the barracks had been left in.
The Facebook page of the German police union posted pictures of the former migrant home saying, semen, blood and faeces on the walls and in the beds.
Inside cockroaches were eating.
The union went on to say that the officers would not sleep in the conditions and preferred to spend the night in their vehicles instead.One policeman said that the only reason they felt they were able to seek alternate accommodations was by showing media what the asylums seekers had left for them.
They called the conditions catastrophic.
The difficulty of bringing migrants up to speed with Western hygienic norms has been shown time and time again over the migrant crisis.
The border town of Nickelsdorf in particular was said to have been struggling with garbage and sewage left by migrants.Trains had to be disinfected entirely because many migrants did not know how to operate a western style toilet and opted to defecate on the floor or in a urinal.
