beirut ( reuters ) - iran s military chief met with syrian president bashar al-assad on thursday during a visit to damascus to set out a joint military strategy , syria s state news agency reported , a sign of deepening iranian influence that has alarmed israel .
general mohammad baqeri said iran was determined to continue supporting the syrian leadership and people until security and safety are returned to them and would help with reconstruction , the state news agency sana said .
israel has voiced deep concern over tehran s widening influence in syria , where iranian forces and iran-backed militias including lebanon s hezbollah have played a critical role helping assad in the six-year-long war .
on tuesday , baqeri , speaking from damascus , warned israel against breaching syrian airspace and territory and pledged to increase cooperation with syria s military to fight both israel and sunni jihadist militants .
israel s air force says it has struck arms convoys of the syrian military and hezbollah nearly 100 times during the war .
israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu has said that iran was strengthening its foothold in syria and that israel would do whatever it takes to protect its security .
tensions have risen this year between lebanon s hezbollah and israel , which have avoided a major conflict since 2006 .
in the meeting with baqeri , assad said the iranian people and armed forces were a key partner in victories against terrorism in syria , sana reported .
military support from iran and russia has helped assad regain swathes of syria from rebels and islamic state militants .
