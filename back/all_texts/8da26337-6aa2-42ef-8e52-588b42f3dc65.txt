You might just die of cute when you see the video the White House just posted.
106-year-old Virginia McLaurin had always dreamed of going to the White House.
Her dream was just fulfilled, and she got to dance with President Obama and the First Lady.
They laugh, they joke, and she is just so excited.
The Obamas compliment her beautiful manicure, and she expresses just the most ecstatic happiness.
She says she is there to celebrate Black History Month.
The White House just posted the video with the caption:What s the secret to still dancing at 106?
