ankara ( reuters ) - the u.s. embassy in turkey said on tuesday that visa appointments were only available from early 2019 , due to an accumulation of applications following a diplomatic spat that prompted the two nato allies to mutually suspend granting visas .
in spite of long wait times , the u.s. mission to turkey continues to process non-immigrant visas .
appointments are available for january 2019 , and applicants can as always choose to apply outside of turkey , it said .
the united states in november resumed limited visa services in turkey after getting what it said were assurances about the safety of its local staff .
washington halted issuing visas at its missions in turkey in october , citing the detention of two local employees .
turkey soon matched the move , relaxing a visa ban of its own that was instituted in retaliation against washington .
however , turkey said it had not offered assurances .
in may , a translator at the u.s. consulate in the southern province of adana was arrested and , more recently , a u.s. drug enforcement administration ( dea ) worker was detained in istanbul .
both are accused of links to last year s coup attempt .
the u.s. embassy has said the accusations are baseless .
turkey has been angered by what it sees as u.s. reluctance to hand over the cleric fethullah gulen , who has lived in pennsylvania since 1999 and whom ankara blames for orchestrating the coup .
u.s. officials have said courts require sufficient evidence to order his extradition .
