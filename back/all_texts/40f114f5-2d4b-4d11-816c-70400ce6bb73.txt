Donald Trump has claimed to be a billionaire who was willing to spend major dollars in order to secure the White House and remain independent.
In reality, Trump has been stingy with his money and the evidence has mounted that he is worth far less than he claims and he won t release his tax returns to prove otherwise.Now in the most recent filings, Trump again has been shown up as a liar, donating far less of his own money to the campaign even as Hillary Clinton began to increase her lead in nearly every national poll.Donald Trump cut his routine $2 million monthly check to his campaign last September after repeatedly suggesting that he would increase his donations during the campaign s stretch run.Trump s campaign, along with Republican joint fundraising committees, said it raised $100 million last month, more than it has in any previous month though well short of the $154 million Hillary Clinton s operation took in.The report also showed that unlike in other years, big pocketed Republican donors have not lined up to support the Trump campaign.
In all likelihood they are seeing the writing on the wall and are staying away from a campaign circling the drain.Since freaking out over former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, the release of his sexual assault audio tape, and the stream of women now coming forward to allege that Trump molested them, his polling numbers have collapsed.
Combined with Republican officials rescinding their support, Trump is now seen as with only about a 10 percent chance of winning the election according to most polling analysis.At the same time, Hillary Clinton has consolidated most of the Democratic Party base behind her, and has top-tier surrogates like President Obama, Michelle Obama, Joe Biden, Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders campaigning on her behalf.Featured image via Flickr
