BONN, Germany (Reuters) - President Emmanuel Macron on Wednesday said his invitation on Wednesday to Lebanon s prime minister Saad al-Hariri to come to France was not an offer of political exile.
No, not at all, Macron told reporters in Bonn when asked if he was handing Hariri exile.
I hope that Lebanon will be stable, and that political choices should be in accordance with institutional rule.
We need a strong Lebanon with her territorial integrity respected.
We need leaders who are free to make their own choices and speak freely.
