Sarah Palin is stupid.
Really stupid.
Imagine generations upon generations of inbreeding among heavy meth users and she s basically the embodiment of that.
So unsurprisingly, when she tweeted out what seems to be a mandatory daily nonsensical attack on the President, the Internet was there to do what it does best and kick her teeth in metaphorically, of course.
Merry Christ er scratch that, she tweeted, linking to an article on Young Conservatives We Are the Obamas and It s Some Random Holiday!
"Merry Christ er scratch that.
"We Are the Obamas and It's Some Random Holiday!"
https://t.co/lyXGK4woql Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) December 11, 2016The article references the Obama family s latest Christmas card, which features a photo of the family smiling with a happy holidays expression of gratefulness for the friends we ve made, the joy we ve shared, and the gifts of kindness we ve received.
It s exactly the kind of family Christmas (it s one of the aforementioned holidays, idiots) card that brings a smile to someone s face unless you re a member of the Stupid Part of America.
The picture features the immediate family of four Barack, Michelle, Malia, and Sasha but makes no mention of Christmas , John S. Roberts writes in his nonsensical screed against the idea that there are more than one religious holidays that fall in the month of December.
It s basically a Holiday card, because writing the word Christmas would hurt too many feelings.
Is it January 20th yet?
he writes, adding that it is right around the corner.
Naturally, the denizens of Twitter did not take kindly to Palin s usual war on Christmas rhetoric.
@SarahPalinUSA Isn't there a job you should be not doing somewhere?
Charles P. Pierce (@CharlesPPierce) December 11, 2016@SarahPalinUSA Video of Obamas saying Merry Xmas over and over.

Go back to Alaska.

(@mlanger) December 11, 2016@SarahPalinUSA Christmas was a pagan holiday.
Jesus has nothing to do with Dec 25.
Christmas tree, yule log, wreath, all pagan symbols.
ibrahim sapien (@IbrahimSapien__) December 11, 2016@SarahPalinUSA So if you want America to go back to its Christian fundamentalist purity, ban Christmas!
ibrahim sapien (@IbrahimSapien__) December 11, 2016@SarahPalinUSA We've been cyber invaded by Russia and you're still stuck in the war on Christmas?
Our concerns are way beyond that.
DudeDiligence (@DudeDiligence) December 11, 2016@SarahPalinUSA I was thinking the Obamas were wishing everyone an enjoyable holiday season?
Holidays are only for Christians?
Gus Studer (@Gus_Studer) December 11, 2016@SarahPalinUSA Nobody cares if you say Merry Christmas for Happy F**king Holidays.
Get over it already.
Ocular Nervosa (@ocularnervosa) December 11, 2016@SarahPalinUSA oh Honey, you're jealous cause the #ObamaLegacy won't have a single drunken brawl or knock up kid.
Plus they can read.

Especially ones with class.
Cathy (@covcat) December 11, 2016If there s one thing we can count on Sarah Palin for it s a virtually assured laugh every year as she pivots from hating on Muslims to whining that other holidays besides Christmas exist.
At least she s fun to mock.Featured image via screengrab
