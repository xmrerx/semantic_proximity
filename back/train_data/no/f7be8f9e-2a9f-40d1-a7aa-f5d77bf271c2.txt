mandalay bay security guard jesus campos mysteriously left the country just days after the las vegas massacre , a report says.customs and border patrol documents obtained by fox news show that the 25-year-old entered the united states from mexico at the san ysidro border crossing in california one week after the mass shooting.it s unclear how long campos was out of the country .
the documents only show that he re-entered the us.the young man reportedly crossed the border at the same location in january.while campos was driving his own vehicle with nevada plates during that trip , sources told fox he took a rental car this time around which was registered in california.the new information raises even more questions about stephen paddock s oct. 1 massacre such as why authorities would allow campos to leave the country in the middle of their investigation or how the security guard managed to make it down to mexico with a gunshot wound to his leg.but was campos really a security guard ?
according to nevada law , every security guard in the state of nevada has to register as an armed or unarmed guard with the state s private investigator s licensing board ( pilb ) .
this entity s records are publicly searchable at : nevadapilb.glsuite.us.there s no jesus campos licensed with the pilb .
here s a close up look at the nv pi licensing board : the document above was released by pol news infinity who has done some amazing investigative work on a number of cases .
