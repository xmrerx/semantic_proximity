VIENNA (Reuters) - The Austrian far-right Freedom Party (FPO) has agreed to rule out a referendum on Austria leaving the European Union as part of a coalition deal with conservatives led by Sebastian Kurz, FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache said on Saturday.
At a joint news conference with Kurz on details of their coalition deal, Strache said the two had agreed to expand direct democracy progressively.
Kurz also said Austria s stance on Russian sanctions would not change with the pro-Moscow FPO joining the government.
