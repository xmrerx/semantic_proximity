last saturday , a bunch of well-armed militiamen decided to protest the extended sentence of two oregon ranchers , dwight and steven hammond , who started fires on federal land near their property .
the federal law they broke has a minimum five-year sentence .
and according to rolling stone : the first federal judge to handle the case concluded that the mandatory sentence was too stiff and gave the pair far lighter sentences , which they served .
but the u.s. attorney in the case called foul ; the federal government took the rare step of appealing the sentence .
in october 2015 , the ninth circuit imposed the mandatory minimum , ruling that : given the seriousness of arson , a five-year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the offense .
the ranchers are due back in federal prison monday to serve out their five years each .
well , not wanting to stay out of the limelight for too long , ammon bundy , son of the infamous anti-government imbecile cliven bundy who stood his ground with no penalty against the bureau of land management ( blm ) not too long ago , decided he would involve himself in the fight against tyranny of government against these law-breaking ranchers .
bundy , and his band of merry morons , decided to take over the malheur wildlife refuge in burns , oregon .
he posted a video to facebook where he declared : we have basically taken over the malheur wildlife refuge .
and this will become a base place for patriots from all over the country to come and be housed here and to live here .
and we re planning on staying here for several years bring your arms .
maybe they don t need their legs ? well , needless to say , the government isn t being tyrannical , but rather following the laws as they are written .
these militiamen may not like the laws , but that s what elections are for you vote in the people who make the laws .
you don t hold armed protests , or rather hissy fits , in an empty wildlife refuge.nonetheless , in no particular order , here are the five stupidest things done by these make-believe patriots in oregon : if there s a protest by ultra-right-wing morons to be had somewhere , you know there are bound to be an abundance of signs that are misspelled .
and not disappointing us in the slightest , the bundy militia made sure to offer some doozies .
looks like maybe they could have used some of that tyranical goverment [ sic ] to help them get a better education.via littlegreenfootballs.comone of the patriots , jon ritzenheimer , even made a goodbye video for his family .
occupying a bird refuge is dangerous , and you never know when a bald eagle may come to knock some sense into them.after this pathetic request for snacks and supplies because this group of soldiers apparently forgot the boy scout motto be prepared // < !

ha !
let s not let this fact escape us .
these idiots took over federal property , and somehow are allowed to still stay there .
they are protesting the government by setting up camp on federal land .
the government can t be too tyrannical if they are allowed to stay as long as they have.now , one may have seen a lot of weird , strange , and/or pathetic things in their lifetime , but this may have to take the cake .
one of these patriots armed himself and took shelter under a blue tarp and was ready to fight at a moments notice .
and yes , this is as weird and stupid as it sounds , so leave it to twitter to take over the well-deserved mockery : is that a militiaman under your tarp or are you just happy to see me pic.twitter.com/vrkstngyyr kstreethipster ( @ kstreethipster ) january 6 , 2016this is happening on teevee nuz rn pic.twitter.com/pzdkbqc2ix steve king ( @ steveking_ ) january 6 , 2016you re only seeing 10 % of the # derp .

furthermore , insurrection is explicitly written against in the constitution.while we watch these idiots get away with treason for now , we can at least have entertainment from their utter stupidity.featured image : twitter
