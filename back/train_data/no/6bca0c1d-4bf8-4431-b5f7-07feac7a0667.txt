it s almost like a flip has switched .
political pundits , news sources and even businesses are starting to see that trump is a force to be reckoned with and he very likely could be america s next president donald trump may not be the president yet , but his constant criticism of ford outsourcing jobs to mexico has caused the auto tycoon to change course and bring the $ 2,000,000,000 plant back to the united states.ford is moving its facility , originally slated for mexico , back to the united states , where it will employ 1,000 factory workers in struggling youngstown , ohio.republican presidential candidate donald trump recently said that if he s elected he would take steps to make it more expensive for manufacturers to shift work to mexico and then export the items back to the united states .
how does that help us ?
trump said about the ford investment in mexico while campaigning in michigan this week .
mexico is becoming the new china .
ford has declined to comment , but many see this as a good sign , a welcome change after decades of outsourcing manufacturing plant overseas .
