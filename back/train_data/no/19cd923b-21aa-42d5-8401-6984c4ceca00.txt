being called out for his utter incompetence as a leader by the press is not something obama is used to cbs news s major garrett asked president obama at a press conference wednesday if he was content with four americans held in iranian jails while his administration celebrated the nuclear deal .
can you tell the country , sir , why you are content with all the fanfare around this deal to leave the conscious of this nation , the strength of this nation unaccounted for in relation to these four americans ?
garrett asked .
that s nonsense and you should know better , obama bit back .
nobody s content and our diplomats and our teams are working diligently to try to get them out .
garrett later brushed off the scolding on cbs s news streaming network , saying , clearly , it struck a nerve .
that was my intention was it provocative ?
yes .
was it intended to be as such ?
absolutely .
the daily beast s shane harris reported yesterday that the americans came up during negotiations over iran s nuclear program .
we believe very strongly that this is an opportunity for iran to let the americans come home , an administration official said.via : the daily beast
