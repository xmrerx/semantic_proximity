beijing ( reuters ) - china supports saudi arabia s efforts to safeguard national sovereignty and achieve greater development , president xi jinping told saudi arabia s king salman , at a time of regional tensions between saudi arabia , iran , lebanon and yemen .
china has traditionally played little role in middle east conflicts or diplomacy , despite its reliance on the region for oil .
but it has been trying to raise its profile , with salman visiting china in march .
speaking by telephone , xi told salman that china s determination to deepen strategic cooperation with saudi arabia will not waver , no matter how the international and regional situation changes , china s foreign ministry said late on thursday .
remarking on the importance of maintaining close communication between the two countries heads of state , xi said china and saudi arabia are comprehensive strategic partners whose strategic mutual trust is deepening .
china supports saudi arabia s efforts to safeguard national sovereignty and realize greater development , the ministry cited xi as saying , without elaborating .
the statement made no specific mention of issues like the resignation as lebanon prime minister saad al-hariri while in saudi arabia , railing against riyadh s bitter foe iran and its lebanese ally hezbollah .
saudi-led forces , which back the government in yemen , have also been targeting the iran-allied houthis in a more than two-year war there .
china has had to tread a fine line between riyadh and tehran as beijing has close ties with iran as well .
the ministry statement said xi and salman also exchanged views on international and regional issues of common concern , but gave no details .
