a battle for mankind is taking place inside a northern arizona university classroom .
an english major at nau contacted an educational watchdog this week after she was penalized for refusing to use a gender-neutral term in lieu of mankind .
a follow-up email by dr. anne scott said that anyone who does not abide by the letter or spirit of the class must be docked for their decision .
included with class rules were several examples of what was and wasn t ok to use , student cailin jefferstold campus reform tuesday .
in one of these examples she stated that we could not use the word mankind .
instead , we should use humankind .
i thought this was absurd , and i wasn t sure if she was serious .
dr. scott took one point out of 50 off ms. jeffers paper and noted that the modern language association is working to have gender-neutral guidelines adopted on a national level .
i will respect your choice to leave your diction choices as is and to make whatever political and linguistic statement you want to make by doing so , the professor wrote .
by the same token , i will still need to subtract a point because your choice will not be made in the letter or spirit of this particular class , which is all about having you and other students looking beneath your assumptions and understanding that mankind does not mean all people to all people .
it positively does not .
an email was sent to the entire class shortly afterward , which stated the crucial need to recognize that our word choices mean a great deal and have consequences in terms of what we reveal about our assumptions about ourselves and others , and the world generally .
