during trump s press conference today , jim acosta of cnn bombarded him with one question after another .
trump responded to his dishonest network by calling out the hatred and venom he constantly sees on cnn .
acosta pressed on and asked yet another question .
trump responded : we do have other people and your ratings aren t as good as the others .
trump told acosta , i think you would do much better by being different .
i m not ranting and raving .
i m just telling you your dishonest people .
i m changing it from fake news to very fake news . '
acosta asked trump if he is undermining news by calling it fake news ?
trump response was perfect , as he replied , i know what s good and i know what s bad , because i m there .
so it s very important to me .
i want to see an honest press .
it s very important to the public to get an honest press .
if you were straight and really told it like it was , i would be your biggest fan if you treated me right , including negative stories about me .
but when story after story about me is bad , i won !
you ve got to be a little bit fair .
but when you take a look at some of your stories , and the bias and the hatred .
the public is smart and they see it .
the whole russian thing it s a ruse
