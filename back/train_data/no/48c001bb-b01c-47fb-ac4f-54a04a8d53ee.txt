berlin ( reuters ) - german police on tuesday detained six syrians suspected of planning an attack using weapons or explosives on behalf of the islamic state militant group , prosecutors said .
police detained the suspects aged between 20 and 28 during raids in the cities of kassel , hanover , essen and leipzig , the general prosecutor s office in frankfurt said in a statement .
some 500 police officers took part in the raids during which eight apartments were searched .
four of the suspects arrived in germany in december 2014 and two arrived the following year .
all six had applied for asylum .
the prosecutor s office did not say if their asylum applications had been approved .
prosecutors said the six syrians are suspected of being members of the foreign terrorist organization that calls itself islamic state ( is ) .
they added : the accused are also suspected of having planned an attack against a public target in germany using either weapons or explosives .
it is the second time this month that syrians have been arrested on suspicion of planning militant violence .
earlier this month a 19-year-old syrian man was detained on suspicion of planning a bomb attack .
the arrest comes one month before the first anniversary of an attack in berlin by a failed tunisian asylum seeker who killed 12 people by plowing a truck into a christmas market .
concrete blocks have been installed around christmas markets at several central squares in the capital this year before the festive season opens in a couple of weeks .
