howard stern : you seem to be pretty conservative .
you kinda are.megyn : i m conservative on some things and not on others and i love that people just make these assumptions about you because you work at fox.howard : well no , i make it [ assumption ] because i hear the questions and the line of questions .
megyn : but that s my job.that s not all megyn seems to be very selective about who can and can t talk about a woman s weight and appearance .
it sure sounds like she has no problem talking to stern about her appearance and how important her good looks and physique are for her job .
in fact , it appears as though megyn actually finds his line of questioning quite amusing.she also spent a considerable amount of time talking about her sex life , her breasts and the size of her husband s penis .
nope nothing seems to offend megyn in this interview : https : //youtu.be/iml_ughxz2q
