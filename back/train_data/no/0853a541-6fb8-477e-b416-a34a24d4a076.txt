brussels ( reuters ) - a summit of euro zone leaders will go ahead as planned in the middle of december , the chairman of european union leaders said on wednesday , dispelling speculation it might be postponed because of the collapse of german coalition talks .
just to be clear : the december euro summit is on .
as part of the leaders agenda we need to discuss what , how and when to move forward on the emu ( european monetary union ) and the banking union , tusk said on twitter .
he said he discussed the agenda of the meeting over the phone on wednesday with the chairman of euro zone finance ministers jeroen dijsselbloem .
german government coalition talks collapsed on sunday night as the liberal fdp party pulled out after weeks of exploratory talks , plunging the euro zone s most important economy into political uncertainty and raising the prospect of new elections .
euro zone leaders are to set a direction for deeper euro zone economic integration at a summit in the middle of december , at which germany s input is crucial .
the summit is to launch six months of work that would lead decisions in june 2018 on whether or not the single currency area should have a budget , a finance minister and a separate euro zone assembly within the european parliament .
the deeper integration push , championed by french president emmanuel macron , also includes the transformation of the euro zone bailout fund into a european monetary fund and the creation of a sovereign insolvency mechanism .
