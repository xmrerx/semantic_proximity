london ( reuters ) - british foreign minister boris johnson will oppose any move to adopt european union regulations made after britain leaves the bloc in march 2019 , the sunday telegraph newspaper reported , risking reigniting divisions over brexit .
johnson , who campaigned to leave the eu in last year s referendum , is one of britain s highest-profile politicians and seen as a possible replacement for prime minister theresa may .
on friday , he praised a speech by may in which she set out her plan for a roughly two-year transition period after brexit .
but the telegraph reported that johnson had set out a new set of demands , reviving talk of a split among may s senior ministers which has the potential to destabilize her minority government .
boris will be one of those cabinet ministers pushing to make sure we don t have any new eu rules and regulations during the transition , a cabinet source was quoted as saying by the newspaper .
johnson had fueled talk of a leadership challenge ahead of may s speech by publishing his own 4,000-word plan for brexit which was seen as a criticism of may s more cautious approach .
may s transition plan , set out in the italian city of florence in a speech that sought to break an impasse in negotiations with the eu , underlined the importance of regulation to the future economic relationship with the bloc .
she highlighted the fact that britain and the eu start with identical regulatory standards and said she wanted a practical approach to regulation that enables us to continue to work together in bringing shared prosperity to our peoples .
she did not say whether she thought eu regulations passed during the transition period would be matched by britain but said , on eu law , that british courts would be able to take european courts of justice rulings into account .
may s brexit minister david davis said he did expect british and eu regulations to diverge over time after brexit .
