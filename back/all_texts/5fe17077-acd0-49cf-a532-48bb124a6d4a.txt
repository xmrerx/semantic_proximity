Speaking up against hate where it stands, yet again, is Senator Elizabeth Warren from the great state of Massachusetts.As Donald Trump was making his official announcement of his choice for Indiana Gov.
Mike Pence to be his vice presidential pick, Warren took to Twitter, as only she can, to tear the choice to shreds.Warren brilliantly stated, as she does, in an epic tweetstorm: Donald Trump and Mike Pence are a perfect match: Two small, insecure, weak men who use hate and fear to divide our country and our people.
Of COURSE Donald Trump a guy who calls women fat pigs & bimbos picked a VP who is famous for trying to control women s bodies.What s worse?
Donald Trump and Mike Pence s sexism isn t some radical fringe of the GOP.
They re in line with the party platform.
The GOP platform is the most anti-choice ever: defund Planned Parenthood and denounce all abortion.
Even cases of rape, incest and woman s potential death.And OF COURSE Donald Trump a guy who [doesn t] feel good about marriage equality picked a VP famous for LGBT discrimination.The GOP platform says overturn marriage equality & it supports parents putting their LGBT children through conversion therapy.
Disgusting.The GOP platform even says that children not from natural marriage are more likely to be drug addicts.
Hateful AND disgusting.Terrifying to thing of Mike Pence being a heartbeat from presidency but the direction [the GOP] wants to take our country is MORE terrifying.

Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) July 16, 2016Warren gets it, and hopefully most of America gets it, too.
Trump is bad for America, and with Trump s pick of Pence bad just went to worse.We need to make sure a Trump/Pence administration never happens for the sake of all things good and decent.Featured Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images
