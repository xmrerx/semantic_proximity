We love Ruth Bader Ginsburg.
She s the sweet but also sharp liberal justice who sits on the Supreme Court.
She s also no fan of Donald Trump.
One tradition that Ginsburg AKA The Notorious RBG has is wearing a special dissent collar when she is going against major rulings presented the land s highest court.
No such ruling was upon the justices today, but Ginsburg wore the collar anyway.
It seemed to be her way of showing the nation and world that she disapproves of a Donald Trump presidency.Now, this fact is no secret; after all, America s favorite SCOTUS justice came under fire during the heated presidential campaign for remarks she made about the bombastic then-GOP presidential nominee.
She said: He is a faker.
He has no consistency about him.
He says whatever comes into his head at the moment.
He really has an ego.
How has he gotten away with not turning over his tax returns?
The press seems to be very gentle with him on that.
Ginsburg then went on to lament the idea of what a Trump presidency will do to our American reality, saying: For the country, it could be four years.
For the court, it could be I don t even want to contemplate that.
Well, unfortunately, that is now our reality.
I have to wonder what is going through Justice Ginsburg s head right about now.
If her dissent collar is any indication, it s nothing good regarding President-elect Trump.Watch the video below:Featured image via Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images
