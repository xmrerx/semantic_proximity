Barber says after he asked a flight attended to ask the man to lower his voice, that s when the altercation started.
But as she left, I heard him saying distasteful and disparaging things about me, Barber said in the statement.
He had problems with those people and he spoke harshly about my need for two seats, among other subjects.
Barber says he purchased two seat because of a physical disability, the same ailment that caused him to stand up instead of simply turning his head to confront the passenger behind him.
I asked him why he was saying such things, and I said he did not know me, my condition, and I added I would pray for him, Barber said.The police were called and Barber was escorted off the plane.Via: Breitbart News
