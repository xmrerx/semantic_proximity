Wednesday was not a good day to be Donald Trump.
In the aftermath of the disastrous Comey hearing where it was confirmed that The Donald s team was indeed being investigated and of Rep. Nunes decision to skip informing his fellow congressional Russia investigators of perfectly legal incidental collection of information about Trump associates and possibly the President* himself and run to The Donald with it instead Trump has been flailing, attempting to distract from the whole Russia thing as much as possible.That s going to be very hard now, as U.S. officials have now confirmed that the facts suggest that members of his team were indeed working with the enemy.
CNN reports:The FBI has information that indicates associates of President Donald Trump communicated with suspected Russian operatives to possibly coordinate the release of information damaging to Hillary Clinton s campaign, US officials told CNN.
