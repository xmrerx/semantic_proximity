the shooter at the congressional baseball practice has been identified .
his name is james hodgkinson the 66-year old white male from illinois is a bernie sanders supporter .
his facebook and twitter accounts are full of anti-trump/pro-bernie sanders posts and pictures : update : president trump just announced that hodgkinson has died from his injuries .
his facebook page and twitter have been inundated with angry conservatives who are so sick of the vile and hateful rhetoric from the left .
he s a huge leftist who clearly hastes president trump calling him a traitor on facebook : this man clearly represents trump derangement syndrome the left is still so angry that trump was elected .
it s sick and twisted ! from the shooter s facebook page : we just reported last weekend on protests across the country that got violent and even saw antifa attacking a police horse with a weapon : a female antifa member was arrested after using a flag pole w/ a silver nail at the end to stab a police horse in the neck during a riot .
