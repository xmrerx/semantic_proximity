moscow ( reuters ) - president vladimir putin formally registered his re-election bid on wednesday , submitting the necessary documents to russia s central election commission in person ahead of a march 18 vote .
polls show that putin , who has dominated russia s political landscape for the last 17 years as either president or prime minister , is on course to comfortably win another six-year term .
that would allow him to rule until 2024 , when he ll turn 72 .
the former kgb officer is running as an independent , a move seen as a way of strengthening his image as a father of the nation rather than as a party political figure .
the ruling united russia party and the just russia party have both said they will support him .
allies laud putin for restoring national pride and expanding moscow s global clout with interventions in syria and ukraine .
but opposition leader alexei navalny , who has been barred from the election over a suspended prison sentence he says was fabricated , says putin has been in power too long and that his support is artificially maintained by a biased state media and an unfair system which excludes genuine opponents .
navalny has called for a boycott of the election , raising the prospect of large-scale protests and clashes with the police .
