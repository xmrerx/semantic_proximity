ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions was at the White House on Monday but did not meet with President Donald Trump, who referred to him in a tweet as “beleaguered” earlier in the day, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said.
Sanders reiterated that Trump was frustrated with Sessions for recusing himself from the Justice Department’s Russia investigation.
Sessions said last week he loved his job and planned to continue serving.
