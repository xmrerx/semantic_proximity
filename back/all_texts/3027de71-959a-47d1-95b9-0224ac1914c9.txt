This morning, Kellyanne Conway attempted to spin White House press secretary Sean Spicer s blatant lies about Trump s inauguration numbers into simply an alternate version of the truth.
This isn t the first time she s said something like this, and so it s getting more than a little ridiculous.
Fortunately, Chuck Todd nailed her to the wall for it, but he wasn t the only one.
Merriam-Webster decided to nail her for it too, with a short, concise tweet:?A fact is a piece of information presented as having objective reality.
https://t.co/gCKRZZm23c Merriam-Webster (@MerriamWebster) January 22, 2017Nothing like having the dictionary troll you when you try to redefine words in front of the whole damn world.Merriam-Webster didn t stop with just a single tweet, though.
That link goes to an entire article blasting Conway for pretending the word fact doesn t mean what we think it means.
In addition to the modern definition, which is their tweet, they gave three obsolete definitions which further puts Conway to shame: There are three obsolete senses of fact in English.
Two of these senses are no longer used:Fact meaning a wrong or unlawful deed is rare, but is still used in the phrase after the fact.
Merriam-Webster also reported, in that story, that lookups for the word fact spiked after Conway spewed her nonsense all over Chuck Todd.
Fact is their #2 lookup today, and feminism is their #3 lookup.
Their #1 lookup, though?
Fascism.
That s been one of their trending lookups for a few months now, which says something about how people on both sides view Trump.You know you ve screwed up big time with a word when you ve got the dictionary coming after you for it.Featured image by Yana Paskova via Getty Images
