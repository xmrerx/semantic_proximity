Right after Dwyane Wade s first cousin Nykea Aldridge was shot and killed in Chicago, Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump thought it was appropriate to bring the shooting back to himself and tweet out: Dwyane Wade s cousin was just shot and killed walking her baby in Chicago.
Just what I have been saying.
African-Americans will VOTE TRUMP!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 27, 2016To call the tweet in poor taste would be a severe understatement.Now, speaking up about his cousin s death and the reaction from Trump is none other than Wade himself in an interview with ABC s George Stephanopoulos.Wade said: I was grateful that it started a conversation but on the other hand, it just left a bad taste in my mouth because of what my family is dealing with and what our city of Chicago is dealing with and it looks like it s being used as political gain.
Which is exactly what Trump was trying to use it for.
Not out of empathy for the deceased and her family, but rather to try to bring it back to himself somehow.Right after the incident that took his cousin s life, Wade took to Twitter to say Enough is Enough in regards to these senseless acts of gun violence.My cousin was killed today in Chicago.
Another act of senseless gun violence.
4 kids lost their mom for NO REASON.
Unreal.
