cairo ( reuters ) - the former leader of egypt s muslim brotherhood islamist movement , mohamed akef , has died in a cairo hospital after an illness , the group s lawyer said on friday .
akef was supreme guide of the movement , as the leadership is known , until the end of 2009 .
he was among those detained in a crackdown after egypt s elected president mohamed mursi , also of the muslim brotherhood , was ousted by the military in 2013 .
akef s daughter announced his death on her facebook page .
the group s lawyer , abdel monem abdel maqsoud , told reuters he had received a call from the prison service to report akef s death in cairo s qasr el-eyni hospital .
president abdel fattah al-sisi has engaged in the toughest crackdown on islamists in egypt s modern history since toppling mursi when sisi was still head of the armed forces .
he was later elected president .
sisi presents himself as a bulwark against militant extremism as egypt battles an islamist insurgency in northern sinai .
but he has come under attack from rights groups , who say his time in power has seen the worst crackdown in their history .
