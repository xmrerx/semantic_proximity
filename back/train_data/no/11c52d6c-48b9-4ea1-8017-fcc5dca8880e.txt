judge napolitano explains what s going on as only he can do he does a great job !
the senate has a rule they can force the senate to raise the majority to 60 that s called a filibuster .
napolitano goes on the explain that the dems are furious because obama s pick for the court wasn t given his day .
they also obviously feel gorsuch is too conservative .
the hypocrisy of the democrats and chuck schumer is exposed when a video of past approval for gorsuch is shown .
schumer , blumenthal and nelson are voting no .
democrats who are up for reelection are voting yes.orrin hatch on democrats : they re politicizing this whole process .
this is a guy who is a mainstream conservative , which they hate .
they don t like that .
and of course , they are still upset about my other friend , merrick garland .
but the republicans had every right to delay that within a presidential election year .
i can t go back in time and show you any case where in a presidential election year they allowed a supreme court justice to be nominated unless both sides agreed .
and both sides didn t agree .
