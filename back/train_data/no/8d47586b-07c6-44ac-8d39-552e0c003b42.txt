canadians are not pleased after white house mouthpiece sean spicer refused to rule out sarah palin as donald trump s choice as ambassador to canada.during yet another disastrous press briefing , spicer suggested to reporters that trump is considering america s village idiot as the united states ambassador to canada .
we have no additional ambassador nominations or announcements to make on that front , spicer said when asked about palin s name being floated for the position .
i m sure at some point we will have soon .
he didn t say that palin would be chosen , but he didn t deny that she was being considered either .
the thought that sarah palin could end up being sent to canada horrified many canadians , who proceeded to mock trump and palin.sarah palin as ambassador ?
well that would show how little steve bannon and his pal @ realdonaldtrump think of canada https : //t.co/js4b2qseah charlie angus ndp ( @ charlieangusndp ) february 8 , 2017this is entirely because sarah palin can see canada from alaska , isn t it ?

@ charlieangusndp @ realdonaldtrump eminently unqualified .
there is no place in alaska where she could see both russia and canada .

alison smiley ( @ gwynskid ) february 8 , 2017appointing sarah palin as the us ambassador to canada is , like , ultimate trolling .

( @ brittca ) february 9 , 2017sarah palin is being considered for job as ambassador to canada .
she s presently on a flight to europe to meet with us .
# sarahpalin rob willcott ( @ advantagephysio ) february 9 , 2017seriously , sarah palin is not ambassador material .
she would be a constant embarrassment to both the united states and canada .
trump has already made us a laughing stock .
the last thing we need is for sarah palin to make things worse .
and she already is by merely being mentioned for the job.if trump is going to send palin to another country he should send her to one far , far away so we don t have to hear from her for a long time .
at least he could then say he did one good thing for the nation.read more : featured image via screenshot
