Well, the moment we have all been anticipating has come to pass.
Donald Trump and the bigots in his administration have rolled out a new Muslim Ban.
There are very few differences.
It excludes Iraq, thanks to their vital role in helping the United States government in the fight against the Islamic State.
It also will not be rolled out immediately, so that we won t have people being detained mid-travel.
It also excludes Green Card holders and those with legal visas prior to January 27, 2017 the date of the original order that was struck down by the courts.
there is also language striking down the first order.
However, make no mistake this is still a Muslim ban.
The intent is the same, and there is one person who wants to make sure that everyone knows it: New Jersey Senator Cory Booker.Just moments after the news broke that Trump had signed the new order behind closed doors, Senator Booker took to Twitter to go all in on Trump and what he and his goons are doing.
This truly an extraordinary rebuke of a sitting Senator of a sitting President.
Here are is the flurry of tweets sent out by a clearly furious Booker:A rebranded #MuslimBan is still a Muslim ban.Plain and simple.
Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017It s clear that the Trump administration s intent with this executive order is the same as it was with the first.
Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017They are trying to exclude refugees and immigrants of a certain religion from entering the United States.
Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017The previous Muslim ban was rejected by millions of Americans and blocked by the federal courts.
Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017This reckless and un-American executive order once again blatantly defies our nation s highest ideals and makes our country less safe.
Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017I will fight every step of the way, this renewed attempt to play the worst kind of politics at the expense of our most cherished values.
Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017As history has shown us, so will the American people.
Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017See you in court (again), @realDonaldTrump Sen. Cory Booker (@SenBookerOffice) March 6, 2017Indeed, we will see Trump in court.
Just as the first order was rejected, so should the second order.
There s really no difference at all, and the claims by Trump and his administration are doing this because of national security concerns have been shown to be baseless by Trump s own Department of Homeland Security.This is the most fundamentally un-American action Trump has taken yet, and considering the things he has done, that s saying something.
Senator Booker is right we ll see him in court.Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
