The worst part about the GOP controlling all three branches of the federal government is that they are about to hand the Supreme Court over to fascists and right-wing ideologues like themselves for a generation.
However, there is one way to stop them if only Senate Democrats have the cajones to do it.
On January 3, for just a few precious moments, the Democrats will control the Senate prior to the newly elected Republican Senators being sworn in.
During that time, according to Senatorial procedure expert David Waldman, Vice President Joe Biden could have the Senate come to order for a vote on Merrick Garland, the Obama nominee that the Senate Republicans have refused to give a hearing and a vote to.
Here are Waldman s tweets explaining the whole thing:Send Biden to the Senate on Jan. 3 w Garland's renomination & instructions to recognize Durbin before swearing in.

David Waldman (@KagroX) November 22, 2016@CatrionaMDW On 1/3, before new Sens.
are sworn, 67 seated Sens.
& Biden are in the chamber.
Biden turns to Durbin instead of McConnell.
Go.
David Waldman (@KagroX) November 22, 2016@CatrionaMDW Schumer's not involved.
He's among the Sens.
who wouldn't be sworn at the time.
And no, pro forma sessions predate them all.
David Waldman (@KagroX) November 22, 2016Now, will Democrats actually do this?
Hopefully so.
It might take all of us calling important Senators like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders to make it happen, but this is our only shot to save the Court.
Garland s confirmation would stack it 5-4 in our favor here.
The GOP has declared war on us, and it s time for the gloves to come off.
We MUST put pressure on Democrats to make this happen.
It s our only hope for a generation.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
