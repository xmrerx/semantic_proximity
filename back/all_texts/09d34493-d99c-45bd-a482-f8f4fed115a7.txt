A group of thugs marched through the main train station in Stockholm, Sweden and beat up refugee children and anyone who didn t appear to be ethnically Swedish.
It is a shocking moment of anti-migrant violence as Europe deals with the fallout from the Syrian civil war.Wearing all-black balaclavas and armbands, the men gathered with the purpose of attacking refugee children, Stockholm police spokesperson Towe Hagg said.
I saw maybe three people who were beaten.
That was no football brawl or something similar.
They targeted migrants.
I was quite scared and ran away, an eyewitness told the Aftonbladet newspaper.Before the attacks, the mob handed out leaflets with the slogan It is enough now!
which threatened to give the North African street children who are roaming around the punishment they deserve .The rhetoric of the attackers sounds unsettling like what we have been hearing every night at Donald Trump s presidential rallies.
He launched his campaign with an explicitly white power message, blaming Mexicans for being rapists, then arguing in favor of a national registry of Muslims and banning them from traveling to the United States.Trump s rhetoric has already led to violence here.
One group of Massachusetts men beat up a Latino man while citing Trump, while at his rallies Trump has egged on his supporters who have attacked and mistreated black protesters.The rise of the nationalist right in Europe has used mass migration as its excuse of the moment, blaming economic hardships and slowdowns on migrants with different colored skin and ethnic and religious backgrounds has been a trope of the extremist right for ages.The Republican Party and the mainstream press have both been afraid to call out Trump and his backers for their blatant hate, and while it seems unspeakable, we re not that different from the people in Europe.
