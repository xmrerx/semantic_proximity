brussels ( reuters ) - britain and the european union have agreed on the three key divorce issues of a financial settlement , citizens rights and how to avoid a hard border between ireland and northern ireland after britain leaves the eu , a joint report said .
the report did not specify a sum that britain would owe the eu as a result of its exit from the bloc in 2019 , but said : both parties have agreed a methodology for the financial settlement .
on northern ireland , the report said that unless otherwise agreed , britain would keep laws in northern ireland aligned with those of the european union s internal market and customs union to avoid the need for a border .
in the absence of agreed solutions , the united kingdom will maintain full alignment with those rules of the internal market and the customs union which , now or in the future , support north-south cooperation , the all island economy and the protection of the 1998 agreement , the report said .
