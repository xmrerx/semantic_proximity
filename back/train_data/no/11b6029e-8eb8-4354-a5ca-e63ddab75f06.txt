washington ( reuters ) - the white house is vetting federal appellate judges merrick garland and sri srinivasan as possible nominees to the supreme court to replace late justice antonin scalia , the new york times reported on friday .
the fbi has been conducting background checks on garland and srinivasan , the times said , citing a person with knowledge of the process .
scalia , a long-serving conservative justice , died on feb. 13 .
srinivasan , 49 , has served on the u.s. court of appeals since he was confirmed on a 97-0 bipartisan vote in the u.s. senate in may 2013 .
as a senior justice department lawyer in 2013 , he was part of the legal team that successfully urged the high court to strike down the defense of marriage act , a law that restricted the definition of marriage to heterosexual couples for the purposes of federal benefits .
garland , 63 , was appointed to the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit in 1997 and became the chief judge in 2013 .
the white house did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
republicans say the decision on who to nominate to the supreme court should be left to the next president , who will be elected on nov. 8 .
under the u.s. constitution , the president nominates supreme court justices and the senate must confirm them .
earlier this week , the times said that federal appellate judge jane kelly was being vetted .
last month the national law journal reported that ketanji brown jackson , a federal trial judge in washington , was also being considered .
without scalia , the court has four conservative and four liberal justices , meaning any potential obama nominee could tip the court to the left for the first time in decades .
nevada governor brian sandoval , a moderate republican , took himself out of consideration for appointment to the supreme court recently .
