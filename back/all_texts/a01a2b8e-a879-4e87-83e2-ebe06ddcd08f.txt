Another day, another foreign hack into America s electoral system.
This time, the hackers aren t targeting the Democratic Party specifically, but rather the state elections systems in an attempt to disrupt the General Election in November.According to the FBI, intelligence officials have sent out warnings, titled Targeting Activity Against State Board of Election Systems to state officials, claiming that cyber intrusions at the hands of (allegedly) Russian state-sponsored hackers have penetrated the election systems, with independent reports concluding that among the states affected were Arizona and Illinois.
The FBI told NEED TO KNOW state officials that they have obtained evidence of exfiltration, which is the theft of voter registration data, among other offenses:In the Illinois case, officials were forced to shut down the state s voter registration system for 10 days in late July, after the hackers managed to download personal data on up to 200,000 state voters, Ken Menzel, the general counsel of the Illinois Board of Elections, said in an interview.
The Arizona attack was more limited, involving malicious software that was introduced into its voter registration system but no successful exfiltration of data, a state official said.The FBI bulletin posted is requesting that states contact their Board of Elections and determine if any similar activity to their logs, both inbound and outbound, has been detected.
The FBI was able to determine that the hacks were foreign based on eight separate IP addresses that were linked to the sources of the hack, with two of them coming from Russian-backed hackers flagged in the past.Although not coming to any conclusions as of yet, Ken Menzel, the general counsel of the Illinois Board of Election, said the FBI, while certain it was foreign, are still trying to find a possible link between this and the Russian-based group found to have breached the DNC.How interesting that these possible breaches are coming once again from the Russians, after the links between their cozy relationship with the Trump campaign (and Trump asking for hacks) have been exposed.
Considering Trump feels the election will be rigged against him should Clinton win, it would come as no surprise if these hacks had something to do with making sure Trump has a comfortable win.Trump, are you sure hackings are the way to go this election?
