Midtown BBQ & Brew owner Tony Harrison was on Fox and Friends to explain that he saw video of a police line being breached and realized that [authorities] weren t going to be able to help us.
That s when he decided he would stand watch outside of his business instead.Harrison said that he left his restaurant at one point.
When he came back, a window was broken.
He said he waited inside in the dark to protect his restaurant, but nothing further happened.Harrison said he s disappointed in the way leaders have responded to the rioting which began in the wake of Freddie Gray s death.
They utterly failed, they failed the businesses, they failed the communities, they failed their own police officers, Harrison said.
