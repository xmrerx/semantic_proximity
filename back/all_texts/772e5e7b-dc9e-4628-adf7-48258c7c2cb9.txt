Does anyone else out there see a future BMW car commercial with this story?
You really can t make this up!
it s what we ve come to with the entitled people who think they can buy a BMW with their EBT card.
Unreal!
Actually, you can buy almost anything else with your EBT card which is soooo wrong and not what this entitlement was intended for.
It s come to this though:A Florida man has been arrested after allegedly stealing a $60,000 BMW a day after a car dealership turned him down from buying it with food stamps.Nicholas Jackson went to an auto dealership where managers declined his business when he tried to buy the BMW with a credit card and his Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card, authorities said.On Thursday night, the Pompano Beach dealership was burglarized and the BMW was missing along with keys belonging to 60 other cars, according to the Martin County Sheriff s Office.Authorities said 36-year-old Jackson did not have money to fill the tank of the stolen BMW and subsequently ran out of gas at an intersection.When officers responded to a suspicious person call on Friday morning, they found Jackson, the BMW and the stolen keys, according to the sheriff s office.Via: Daily Mail
