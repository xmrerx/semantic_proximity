We d like to offer a special word of thanks to Pamela Gellar for shining the light on the truth about Americans who are being bullied into submission by muslim terrorists.https://youtu.be/D2mcRb_WXhYThis skit points out the ridiculousness of the argument by the left that we need to draw the free speech line at criticizing Islam.
It s okay to criticize Christianity or Judaism.
There s no need to fear criticizing other faiths, but criticize Islam and threats made against your life are apparently justified.
Funny we don t remember seeing anything in the First Amendment that exempts American citizens from criticizing Muhammed or the Islam faith
