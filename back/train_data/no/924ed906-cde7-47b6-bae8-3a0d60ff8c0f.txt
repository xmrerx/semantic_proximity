but obama s federal wildlife officers had different plans for journalists , who attempted to expose the danger obama s radical open-border policies pose to america s national security federal wildlife officers ?
infowars reporters were detained and disarmed by federal agents wednesday while reporting near the texas-mexico border .
following the encounter , infowars joe biggs explained how he and michael zimmermann were disarmed after the pair were taken into custody alongside fellow reporter alejandra .
we just got out of federal custody we ve been there for 2 hours , biggs said.despite previously getting approval from both border patrol and law enforcement to be in the area , federal wildlife officers known to be obama s attack dogs on the border ordered the crew to put their hands up after encountering them filming a report.after being questioned for hours , biggs and zimmermann were told by federal officers that they would need to pay $ 230 each in order to receive their firearms back .
the trio were also charged with misdemeanor criminal trespassing and threatened with felony charges if they returned to the area.despite being told that the area was off-limits to the public , investigation into the location reveals the exact opposite to be true.only hours earlier an entirely separate law enforcement group told the reporters that they would have to leave a different part of the border as well .
