mexico city ( reuters ) - former mexico finance minister jose antonio meade , who resigned to seek the presidential nomination of the ruling party , is lagging far behind in public support ahead of next year s election , according to a newspaper poll published on wednesday .
meade , who is widely expected to receive the nomination of the centrist institutional revolutionary party ( pri ) , came in third in two scenarios polled by mexican newspaper el universal , while leftist andres manuel lopez obrador maintained a strong lead in both instances .
the survey found that 31 percent of respondents would vote for lopez obrador , who leads the national regeneration movement ( morena ) party , followed by the conservative national action party s ( pan ) ricardo anaya , leading a coalition of parties , with 23 percent .
meade came in third with 16 percent .
when mexico city mayor miguel angel mancera was entered into the mix for the coalition , obrador had 32 percent support , followed by mancera with 22 percent and meade with 15 percent .
the poll was conducted from dec. 1 to dec. 4 , after meade resigned to seek the presidency .
meade , who has served in both pri and pan administrations , has a reputation for honesty that pri officials hope will help the party recover from a spate of corruption scandals .
but he remains unknown to much of the mexican public .
a victory for the combative and nationalist-leaning lopez obrador , who promises to revive economic growth by battling graft , could stoke tensions with the trump administration just as the united states , mexico and canada seek to seal a renegotiation of the north american free trade agreement .
support for morena and the pan slipped 1 percentage point from the previous poll in november , while support for the pri held steady at 16 percent , according to el universal .
the survey by pollster buendia & laredo included 744 face-to-face interviews and has a +/- 4.1 percent margin of error .
