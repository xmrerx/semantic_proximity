minsk ( reuters ) - there is a substantial difference between how germany and france envisage the possible deployment of u.n. peacekeepers in eastern ukraine and russia s position , german foreign minister sigmar gabriel told journalists on friday .
both kiev and moscow have proposed u.n. peacekeepers be deployed to help resolve ukraine s pro-russian separatist conflict but the sides disagree on whether the troops should be positioned on the rebel-controlled part of the ukraine-russia border .
germany , france , russia and ukraine have previously held talks in an effort to end the fighting that has killed more than 10,000 people despite a notional ceasefire .
germany and france s idea and russia s idea on how a blue helmets ( peacekeeping ) mission would be shaped are still very far apart , gabriel said during an official visit to belarus .
nevertheless gabriel said the deployment would represent a real chance for peace in the war-torn donbass region .
although our ideas are still far apart , it would be inadvisable to close this window of opportunity , he said .
