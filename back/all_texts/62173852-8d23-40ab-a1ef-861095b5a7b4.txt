Since CNN reported that Trump and Obama had been presented with an addendum to their report on Russian hacking that detailed a number of harmful allegations against Trump as well as evidence that his team may have been directly colluding with the Russian government during the campaign and Buzzfeed showed a higher degree of journalistic integrity by dumping the full documents so the American people rather than withhold information Donald Trump has been on the warpath, seeking to destroy the media he blames for the release of documents that would not exist if he didn t do unethical, crazy, and gross stuff constantly.After finally admitting on Wednesday that it was Russia who hacked his political opponents (and promising that Vladdy Poot-Poot won t be doing that anymore now that he has helped install Trump in the Oval Office), Trump once again took aim at the L genpresse lying press who had the audacity to report on Russia s attack on our country.
After throwing an epic RUSSIA SAID, allcaps tantrum Wednesday morning, Trump continued his assault on the media at his press conference later that night.
Not you.
Your organization is terrible, Trump told CNN senior White House correspondent Jim Acosta.
I m not going to give you a question.
You are fake news.
Even after CNN attempted to kiss and make nice-nice with Trump by attacking Buzzfeed for doing nothing more than releasing the full memos, Trump continued his assault on Twitter Thursday.
@CNN is in a total meltdown with their FAKE NEWS because their ratings are tanking since election and their credibility will soon be gone!
Trump tweeted, apparently forgetting about the fact that he led the Obama birther movement for years, accused Ted Cruz s father of helping assassinate JFK, promoted an anti-vaccine agenda, and that he is besties with Alex Jones, a guy who thinks the Sandy Hook massacre didn t really happen and shapeshifting lizard-people are real..@CNN is in a total meltdown with their FAKE NEWS because their ratings are tanking since election and their credibility will soon be gone!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 12, 2017While The Donald might be willing to overlook his own past with regard to actual fake news rather than whatever conservatives decide they don t want to hear and call fake, the internet doesn t forget.
Ever.
Trump s timeline lit up with people reminding him that he s a f*cking idiot when it comes to determining fact from fiction:@realDonaldTrump @CNN Obama still from Kenya?

@realDonaldTrump @CNN as Anderson Cooper proved while shredding @KellyannePolls last night, nothing they said was untrue.
Stop lying.

@realDonaldTrump Oh my.
I hoped a good night's sleep would help, but you need to stop this CNN fixation.
People are laughing at you, angel.
Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 12, 2017@realDonaldTrump Your claim that #CNN reports fake news is fake news.
Jeffrey Guterman (@JeffreyGuterman) January 12, 2017@realDonaldTrump @CNN Glad you are using your power to destroy the free press.

@realDonaldTrump I have not seen such an exquisite tantrum since the time I told my 2 year old he couldn't eat the cat's food Allison Robicelli (@robicellis) January 12, 2017@realDonaldTrump @CNN A very clear illustration of YOUR "fake news" versus reality.

Michael Beveridge (@mickyb273) January 12, 2017@realDonaldTrump is the @BBC also a "fake news" organization?
https://t.co/0Ued2rAafH Ron Pragides (@mrp) January 12, 2017The BBC reports that the memo referenced by CNN and revealed by Buzzfeed isn t the only one in existence.
In fact, they reported Wednesday that a second source has come forward:FLASH BBC reports there is more compromising material on Donald Trump.
Source: CIA.
Great report by Paul Wood / @BBCOS.
Text attached pic.twitter.com/sBTSURyMeD Hans de Vreij (@hdevreij) January 11, 2017 I saw the report, compiled by the former British intelligence officer, back in October, BBC correspondent Paul Wood said.
He is not, and this is the crucial thing, the only source for this, noting that at least one Eastern European intelligence service is aware that the Russians had kompromat or compromising material on Mr. Trump.
It s very, very difficult, of course, to talk to US intelligence people.
They re breaking the law if they talk to you, Wood added.
But I did ask somebody with connections in the CIA to pass a message to them, and I got a message back that there was allegedly more than one tape, not just video, but audio as well, on more than one date, in more than one place, in both Moscow and St. Petersburg.
St. Petersberg is Russia s leader in child sex tourism, which makes it exactly the sort of place Trump would not want incriminating evidence to surface when it s considered that he has been accused of raping multiple children in the past.Listen to Wood talk about the allegations below:Featured image via Getty Images (Andrew Renneisen)/screengrab
