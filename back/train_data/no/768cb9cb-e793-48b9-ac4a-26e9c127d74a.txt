tokyo ( reuters ) - the u.s. navy carrier , the uss ronald reagan , conducted three days of drills with a japanese destroyer and two indian warships in the sea of japan , japan s navy said on tuesday .
the exercise involving five ships , which ended monday , came amid heightened tension in the region over north korea s ballistic missile and nuclear tests and as u.s. president donald trump began a 12-day tour of asia beginning in japan on sunday .
the exercise helped improve fighting skills and deepened cooperation with india , japan s maritime self defence force said in a press release .
the 100,000-ton reagan , which is based in japan carries around 70 combat aircraft and is the u.s. navy s most powerful warship in asia .
the reagan will join two other carriers in the western pacific , the uss nimitz and uss theodore roosevelt , in a potent reminder to pyongyang of the u.s. ability to rapidly mobilize military force , u.s. officials told reuters earlier .
