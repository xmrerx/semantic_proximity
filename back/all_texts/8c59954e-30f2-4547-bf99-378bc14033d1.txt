One of the more popular segments on Jimmy Kimmel Live is Celebrities Read Mean Tweets.
Sometimes Kimmel runs special editions, like sports editions, film editions, creator editions, and more.
Last night, Kimmel had President Obama on his show to read mean tweets the second time that Obama has done that.
Most of the tweets are pretty standard, vanilla hate, right up until the end, when he gets to a tweet from none other than one Donald J. Trump.Trump takes potshots at Obama all the time on Twitter that s nothing new.
His Twitter feed is a cesspool of self-congratulations, pseudo-gratitude for his loyal subjects, and insults at everyone who bothers him.
The tweet that Obama read said: President Obama will go down as perhaps the worst president in the history of the United States!
It was Obama, though, who got the last laugh on that one with a truth that the Donald will never acknowledge: Really?
Well, @realDonaldTrump, at least I will go down as a president.
Bam!
Right in Trump s bright orange face!
That s one thing that Obama will always have that Trump is less and less likely to ever get.
