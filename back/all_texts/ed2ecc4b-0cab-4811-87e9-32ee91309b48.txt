On Sunday s edition of Meet The Press, Senator Harry Reid blasted Mitch McConnell for his continued lack of leadership and warned of a revolt by Republican senators who understand how the Constitution works.Just minutes after President Obama announced his nominee, Judge Merrick Garland, for the Supreme Court last week, McConnell vowed to continue his obstructionism.
While speaking to Chuck Todd, Senator Reid said that he cannot understand what the hell the GOP Senate leader is thinking: I don t know why McConnell has done this to his senators.
He s marching these men, women over a cliff.
The Democrat went on to say that he doesn t believe some of the right s senators are going to ignore their constitutional duty like McConnell wants them to: I don t think they re going to go .Mitch McConnell has said a lot of things.
But his Republican senators are not going to go over that cliff with him.
They re not going to do it.
Reid is right, not all of the Republicans in the Senate are complete imbeciles, they know that McConnell is giving them bad advice.
As a matter of fact, his obstructionism started falling apart in just a few hours after Obama announced Garland as his pick.In spite of the fact that his senators are not falling in line like he expected them to, McConnell again said that he would never allow Obama s nominee to be appointed, during an interview with CNN on Sunday: Who ought to make this lifetime appointment?
It s the next president, not this one.
Mitch McConnell is still very confused about how elections work.
When we elected President Obama for eight years, not seven.
His continued insistence that he knows what the American people want is going to destroy his party further.
They already have Trump pissing off the people of this country, he probably shouldn t be adding to our anger.
Just sayin .
