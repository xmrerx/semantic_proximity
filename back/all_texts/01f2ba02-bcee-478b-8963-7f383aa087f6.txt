The president says he doesn t think Obamacare is going anywhere just yet.
In an interview on ABC s This Week, Obama said he doesn t think the Affordable Care Act will be fully repealed quite like Republicans hope and millions of Americans fear.President Obama said that although there is definitely the risk of a full repeal, he simply doesn t think the GOP can come up with a viable replacement plan.
After all, he explained with amusement, they have been trying to do so for seven full years and have always failed.
But when asked directly if he thought his signature health care legislation would survive, the president said he had faith that the ACA would endure.
I think it will, he said.
It may be called something else.
And as I said, I don t mind.
If in fact the Republicans make some modifications, Obama continued.
Some of which I may have been seeking previously, but they wouldn t cooperate because they didn t want to make the system work, and re-label it as Trumpcare, I m fine with that.
Obama said he isn t worried about having his name attached to the ACA, he is worried about the millions of Americans who depend on the legislation for their medical care.
He noted all the letters he gets from real people whose lives have literally been saved because of Obamacare and said that this is what matters to him.
This is his legacy, he insisted, not having his name stamped on it.Republicans are still bound and determined to repeal Obamacare and replace it with something better.
However, as Obama points out, this isn t necessarily what the American people want.
He notes that many Trump voters have said they never really believed that Donald Trump would take away their health care.
Obama is hopeful that the will of the American people can keep the ACA around for a long time to come, even if it is called Trumpcare.Watch what President Obama had to say about Obamacare today, here:[ad3media campaign= 1414 ]Featured image via Ron Sachs-Pool/Getty Images
