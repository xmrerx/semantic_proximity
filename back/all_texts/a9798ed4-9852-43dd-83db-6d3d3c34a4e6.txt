MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Wednesday after holding talks with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that some progress had been made on Syria and that a working group would be set up to examine the poor state of U.S.-Russia ties.
Lavrov, addressing a news conference, said President Vladimir Putin had said Moscow was ready to restore an air safety agreement covering Syria which it had suspended after last weekâ€™s U.S. missile strikes on Syria.
Moscow and Washington had also agreed to continue cooperating to try to find a political solution for Syria, he said.
