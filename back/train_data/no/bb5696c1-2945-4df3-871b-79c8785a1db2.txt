rio de janeiro ( reuters ) - a court in brazil decided on monday to resume criminal proceedings , including consideration of murder charges , related to the 2015 samarco mine disaster , throwing out a challenge from two defendants claiming that evidence was illegally collected .
vale sa and bhp billiton ltd , joint owners of the samarco iron mine , are part of a group that includes 22 people and two other companies that stand accused of crimes related to a tailing dam that burst .
the burst unleashed a torrent of toxic mud that killed 19 people .
the court in the state of minas gerais suspended proceedings in july to consider claims from two samarco executives who alleged that phone data , instant messages and emails were illegally collected outside of the period legally authorized .
the judge ruled certain material based on transcripts of corporate emails and chats to be invalid but that it did not impact the validity of telephone surveillance and other evidence , federal prosecutors said in a statement .
