london ( reuters ) - britain will meet its financial obligations when it leaves the european union , transport minister chris grayling said on friday , hours before prime minister theresa may makes a high-stakes speech to reset brexit talks .
may , weakened after losing her conservative party s majority in a june election , is hoping to move talks forward with the eu in a speech in florence , italy , on friday .
according to grayling , the speech will set out the principles of a future relationship .
it s not about the specific purpose of where we might end up at that point in the negotiations ... what she is doing is setting out today the principles of a future relationship , she is talking about how we move the negotiations forward , grayling told bbc radio .
asked whether reports that britain will offer a financial settlement to the eu are correct , grayling said : we are a nation that meets its obligations .
of course we absolutely accept that britain has obligations ... but what we are looking to do though , is not simply today to start talking about the nuts and bolts of negotiation .
