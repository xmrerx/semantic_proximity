BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping said on Wednesday China has firmly opposed and prevented Taiwan s independence over the past five years.
Xi made the comments in a speech at the beginning of a Communist Party congress.
China considers self-ruled Taiwan to be a wayward province, to be brought under Beijing s control by force if necessary.
