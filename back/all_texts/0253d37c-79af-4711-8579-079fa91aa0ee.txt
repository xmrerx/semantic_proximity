Ben Affleck posted a statement expressing his sadness and anger over billionaire producer and Hollywood kingpin, Harvey Weinstein.
Actress Rose McGowan immediately went after Affleck on Twitter, claiming he knew all about Harvey Weinstein s antics, despite his statement of fake outrage and disgust.Affleck s Facebook statement about his recent discovery about Weinstein charges read: I am saddened and angry that a man who I worked with used his position of power to intimidate, sexually harass and manipulate many women over decades, Affleck said in a statement about Weinstein Tuesday.
The additional allegations of assault that I read this morning made me sick.
Rose McGowan wasted no time calling Ben Affleck out on Twitter, even going so far as to call him a liar:You want to play let's play #ROSEARMY pic.twitter.com/uqd26Z78gc rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) October 10, 2017Rose then went on to call all of the Hollywood A-list Golden Boys, LIARS and warned them, We have just begun.
It almost feels like this fierce little Rose , who s using the hashtag #RoseArmy, might be getting ready to rip the mask off some of the sanctimonious and phony male celebrities who ve been mocking Trump over a ridiculous taped private conversation with another male for almost a year now, while hiding the sins of serial sexual predators like Harvey Weinstein.All of you Hollywood A-list golden boys are LIARS.
We have just begun.
