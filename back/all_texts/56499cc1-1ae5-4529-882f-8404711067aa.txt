Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn (R-TX) thought it would be a good idea to attack Special Counsel Robert Mueller over the Russia probe.
As Mueller s noose tightens, Republicans are losing their sh-t and attacking Mueller and the FBI in order to protect probably the most corrupt president ever.Former Attorney General Eric Holder tweeted on Friday, Speaking on behalf of the vast majority of the American people, Republicans in Congress be forewarned: any attempt to remove Bob Mueller will not be tolerated.
Cornyn retweeted Holder to say, You don t. You don t https://t.co/7lHYkIloyz Senator JohnCornyn (@JohnCornyn) December 16, 2017Bloomberg s Steven Dennis tweeted on Saturday that [Cornyn] s beef is with Holder, not Mueller, but Cornyn responded to say, But Mueller needs to clean house of partisans.
