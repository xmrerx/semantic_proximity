moscow ( reuters ) - russia and saudi arabia have signed a roadmap for cooperation in the atomic energy sector , russian state nuclear company rosatom said on thursday .
the roadmap comprises a number of steps needed to implement a cooperation program that was signed by the two nations during saudi king salman s visit to russia in october .
saudi arabia , which wants to reduce oil consumption at home , is considering building 17.6 gigawatts of nuclear-powered electricity generating capacity by 2032 and has sent a request for information to international suppliers to build two reactors in the kingdom .
last month rosatom said it hoped to win the saudi tender .
