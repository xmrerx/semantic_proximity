former nsa officer john schindler reports on a devastating fact not mentioned in the fbi s investigation of hillary clinton conducting state department business on an unsecure homebrew email server : sidney blumenthal s email read exactly like classified nsa reporting , as anybody acquainted with our sigint would immediately recognize .
as one veteran agency official told me back in january , blumenthal s email was nsa information with at least 90 percent confidence .
which was no coincidence , since an nsa investigation subsequently determined that blumenthal s sudan assessment was derived from their reporting in some cases verbatim .
as i reported in march , nsa concluded that blumenthal s sudan report came from four different agency sigint reports , all classified top secret/sci .
then it got worse : at least one of those reports was issued under the gamma compartment , which is an nsa handling caveat that is applied to extraordinarily sensitive information ( for instance , decrypted conversations between top foreign leadership , as this was ) .
gamma is properly viewed as a sigint special access program , or sap , several of which clinton compromised in another series of her unclassified emails.nsa had no doubt that blumenthal somehow got his hands on some of their crown jewels information .
it s word-for-word , verbatim copying , an agency official of them explained .
in one case , an entire paragraph was lifted from an nsa report that was classified top secret/sci .
to add to the mystery , sid emailed hillary his personal assessment on sudan only hours after some of those classified nsa reports were issued.somehow sid blumenthal who in 2011 was not working for the u.s. government in any capacity and had not held security clearances in a decade was reading above-top-secret nsa reports just hours after they appeared in tightly restricted gamma channels.read more : observer
