brasilia ( reuters ) - the speaker of brazil s lower house of congress , rodrigo maia , said on monday that two new charges against president michel temer in a corruption case should be considered together when they reach the floor of the chamber on tuesday .
brazil s congress has the authority to decide whether the president should stand trial at the supreme court on charges of obstruction of justice and racketeering .
separation of the charges would dash temer s hopes of his allies quickly rejecting the accusations and returning to his reform agenda .
