MADRID (Reuters) - The Spanish Constitutional Court has suspended a referendum law that was approved on Wednesday by the Catalan parliament, blocking the way for an Oct. 1 ballot on independence from Spain, a court source said on Thursday.
The law will be suspended while judges consider arguments that the vote breaches the country s constitution.
Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said earlier on Thursday he had appealed to the court to declare the referendum illegal.
The constitution states Spain is indivisible.
