tunis/rome ( reuters ) - at least eight people drowned on monday when a boat carrying dozens of mostly tunisian migrants collided with a navy vessel off the country s southeast coast , its defense ministry said .
according to testimony from survivors , there were between 70 and 80 people on board , international organization for migration ( iom ) spokesman flavio di giacomo said .
he said at least 20 people were missing and some 40 , almost all tunisians , had been rescued .
the ministry said eight bodies had been recovered after the collision with the tunisian navy boat , which occurred 54km ( 33 miles ) off the coast .
italian news agency ansa said the migrant vessel had sunk .
libya has long been the busiest country of departure for a steady flow of migrants trying to reach the european union from north africa .
but activity on that route has declined since july as libya s coast guard and an armed group in the smuggling hub of sabratha tightened controls .
meanwhile departures from tunisia have picked up , many in wooden boats that have started landing on secluded sicilian beaches , often in broad daylight .
a rescue mission after monday s collision was being coordinated by the maltese coast guard , an italian coast guard spokesman said .
two italian coast guard ships , a finance police boat and a navy ship had been sent to assist , he said .
a maltese plane was en route to the scene , a maltese army spokesman said .
