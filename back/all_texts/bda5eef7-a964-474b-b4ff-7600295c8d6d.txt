21st Century Wire says The mainstream media continues to deflect from its own collapse in credibility in the wake of Hillary Clinton s epic electoral meltdown by inventing a synthetic fake news crisis and scapegoating Clinton s loss on bloggers and cheap eastern European hoax websites.
In addition to mainstream media constantly pushing out actual fake news, corporate media giants have also created their own fake alternative media as well.
Here are a number of media operatives appearing on TV pretending to be alternative media but in reality are really funded by the major broadcast media empires.
One of these is a political news website called Vox.com.
It s designed to look like an edgy alternative news source, but in reality, Vox is just another establishment consensus reality-building tool.
Silicon Valley investors have pumped tens of millions of dollars into this media outlet, with the lead investor being none other than NBC Universal who are one of the biggest peddlers of actual fake news globally (just ask their phony news anchor Brian Williams).
Watch as FOX host Tucker Carlson takes apart hypocritical Vox staffer Timothy Lee over the issue of fake news circulating on the internet, revealing how Vox is also a producer of fake news too.
As Carlson rightly points out this issue really boils down to freedom of speech.Caveat: Certainly, FOX News is not immune to pushing their own brand of fake news, especially when it comes to promoting US wars overseas, but it does have a number of capable pundits who have exposed a number of key revelations during the course of this historic 2016 Election.
