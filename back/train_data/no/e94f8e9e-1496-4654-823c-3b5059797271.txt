i m pretty sure trump will win with a yuge majority in new york without his kids votes .
eric trump and ivanka trump won t be voting for their father , donald , in the new york primary next week.the deadline to register to vote in the republican primary in new york was october 9 , 2015 .
both eric and ivanka missed the deadline to register .
they had a long time [ to ] register and they were , you know , unaware of the rules , and they didn t , they didn t register in time , trump stated during an interview on fox news .
so they feel very , very guilty .
but it s fine , i mean , i understand that .
i think they have to register a year in advance and they didn t. so eric and ivanka i guess won t be voting , trump added .
