phnom penh ( reuters ) - cambodia has canceled the diplomatic passports of some opposition members weeks after a supreme court ruling dissolved their political party , senior government officials said on thursday .
the court outlawed the cambodia national rescue party ( cnrp ) this month at the request of authoritarian prime minister hun sen s government in a move that prompted the united states to cut election funding and threaten more punitive steps .
huy vannak , undersecretary of state at the interior ministry , said 56 diplomatic passports of former members of the cnrp had been revoked .
legally , they are just ordinary citizens , they are no longer special officials who receive diplomatic passports , huy vannak told reuters .
they can no longer use them and it means that they can use normal passports .
the move comes after a warning this week from hun sen that former members of the cnrp who have fled to thailand may be sent back to cambodia .
government spokesman phay siphan told reuters on thursday he was unaware whether there was any attempt to bring back to cambodia those in hiding in thailand .
rights groups and some western governments have voiced concern over what they say is the deterioration of cambodia s political landscape ahead of a 2018 election that had looked set to be the biggest challenge to hun sen s 32-year rule .
cnrp leader kem sokha was arrested in september and charged with treason over an alleged plot to take power with american help .
washington has rejected the accusations as baseless .
the nov. 16 supreme court ruling ordered a five-year political ban for 118 members of the cnrp , including kem sokha .
the 55 parliamentary seats the cnrp won in the last election in 2013 were allocated to smaller parties after the ruling .
