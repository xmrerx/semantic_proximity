It s no secret Republican women hate Donald Trump.
The GOP frontrunner has a net negative rating of 42 percent amongst Republican women (and a net negative of 50 amongst all women).
Bottom line: women hate Donald Trump, and if Republican women revolt against the sack of hot air, he loses in a landslide to Hillary Clinton.Well Clinton may have gotten a boost from an unlikely source: former First Lady Laura Bush.Speaking to the Women in the World Summit in New York, Bush, who recently published a book on Afghan women, told the crowd: I want our next president, whoever he or she might be, to be somebody who is interested in women in Afghanistan and who will continue U.S. policies and that we continue to do what we re committed to do as a country.
That s who I want or the kind of people that will do that and will pay attention to our history, and know what s happened before and know specifically how we can continue to do the good things that we do around the world.
Considering Ted Cruz wants to carpet bomb the Middle East to see if sand can glow and Donald Trump wants to ban Muslims fleeing oppression from entering the United States, it doesn t take a genius to see what kind of candidate Bush is looking for.And when it comes to the issue of refugees, more than half of which are women.
She stated she wanted the next president to protect the rights of women in Afghanistan.
This eliminates both Trump and Cruz, so who s left?The Summit, focused on empowering women in a time of war, is a staple in Clinton s campaign message empowering all women, all across the world.Jenna Bush, Laura and George s daughter, was more candid.
Holding her 6 month old baby, she bluntly said:I m worried about her future.Laura Bush, who objected to her husband s family values oriented 2004 campaign, has taken a more moderate approach to politics than her husband and his inner circle.
