tokyo ( reuters ) - japan will propose a strategic dialogue among leaders of the united states , india and australia , aiming at counteracting china s expansion under its belt and road policy , foreign minister taro kono told the nikkei business daily .
prime minister shinzo abe is expected to propose the idea to u.s. president donald trump on nov. 6 when they plan to hold a summit meeting , said the nikkei on thursday .
the proposal is for the leaders of the four nations to promote free trade and defense cooperation across the land and sea to southeast , south and central asia , and beyond to the middle east and africa , kono said in the interview with the nikkei conducted on wednesday .
we are in an era when japan has to exert itself diplomatically by drawing a big strategic picture , kono was quoted as saying .
to maintain free and open ocean , the economy and security will surely be on the table , he said .
kono said the aim was to also promote high-quality infrastructure investment across asia to africa .
chinese president xi jinping s vast belt and road infrastructure project was included in the ruling communist party s constitution on tuesday , giving it greater policy heft and added pressure to succeed .
the belt and road plan , a silk road -like initiative , is a vehicle for china to take a greater role on the international stage by funding and building global transport and trade links in more than 60 countries .
kono also said putting pressure on north korea would certainly be necessary to make pyongyang dismantle its missile and nuclear development , according to the nikkei .
he said if north korea accepted a review by international atomic energy agency it would be the most trustworthy option for conditions for talks between pyongyang and the international community .
