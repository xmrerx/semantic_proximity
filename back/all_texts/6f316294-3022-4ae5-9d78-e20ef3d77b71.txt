Carl Bernstein, the legendary journalist who is most famous for his original coverage of the Watergate scandal, had some strong words for Donald Trump Sunday morning.
Bernstein appeared on CNN s Reliable Sources to discuss Trumps campaign s media blackballing of several major news outlets.Trump has refused to give media passes to several major publishers from Politico to The Washington Post, where Bernstein worked for most of his career.The panel featured in the segment was made up of current editors from a few of the media organizations that Trump has put a wall up between them and his campaign.
They wasted no time lamenting how hard it has been to deliver news coverage of Trump s campaign and expressed worry for the media under a Trump administration, given his blatant disregard for first amendment rights.It was Bernstein though who had the most critical things to say about Trump and his campaign.
Really, this is about a candidate for president of the United States who does not believe in a free press, said Bernstein.
He keeps talking about changing libel laws and suing the press and has instituted many, many lawsuits throughout his career.
The underlying story here is who is Donald Trump?
And I will say, and have said, that we are seeing the nominee of a major political party for the first time in our history, who is a neofascist, a particular kind of neofascist a strongman who doesn t believe in democratic institutions.
Bernstein suggests that there is not enough reporting and analysis of Trump in the media that shows that accurately puts Trump into the context of elections historically.
His bigotry is evident and we need to keep looking at it, but this is a story of a candidate who is a total break in our history and we need to be doing reporting on it, not just debating it on television.
