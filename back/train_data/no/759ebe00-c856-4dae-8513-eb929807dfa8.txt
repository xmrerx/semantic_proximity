a teacher at a school in wels in upper austria simply changed the hymn god s love is so wonderful to allah s love is so wonderful .an angry father confronted the local school board , demanding they correct the lyrics , but you can not just rewrite a text !
there is huge uproar in vogelweide primary school in wels .
the 4th year class teacher ( where a majority of the children are muslim ) created a text by hand : throughout the entire hymn , the word god was replaced in handwriting by the word allah .after the incident was brought to the attention of the school inspector karin lang , he immediately corrected the situation with the teacher concerned and the school principal.via : krone.at
