washington ( reuters ) - president barack obama will ensure that federal officials are held accountable if any wrongdoing is uncovered in the u.s. environmental protection agency ’ s handling of the water contamination crisis in flint , michigan , the white house said on thursday .
“ the president believes that the principle of accountability is important , particularly when the stakes are this high , ” white house spokesman josh earnest told reporters at a briefing .
noting that the justice department was investigating the contamination of flint ’ s water supply , earnest said obama will make sure that epa officials are held responsible for any “ errors or wrongdoing ” that may be uncovered .
obama on wednesday said it was “ inexplicable and inexcusable ” that families in flint were not immediately notified about the contaminated water .
federal and local government agencies have faced criticism for their response to the crisis in flint , where a switch in water supply for the cash-strapped city of 100,000 north of detroit led to elevated levels of lead in drinking water .
high levels of lead in the blood can cause brain damage and other health problems .
while the obama administration has repeatedly stressed oversight of the flint ’ s water was primarily the responsibility of state and local authorities , the epa has said it did not act fast enough to address the problem .
complaints about flint ’ s water began within a month after the city switched to flint river water in april 2014 to save money .
the city had been using the lake huron as its water source .
flint did not return to the lake huron water supply until october 2015 , after tests showed elevated levels of lead in flint tap water and in some children .
