Bystander footage shows a group of Bakersfield, California police officers brutally beating a man in the street.The video begins with the man, now identified as Robert Woodson, lying in the street with an unidentified officer standing over him.
He can be heard screaming that he thinks his leg is broken.Two more officers arrive on the scene.The video shows the officers repeatedly striking Woodson with a police-issued baton.Throughout the brutal assault the officers can be heard shouting, Stop resisting!
Stop resisting.
The person recording the incident responds by sayinm He s not doing nothing, and He s not resisting.
While it s clear that Woodson wasn t complying with police commands, at no time does the video show him trying to get up off the ground, making threatening moves or gestures toward police.In spite of this, the cops use a taser on him.His screams of pain can be heard throughout the encounter.According to KERO Woodson was eventually taken to a local hospital where he was treated for injuries sustained during the episode.The police watchdog organization Photography Is Not A Crime reports that the man suffered an injury to his arm which required a cast.Police charged Woodson with resisting arrest and assaulting a police officer.If that s not disturbing enough, during an interview with KERO, Bakersfield police sergeant Gary Carruesco stated that police acted appropriately, in part because they were concerned Woodson had mental issues.
The video, combined with the disturbing response from sergeant Carruesco, provides a bleak picture of how law enforcement officers respond to people with mental illness.While police assessed Woodson s behavior as willful noncompliance, it s unknown whether the man was physically or mentally capable of following officer s commands.In Woodson s case, officers expressed their concern for him with tasers and batons.Here s the video, courtesy of KERO.Featured image via ideo screen capture via KERO
