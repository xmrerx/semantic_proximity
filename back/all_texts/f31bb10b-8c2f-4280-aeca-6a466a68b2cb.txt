This week s cold open for Saturday Night Live featured a parody of the morning show, Morning Joe.
The sketch featured Alex Moffat as host Joe Scarborough and Kate McKinnon as Mika Mika Brzezinski.
The sketch also has Alec Baldwin as President Donald Trump, who calls into the show as John Miller, a spokesperson for the White House.
Back in the day, Trump was known for calling reporters all over the New York area pretending to be his own publicist.
He would call, not to tout his business successes but to brag about his sex life.The sketch also made fun of the relationship between the hosts.
The pair got engaged recently when they were celebrating Mika s 50th birthday.
The sketch shows the response from the other panelists on the show, Mark Halperin, Willie Geist and Mike Barnacle, who all have no idea how to respond to Joe and Mika s behavior on the set.Featured image via Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images.
