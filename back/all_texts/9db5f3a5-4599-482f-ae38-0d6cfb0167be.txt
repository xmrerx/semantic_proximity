Linguistics professor and political commentator Noam Chomsky has come out with a shocking statement about the Republican party.
We ve all known that Republicans are pretty much the scum of the earth today, but Chomsky warns they are the most dangerous organization in human history.
During an interview with BBC s Newsnight Wednesday with host Evan Davis, Mr. Chomsky quickly addressed the Republican Party, saying that they are worse than the Islamic State terrorist group or anyone else who have caused millions of casualties during the 20th century.Chomsky agreed his statement was outrageous but made it hit home when comparing the Republican part to ISIS.
Is ISIS dedicated to trying to destroy the prospects for organized human existence?
He went on to explain, What does it mean to say not only are we not doing anything about climate change, but we re trying to accelerate the race to the precipice?
he said.
It doesn t matter whether they genuinely believe it or not if the consequence of that is, let s use more fossil fuels, let s refuse to subsidize developing countries, let s eliminate regulations that reduce greenhouse gases.
If that s the consequence, that s extremely dangerous.
Chomsky has a real point.
The rate at which the GOP is deregulating industry and ignoring the effects of climate change, the world will see levels of human suffering that have never been experienced in history.Watch the video here:
