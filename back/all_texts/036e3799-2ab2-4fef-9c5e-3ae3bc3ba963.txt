Donald Trump is proving, yet again, that he is terrified of strong women.
Not to mention the fact he s also got the thinnest skin around when it comes to being able to take criticism thrown against him.
He also can t help but throw insults, especially at women, because when you have nothing to arm yourself in a battle of wits, throw insults.After being just absolutely pummeled by Elizabeth Warren on Twitter Monday morning, Trump was asked what he felt about her calling him a loser etc., and Trump being Trump responded as such: Who s that, the Indian?
You mean the Indian?
And then follows it up by claiming that country is so divided and it s the fault of people like Warren.
The problem with the country right now [is] it s so divided, and people like Elizabeth Warren really have to get their act together because it s going to stay divided.
Of course, sliding in there that maybe he s to blame as well, but really this diversionary tactic is typical of Trump to get the topic away from him being called out so tremendously well and turned back onto the person who threw down the gauntlet against him.Trump cannot take criticism and Warren knows this.
How he responds makes him look juvenile and weak, so hopefully Warren as well as all others who are trying to prevent him from getting into the Oval Office continue to put him on the defense, because he really just can t handle it.
