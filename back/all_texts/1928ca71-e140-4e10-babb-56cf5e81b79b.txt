Bravo!
Polish prime minister Beata Szydlo just put her foot down!
She told the EU that Poland will not be blackmailed into accepting thousands of refugees under the EU quota system.
Szydlo hammered the weak EU for allowing the slow death of European culture and its people by taking in millions of refugees that are destroying the Western nations financially, socially and culturally.
In a fantastic speech before the Polish Parliament, Szydlo urged lawmakers to protect Poland and its children from the scourges of Islamist terrorism and cultural suicide:Where are you headed, Europe?
Rise from your knees and from your lethargy, or you will be crying over your children every day.If you cannot see that terrorism has the potential to hurt every country in Europe, and you think that Poland should not defend itself, you are going hand in hand with those who point this weapon against Europe, against all of us.Do we want politicians who say we have to get used to terrorist attacks?Prime Minister Beata Szydlo received raucous applause from many members of the Polish parliament, who expressed their approval of her no-nonsense call to action.
