WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called on President Barack Obama to resign from office because he did not say the words “radical Islam,” in a statement in response to the Orlando massacre where 50 people were killed.
“Because our leaders are weak, I said this was going to happen – and it is only going to get worse,” Trump said in a statement.
“I am trying to save lives and prevent the next terrorist attack.
We can’t afford to be politically correct anymore.” Trump’s campaign said he will address the attacks in a speech he already had scheduled to deliver on Monday addressing national security and responding to criticism from Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.
