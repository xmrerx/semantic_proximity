hillary clinton breaks out the very phony southern accent during a speech in memphis .
this always cracks me up because i m from the south and we can spot a phony a mile away .
pandering to her base is what clinton does best .
just like obama , she plays to the crowd she s speaking to by adopting their accent or acting like she s just one of them .
this folksy style is cringe inducing for anyone with half a brain but she is speaking to a group of democrats soooooo south carolina : hillary clinton sat down for a chair chat with the chairman of the democratic party of south carolina .
during the interview , as in many of her speeches to people who live in the south , she put on a southern accent that is absent from her speeches to northerners .
we made a mashup of some of the most painfully pandering moments , and ranked the intensity of her accent with cowboy boots ( 1 = lowest , 5 = strongest ) .
