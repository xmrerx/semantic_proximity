Conservatives are already praising God for the murder of 20 or more people at an LGBT night club in Orlando, Florida.On Saturday night, a gunman walked into the club with an assault rifle and began shooting people.
So far, at least 20 are confirmed dead but police say the death toll could be as high as 50.But it didn t take long for Republicans to merely offer thoughts and prayers instead of vowing to take actions that would make their NRA masters very angry.Some Republicans, however, have absolutely no compassion for those who were slaughtered because they are anti-gay bigots who believe the victims got what they deserved.The following morning after the terrorist attack took place, Texas Lt.
Governor Dan Patrick posted a vile Bible verse on Twitter citing Galatians 6:7 which reads: Do not be deceived: God cannot be mocked.
A man reaps what he sows.
Here s an image of the Tweet via the Houston Chronicle.In other words, Patrick thinks that the people shot and killed at Pulse Orlando had it coming because they were at a gay night club.
According to conservative Christians like Patrick, being gay is a sin against God punishable by death.Twitter users immediately blasted Patrick for his lack of compassion.
Have you no shame?
one user wrote.Texas Democratic Party Chair Gilberto Hinojosa also condemned the tweet.
Hate and violence have no place in America, he said.
Unfortunately, Texans in mourning for our families in Florida woke up to an embarrassment from their lieutenant governor.
Lt.Gov Dan Patrick, please apologize immediately.
Make this right.
We are better than this.
But Patrick has not apologized nor has he expressed condolences to the families of those who were killed.
He merely deleted the post.Make no mistake, many conservatives are cheering this act of terrorism today and they should be ashamed of themselves for it.Featured Image: YouTube
