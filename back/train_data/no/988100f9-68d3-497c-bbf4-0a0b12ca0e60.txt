istanbul ( reuters ) - a turkish court sentenced a journalist from opposition newspaper cumhuriyet to three years in prison on tuesday on a charge of spreading terrorist propaganda over a tweet which the paper briefly posted in may , state media said .
the newspaper s online editor , oguz guven , was accused of discrediting ankara s fight against supporters of the u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen , who the government says orchestrated a coup attempt last year .
the tweet had referred to a prosecutor being killed in a road accident with the expression that he had been mowed down by a truck .
cumhuriyet , long a pillar of the secularist establishment , says the tweet was replaced within one minute by one saying the prosecutor died awfully in a truck accident .
the prosecutor who died had prepared an indictment against gulen s network .
the cleric denies any involvement in the coup attempt .
state-run anadolu agency said guven was sentenced to three years and one month in jail .
he had been remanded in custody in may but was released in june pending trial .
more than a dozen cumhuriyet correspondents and executives are being tried in a separate case in which prosecutors say the paper was taken over by supporters of gulen and used to target erdogan and veil the actions of militant groups .
prosecutors are seeking up to 43 years in jail for the paper s staff , accused of targeting erdogan through asymmetric war methods .
they have denied the charges .
since the failed coup in july 2016 , turkey has jailed more than 50,000 people and closed more than 130 media outlets , raising concerns among western allies about deteriorating rights and freedoms .
