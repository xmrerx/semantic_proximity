WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Marco Rubio, who dropped out of the Republican presidential race earlier this year, was chosen on Tuesday as the Republican Party nominee for a second U.S. Senate term from Florida, according to the Associated Press.
Rubio was projected to win the party nominating contest in Florida over novice politician Carlos Beruff, a wealthy homebuilder.
Rubio could face Democratic U.S. Representative Patrick Murphy, who was expected to win his partyâ€™s nominating contest, in the Nov. 8 election.
