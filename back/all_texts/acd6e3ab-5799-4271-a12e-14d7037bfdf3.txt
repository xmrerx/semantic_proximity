Last Saturday, a bunch of well-armed militiamen decided to protest the extended sentence of two Oregon ranchers, Dwight and Steven Hammond, who started fires on federal land near their property.
The federal law they broke has a minimum five-year sentence.
And according to Rolling Stone: The first federal judge to handle the case concluded that the mandatory sentence was too stiff and gave the pair far lighter sentences, which they served.
But the U.S. attorney in the case called foul; the federal government took the rare step of appealing the sentence.
In October 2015, the Ninth Circuit imposed the mandatory minimum, ruling that: given the seriousness of arson, a five-year sentence is not grossly disproportionate to the offense.
The ranchers are due back in federal prison Monday to serve out their five years each.
Well, not wanting to stay out of the limelight for too long, Ammon Bundy, son of the infamous anti-government imbecile Cliven Bundy who stood his ground with no penalty against the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) not too long ago, decided he would involve himself in the fight against tyranny of government against these law-breaking ranchers.
Bundy, and his band of merry morons, decided to take over the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Burns, Oregon.
He posted a video to Facebook where he declared: We have basically taken over the Malheur Wildlife Refuge.
And this will become a base place for patriots from all over the country to come and be housed here and to live here.
And we re planning on staying here for several years bring your arms.
Maybe they don t need their legs?Well, needless to say, the government isn t being tyrannical, but rather following the laws as they are written.
These militiamen may not like the laws, but that s what elections are for you vote in the people who make the laws.
You don t hold armed protests, or rather hissy fits, in an empty wildlife refuge.Nonetheless, in no particular order, here are the five stupidest things done by these make-believe Patriots in Oregon:If there s a protest by ultra-right-wing morons to be had somewhere, you know there are bound to be an abundance of signs that are misspelled.
And not disappointing us in the slightest, the Bundy Militia made sure to offer some doozies.
Looks like maybe they could have used some of that tyranical goverment [sic] to help them get a better education.via littlegreenfootballs.comOne of the Patriots, Jon Ritzenheimer, even made a goodbye video for his family.
Occupying a bird refuge is dangerous, and you never know when a bald eagle may come to knock some sense into them.After this pathetic request for snacks and supplies because this group of soldiers apparently forgot the Boy Scout motto be prepared // < !

!Anyone that wants to send any supplies can send them to: General Mail Posted by Blaine Cooper on Thursday, December 31, 2015 several folks took to Twitter to mock the living hell out of the ill-prepared dimwits:Please send snacks b/c the USPS isn't at all part of the "oppressive tyrannical government " we hate.

Ha!
Let s not let this fact escape us.
These idiots took over federal property, and somehow are allowed to still stay there.
They are protesting the government by setting up camp on federal land.
The government can t be too tyrannical if they are allowed to stay as long as they have.Now, one may have seen a lot of weird, strange, and/or pathetic things in their lifetime, but this may have to take the cake.
One of these Patriots armed himself and took shelter under a blue tarp and was ready to fight at a moments notice.
And yes, this is as weird and stupid as it sounds, so leave it to Twitter to take over the well-deserved mockery:Is that a militiaman under your tarp or are you just happy to see me pic.twitter.com/vrKstnGYyr KStreetHipster (@KStreetHipster) January 6, 2016This is happening on teevee nuz rn pic.twitter.com/pZDkbQc2Ix Steve King (@steveking_) January 6, 2016You re only seeing 10% of the #Derp.

Furthermore, insurrection is explicitly written against in the Constitution.While we watch these idiots get away with treason for now, we can at least have entertainment from their utter stupidity.Featured image: Twitter
