Everyone knows by now just how fast and loose Kellyanne Conway is with her words.
She pioneered alternative facts.
She claimed that the U.S. had never gone as long without a Treasury Secretary as we did with Trump.
She made up an entire terrorist attack.
She said that microwaves turn into cameras.
And somehow, people still want to talk to her.Some in the press have started seeing her as the darkness, because she s such a purveyor of misinformation.
That word, darkness, refers to the Washington Post s front page motto, Democracy dies in darkness.
Michael Wolff, a reporter for the Hollywood Reporter, told her: I m going to tell you, when they say democracy dies in darkness, you re the darkness.
So the Washington Post (and Wolff) is calling her and other purveyors of lies out in their front-page motto.
Conway s response was to first say, I m not the darkness!
Then she said: It s what I tell small children: Just because somebody says something doesn t make it true, and it s a great lesson for everyone.
Miss Bowling Green Massacre is defending herself against accusations of lies by pointing out that people lie.
The irony!
It hurts!
But it gets even better: You can turn on the TV more than you can read in the paper because I assume editors are still doing their jobs in most places and people literally say things that just aren t true.
Yes, primarily Fox News and those that like Trump.
And herself.
Someone needs to get Glass House here to say all of this again while looking in a mirror.Watch below:.
@MichaelWolffNYC: Democracy dies in darkness.
You re the darkness.
@KellyannePolls: I m not the darkness.
