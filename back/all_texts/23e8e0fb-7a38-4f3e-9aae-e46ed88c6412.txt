MINSK (Reuters) - There is a substantial difference between how Germany and France envisage the possible deployment of U.N. peacekeepers in eastern Ukraine and Russia s position, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told journalists on Friday.
Both Kiev and Moscow have proposed U.N. peacekeepers be deployed to help resolve Ukraine s pro-Russian separatist conflict but the sides disagree on whether the troops should be positioned on the rebel-controlled part of the Ukraine-Russia border.
Germany, France, Russia and Ukraine have previously held talks in an effort to end the fighting that has killed more than 10,000 people despite a notional ceasefire.
Germany and France s idea and Russia s idea on how a blue helmets (peacekeeping) mission would be shaped are still very far apart, Gabriel said during an official visit to Belarus.
Nevertheless Gabriel said the deployment would represent a real chance for peace in the war-torn Donbass region.
Although our ideas are still far apart, it would be inadvisable to close this window of opportunity, he said.
