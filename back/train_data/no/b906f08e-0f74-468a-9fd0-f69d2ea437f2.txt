luxembourg ( reuters ) - european police forces can not impose blanket height restrictions on recruits because that discriminates against women , the eu s top court ruled on wednesday , throwing out an argument from the greek government .
athens had defended a minimum height requirement for entry to the greek police academy of 1.70 meters ( 5 feet 7 inches ) after a woman complained of sex discrimination when her application to join the force was rejected in 2007 because she was too short .
but the european court of justice ruled that such a blanket restriction was not justified .
it said some tasks in the police - it cited traffic duty - do not require special physical characteristics while even for those for which a physical aptitude is needed , tests could be less discriminatory against women .
women account for 13 percent of police officers in greece .
that compares to 18 percent in france , where a 1.60-metre rule was scrapped in 2010 , and fully 29 percent in england and wales , which abandoned minimum heights for both men and women 27 years ago .
until 1990 , english women had to be at least 1.60 meters tall to join the police - 3 centimeters less than men .
