LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May will listen to concerns from lawmakers about legislation to sever political, financial and legal ties with the European Union, but it is a vital bill, her spokesman said on Thursday.
Parliament is due to begin debating the repeal bill, which is central to the government s plan to exit the bloc in 2019, later on Thursday but some lawmakers have expressed concerns about the powers it will give the government.
She has said she will listen to the concerns of MPs (lawmakers) but we believe the bill is the right way to go about delivering a smooth exit from the European Union which is in everybody s interest, the spokesman told reporters.
