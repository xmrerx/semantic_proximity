Tonight s Oscars were filled with award winners and speeches.
However, there was no moment that had a larger collective impact on those watching than Lady Gaga s performance, which brought a standing ovation and tears to the eyes of many in the audience.That s because she performed her Oscar nominated song Till it happens to you, from the documentary The Hunting Ground, which explores rape on college campuses in the U.S.
Here s the video:Lady Gaga was introduced by Vice President Joe Biden, who spoke about the White House s It s On Us campaign, urging everyone to get on board.
After receiving a standing ovation, Biden said: Lets change the culture so that no abused woman woman or man ever feels they have to ask themselves, What do I do?
They did nothing wrong.
Then it was Lady Gaga s turn to deliver one of the most memorable moments in Oscar history.
Gaga performed while playing the piano and was joined by a group of sexual-assault survivors on stage, drawing a standing ovation and tears from members of the audience.
Earlier this week, Gaga gave her support to pop star Kesha, who is currently involved in a legal battle with Sony.
Kesha tweeted her thanks to both Lady Gaga and Vice President Joe Biden:thank u @ladygaga and VP @JoeBiden for bringing attention to sexual assault at the oscars.
