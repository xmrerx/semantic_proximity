But of course Oh the humanity The attacker was wearing a fake explosives vest and shouted Allah Akbar God is Great during the terrifying incident before he was shot dead.German police revealed they had raided an apartment at an asylum centre in the western city of Recklinghausen claiming it had been occupied by the attacker.Officers said they were acting on concrete evidence obtained from French security authorities.They said the results of the search are still being evaluated with their French counterparts and there is no evidence of further possible attacks being planned.Police said they would not release any further information at the moment to avoid jeopardising the ongoing investigation.French investigators are still trying to determine the true identity of the man originally identified as Sallah Ali who was carrying a butcher knife as he tried to storm the station last Thursday.Paris prosecutor Francois Molins confirmed the attacker was carrying a piece of paper that pledged allegiance to the leader of evil ISIS also known as Daesh and said his act is linked to the deaths in Syria He also had a phone with a German SIM card, the prosecutor said.He said: A mobile phone and a piece of paper, on which appear the Daesh flag and a clear written claim in Arabic, were found on the individual.
Alexis Mukenge, who saw the shooting from inside another building, told the network iTele that police told the man, Stop.
Move back.
Mukenge said officers fired twice and the man immediately dropped to the ground.A police official said Ali shouted Allahu Akbar and had wires protruding from his clothes.
That s why the police officer opened fire.
The chilling attack occurred on the one-year anniversary of the Charlie Hebdo massacre where 12 people were killed at the satirical newspaper s office by jihadi gunmen.
