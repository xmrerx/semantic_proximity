Most of the media is capitalizing off what Hillary Clinton said at a recent LGBT event that was held in New York City.
Unlike a Donald Trump gaffe every other hour, Hillary said something that bordered on inappropriate, albeit completely honest.
She said that half of Trump s supporters are a basket of deplorables.
In other words, they need to be called out on their blatant bigotry.Hillary said: To just be grossly generalistic, you can put half of Trump supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables.
Right?
Racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamaphobic, you name it.
And unfortunately, there are people like that and he has lifted them up he tweets and retweets offensive, hateful, mean-spirited rhetoric.
Hearing this from Hillary, Trump took this as a cue to defend the indefensible the racists themselves.
And yes, they are blatantly racist.
In fact, he even called them great Americans.
Trump tweeted out: Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment.
What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans!
