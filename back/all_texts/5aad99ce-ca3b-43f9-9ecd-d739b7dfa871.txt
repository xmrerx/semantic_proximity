Saturday Night Live once again took aim at Donald Trump.
Trump once again threw a hissy fit about it.
And Alec Baldwin once again responded perfectly.Baldwin s impersonation of Trump has been spot-on, must to the delight of Saturday Night Live fans across the country.This week, Baldwin returned to lampoon Trump s inability to focus on the most important job he ll ever have because he refuses to stop tweeting insults and petty whining.Baldwin s Trump interrupted a security briefing to retweet random people, which is totally believable because Trump ignores the daily briefings all the time and still spends much of his time on Twitter.Kate McKinnon s Kellyanne Conway explained that Trump does that because he wants to distract people from talking about his conflicts of interest.
But Baldwin s Trump had a different reason.
I do it because my brain is bad, he said.Here s the video via YouTube.After the show ended, the real Donald Trump couldn t refrain from attacking Saturday Night Live again and even whined about Baldwin s impersonation, which again, is fantastic.Just tried watching Saturday Night Live unwatchable!
Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can t get any worse.
Sad Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 4, 2016Baldwin then struck back by offering Trump a deal.
@realDonaldTrumpRelease your tax returns and I ll stop.
Ha ABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) December 4, 2016Now, we all know that Trump is going to refuse Baldwin s offer.
That s because Trump has been hiding his tax returns from the American people all year because he doesn t want everyone to know how much of a greedy terrible businessman he really is.Of course, Baldwin wasn t the only one who slammed Trump s hissy fit.
Twitter users also had something to say.Jesus fucking Christ, @realDonaldTrump.
You are the president-elect.
Pick your fucking battles, man.
You re embarrassing yourself.

Might be more your speed Jon Rosenberg (@jonrosenberg) December 4, 2016@realDonaldTrump Alec would be a better POTUS-E. At least he makes people laugh.
Tony Posnanski (@tonyposnanski) December 4, 2016President-elect, or whiny thin-skinned narcissistic man-baby?
He s both!

Sad!
Bob Hagh ?
(@BobHagh) December 4, 2016Donald Trump has repeatedly demonstrated his inability to focus on the presidency.
Instead of learning what the job is all about and keeping up with the daily briefings he would rather spend his time whining on Twitter.
That s totally unpresidential and it s why Trump should not be inaugurated in January.Featured Image: Screenshot
