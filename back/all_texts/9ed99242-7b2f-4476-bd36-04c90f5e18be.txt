Trump s way of handling the heat is simple: deflect, and blame everything on everyone else.
He is a master of pointing the finger and saying look, they do it too!
The evidence couldn t be more clear with how he accuses Hillary Clinton of everything from pay-for-play, to corruption, to even murder.And for some reason, the media lets him get away with it.But luckily for us (and bad for Trump once the debates come around), Hillary Clinton isn t letting him get away with anything.Sick of the never ending accusations and silence by the media elites, Clinton listed on her website nine difference instances in which Trump accused her of doing something he actually does himself.
From real pay-for-play to ties to Russia, Clinton proves that it really is Trump, and not her, that is the shady candidate.Let s take a look:So there you have it.
While Trump continues to accuse Clinton of everything under the sun, he himself is actually the real culprit in all of these scenarios.
