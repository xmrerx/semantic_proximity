accra ( reuters ) - ghana and ivory coast set up a body on tuesday to implement an international tribunal ruling on their dispute over a border running through multibillion dollar offshore oilfields , they said in a statement .
the international tribunal for the law of the sea last month drew an ocean boundary that seemed to favour ghana in a dispute with its neighbour ivory coast , ruling that accra had not violated ivorian rights in drilling for oil .
following last month s ruling , the two leaders have agreed to work together and this has culminated in the setting up of a joint commission to implement the ruling , ghanaian foreign minister shirley botchwey said , reading a joint communique .
the decade-old row between the west african neighbours has put the brakes on the development of ghana s $ 6 billion offshore ten field , run by tullow oil , one of the projects in the contested area of the atlantic .
the court ruling did not correspond with either ghana or ivory coast s claim , but appeared closer to ghana s , and it rejected the former s attempt to halt development .
