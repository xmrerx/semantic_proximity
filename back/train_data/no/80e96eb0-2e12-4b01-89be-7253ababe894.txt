beijing - china will expand a pilot project for anti-graft supervision reforms nationwide next year that will consolidate existing corruption agencies , state-run news agency xinhua reported , as president xi jinping expands his signature policy drive .
xinhua said in a report published late on saturday china s top legislature adopted a decision calling for new supervisory commissions to be set up by the people s congresses at provincial , city and county-levels to supervise those exercising public power .
xi s signature anti-graft drive has jailed or otherwise punished nearly 1.4 million communist party members since 2012 .
the leader , who began his second five-year term in october , has vowed to maintain the irreversible momentum of the campaign to root out corruption .
china aims to pass a national supervision law and set up a new commission at the annual parliament meetings early next year .
the new national supervision commission will work with the communist party s anti-graft body , the central commission for discipline inspection , expanding the purview of xi s anti-graft campaign to include employees at state-backed institutions .
xinhua said the commissions to be set up nationwide under the china legislature s new directive will have the power to investigate illegal activities such as graft , misuse of authority , neglect of duty , and wasting public funds .
the commissions will have the ability to conduct searches , freeze assets and detain suspects as part of those efforts , the xinhua report said .
