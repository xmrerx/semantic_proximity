We ve all been concerned with the idea of the likes of Donald Trump receiving national security briefings, which are set to start on Wednesday.
However, we can all breathe a little easier if what Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) says is true: Trump s briefing won t be anything we can t get from tuning into the political news shows.
Schiff, making an appearance on MSNBC s Morning Joe Wednesday morning, says of Trump s intelligence briefings: I think it will go, frankly, not much beyond what you would find on MSNBC, CNN or Fox any day of the week when you turn in to hear a national security discussion.I think what he s going to get is a very top-line briefing that will set the context for what the national security challenges are that face the country but won t go into anything that might reveal a source of information, a method of how we got that information, nothing of that level of specificity.
Schiff went on to say that Trump won t even get the kinds of briefings that happen in the House: In fact, many of the classified briefings for the full House of Representatives have the same character, where we leave the briefing and get more detail watching your show than we did during the briefing.
I think this will be even more top-level than what the 435 members of the House get.
I hope you re right, Rep. Schiff.
In fact, given the inability of Trump to control the verbal diarrhea that regularly spews from his mouth, perhaps we should be on the safe side and do as Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid suggested and just give him fake information altogether.Watch Rep. Schiff s remarks below:.
