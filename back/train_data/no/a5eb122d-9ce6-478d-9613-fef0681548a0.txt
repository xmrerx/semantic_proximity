hillary clinton is known world-wide for saying and doing the most ridiculous things , but her press conference concerning the attacks over the weekend has to be the most ridiculous to date.any american that truly decides to actually listen to the things she said can see that she has run out of any form of ammo against trump that she thought she had.just a few of the things she said that will make you think twice : we need a better visa system .
lets remember what happened on 9/11 .
these were not refugees .
we need to do everything we can to support law enforcement .
we will defeat the evil , twisted ideology of the terrorists .
take the fight to isis everywhere they threaten us .
these are just a few in a 12 minute long dialogue that sounds like she is doing her best to literally say the opposite of everything she has ever said before .
hillary even has the gall to claim that trump is aiding and abetting terrorists .
she must have forgotten that she is the one who takes monetary gifts from places like iran.in an ironic twist hillary basically blames trump for any and all attacks saying that his anti-muslim rhetoric is the root cause for muslims to want to attack us .
really hillary ? clinton has tried to push the refugee program on us even after it was made clear that the refugees can not be vetted properly .
she has fully supported black lives matter and continuously disrespects law enforcement .
hillary has said more than once that she supports the rights of muslims in america ( sharia law ) .
furthermore she tries to label anyone that protests the radical ideology of islam as terrorists .
every word she says in the press conference is a direct contradiction of her record :
