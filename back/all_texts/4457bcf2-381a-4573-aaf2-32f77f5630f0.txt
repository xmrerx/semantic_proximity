THE BRITISH PEOPLE PUT BRITAIN FIRST, WILL AMERICANS PUT AMERICA FIRST?
THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION S POLL COULD GIVE US HOPE FOR A TRUMP WIN: A majority 55 percent of Americans believe that the American way of life needs to be protected against foreign influence, says a wide-reaching poll conducted by Brookings Institution which revealed a greater urgency among some respondents.Three-fourths of Republicans and 83 percent of those who support presumptive nominee Donald Trump say this influence must be curtailed.
In contrast, only four in 10 Democrats agree.
The poll focused on public concern over immigration and cultural change, and how these worries shape the 2016 presidential election.
The survey revealed the presence of a new strain of protectionism, an analysis noted.
Republicans, and particularly Trump supporters, strongly believe the American way of life needs to be protected from foreign influence on both the economic and cultural fronts.
The findings also broached some sensitive subjects, revealing that 57 percent of Americans overall agree the values of Islam are at odds with American values and way of life.
There are some partisan divides: Among Republicans, the number was 79 percent, among Democrats 42 percent.
The public is also divided over whether so-called reverse discrimination, or discrimination against whites, is as big a problem as discrimination against blacks and other minorities: 49 percent agree and 49 percent disagree, the analysis said.
There are huge partisan disparities on this question: 81 percent of Trump supporters and 72 percent of Republicans agree with this statement, compared to only 32 percent of Democrats.
