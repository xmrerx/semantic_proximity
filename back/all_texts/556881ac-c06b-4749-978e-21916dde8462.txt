The terror attacks in Brussels, Belgium have brought out the Muslim-haters on the right in full force particularly GOP presidential hopeful Ted Cruz.
The creepiest candidate on the right has openly called for the police to increase patrols in Muslim neighborhoods, and has gotten backing for his disgusting statements from the network that is a longtime mouthpiece of the bigoted right Fox News.Well, there s one person who isn t taking their bullshit lying down: Comedy Central host Larry Wilmore.
On Wednesday night s edition of his show, Wilmore blasted Cruz and Fox over their bigotry, and especially their insistence that anyone questioning their hateful words is just being politically correct.
Gooooooooo f*ck yourselves.
I mean, a major news network, so-called major news network, and a major presidential candidate slamming a major religion has nothing to do with political correctness.
It s just wrong.
To round out the hilarious but truthful segment, Wilmore interviewed Masir Ali, an expert on the Middle East.
He weighed in from a snowy vacation, complete with snowboard, to show everyone just how dumb Ted Cruz and Fox News really are.The Nightly Show host is right.
They are wrong.
Bigotry and discrimination are a huge and major selling point with right-wingers, and here in the year 2016 that is just shameful.
We seriously have one of the two major political parties in America that gets most of their votes for hating on anyone who isn t straight, white, male, and Christian.
Think about that, and what it means for the future of this country.Watch the video below via Comedy Central:Featured image via video screen capture
