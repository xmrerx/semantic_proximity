almaty ( reuters ) - kazakhstan is to change its official alphabet for the third time in less than 100 years in what is seen in part as symbolic move to underline its independence .
president nursultan nazarbayev ordered his office on thursday to prepare for a switch to a latin-based alphabet from a cyrillic one , distancing itself , at least graphically , from russia .
the oil-rich former soviet republic of 18 million has very close ties with moscow , its main trading partner , but is also wary of russia s ambitions to maintain its political influence throughout the region .
kazakh , a turkic language , used to be written in arabic script until the 1920s when the soviet union briefly introduced a latin alphabet for it .
this was later replaced by a cyrillic one in 1940 , based on the russian alphabet .
part of the latest switch relates to modern technology .
the currently used cyrillic alphabet has 42 symbols , making it cumbersome to use with digital devices - a standard kazakh keyboard utilizes almost all number keys in addition to letter and punctuation keys .
the latest version of the proposed latin alphabet works around that by using apostrophe signs to modify letters .
the country s official name would thus be spelled as qazaqstan respy blikasy .
according to a statement published by nazarbayev s office , he has ordered his chief of staff to draft an executive order introducing the new alphabet .
the switch will be gradual , it said .
alhough kazakh has been the state language since kazakhstan became independent in 1991 , only 62 percent of the population said they were fluent in both written and spoken kazakh during a the most recent national census in 2009 .
russian is more widespread with 85 percent claiming fluency in the same census .
russian is recognized as an official language in kazakhstan .
several other turkic nations , including turkey itself , ex-soviet azerbaijan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan , have also switched to latin alphabets .
