the woman whose husband made several trips to pedophile island with his convicted pedophile friend , billionaire jeffrey epstein mocks trump for liking to be around beauty contests ?
hillary used what she thought would be a good zinger against trump during the debate when she boldly stated , he loves beauty contests , supporting them and hanging around with them .
really hillary ?
don t you wish your own husband limited his desire for other women to simply enjoying being around them ?
think of how many less women you d have to threaten to keep quiet if bill only looked at other women and didn t actually sexually assault them.hillary clinton s new anti-trump poster child is literally a porn star who was accused of driving the getaway vehicle for a murder attempt and later threatening to kill a judge.but the media is saying trump is the villain of the piece because he once said she was overweight ( despite cnn reporting the same thing ) .let that sink in.hillary brought up alicia machado , who won the miss universe pageant owned by trump in 1996 , during the debate on monday night , claiming that trump once called her miss piggy because she gained a lot of weight while representing the pageant.the whole stunt was designed to play into hillary s feminist image and portray trump as anti-women.donald trump once called a woman overweight vs hillary clinton repeatedly threatening bill clinton s sexual abuse victims.which story is the media interested in and which one won t they touch ?
no prizes for guessing the correct answer.but that s not even the worst part of it.machado , who is now a fully signed up hillary campaign surrogate , was accused of driving a getaway car to aid her boyfriend in a plot to murder his brother-in-law at the funeral of the dead man s wife and then threatening to kill the judge who was in charge of convicting juan rodriguez reggeti.despite giving conflicting stories on where she was at the time , the judge said there was insufficient evidence to prove she was at the scene of the crime.when cnn s anderson cooper confronted machado with her own sordid past , she didn t try to deny it , simply waving her hand and scoffing , i have my past , everybody has a past , i m not a saint .
