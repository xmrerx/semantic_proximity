immigration advocate roberto hernandez joined tucker carlson to debate the controversial payout of $ 190k to an illegal for being turned over to ice .
you won t believe the reasoning !
this is insane ! an illegal immigrant is set to be awarded $ 190,000 from san francisco after police turned him over to immigration authorities , which is a violation of the city s sanctuary policy .
pedro figueroa-zarceno , who is from el salvador and was living in the u.s. illegally , walked into a police station on december 2 , 2015 , to recover his stolen car .
when he left the station , u.s. immigration and customs enforcement ( ice ) immediately took him into custody .
figueroa-zarceno recently reached the massive settlement agreement with the city attorney s office .
the agreement must be approved by the city s board of supervisors.tucker argued it s insane that the city is paying hernandez because they actually enforced u.s. federal immigration law .
you shouldn t pay a criminal for breaking the law , tucker said.hernandez said that san francisco has a sanctuary policy because citizens and city leaders believe that the federal government s immigration policy has failed .
in san francisco , we are different .
we are progressive .
we think different .
we re leaders when it comes to being humanitarians , hernandez said.tucker asked why san francisco is willing to ignore federal law , but only for illegal immigrants .
if i m wanted for tax evasion in another state and the san francisco police turn me over to the feds , why shouldn t i be able to sue the city of san francisco for cooperating with the federal authorities ?
