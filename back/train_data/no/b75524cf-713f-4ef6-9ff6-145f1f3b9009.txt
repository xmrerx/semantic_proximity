republican governor larry hogan waited for a call from leftist democrat mayor rawlings-blake .
the call didn t come until the city had reached a boiling point and had entered into a full blown riot .
why do the republicans always have to be the adults in the room ?
and why are conservatives always left to figure out ways to clean up the messes made by the left ?
as baltimore burns the media begins the blame game .
last night pressing the maryland governor on why it took so long for the maryland national guard to be activated governor larry hogan cuts right to the chase : within 30 seconds of receiving the call , i activated the national guard .the delay stems from baltimore mayor rawlings-blake refusing to ask for assistance , and refusing to return phone calls from the governors office .
start watching the video at 09:00 to see delivery : governor hogan is a republican , mayor rawlings is a far-left liberal democrat.after governor hogan arrived in baltimore , cnn pundit don lemon tried to pin the blame on him in an effort to protect the more liberal mayor rawlings from her own ineptitude .
again governor hogan was having none of it.the liberal bias dripping from don lemon is ridiculous.via : the conservative treehouse
