moscow ( reuters ) - russia s upper house of parliament on wednesday approved a bill which will allow the authorities to list foreign media operating in russia as foreign agents , responding to u.s. restrictions on two russian media outlets , ria news agency reported .
last week the foreign agents law was swiftly approved by the lower chamber of the legislature .
it now needs president vladimir putin s signature to become law .
the move by the compliant parliament heavily dominated by putin s loyalists comes after his threat this month that russia would respond in kind to what he said were washington s measures to restrict the freedom of speech of russian media organizations operating on u.s. soil .
