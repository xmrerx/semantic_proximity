ohio governor john kasich , who signed a pledge to support the republican candidate no matter who it was , is clearly not a man of his word .
he has been an open crybaby critic of trump since he found himself polling at 1 % while donald was on a meteoric rise to the top of the gop ticket .
so many of these sour grapes gop contenders who have been outspoken , or have quietly skulked away , refusing to endorse trump or half-heartedly endorsing him , have lost supporters who would likely have helped them to win their reelection bids in their respective states .
america chose their nominee , and politicians like john kasich chose to put their own petty difference ahead of the american voter by essentially checking the box for hillary .
if the polls aren t rigged and trump cleans up in ohio , someone s gon na have a little egg on their face john kasich proudly announced today , that he has written in a vote for the liberal war-hawk , john mccain who got creamed in the general election against barack hussein obama.the ohio governor s write-in vote for the 2008 gop nominee , confirmed by a spokesman , won t count .
ohio law requires write-in candidates to file with the secretary of state more than two months before election day.with the vote for mccain , kasich , who failed in his own presidential bid this year , issued a final rebuke of trump.the ohio governor has long said he finds trump s policy positions and behavior troubling .
this month , he confirmed he would not vote for the controversial new york billionaire , despite having signed a pledge last year to support the republican nominee , no matter who it was .
