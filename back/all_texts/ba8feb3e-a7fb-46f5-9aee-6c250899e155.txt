The world is going to need to make some major adjustments now that the apologists have left the White House Sec of State Rex Tillerson on chemical weapons attack on Syrians: Well obviously, the events that have occurred in Syria with the chemical weapons attack here in the past day I think have just horrified all of us and brought to the front pages and to our television screens as well the tragedy that is part of the Syrian conflict.
There is no doubt in our mind and the information we have supports that Syria, the Syrian regime under the leadership of Bashar al-Assad are responsible for this attack and I think further it s very important that the Russian government consider carefully their continued support for the Assad regime.
On Thursday, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said steps are under way to form an international coalition to remove the president of Syria Bashar al-Assad after Tuesday s chemical bombings in Syria.
