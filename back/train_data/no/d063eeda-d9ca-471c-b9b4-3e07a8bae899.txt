general michael flynn released the statement below : after over 33 years of military service to our country , including nearly five years in combat away from my family , and then my decision to continue to serve the united states , it has been extraordinarily painful to endure these many months of false accusations of treason and other outrageous acts .
such false accusations are contrary to everything i have ever done and stood for .
but i recognize that the actions i acknowledged in court today were wrong , and , through my faith in god , i am working to set things right .
my guilty plea and agreement to cooperate with the special counsel s office reflect a decision i made in the best interests of my family and of our country .
i accept full responsibility for my actions .
