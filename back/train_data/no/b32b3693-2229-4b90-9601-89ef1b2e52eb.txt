remote controlled car bombs are being constructed for countries where suicide bombers are scarce .
the only thing they need are some radical islamists to set the vehicles in motion .
with our wide open borders and generous refugee resettlement program ( which brings hundreds of thousands of men and woman coming from countries who hate us to live in america on our dime ) it shouldn t be too hard to implement their terror plans .
terror group islamic state is employing scientists and weapons experts to train jihadists to carry out sophisticated spectacular attacks in europe , while also modifying weapons systems capable of targeting passenger jets and military aircraft.from a jihadi university in the syrian city of raqqa , the scientists have stunned western weapons experts by producing a homemade thermal battery for surface-to-air missiles.it had been regarded as a virtually impossible feat for terror groups working without a military infrastructure.but footage exclusively obtained by sky news shows that is can now recommission thousands of missiles assumed by western governments to have been redundant through old age.heat-seeking warheads can be used to attack passenger and military aircraft .
they are 99 % accurate once locked on.for decades terror groups , including the ira , had these weapons but storing them and maintaining the thermal battery a key component to the warhead was very difficult.it seems that is scientists have got round the problem , and that revelation will shock the world of international security.the is research and development team has produced fully working remote controlled cars to act as mobile bombs , while they have fitted the cars with drivers ; mannequins with self-regulating thermostats to produce the heat signature of humans , allowing the car bombs to evade sophisticated scanning machines that protect military and government buildings in the west.here is a stunning video actually showing islamic state terrorists testing their inventions : the group trained fighters from a variety of countries to carry out attacks and to train more jihadists in their own countries.an is trainer with more than eight hours of unedited training videos was captured by the remnants of the free syrian army ( fsa ) as he headed north through turkey towards europe.the fsa passed the material to sky news but was not aware of the importance of the videos , described by a weapons adviser to the british military as an intelligence gold mine .using aerial and satellite imagery sky news has identified the location of the university and pieced together the apparently random collection of video files to reveal the true extent of is s sophisticated development and training team.although this type of activity had been widely suspected by western intelligence services , this is the first concrete evidence that it is taking place.crucially , it is far more developed than had previously been thought possible.groups of trainees from a range of countries including syria , iraq , sudan , somalia , tunisia , egypt and pakistan were given terror training courses using science labs and facilities based around the former equestrian centre in raqqa .
