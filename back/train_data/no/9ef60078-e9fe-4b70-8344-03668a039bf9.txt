what trump actually said was : our police are amazing .
our local police they know who a lot of these people are .
they are afraid to do anything about it because they don t want to be accused of profiling and they don t want to be accused of all sorts of things .
you know , in israel they profile .
they ve done an unbelievable job , as good as you can do .
but israel has done an unbelievable job , and they ll profile .
they see somebody that s suspicious , they will profile .
they will take that person and they ll check out .
do we have a choice ?
look what s going on .
do we really have a choice ?
we re trying to be so politically correct in our country .
and this is only going to get worse .
the above screenshot shows the contradiction .
cnn indicates that trump is supporting racial profiling , while they go on to show his exact quote where he does not state racial .h/t [ breaking 911 ]
