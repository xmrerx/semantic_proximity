As we get closer to the day when Trump must take office, conflicts-of-interest continue to rise between his presidency and his series of businesses.Trump has promised to leave his business to focus on his presidency, yet he plans to leave his children in charge of his business.
Of course, that won t solve anything because as POTUS Trump wouldn t do anything to harm his children s new business and close contact with his children ensures he will still play some sort of role.
Therefore, his plan wouldn t actually be effective, and Elizabeth Warren just called him out on that all over Twitter.Americans deserve to know that the President is doing what s best for the country not using his office to do what s best for himself.
Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) December 15, 2016The only way for @realDonaldTrump to eliminate conflicts-of-interest is to divest his financial interests & place them in a blind trust.

@SenatorCardin, @ChrisCoons, @SenatorDurbin, @SenJeffMerkley & I will introduce a bill in January to implement the Emoluments Clause.
Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) December 15, 2016Placing assets in a true blind trust has been the standard for previous presidents.
Our bill makes clear we expect Trump to do the same.
Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) December 15, 2016In the past, every president with business assets has had to place them in a blind trust before taking office, for good reason.
Donald Trump should definitely not be an exception, but he should have released his taxes, too and we know how that went.
He should not be allowed to leave his business in the hands of his children either, and it s looking very unlikely he will leave his business in a blind trust unless he is absolutely forced to.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images
