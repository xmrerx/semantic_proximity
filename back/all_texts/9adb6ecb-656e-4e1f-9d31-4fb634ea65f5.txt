I ll bet you re thinking this is a joke, right?
Can you believe these idiotic liberals?
so happy I don t live in the towns in Massachusetts that changed Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day.
Just frickin ridiculous!
Northampton became the second city in Western Mass to change the name of Columbus Day to Indigenous Peoples Day.A unanimous vote tonight sides with the residents who believe the change should be made based on the slavery and genocide that Christopher Columbus brought to native peoples in the Americas.
Northampton is also looking into better educating children about the Native American s sacrifice to the city it is today.
The school committee is also going to pick this up and probably pass a resolution of its own so that we have the commitment of educators in Northampton to actually really teach this material and get children to understand that our city is built on the foundation of these Native American peoples, said Ward 7 City Councilor Alisa Klein.
In May, Amherst became the first community in the state to make the Columbus Day name change.
