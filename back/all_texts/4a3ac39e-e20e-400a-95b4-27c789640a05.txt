In a shocking exchange on Wednesday, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Loony Liberal Senator Sheldon Whitehouse discussed whether the DOJ had considered civil action against climate change deniers.
This tells you just how out of control this DOJ is.
If you don t buy into the climate change scam then you will be punished.
Crazy times!
This matter has been discussed.
We have received information about it and have referred it to the FBI to consider whether or not it meets the criteria for which we could take action on, Lynch said at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on Justice Department operations.
