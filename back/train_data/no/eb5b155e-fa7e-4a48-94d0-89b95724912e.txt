altoona , iowa ( reuters ) - iowa ’ s governor said on tuesday it would be a “ big mistake ” for voters in the nation ’ s first presidential contest next month to choose ted cruz for the republican nomination , citing the u.s. senator ’ s opposition to a biofuel mandate important to the state .
republican governor terry branstad said cruz was in the pocket of “ big oil , ” and criticized the texan ’ s opposition to the renewable fuel standard , which requires u.s. fuel to contain a minimum amount of biofuels , including ethanol .
ethanol is a major market for iowa corn , and the state ’ s voters have generally supported ethanol mandates .
branstad said cruz is a big opponent of renewable fuels who is “ heavily financed by big oil. ” “ ted cruz , who is ahead in the polls , is diametrically opposed to what we really care about , and that is growing the opportunity for renewable fuels in this country , ” branstad said .
branstad spoke after addressing the iowa renewable fuels summit , where republican front-runner donald trump also spoke later in the day and endorsed the renewable fuel standard .
branstad ’ s oldest son , eric , has worked on a political action committee that has been critical of cruz ’ s ethanol stance .
the governor has said he would not endorse a candidate before the feb. 1 caucuses in iowa , where cruz leads trump in some opinion polls .
“ i think it would be a big mistake for iowa to support him , ” branstad said of cruz .
“ i know he ’ s ahead in the polls , but the only poll that counts is the one they take on caucus night .
and i think it could change between now and then. ” u.s. representative steve king of iowa , who backs cruz , criticized branstad ’ s comments as a “ de facto endorsement of trump. ” ( reporting by kay henderson ; writing by doina chiacu ; editing by jonathan oatis ) sap is the sponsor of this coverage which is independently produced by the staff of reuters news agency .
