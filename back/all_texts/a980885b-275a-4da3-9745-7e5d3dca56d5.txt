After much back and forth between the white dude wearing a Black Lives Matter t-shirt and the black man who appears to be acting as security for corrupt Hillary, the black man suggests he go to the back of the line and ask secret service for permission to enter.
The good news is that it appears the line to see Hillary (as usual) is pretty short.
If he had to get to the back of the line for a Trump event, that could have been an issue.https://twitter.com/ShaunKing/status/724776822018170881Corrupt Hillary actually sent out this tweet just before the event the white dude in the Black Lives Matter t-shirt wasn t allowed to enter:"As a white person, I have to talk about [racism] more.
We are not a post-racial society."
