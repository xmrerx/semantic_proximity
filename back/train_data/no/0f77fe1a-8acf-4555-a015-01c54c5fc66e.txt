london ( reuters ) - london mayor sadiq khan said on sunday that it would be wrong for britain to host u.s. president donald trump on a state visit , describing some of the u.s. leader s views on islam as ignorant .
khan and trump have a history .
during the u.s. presidential election campaign , khan was among many people who spoke out against trump s proposed ban on muslims entering the united states , an idea he said would play into the hands of extremists .
trump has criticized khan , accusing the mayor of making a pathetic excuse over his statement urging londoners not to be alarmed by the presence of additional police on the streets in response to an attack in june .
at the annual conference of his opposition labour party , khan told an audience with guardianlive that he thought having a state visit , which prime minister theresa may has said is still planned , was wrong .
i sometimes think people are ignorant , he said , adding that it was his job to educate them .
