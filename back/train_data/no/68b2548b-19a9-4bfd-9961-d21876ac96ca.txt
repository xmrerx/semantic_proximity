berlin ( reuters ) - a man drove a car at the entrance of the berlin headquarters of germany s social democratic party ( spd ) late on sunday evening , lightly injuring himself , later telling police that he had intended to commit suicide .
police said the car , which crashed through the first set of glass doors of willy brandt house , the spd s headquarters , was laden with petrol canisters and gas cartridges .
the building s sprinkler system extinguished the resulting blaze .
authorities did not identify the man , in part because of a policy of limiting public communications in cases involving suicide , attempted or otherwise , saying only that he was 58 years old .
a police spokeswoman said investigators had found nothing to cast doubt on the man s claim that he had been attempting to commit suicide .
the incident did not appear to be an attack , she added .
it was unclear why he had chosen the spd , which is about to start negotiations on governing for another four years in coalition with chancellor angela merkel s conservatives , as his target .
the man was taken to hospital for treatment for superficial injuries to his head .
nobody else was hurt .
police launched an arson inquiry and state security services were also investigating .
