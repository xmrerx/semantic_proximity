Donald Trump is a sexual predator, and more and more evidence of that fact keeps surfacing.
It seems that the hot mic tape of the lewd conversation between Trump and then-Access Hollywood host Billy Bush was just the tip of the iceberg.
There have also been women who have come forward to say that Trump groped them inappropriately, and now there is video footage of Trump literally making sexually suggestive remarks about a 10-year-old girl.
This occurred at a Christmas event in Trump Tower years ago, in 1992, when Trump was 46 years old.
During the event, aired on Entertainment Tonight, Trump inquired of the little girl if she was going up the escalator.
He then said, unabashedly and live on air: I am going to be dating her in 10 years.
Can you believe it?
This is just beyond creepy.
Donald Trump needs to be investigated.
We have a sexual predator as a major party presidential nominee, and nothing is being done about his behavior by the authorities.
Granted, we do have statues of limitations and all of that, but this is just insane.
This more than locker room talk, as Trump put it at the second presidential debate.
No, this is predatory behavior, and it is becoming more and more apparent that Trump regularly engages in inappropriate behavior even with pre-pubescent children.
If the GOP doesn t disavow Trump after this, the entire nation will know that they tolerate literal pedophilia in their ranks.
Watch the disturbing comments below:Here's Trump, then 46 yrs old, saying in 1992 that "I'm going to be dating her in 10 years" while referring to a young girl.
