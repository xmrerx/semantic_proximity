According to what White House press secretary Sean Spicer said, Trump requested the resignation of former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn due to the erosion of trust.
Flynn lied to the administration regarding discussions with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak.
Trump literally fired Flynn but he s now calling the scandal fake news.
The amateur president has been lashing out at networks reporting on the scandal, calling them fake news, too.
Thursday morning, Trump went on quite a tweet-storm.
FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and sources, is far more effective than the discredited Democrats but they are fading fast!, Trump tweeted.FAKE NEWS media, which makes up stories and sources, is far more effective than the discredited Democrats but they are fading fast!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2017In the following tweet, he wrote, The Democrats had to come up with a story as to why they lost the election, and so badly (306), so they made up a story RUSSIA.
Fake news!

Fake news!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 16, 2017Trump is clearly unhinged.
Trump has previously admitted that Russia engaged in cyber attacks during the U.S. presidential election.
And again, he fired Flynn for lying to the administration about talks with the Russian ambassador about sanctions.
Regardless, today he s calling it fake news.The Internet pounced after Trump unleashed his crazy-time tweets and fact-checked him.

Kristina Wong (@mskristinawong) February 16, 2017@realDonaldTrump It s not fake news when three of your advisers are forced to resign because of exposed Russian ties.

(@nicholasstoller) February 16, 2017Trump won t even take questions about Flynnghazi from reporters.
And by the way, there s a Russian spy ship patrolling off the coast of the U.S.
Presently, it s near Virginia.
So naturally, Trump is planning to hold a rally in Florida.Photo by Isaac Brekken/Getty Images with added tweet.
