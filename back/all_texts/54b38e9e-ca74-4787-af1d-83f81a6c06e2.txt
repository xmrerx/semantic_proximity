Remember when these Turkish thugs beat up (see below) protesters in DC a few months ago?
Someone needs to set these guys straight and tell them they re not in Turkey but in the U.S .Protesters were pummeled on Thursday during an appearance by Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan at a Midtown hotel.
The violence erupted as Erdogan took the stage inside a ballroom at the Marriott hotel in Times Square.#Erdo an New York ta Protesto Edenlere Yaka Pa a M dahale https://t.co/xqKyXuGIN1 pic.twitter.com/PrhSxsXCZv Amerika n n Sesi (@VOATurkish) September 21, 2017 Terrorist!
a demostrator shouted as he jumped on his chair, prompting security to rush him.
You re a terrorist!
Get out of my country!
Erdogan supporters in the crowd erupted in shouts and boos and attempted to punch the man, climbing over security to take swings, video of the mayhem shows.Another protester unfurled a banner for a banned Kurdish group and was escorted out.
The scene quickly erupted into a free-for-all as bodyguards tried to escort the unwanted guests from the room.THIS IS WHAT HAPPENED IN DC A FEW MONTHS AGO:Pandemonium followed a crowd of security as they barreled toward the doors of the room, according to video taken by a Turkish journalist.One man stands on top of his chair and slams his fist down on the head of one of the protesters as security walk him past.Erdogan, in town for the United Nations General Assembly, was speaking to a large audience at an event organized by the Turkish American National Steering Committee.Police said one security officer suffered a minor injury, but no arrests were made.It was unclear if the suit-clad men escorting the protesters were hired security or members Erdogan s personal detail.In May, Turkish security officials were captured on video hitting and kicking peaceful protesters outside the Turkish ambassador s residence in Washington, D.C., while Erdogan stood by his car and watched.
