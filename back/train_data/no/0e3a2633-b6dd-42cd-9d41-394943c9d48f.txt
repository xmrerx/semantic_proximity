manchester , england ( reuters ) - britain will limit sales of sulphuric acid and outlaw the sale of such corrosive substances to children after a spate of assaults and its possible use to make bombs , interior minister amber rudd said on tuesday .
much to public alarm , the number of incidents where assailants have used acid has risen sharply , with police figures suggesting there had been more than 400 corrosive substance attacks in the six months to april this year .
many victims were left with serious , life-changing injuries as a result .
the proposed new laws will make it illegal to sell the most harmful corrosive substances to under-18s while the carrying of acid in public without good reason will be banned .
acid attacks are absolutely revolting , home secretary rudd told party activists at the conservative party conference in the northern english city of manchester .
you have all seen the pictures of victims that never fully recover ; endless surgeries , lives ruined .
rudd said she also intended to drastically limit the public sale of sulphuric acid because of its use in making the highly volatile triacetone triperoxide ( tatp ) , known as mother of satan , which is often used as a detonator in home-made explosives .
police say tatp was used in an attempted bombing on a packed london underground train last month which injured 30 people .
the bomb engulfed a carriage in flames but failed to explode fully .
at the moment , businesses that sell sulphuric acid have to tell the police of any theft or loss , but the new law would mean anyone wanting to buy it above a certain concentration would have to have a home office license .
rudd also announced plans to further restrict the online sale of knives to under-18s following a significant increase in the number of stabbings .
