ANKARA (Reuters) - President Tayyip Erdogan said on Tuesday that Turkey will very soon completely destroy those in Syria linked to Kurdish militants.
Turkey has been angered by U.S. support for Syrian Kurdish YPG fighters who have spearheaded the Western-backed military campaign against Islamic State.
Ankara says the YPG is an extension of the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK).
