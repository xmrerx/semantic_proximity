vienna ( reuters ) - a new poll by austria s social democrats ( spo ) suggests they may be poised for a boost at parliamentary elections on sunday after having been relegated to third place behind the conservatives and the far right in opinion polls for months .
an spo source and a report by newspaper kurier said on friday the social democrats have come within less than a handful of percentage points of the conservatives , who have been leading polls for months at around a third of the vote .
the spo and the far-right freedom party ( fpo ) have both attracted approval ratings of around a quarter , with the fpo taking second place more often than not .
we will win this , you will see , an ebullient christian kern , social democrat chancellor and party leader , told supporters .
whichever party wins the most votes on sunday is likely to miss the 50-percent mark , meaning it will have to enter coalition talks .
