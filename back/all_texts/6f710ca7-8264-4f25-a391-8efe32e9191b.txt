Who knew you could be a parent and still find the time to get out and riot with your spouse?
Have you ever wanted to attend a mass protest, serve on a feminist panel, or lecture an unsuspecting group of tourists about the gender spectrum only to discover that you can t get a babysitter on short notice?Well, fear not at least, fear not if you re a resident of the greater Washington, DC, area.
Woke babysitting a new activism-oriented babysitting community is here to step in to care for your progressive tots while you practice social justice out in the community.
Have you ever been prevented from attending a rally, protest, or emergency call to action by the lack of a babysitter?, the site reads.
Woke Babysitting wants to help.
The site is the hub for a Google Group, where progressive parents of tots can sign up to become a sort-of child-sharing service, watching each others kids when lawyers, legal observers, and activists may be called upon for urgent action, and don t have time to line up a neighborhood sitter.Ostensibly, while you re out rocking your pussy hat on the Washington Mall or filing emergency stays with the Supreme Court, your woke babysitter will line up age-appropriate social justice-oriented activities so that your child is raised with all the proper compassion and wokeness required of today s offspring.When you get back from the bar (or wherever else you happen have your post-protest karmic transfer Reiki meeting), your children will be waiting with Black Lives Matter signs, subversive art projects, or having heard politically correct bedtime stories.Via: HeatStreet
