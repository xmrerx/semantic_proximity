You re gonna love this!The left has been screaming for decades about the government interfering in their right to kill their babies.
Because after all, even though it s a human life in its earliest stages of development; it s growing inside their womb, so the government has no business protecting the innocent life of that baby in THEIR bodies.Strangely enough, the left is angry about Trump s decision to let the states decide if they will or will not force its citizens to share a bathroom or public shower with a person who claims to be a certain gender contrary to what their genitals say they are.
Clearly the hypocritical left can t make up their mind when it s okay, or when it s not okay for the government to tell citizens what they can or cannot do
