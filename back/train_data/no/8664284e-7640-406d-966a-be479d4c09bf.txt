it s easy to glance at tuesday s popular vote which , with 92 percent of all precincts reporting , shows hillary clinton with six million fewer votes than barack obama won in 2012 and reach the conclusion that clinton lost the white house because she failed to turn out the democratic base .
but the truth is much more complicated .
while she underperformed relative to obama s 2012 totals in several midwestern states ohio , michigan , iowa , and wisconsin clinton ran virtually even with obama in the battlegrounds of pennsylvania , north carolina , virginia , nevada , and new hampshire .
what s more , she far surpassed obama s 2012 vote total in florida , the country s biggest swing state .
yet somehow , while obama carried florida , clinton lost it .
which brings us to an important question : was donald trump just good enough to beat a bad democratic opponent on tuesday , or does he deserve far more credit ? a review of vote totals in the past two elections reveals that trump 2016 would have defeated obama 2012 in the electoral college .
( disclaimer : this obviously is an apples-to-oranges exercise because no two elections are the same , nor are any two electorates .
still , unlike debating whether the 2016 cubs would defeat the 1927 yankees , this is not an entirely abstract argument ; a comparison of their respective performances in the country s most competitive states shows trump edging obama in a hypothetical head-to-head matchup . )
the math might seem impossible .
after all , obama won nearly 66 million votes in 2012 ; trump is currently at 59.5 million and should finish around 60 million , which will actually be one million fewer votes than mitt romney won .
how , then , could trump have topped obama in the electoral college ?
the answer : republican turnout lagged in certain parts of the country but shot through the roof in the nation s most critical battleground states .
let s look at them individually , in descending order by population , and do the electoral-vote math .
the 2016 totals aren t yet final because not all precincts have reported.florida 29 evs 98 percent reportingobama 2012 : 4,235,270clinton 2016 : 4,485,745romney 2012 : 4,162,081trump 2016 : 4,605,515conclusion : trump beats obama by some 370,000 votes and wins florida .
( note : clinton herself won 250,000 more votes in florida than obama did in 2012 . )
pennsylvania 20 evs 97 percent reportingobama 2012 : 2,907,448clinton 2016 : 2,844,705romney 2012 : 2,619,583trump 2016 : 2,912,941conclusion : trump squeezes past obama by a margin of some 5,000 votes and wins pennsylvania .
( note : clinton runs about 60,000 votes behind obama , but would ve had more than enough to defeat romney in 2012 . )
ohio 18 evs 94 percent reportingobama 2012 : 2,697,260clinton 2016 : 2,317,001romney 2012 : 2,593,779trump 2016 : 2,771,984conclusion : trump edges obama by roughly 75,000 votes and wins ohio .
( note : clinton s worst battleground state showing was ohio , winning 380,000 [ ! ]
fewer votes than obama .
) stop right there and crunch the numbers : florida ( 29 ) + pennsylvania ( 20 ) + ohio ( 18 ) = 67 evs.romney finished with 206 evs .
by protecting all of those , and then taking 67 from obama , trump would hit 273 and win the presidency.the question : did trump 2016 defeat obama 2012 in all of the states romney won ?
yes .
here s a look at the competitive ones : north carolina ( 98 percent reporting ) : trump 2,339,603 obama 2,178,388 arizona ( 73 percent reporting ) : trump 947,284 obama 930,669 georgia ( 93 percent reporting ) : trump 2,068,623 obama 1,761,761 utah ( 78 percent reporting ) : trump 360,634 obama 229,463a review of the romney 2012 states confirms that trump , in this hypothetical matchup , would have carried every single one against obama .
it doesn t matter that obama would have trounced trump by nearly 300,000 votes in michigan ; by more than 200,000 in wisconsin ; by 175,000 in virginia ; and by 160,000 in colorado .
it s similarly meaningless that obama would have narrowly defeated trump in iowa , nevada , and new hampshire .
the 44th president carried all of those states in 2012 , and in this hypothetical contest , he would successfully defend all of them .
but it wouldn t be enough .
the electoral college would produce a razor-thin margin : trump 273 , obama 265.via : national review
