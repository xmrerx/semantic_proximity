mogadishu ( reuters ) - fighting between the military and police backed by intelligence forces killed nine people in the somali capital on saturday , police said .
it seems they mistook the somali national army for ( clan ) militias .
the death toll is nine people including a civilian , major abdullahi hussein , a police officer , told reuters .
he said the fighting occurred because police were wrongly informed that there were armed militias in the area .
accidents happen , he said .
somalia has been riven by civil war since 1991 , when clan-based warlords overthrew a dictator then turned against each other .
the weak u.n.-backed government is now battling an islamist insurgency , but many members of its security forces are badly trained and coordination is poor .
last night security forces ( the police and intelligence ) besieged us and then opened fire .
we defended ourselves and chased the so-called security forces after hours of fighting today .
we lost two soldiers and a wife of my colleague , major nur osman , a military officer , told reuters on saturday .
the land belongs to the military , it houses the families of soldiers .
however , the security forces were trying to force us off the land , he said .
residents said the fighting was terrifying .
we were awoken last night ... by gunfire ... we took our babies on our shoulders and fled , resident mohamed idle told reuters .
in a separate incident on saturday , islamist insurgents briefly entered the town of el wak in gedo region , southern somalia , near the border with kenya .
a few soldiers were in el wak and they left in the morning for tactical practice .
many al shabaab fighters advanced , captain ibrahim ali , a military officer , told reuters .
al shabaab said they stayed briefly , took weapons and supplies , and left .
