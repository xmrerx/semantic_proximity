ankara ( reuters ) - turkish authorities issued detention warrants for 79 former school employees on wednesday over alleged links to last year s failed military coup , broadcaster ntv said .
they were suspected of using bylock , an encrypted messaging app which the government says was used by the network of u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen , whom it accuses of orchestrating the abortive putsch in july 2016 .
the suspects worked at private schools and tutor schools which prepared students for university entrance exams , many of which used to be run by supporters of gulen .
gulen , who has lived in self-imposed exile in the united states since 1999 , has denied involvement and condemned the coup attempt .
since the coup attempt some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the public and private sectors , including some who worked at schools founded by his supporters , and more than 50,000 have been detained for alleged links to it .
the crackdown has alarmed rights groups and some of turkey s western allies , who fear the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent .
the government , however , says gulen s network deeply infiltrated turkey s institutions - the army , schools and courts - and only a massive purge could neutralize the threat .
