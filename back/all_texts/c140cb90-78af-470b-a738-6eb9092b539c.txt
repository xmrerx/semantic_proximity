As the polls close in the all-important South Carolina Democratic primary, Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton comes away with a very big win.
Unlike what happened in Iowa and Nevada, the voters spoke very clearly here: Clinton is their leading lady.Clinton s win is widely seen as a result of 80 percent support from Black voters, who have a long and sustained relationship with the Clintons.
The same people who favored Barack Obama over Hillary Clinton in 2008 are now voting Clinton.
This is a crucial demographic for the candidate wishing to take the party s nomination, and it seems that Clinton has it locked up.Hillary excitedly took to twitter to thank her volunteers, supporters, and voters:To South Carolina, to the volunteers at the heart of our campaign, to the supporters who power it: thank you.

It s a bit of a make or break state, and Clinton s performance there today showed that she is most definitely up to the task.The next big hurdle is this coming Tuesday, the event known as Super Tuesday, in which 11 states hold caucuses that will definitely help decide the nominee going into the general election.Great job today, Madame Secretary!Featured image via Hillary Clinton Twitter
