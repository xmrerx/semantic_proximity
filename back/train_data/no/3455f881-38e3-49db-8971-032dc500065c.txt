berlin ( reuters ) - german authorities are investigating reports that asylum seekers in a berlin refugee camp were forced into prostitution , officials said , adding that they had not been able to confirm that such incidents had taken place .
the allegations come amid heightened concern at germany s ability to integrate the 1.1 million refugees who arrived in 2015 and 2016 .
the political parties negotiating to form a new national coalition government are arguing over whether to impose a cap on immigration numbers .
broadcaster zdf reported on tuesday that employees of a security company that runs several refugee camps in berlin were luring asylum seekers , some of them minors , into prostitution .
both national government and berlin city officials said they were investigating the allegations , and berlin said its staff would be given further training to help them identify such cases .
if the allegations of security staff profiting from and driving refugees into prostitution are true , these would be very serious charges , said government spokesman steffen seibert said .
exploiting the material hardship in which many refugees and immigrants live is totally unacceptable .
forcing people into prostitution is morally reprehensible , he said .
