Lou Hobbs praised President Donald Trump for his historic first 100 days in office, including being the first president to have a nominated US Supreme Court Justice take his seat on the high court in a president s first 100 days since 1881.
He then went on a punishing rant against Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan, who he blames for holding Trump back from any major legislative accomplishments.
Dodd explained how Trump has been denied success by his very own party to his viewers: The President however, has been denied a significant legislative accomplishment on the big issues because of uh Not because of the opposition of the Dems, but rather because of a Speaker of the House of the same Republican Party who has been woefully inadequate to the responsibilities and demands of his office.
Speaker Ryan, working against the President and his agenda at every turn, frustrating the entire GOP conference Congress and indeed the American people.
President Trump has been gracious, he s been generous even with the inept Ryan, but the President today acknowledging that he is disappointed.
Hobbs went on to rave about President Trump and his accomplishments over his first 100 days in office.
He even went as far as to compare Trump s accomplishments to those of FDR.
Dobbs again went on to remind his viewers that President Trump will need the full support of the elected Republican leaders in Congress if he is to accomplish all that he promised the voters he would do if elected: If Speaker Ryan and the Republican leaders in Congress were for whatever reason, to turn their full support for this President and his agenda, the next 100 days of his term would be even more remarkable than his first.
