WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW:In all 50 state capitals and the District of Columbia, electors chosen by the state parties of the candidate who carried their state, Trump or Hillary Clinton will meet to cast their ballots.
There s no national meeting of the Electoral College.
Instead, electors gather in each state usually in the Capitol.Under federal law, though, electors must gather on December 19.
And each elector must sign six copies certifying their votes for president and vice president.Two ballots go to the National Archives.
One goes to the president of the Senate.
Two go to their state s chief elections officer.
And one goes to a local judge.
After Monday s votes, there is still one last step: On January 6, Congress has to officially count the electoral votes.
Vice President Joe Biden will preside over the count.
Lawmakers can technically object in writing, with objections signed by at least one House and one Senate member to individual electoral votes or entire states results.
If the House and Senate support that objection, the vote or votes in question are thrown out.
But that has never happened.
After the votes are counted, the results are final, and Trump is officially set for his inauguration at noon on January 20.Read more: CNN
