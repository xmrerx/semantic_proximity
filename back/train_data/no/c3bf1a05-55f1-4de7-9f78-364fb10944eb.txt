tonight , 9pm et .
msnbc . ( seriously ) .
rachel maddow msnbc ( @ maddow ) march 14 , 2017speaking on background , a white house official said , you know you are desperate for ratings when you are willing to violate the law to push a story about two pages of tax returns from over a decade ago .
before being elected president , mr. trump was one of the most successful businessmen in the world with a responsibility to his company , his family and his employees to pay no more tax than legally required , the official continued .
that being said , mr. trump paid $ 38 million dollars even after taking into account large scale depreciation for construction , on an income of more than $ 150 million dollars , as well as paying tens of millions of dollars in other taxes such as sales and excise taxes and employment taxes and this illegally published return proves just that .
despite this substantial income figure and tax paid , it is totally illegal to steal and publish tax returns .
the dishonest media can continue to make this part of their agenda , while the president will focus on his , which includes tax reform that will benefit all americans .
