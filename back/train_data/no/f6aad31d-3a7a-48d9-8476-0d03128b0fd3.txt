istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish police said on thursday they had rescued thousands of artefacts dating back to anatolian , greek and egyptian civilizations in the largest operation to combat smuggling of ancient treasures in the country s history .
among the items recovered were a golden queen s crown with an inscription of the hellenistic god , helios , a bust dedicated to alexander the great s conquest of india and a statue of a goddess dating back to the hittite era 3,000 years ago .
the 26,456 objects recovered also included egyptian-origin statues and phoenician-type teardrop vials .
the retrieved artefacts are ... more valuable than the artefacts in the inventory of an average size museum , istanbul police said in a statement .
for three months the investigation , dubbed operation zeus , tracked the smuggling ring , which aimed to take the artefacts abroad and sell them to museums and collectors for millions of dollars , it said .
six people involved in the ring were detained on dec. 12 in turkey s northwestern province of duzce as they attempted to sell off some of their haul .
seven more were detained in four different provinces .
