sydney ( reuters ) - australia has discovered the wreck of its first submarine off the coast of papua new guinea , authorities said on thursday , resolving one of the country s oldest naval mysteries after more than a century .
the submarine , ae-1 , was the first allied vessel to sink during world war one , while patrolling for german warships in 1914 , in circumstances that have never been established .
the australian navy and several private bodies found the final resting place of the vessel s 35 crew on their 13th attempt , defence minister marise payne told media .
the submarine s disappearance was a tragedy for our then fledgling nation , payne said , adding that a small commemorative service was held aboard the survey ship that found the wreck and authorities were trying to contact the crew s descendants .
it is my hope that what we have done in the last couple of days will now provide relief to the family and descendants of all of those members , said navy chief vice admiral timmy barrett , adding that the crew had come from australia , britain and new zealand .
the authorities did not disclose the wreck s location , except to say it was found off the duke of york islands .
the governments of australia and papua new guinea said they planned to preserve the site .
