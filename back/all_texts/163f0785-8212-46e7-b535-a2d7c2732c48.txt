Senate Minority Leader Schumer and House Minority Leader Pelosi are having a temper tantrum after President Trump exposed them for who they really are in a scorching tweet:PRESIDENT TRUMP S TWEET: Meeting with Chuck and Nancy today about keeping government open and working.
Problem is they want illegal immigrants flooding into our Country unchecked, are weak on Crime and want to substantially RAISE Taxes.
I don t see a deal!Meeting with Chuck and Nancy today about keeping government open and working.

CHUCK AND NANCY CAN T HANDLE THE TRUTH!They released a joint statement on Tuesday saying they were not playing They were taking their ball and going home like a couple of toddlers.
Were they EVER in the budget game to make any reasonable compromise?
We think they asked for unreasonable things that Trump just couldn t pull the trigger on.
Amnesty for Dreamers could be one of those things.
We don t have details but we re thinking it s why Trump tweeted about one borders.A portion of the statement reads: Given that the President doesn t see a deal between Democrats and the White House, we believe the best path forward is to continue negotiating with our Republican counterparts in Congress instead.
Rather than going to the White House for a show meeting that won t result in an agreement, we ve asked Leader McConnell and Speaker Ryan to meet this afternoon, THE TWEET IS THE TRUTH It s about time someone called these two out for putting Americans last!
