WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. budget chief Mick Mulvaney on Tuesday told staff at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to “disregard” instructions from Leandra English, the deputy director, according to a memo.
“Consistent with my email from yesterday, please disregard any email sent by, or instructions you receive from, Ms. English when she is purporting to act as the Acting Director,” Mulvaney wrote in an email to staff Tuesday morning.
Mulvaney and English, the agency’s deputy director, are in a legal fight over who should control the agency following the Friday resignation of Director Richard Cordray.
