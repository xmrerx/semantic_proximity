berlin ( reuters ) - germany s departing finance minister expressed optimism that his country s democratic institutions were strong enough to withstand the arrival of the far-right alternative for germany ( afd ) as the third-largest party in parliament .
wolfgang schaueble , who is due to step down as finance minister to become president of the bundestag parliament , told the newspaper bild am sonntag that afd s 90-odd elected lawmakers would be constrained by germany s constitution .
i d like to see more self-confidence , he told the newspaper in an interview published on tuesday .
our free , democratic system based on the rule of law is so strong that nobody can wreck it , neither from within nor from without .
anybody who tries will fail .
the 75-year-old conservative took his new job at the urging of chancellor angela merkel .
her conservatives are trying to patch together a three-way coalition with the greens and the pro-business free democrats , who are expected to demand the position of finance minister .
also , many in germany s mainstream felt a senior politician was needed to rein in the first far-right party to enter parliament in 50 years .
schaueble is germany s longest-serving parliamentarian , and his stature is second only to merkel s in german politics .
but schaueble said he was ready to move on : i decided before the elections after eight years as finance minister and many years government responsibility to take on a new task .
he added he was confident that a three-party coalition would be agreed , dismissing arguments about a formal cap on immigration as a false argument .
he defended merkel s 2015 decision to open germany s borders to over a million migrants fleeing war in africa and the middle east .
even our children will remember with pride the willingness to help that the germans showed during the refugee crisis , he told the paper .
