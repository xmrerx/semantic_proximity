as a college student , i know first-hand how quick liberals are to attack someone for expressing a political opinion that is different from their own .
this is another one of the many examples of the hate young conservatives endure for simply doing what they believe is right.a twitter user out of wyoming with the handle makenna_mg posted the pictures on wednesday and they proceeded to go mega-viral.makenna , a girl from wyoming posted pictures of herself cleaning graffiti off of trump s star and was subsequently berated for her respect for the president .
i m guessing her looks were also triggering to some of the angry girlsstopped to clean @ realdonaldtrump hollywood star .
nothing but respect for my president .

politics aside it 's sad that our country criticizes and taunts a young lady who did what she thought was right .
