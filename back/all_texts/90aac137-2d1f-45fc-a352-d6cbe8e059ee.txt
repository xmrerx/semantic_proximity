The Westboro Baptist Church doesn t leave much room for dissension among its ranks, so when a Phelps family member speaks on an issue, you can pretty well assume that their sentiment mirrors that of the entire cult.
That s what makes the conversation The Daily Caller had with Lee Ann Phelps, whose husband Timothy is the late Fred Phelps son, all the more interesting.
Talking politics at all with a cult family that hates everyone is typically a pointless endeavor, but in this case something stuck out that is just too good to pass up.Phelps said she couldn t support Donald Trump for president because he is too fringe.
Yes, you read that right.
Still, you ll want to take a deep breath and prepare yourself for the laughter that is undoubtedly making its way to the surface when you read it again: Donald Trump is too fringe for the Westboro Baptist Church.
The same cult that pickets just about anything imaginable with such incendiary slogans as God Hates F*gs and America Is Doomed thinks that Trump is too far out there on too many issues to be considered for the presidency.According to Merriam-Webster, fringe means: Not part of the mainstream; unconventional, peripheral, or extreme.
There is nothing in America more unconventional, peripheral or extreme than the Westboro Baptist Church.
At least there used to be nothing that compared.
Now we have a failed businessman masquerading as a success declaring racism and hate to be what will make America great again.
You could almost wager that if you were to ask just about anyone who their guess would be for a WBC endorsement, Donald Trump would win hands down.While she says she isn t voting, Phelps has declined to weigh in on the Democratic candidates at all.Featured image from Wikimedia
