mumbai ( reuters ) - rescuers in the indian city of mumbai wound down on friday their search for victims in the ruins of a condemned building that collapsed , after pulling 12 survivors and 34 bodies from the rubble , emergency services said .
the 117-year-old , six storey-building in a congested old neighborhood came crashing down early on thursday after heavy rain had drenched the financial hub for days .
rescue operations are in a demobilization phase .
two fire appliances and one ambulance will be on standby at site as a precautionary measure , said p. s. rahangdale , chief fire officer of the mumbai fire brigade .
among the dead was a 20-day old baby , police said .
the collapse was the second in mumbai in little over a month .
in july , 17 people were killed when a four-storey building came down after suspected unauthorized renovations .
the cause of the latest collapse was not known but it came after several days of torrential rainy-season downpours that flooded parts of the city .
devendra fadnavis , the chief minister of maharashtra state , of which mumbai is the capital , ordered an inquiry .
the building had been declared unsafe by the housing regulator in 2011 but many people had stayed on living here .
neighbors said developers tasked with renovating properties in the area had not provided enough information about options for temporary housing .
officials from the housing regulator told media they had granted a neighborhood trust with the right to redevelop the building and provide temporary housing to residents .
the trust issued a statement on thursday saying it had started relocating residents , and had moved seven families in 2014 , but other residents had refused to leave .
