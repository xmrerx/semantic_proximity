we can t wait for next year s midterm elections !
this will be a huge chance for republicans to build a bigger majority in the senate.the senate map heavily favors republicans who look solid except for a couple seats .
democrats don t have it so good .
they ll have to defend 25 seats ! here are the seven most vulnerable senate seats according to the hill : sen. dean heller ( r-nev. ) heller is the only republican up for reelection in 2018 who represents a state that hillary clinton won last november .
making matters worse for heller , he s had a rough 2017.sen .
claire mccaskill ( d-mo . )
mccaskill is one of the few statewide democratic officeholders left in missouri , which trump won by 19 points in november.sen .
joe donnelly ( d-ind . )
donnelly leveraged a bipartisan approach to politics and his blue-collar appeal into a senate seat in 2012 , but he ll have to fight yet another tough battle if he wants to keep his senate seat in a state trump won by 19 points.sen .
jeff flake ( r-ariz. ) flake wouldn t rank this high in a normal election year , but a republican president threatening to support a primary challenge to an incumbent gop senator isn t normal , either.sen .
joe manchin ( d-w.va. ) in 2016 , west virginia went for trump by a larger margin than any other state 42 points.sen .
heidi heitkamp ( d-n.d. ) heitkamp hails from another deep-red state north dakota went for trump by about 36 points.sen .
jon tester ( d-mont . )
republicans have a lot to like about their montana prospects .
trump won the state by more than 20 points in november , and republican greg gianforte just won the state s at-large congressional seat in a special election even after he assaulted a reporter .
