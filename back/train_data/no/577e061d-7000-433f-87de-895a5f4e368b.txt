this is what happens when a nation puts liberalism before their own children.the 20 minute video , apparently created by the 16 year old facebook user miss wilhailm , starts with her saying that she is , so scared everywhere , for example if my family and i go out together , or if i see a movie with my friends .
usually i stay out until 6pm in winter , and it is so scary .
it is just very hard to live day-to-day as a woman .
the girl who some social media users report has now been banned from facebook , though others say she has removed herself then goes on to talk about an incident that happened to her at a local supermarket saying , i ran all the way home .
i was frightened for my life .
there s no other way to describe it .
she talks about her experiences over summer , when a group of muslims said that her and her friends were sluts for walking outside in t-shirts .
yes , we were wearing t-shirts .
it s summer !
she adds : another day , i was wearing this .
my friend and i purchased it while shopping .
if we feel like wearing it , we will wear it !
and you muslims have no right to physically assault or rape us for it !
god willing , never in my life .
you have no right to attack us because we are wearing t-shirts .
you also have no right to rape .miss wilhailm then turns toward what she sees on social media , describing how she has seen , a 17 year old attacked , a 15 year old attacked , two 12 year olds attacked , so many , and questions , why should we , children , have to grow up in such fear ?
i can not understand why they do this .
but more importantly , i can not understand why germany is doing nothing !
why is germany standing by , watching , and then doing nothing ?
please explain , why .
men of germany , these people are killing your children , they are killing your women .
we need your protection , she goes on to say adding , the politicians live alone in their villas , drink their cocktails , and do nothing .
they do nothing !
i do not know what world they live in , but please , people , please help us !
please , do something !
continuing , miss wilhailm tells of her own personal experiences with arab and muslims migrants saying , one day , my friend and i were walking down the street , and a group of arabs were protesting and demonstrating .
they shouted , allah !
allah !
allah is the one god !
kill those infidels !
allah allah !
what should i do ?
should i wear a burka ?
why should i have to convert to islam ?
it s fine if you believe in allah , but why do you want to make everyone else believe in allah too ?
i just think it would be better if there were no religion .
stop trying to make everyone else believe in your god when they do not want to .according to the her experiences , the police are no help .
she alleges , they say it is a problem and they ignore it .
it is unfair .
they laugh at us .
they say we are dumb , and that , they don t care about our fears .
this description matches many other cases where police have been afraid to be labeled as racist for taking a hard line on migrant crime and even victims of migrant crime have been accused of racism for speaking up.free market liberal group freiheitliche aufklaerung or liberal education posted the video on their facebook group page and made the following comment when it disappeared from miss wilhailm s page : how many have already noticed the video you make germany broken !
is no longer there .
in this video , the 16-year-old girl said that she now is afraid to go out alone and that they can not understand the insane asylum policy of the german government .
europe and germany are thus ruined unfortunately , we live in a social dictatorship , in what critics of the establishment and its illiberal policies are tackled and accosted in the strongest terms .
the group claims it doesn t have evidence , but says it can not rule out a censorship by facebook 100 % .breitbart london understands from facebook that while the matter has not been fully investigated yet , the usual reason for videos disappearing are down to the user taking them down themselves.the censorship fears come after facebook announced last year that they would help the german government monitor for hate speech and as recently as this month chancellor angela merkel s government has demanded facebook remove posts and videos in the wake of the cologne sex attacks .
the company has not yet responded to breitbart london s request for comment on the matter.the video ends with a stark message for german chancellor angela merkel : thank you , angela merkel , for killing germany !
i have no more respect for you , merkel .
i do not think you know what you have done .
you do not see how our lives have changed .
open your eyes !
is this normal ?
should i , a 16-year old who is almost 17 , be so scared to walk outside my house ?
no , it is not normal .
you have killed germany !
she closes : men please help your women .
help your children .
i am so scared .
my friends have the same fears .
we are shocked that this has happened .
i hope this video can convince you , and that these terrible events can stop .
https : //youtu.be/-bcrl8kdrditranscript : hello , you can read the newspapers but this video is about the real situation in germany .
i would like to tell everyone about this on youtube and facebook .
i am almost 16 .
i would like everyone to know what is going on , what i am authentically feeling at this moment.and i am so scared everywhere .
for example , if my family and i go out together , or if i see a movie with my friends .
usually i stay at home , but sometimes i stay out until 6 pm in winter , and it is so scary .
it is just very hard to live day-to-day life as a woman.i just want to say that i am not a racist .
but one day , a terrible thing happened at the supermarket .
i ran all the way home .
i was so frightened for my life .
there s no other way to describe it.my aunt and her friend have said you have to grow up .
why should we , children , have to grow up in such fear ?
it s not just me , my friends too .
you can see on facebook , a 17 year old attacked , a 15 year old attacked , two 12-year olds attacked , so many .
it is really so sad that this is happening because of you people .
i can not understand why they do this .
but more importantly , i can not understand why germany is doing nothing !
why is germany standing by , watching , and then doing nothing ?
please explain , why .
men of germany , these people are killing your children , they are killing your women .
we need your protection .
we are so scared , we don t want to be frightened to go to the grocery store alone after sunset .
the politicians live alone in their villas , drink their cocktails , and do nothing .
they do nothing !
i do not know what world they live in , but please , people , please help us !
please , do something !
i can not understand why this is happening .
one day , my friend and i were walking down the street , and a group of arabs were protesting and demonstrating .
they shouted , allah !
allah !
allah is the one god !
kill those infidels !
allah allah !
what should i do ?
should i wear a burka ?
why should i have to convert to islam ? it s fine if you believe in allah , but why do you want to make everyone else believe in allah too ?
i just think it would be better if there were no religion .
stop trying to make everyone else believe in your god when they do not want to.please , people of germany .
do something ! when i try to tell the authorities about what has happened , they hold their hand up towards me and they say it is a problem and then ignore it .
and they laugh .
it is unfair .
they laugh at us .
they say we are dumb .
they think this not only of me , but of the entire state of germany .
they don t care about our fear .
please help us .
this is an emergency !
there are more and more of them.one time in summer , the muslims said we were sluts for walking outside in a t-shirt.yes , we were wearing t-shirts .
it s summer ! another day , i was wearing this .
my friend and i purchased it while shopping hehe .
if we feel like wearing it , we will wear it !
and you muslims have no right to physically assault or rape us for it !
god willing , never in my life .
you have no right to attack us because we are wearing t-shirts .
you also have no right to rape.the life of germany has changed because these people can not integrate .
we give them so much help .
we support them financially and they do not have to work .
but they only want more babies and more welfare and more money .
men of germany , please , patrol the streets and protect us .
do this for your women and your children .
if you do that , i believe that we will have a chance.this sort of action would be wonderful .
we would be so grateful and thankful .
so many thanks , if steadily , more men would come to protect us .
we are so scared.i am so upset about what merkel has done.thank you , angela merkel , for killing germany !
i have no more respect for you , merkel .
i do not think you know what you have done .
you do not see how our lives have changed .
open your eyes !
is this normal ?
should i , a 16-year old who is almost 17 , be so scared to walk outside my house ?
no , it is not normal .
you have killed germany ! this is the truth .
we are no longer allowed to walk outside .
we are no longer allowed to wear our clothes .
we are no longer allowed to live the german life .
this is the sad truth.i think it s about time to end this video .
i believe i have given a full account from a normal person .
i hope others can see this and understand.i only want to end with one message : men , please , help your women .
help your children .
i am so scared .
my friends have the same fear .
we are shocked that this has happened .
i hope this video can convince you , and that this terrible events can stop.via : breitbart news
