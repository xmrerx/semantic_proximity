ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - The conversations U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions had last year with Russia’s ambassador were not related to his role advising the Trump campaign but solely to his work as a U.S. senator, the White House said on Thursday.
“He was clearly conducting himself as a United States senator,” White House spokesman Sean Spicer told reporters aboard Air Force One.
“This is what senators do.”
