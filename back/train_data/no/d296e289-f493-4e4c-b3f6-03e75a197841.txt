( reuters ) - u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump said on friday he will attend a fox news televised debate on march 3 with moderator megyn kelly after he skipped a similar event hosted by fox last week , an online and cable television network reported on friday .
“ no , i ’ ll be there .
i have no objection to being there .
that had nothing to do with megyn kelly the fact that i went out of the last one , it had to do with a memo that was sent out by fox that was a little bit taunting and i said it was inappropriate , ” trump said on newsmaxtv.com .
he added that he had no regrets about missing the jan. 28 debate in des moines , iowa just days before the iowa caucuses , the first nominating contest of the 2016 campaign , at which he came in second after texas senator ted cruz .
“ and what happened , because i didn ’ t do it i raised $ 6 million for the vets .
so , i wouldn ’ t have changed places .
i did the right thing , ” he said on “ the steve malzberg show. ” trump said last week he was angered by a statement from fox news ( foxa.o ) that mocked him for refusing to participate in the des moines event .
the real estate billionaire had said earlier he doubted he would be treated fairly at the des moines debate and at one point called kelly “ a lightweight reporter ” and “ highly overrated. ” he later said fox news had apologized for the statement and that the situation had been resolved .
trump accused kelly last august of asking him tougher questions than other candidates during a debate .
his comments drew outcry , with some accusing the business tycoon of sexism .
