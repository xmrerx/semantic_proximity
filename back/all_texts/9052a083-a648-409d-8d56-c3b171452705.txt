BERLIN (Reuters) - Angela Merkel s conservatives are ready to make further concessions on reducing coal emissions to salvage talks with two smaller parties on forming a coalition government, an ally of the German chancellor said on Thursday.
Volker Kauder, parliamentary leader of Merkel s conservatives, said the conservatives, Greens and the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) could still seal a deal this weekend despite deep differences on climate and migration.
Despite the big stumbling blocks I believe it could work, Kauder told reporters.
I feel readiness by all sides and everyone has to make concessions.
And I believe that the exploratory talks must end this weekend.
