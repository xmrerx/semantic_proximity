( reuters ) - kentucky ’ s republican governor matt bevin has filed a lawsuit asking a judge to close an abortion clinic in lexington , saying it was operating without a license .
the lawsuit filed in fayette circuit court on wednesday alleges that the emw women ’ s clinic was unsanitary , maintained expired medication on the site and does not have an adequate agreement to transfer patients to a hospital in case of an emergency , according to court documents .
a call placed to the clinic was not immediately returned .
the lexington clinic is one of three in kentucky that provide abortions , according to local media .
the lexington herald leader said that the governor ’ s office filed a lawsuit last month against planned parenthood , saying it did not have the proper license to perform abortions at its louisville clinic .
planned parenthood has responded that it does have the proper licensing under an agreement with the former governor , the herald leader reported .
according to this week ’ s lawsuit , filed on behalf of the commonwealth of kentucky and the state health service , and signed by the governor ’ s general counsel , emw women ’ s clinic does not provide any care other than abortions , and therefore needs a specific type of license that it does not have .
bevin ran for governor on an anti-abortion platform and in february signed an informed consent law that requires women to consult with a doctor before having an abortion .
