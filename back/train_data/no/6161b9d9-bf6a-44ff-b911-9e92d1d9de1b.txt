great update !
three weeks after hampshire college removed the american flag from campus , the stars and stripes was raised again on friday morning at the liberal arts school in amherst.the flag s return comes after a torrent of calls , e-mails , and protests from people angered by its removal eight days after it was set on fire in an apparent protest of the election of donald trump as president .
i ve received many e-mails , a lot of them extremely unpleasant , hampshire college president jonathan lash said by telephone on thursday night .
our phone lines have been clogged with people calling to express their anger .
people can disagree with us , but we ve also received very explicit threats .
for us , we raise the flag as a symbol of our hopes for justice , fairness and freedom , lash said .
i hope this is not the end of the dialogue about these issues .
the underlying issues are very important for the country .
