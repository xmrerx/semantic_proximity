ed klein : for the past 100 years every president who is outgoing has packed up his stuff gone home and not criticized his successor .
this is not what the obamas are planning to do .
they rented an eight-bedroom mansion in the section of washington near joe lockhart , bill clinton s last press secretary .
in that house there s enough room for valerie jarrett and michelle and the kids .
a place for ten cars to park .
they are setting up what they are calling a shadow government.pete hegseth : the obamas claim it is because the children want to stay in d.c .. ed klein : that s not the real reason they are staying there .
they are staying there because despite what the president said in his press conference , he s in a sense of outrage over this incoming trump administration , which he thinks is going to wipe out his legacy .
so he s setting up this kind of almost insurgency , picking people in foreign affairs , labor , abortion , union matters and setting them up to start appearing on television , making speeches and doing op-ed pieces for next four years , you re going to see not only a trump administration but you re going to see a shadow government opposing the trump klein said it was an insurgency by the left starting on inauguration day with the mass demonstrations organized by michael moore .
