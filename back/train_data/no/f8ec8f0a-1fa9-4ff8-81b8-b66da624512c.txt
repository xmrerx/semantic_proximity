seoul ( reuters ) - south korea president moon jae-in said he hoped a visit by u.s president donald trump would be a turning point in efforts to defuse tensions over north korea s nuclear program as the two leaders met in seoul on tuesday .
the state visit in the south korean capital was billed as an opportunity for trump and moon to present a united front , despite differences over how to confront north korea s nuclear threat , as well as trump s complaints over the two countries trade agreements .
besides vowing to prevent north korean leader kim jong un from developing nuclear weapons and missiles that can effectively strike the mainland united states , trump has also threatened to pull out of a free trade pact between the two countries .
