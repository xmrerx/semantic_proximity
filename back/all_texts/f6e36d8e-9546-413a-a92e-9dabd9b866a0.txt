Is it not enough that Hillary has compromised our national security with her unsecured email server that contained top classified security emails?
In her rush to prove how much more she knows that Donald J. Trump when it comes to national security, Hillary just committed treason when she revealed damning information that could compromise the safety and security of our nation Is this treasonous, loose cannon the person Democrats want representing our nation simply because it s her turn or because she has the proper genitalia?
She s been accused during sworn testimony of disrespecting security agents and putting them in danger.She abaonded her friend Ambassador Chris Stevens and left him to the Islamists who slaughtered him in Benghazi.Tonight during the final presidential debate Hillary Clinton leaked more national security secrets.Hillary said it took four minutes between the nuclear order and nukes flying.
GPCareless Hillary told the WORLD the US 'Nuclear Response' Time!!
REALLY?
