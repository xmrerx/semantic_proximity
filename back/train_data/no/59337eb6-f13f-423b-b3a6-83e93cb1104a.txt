president donald trump s pick for secretary of labor , andrew puzder , has withdrawn from the nomination just hours before his first scheduled appearance before the senate help committee.puzder s nomination was controversial from the start because of some of his own business practices that many felt were less than generous .
he officially withdrew after an interview his ex-wife , lisa fierstein , did on the oprah winfrey show came to light .
she claimed that she had to flee from her , then husband , and that she had been abused by puzder during their marriage.https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=curhgcbswocfierstein has since admitted that her allegations were false and that she concocted them to get a better settlement in their divorce .
she has also sent a letter to the senate in an attempt to clear her ex-husband s name but it seems to be too little too late.puzder released this statement concerning his withdrawal.i am withdrawing my nomination for secretary of labor .
i 'm honored to have been considered and am grateful to all who have supported me .
