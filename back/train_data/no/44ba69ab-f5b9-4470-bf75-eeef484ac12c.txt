prof michel chossudovsky global reaseachthe media has failed to address the confrontation between the u.s. state department and the joint chiefs of staff.the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff general joseph francis dunford ( image , left ) has warned both the us senate as well secretary of state john kerry in no uncertain terms that a no fly zone over syria would lead to war with both syria and russia , intimating a dangerous process of military escalation.in a senate arms services committee hearing , dunford said , responding to questions from republican senator roger whicker ( mississippi ) : right now , senator , for us to control all of the airspace in syria it would require us to go to war , against syria and russia that s a pretty fundamental decision that certainly i m not going to make .
( senate armed services committee , september 22 , 2016 , emphasis added ) at the third presidential debate , hillary clinton reasserted her commitment that if elected president , she would implement a no-fly-zone , intimating that the objective was to save lives : i think a no-fly zone could save lives and could hasten the end of the conflict .
i am well aware of the really legitimate concerns you have expressed from both the president and the general , clinton said in response to a question from fox news debate moderator chris wallace .
this would not be done just on the first day .

confirmed by the leaked emails michele flournoy is a crony of the clintons .
she has called for limited military coercion to help remove assad from power in syria , including a no bombing zone over parts of syria held by u.s.-backed rebels .
this is tantamount to a no fly zone to protect the terrorists including isis daesh from actions by syrian and russian forces.according to defense one : flournoy did not deny the entire report that she favors increased u.s. intervention ; for instance , she acknowledged her support for u.s. strikes using standoff weapons to retaliate against syrian military targets to enforce the no-bomb zone continue this article at global researchread more hillary news at : 21st century wire clinton files
