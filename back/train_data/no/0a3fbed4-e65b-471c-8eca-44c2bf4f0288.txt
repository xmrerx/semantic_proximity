manila ( reuters ) - ride-hailing platforms uber [ uber.ul ] and grab have agreed to stop their drivers from delivering unchecked packages on behalf of customers , in response to government concerns they could unwittingly become couriers of illegal drugs .
the decision followed an advisory from the philippine drug enforcement agency ( pdea ) about some illicit drugs in packages reportedly being delivered via the ride-hailing services .
president rodrigo duterte s 15-month-old administration has been waging a brutal war on drugs , the centerpiece of his election campaign , with thousands of people killed during what police say are anti-narcotics operations .
duterte insists narcotics are at the root of the country s rampant crime problem and says as many as four million filipinos are using drugs .
uber and grab representatives who met this week with officials of pdea and the land transportation franchising and regulatory board ( ltfrb ) said they would order drivers not to take unchecked packages without passengers .
uber services here are for passengers only , yves gonzales , in charge of government relations and public policy at uber philippines , said during the meeting , in comments aired on news channel anc on friday .
leo gonzales , grab philippines public affairs head , sought an assurance that grab drivers would not be penalized by the regulator for refusing customers who wanted packages to be delivered .
its delivery service , grab express , would require customers to open the packages and show the contents to drivers first , then complete identification forms , anc reported .
the ltfrb said in a statement it would make drug testing mandatory for all drivers of public utility vehicles and ride-hailing services , and would ban those showing positive results .
representatives of uber and grab did not immediately respond to requests for comment .
