Federal law says that presidential recounts must be completed within 35 days after an election.
Stein waited until 90 minutes before the Wisconsin deadline for filing a recount petition expired.All the votes have to be certified by December 13 according to a report on Friday.
The electors meet on December 19.Wisconsin will almost certainly miss that deadline, since the last recount took more than a month.
And that recount was for a state Supreme Court contest where only 1.5 million votes were cast.If Wisconsin misses the December 19 deadline, the electoral votes may not be counted.Stein is going to ask for a hand recount, which will slow the process even further.If Wisconsin s electoral votes are excluded on December 19, the state will then have to try and get Congress to include the votes in the January 6 count.They're not looking for fraud.
They're seeking to delay the counting of the votes so that Trump won't have 270 on December 13. https://t.co/paDfPkY3hb Thomas Wictor (@ThomasWictor) November 27, 2016They can't steal 100,000+ votes.
They don't even have to.
All they need to do is stall the electoral vote count for two weeks.

If so, it ll be up to Congress to decide whether they include the votes or not.
Gateway PunditYou're letting them distract you.
IT ISN'T THE VOTES.
The goal is to the nullify the electoral votes by making the states miss the deadline.
