warsaw ( reuters ) - poland wants the euro zone to become stronger before making a decision whether to join the single currency , finance minister mateusz morawiecki said .
we are holding our fingers crossed for the euro zone to survive , to overcome its imminent problems ...
surely , the convergence is not happening as the authors wished it , morawiecki , who is also deputy prime minister , told journalists .
we would like the euro area to be strong and then in a few years will see how it copes with everything .
the statement suggests a softening towards the euro zone membership by the eurosceptic law and justice ( pis ) party that came to power two years ago .
although he declined to say when poland could start thinking about membership , on friday , he told an economic forum that he is not an opponent of introducing the euro currency in poland , but the time is not right yet .
let s wait five to 10 years , he said .
the pis government has said previously that the flexibility of a national exchange rate has helped the country in difficult times .
earlier this year , morawiecki said at an economic forum that it remained to be seen if euro zone was going to be a part of the problem or part of the solution for the eu .
according to various polls , more than two thirds of poles oppose joining the euro area .
