UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Iran rejected as unfounded a U.S. accusation on Thursday that it supplied a missile fired at Saudi Arabia from Yemen on Nov. 4, describing weaponry displayed by U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley as fabricated.
Iran s mission to the United Nations said in a statement that the accusation by the United States was irresponsible, provocative and destructive.
These accusations seek also to cover up for the Saudi war crimes in Yemen, with the U.S. complicity, and divert international and regional attention from the stalemate war of aggression against the Yemenis, the statement said.
