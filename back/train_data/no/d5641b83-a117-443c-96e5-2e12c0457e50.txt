istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish president tayyip erdogan said on tuesday the country s military operation in northwest syria s idlib province was largely completed but the neighbouring region of afrin , controlled by a kurdish militia , remained an issue .
turkey s army began setting up observation posts in idlib this month under a deal with russia and iran to reduce fighting between insurgents and the syrian government , but the deployment was also seen partly aimed at containing the ypg militia .
erdogan was speaking in parliament to members of his ruling ak party .
