On Sunday, during a panel segment on CNN s State of the Union, former MTV Real World reality TV star and Trump surrogate Rachel Campos-Duffy, tried her best to spin the recent #TacoTrucksOnEveryCorner mega-gaffe.
Her efforts received laughter from the other panelists, with Clinton surrogate Bakari Sellers remarking that they had never seen spin like that.
In case you missed it, Latinos for Trump founder Marco Gutierrez warned that if we did not do something to stop illegal immigration and elect Hillary Clinton we will have taco trucks on every corner.Here s how Campos-Duffy tried to spin the narrative: What I think is really interesting is that taco trucks really are the ultimate symbol of American entrepreneurial capitalism.
And I think what people want to know is not what some first-time surrogate fumbled, what they want to know about is who is going to help people who want to start taco trucks.
Campos-Duffy then went on to say: And liberal policies have always over-regulated food trucks.
What people want to know is who is going to help people start businesses, let them grow, become financially independent.
Liberals over-regulate these kinds of small business owners and conservatives help them achieve their dreams.
Excellent pivot, Jake Tapper remarked.Trump surrogate Andre Bauer was, believe it or not, quite fond of the analogy.
Those are people that are business owners, they re working hard.
We just don t want the people here that are stealing the hubcaps.
Which, as Tapper pointed out was not at all what Gutierrez meant when he made the gaffe.You can watch the segment below.
