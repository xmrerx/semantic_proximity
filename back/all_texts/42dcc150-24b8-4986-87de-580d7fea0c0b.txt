By now, we all know that House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes has turned tail and gone off on what his fellow GOPer in the Senate, Lindsey Graham (R-SC) calls an Inspector Clouseau investigation.
In other words, Nunes is a bumbling idiot and a stooge for the Trump White House when it comes to investigating ties between officials from Donald Trump s presidential campaign and Russia during the 2016 presidential election.Well, it now seems that Nunes (R-CA) might have a bit of a problem come 2018.
Star Trek star and wildly popular LGBTQ rights activist George Takei is running for Congress against Nunes.
The endeavor was largely secret, until Takei and his husband were found out as they started scoping out property to buy in Nunes s red district.
Takei says of the move: Well, I guess the jig is up.
With what is going on now in the country, I couldn t stand by any longer merely as a citizen.
I knew I had to take a bigger stand.
So that s why I m running for Congress.
My hope is to challenge Davin Nunes for his seat in 2018.
I think Nunes is vulnerable.
And I plan to prove that.
People are tired of his ass-kissing of Trump.
Can I say that?
I think I can.
These days you can say pretty much anything and not get in trouble.
I want to be a champion for all people, but especially those whose voices are not heard often in the halls of Congress.
We need to build a majority again in Congress, too, to be a check against the Trump Administration s excesses, assuming he s even around by then to keep making horrific mistakes.
