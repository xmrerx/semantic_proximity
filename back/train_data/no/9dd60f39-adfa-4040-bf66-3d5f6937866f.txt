gaza ( reuters ) - hamas security chief in the gaza strip was wounded in a car bombing on friday in what the islamist group called a failed assassination attempt .
the attack came as rival factions are trying to implement a new agreement meant to end a 10-year rift that has effectively split the palestinian territories between hamas in gaza and the more mainstream fatah in the occupied west bank .
tawfeeq abu naeem , hamas head of security in gaza and a strong supporter of the reconciliation deal , was lightly wounded when his car exploded outside a mosque , hamas said in a statement .
hamas , which has been quick to blame israel for similar attacks in the past , did not say who it believed was behind the bombing , suggesting it could also be the work of a radical jihadist salafi group that opposes the palestinian rapprochement .
asked about the explosion in gaza , israel s military said it did not comment on foreign reports .
hamas has stepped up a security campaign against salafi groups and recently detained a senior operative .
hamas also has improved ties with egypt , which is battling islamist groups across the border in the sinai peninsula .
some disputes arose this week in implementing the reconciliation deal .
senior fatah officials traveled to gaza this week from the west bank to take control of two government offices there , but they turned back , saying hamas officials refused their authority .
a fatah spokesman later said the issue was being resolved .
