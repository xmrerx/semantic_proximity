SAN SALVADOR (Reuters) - Former Salvadoran President Armando Calderon, who helped oversee the Central American country s transition from a bloody civil war to peace in the 1990s, has died at the age of 69 after a battle with cancer, his family said on Monday.
Calderon, who was president from 1994 to 1999 as the reconstruction of the divided country took hold, died around midnight in a hospital in Houston where he was admitted in critical condition with an undisclosed form of cancer.
El Salvador s 1980-1992 civil war, which pitted a U.S.-backed right-wing government against the leftist guerilla Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN), claimed some 75,000 lives and left around another 8,000 people missing.
A founder of the powerful, right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance (Arena), Calderon as president ushered in a string of business-friendly economic reforms including a privatization of the telecoms sector and the pension system.
El Salvador s Supreme Court of Justice in 2016 ordered an investigation into Calderon s fortune on suspicion of illicit enrichment.
The former president, who was also mayor of San Salvador between 1988 and 1994, rejected the accusations.
