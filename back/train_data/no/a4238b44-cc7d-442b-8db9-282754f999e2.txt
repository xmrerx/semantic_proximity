minsk ( reuters ) - belarus s kgb state security service said on monday it had uncovered a spy ring working for the ukrainian defence ministry that had been set up by a detained ukrainian radio correspondent .
minsk-based journalist pavlo sharoyko was arrested in october and charged with being an undercover intelligence officer , kgb spokesman dmitry pobyarzhin said in a briefing .
in belarus , sharoyko built a network of agents made up of belarussian citizens , who carried out his assignments for monetary compensation , pobyarzhin said .
an adviser to the embassy in minsk , ukrainian ihor skvortsov , has been declared persona non grata - banned from the country - as he is believed to be sharoyko s handler , pobyarzhin said .
the ukrainian defence ministry denied the allegations against sharoyko who it said had worked as a spokesman for the ministry before switching to journalism in 2009 .
the information contained in the ( kgb ) statement is not true , it said .
the ukrainian foreign ministry declined immediate comment .
sharoyko and skvortsov could not be reached for comment .
the case could put further pressure on relations between minsk and kiev that were tested earlier this year when belarus hosted large-scale joint military exercises with russia .
september s zapad-2017 ( west-2017 ) war games unnerved ukraine and nato member states on europe s eastern flank , which feared the exercises could be a rehearsal or cover for a real offensive .
