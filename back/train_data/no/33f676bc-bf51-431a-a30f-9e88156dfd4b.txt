detroit ( reuters ) - the obama administration will announce efforts to boost self-driving cars on thursday , according to government officials .
mark rosekind , head of the national highway traffic safety administration , told reporters that transportation secretary anthony foxx will be in detroit to talk about administration efforts to speed the introduction of self-driving vehicles .
there is not yet a clear legal framework governing the presence of driverless cars on u.s. roads .
automakers and technology companies such as alphabet inc ’ s google have called on regulators to clarify guidelines for introduction of autonomous driving technology , in part out of concern that a mishap involving a self-driving car could result in costly litigation .

detroit automakers are also likely to participate .
in december , rosekind said he opposed a “ patchwork ” of state regulations on driverless cars and promised a “ nimble , flexible ” approach to writing new rules for self-driving vehicles .
