milan ( reuters ) - two wealthy regions of northern italy , lombardy and veneto , voted overwhelmingly on sunday for more autonomy from the central government , according to preliminary results .
millions of people in the regions , both run by the once openly secessionist lega nord party , voted more than 90 percent for yes .
together , lombardy and veneto account for a third of the italian economy .
the party wants to use the results to persuade rome to allow the regions to keep more of their taxes at home , though the referendums are not binding on the central government .
