Ted Cruz s latest ad just manipulated children to send a political message to voters.The latest campaign move for the Texas Senator is a big jab at his biggest GOP rival, Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who is portrayed in the ad as an action figure who pretends to be a Republican.
In the 45-second spot, young boys are shown playing with a Trump doll, while stating that this action figure likes bailouts for the banks and donates to Democrats.
The ad also features a Hillary Clinton doll, who gets paid by Trump to befriend him a reference to Trump s claim that Clinton attended his wedding because he donated to her Foundation.Toward the end of the ad, a large dollhouse gets ruined by the Trump doll, who says, I m going to take your house with eminent domain and park my limos there!
right before destroying it.
This particular part of the ad is a reminder that Trump once tried to level an elderly woman s Atlantic City home so he could turn it into a parking lot for limos.At the end of the ad, concerned parents see their children playing destructively with the Trump doll and the narrator asks viewers: We wouldn t tolerate these values in our children.
Why would we want them in a president?

Trump has a history of flip-flopping and holding more liberal values.Last week, Cruz beat Trump in the Iowa Caucuses, but Trump took the New Hampshire primary.
This attack ad might be the first of many as the two will face off again on February 20th for the South Carolina primary.Featured image is a screenshot
