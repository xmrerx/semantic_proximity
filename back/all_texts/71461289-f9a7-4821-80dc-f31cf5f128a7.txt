WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday urged Republicans in Congress to repeal Obamacare and work on a healthcare plan that he said would draw Democratic support.
In a tweet following the loss of support for a Senate Republican bill, Trump said, “Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate.
Dems will join in!” Democrats have insisted that they will not cooperate with any Republican legislation that repeals President Barack Obama’s landmark healthcare law, but would work in a bipartisan way to improve it.
