( reuters ) - a former lawmaker filed a petition at kenya s supreme court on monday challenging the results of last month s presidential election , a reuters witness said , opening the door to potential legal challenges to president uhuru kenyatta s re-election .
the petition , filed by former legislator harun mwau , seeks to overturn kenyatta s victory in the oct. 26 election , which was held after the supreme court nullified kenyatta s win in an aug. 8 presidential election on procedural grounds .
the grounds for mwau s petition were not immediately clear since his lawyer did not answer questions .
