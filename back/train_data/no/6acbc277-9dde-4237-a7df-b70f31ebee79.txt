funny what happens when liberals aren t able to bully or shame someone they don t agree with the results don t read like any poll you ve seen reported in the last weeks , but instead like they have been answered primarily by the most ardent trump supporters.some zip questions : new polls suggest trump is getting crushed by clinton .
do they reflect how you are going to vote ?
some 64 % told zip they would vote for trump , compared to 36 % for clinton .
in the latest reuters/ipsos poll , clinton leads trump , 42 % to 36 % .
california , who you voting for ?
trump got 55 % , compared to 45 % for clinton .
in the latest public policy institute of california poll , clinton has a 16-point advantage over trump , 46 % to 30 % .after one week of the media defining what trump really meant when he suggested 2nd amendment supporters will defeat hillary , here is how americans really feel about trump s comments : what do you honestly think trump meant by saying the 2nd amendment people can do something about hillary ?
vote against her ?
63 % assassinate her 37 % militi insists his replies are a cross-section of voters in age , gender and geography .
these are the same results we saw when he ( trump ) was in the primaries , he says .
he contends that most media polls are just flat-out wrong and that smartphone answers are the future.douglas rivers , a stanford university political science professor and chief scientist for yougov , which conducts online polls with such partners as cbs and the economist , disagrees .
what do they know about these people ?
rivers says .
we worry a lot about who we re talking to .
so either the traditional polls are right or militi is onto something , with a different way of polling that lets citizens answer more openly .
we ll find out on nov. 8 , when voters go to the real polls.read more : usa today
