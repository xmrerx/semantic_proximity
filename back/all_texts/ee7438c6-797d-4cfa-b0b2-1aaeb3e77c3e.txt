This is by far the best analysis yet of the entire ordeal of the Trump-Russia collusion lie.
Victor Davis Hanson goes through what brought us to where we are with this charade.
He goes through all of the things that Obama and Clinton did that could be misconstrued as supporting the Russians Remember the sale of our uranium?
How about the big reset button that Hillary Clinton presented to the Russians Yes, if President Trump did any of that he would be accused of working for the Kremlin.https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=3&v=Y5TPHHGG6HEHanson calls this entire case the BIG LIE and we couldn t agree more!
He nails it!
We think Tucker needs to bring Hanson back ASAP!
