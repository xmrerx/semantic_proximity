The thin-skinned president-elect took his angry little fingers to his Twitter account to moan about Saturday Night Live s skit this weekend.
Alec Baldwin knows how to get under Donald Trump s skin and it s glorious to watch.Incoming press secretary Sean Spicer was upset as he spoke with Tamron Hall and Willie Geist of the NBC TODAY Show Monday about the comedy skit.Alec Baldwin returned to play the part of Donald Trump this weekend to hit on the 35-page dossier alleging that Trump paid prostitutes to take part in Golden Showers at a hotel in Moscow.
I d like to ask you about your big Russian pee-pee party, the reporter said.
No, no, Baldwin s Trump told the reporters.
I m not talking about the pee-pee.
It didn t happen.
It wasn t as cool as it sounds.
Next question.
But that was too much for Spicer to handle.
He called the comedy show disappointing and not funny.
It was not funny; it was mean-spirited, Spicer said.
And it s gone from being a show you could sit back and get a good laugh out of to being something that s frankly mean and bad television, he continued.It was funny, though.Watch:The Twitter-addicted president-elect took to Twitter to cry about the show.
@NBCNews is bad but Saturday Night Live is the worst of NBC.
Not funny, cast is terrible, always a complete hit job.
Really bad television!, he tweeted.It s a comedy skit and the more Team Trump rants against it, the more the show s ratings will peak.
Somewhere, Alec Baldwin is smiling because again, he got under Donald J. Trump s skin simply by impersonating him on a late night comedy show.In Barack Obama s final interview with 60 Minutes as president, he said thick skin is an important quality to have when serving as the commander-in-chief.
Thick skin helps in getting the job done, the president said.Grow up, Donald.
Life is hard.
