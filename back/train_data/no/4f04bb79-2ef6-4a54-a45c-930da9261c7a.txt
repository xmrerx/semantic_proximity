shaming people into voting for someone now that s what i call desperation .
how about we let young women decide for themselves who they vote for without being told they ll go to hell if they don t follow in lockstep with the demands of the left .
note to hillary and ms. albright : women can think for themselves these days.former sec .
of state madeleine albright attempted to shame young women voters at a hillary clinton campaign event on saturday , repeating her now-famous line : there s a special place in hell for women who don t help each other .
albright joined new jersey sen. cory booker at a rally in concord , n.h. , just days before the nation s first presidential primary of the 2016 campaign.the 78-year-old diplomat , who served in the bill clinton white house , complained that some young women don t understand the importance of why young women have to support hillary clinton .
the story is not over , they re going to want to push us back .
appointments to the supreme court make all the difference , albright said of republicans , adding that young women have to help and that hillary clinton will be there for you .
just remember : there s a special place in hell for women who don t help each other , albright said , much to the joy of clinton , who is seen laughing at the remark , which she has used numerous times in the past .
