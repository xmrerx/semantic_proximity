Lady Gaga, who protested in front of Trump Towers against Trump s election and mocked Melania Trump for wanting to work on the prevention of bullying in schools, says it s important to have tolerance for others in the video below: Comedian Kathy Griffin goes on expletive rant.
We re not sure how many times she tells Trump to, F*ck off, but it s quite a few.
We re pretty sure her outrageous behavior based on her abject hate for Donald Trump would be considered bullying by teachers and parents alike.
But then again, Hollywood celebrities and those on the Left are experts at telling us and our children how to behave.
Rules and socially acceptable behavior just don t apply to them.Watch full-fledged bully Kathy Griffin s embarrassing anti-Trump, F*ck You rant:(WARNING*** Vile language***)In a much less offensive tweet, Adam Levine had this to say about Donald Trump on Twitter (you know social media, where the celebrities in the anti-bully video warn kids are bullied).Donald Trump is one slip into a vat of toxic waste away from becoming an ACTUAL comic book super villain.
Adam Levine (@adamlevine) November 8, 2012Here s Cher calling Trump a F*cking idiot and Hitler in front of a crowd of Hillary supporters.
Remember, she s a role model for kids of how not to bully other people right?
