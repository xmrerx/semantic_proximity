A few months ago, a story of a young African-American girl went viral on social media.
The girl is a first grader named Kameria.
She was devastated that President Obama would soon be leaving office and her tears appeared all over social media.
Kameria isn t the only one.
Another little girl s tears are going viral as she whimpers that she will miss Obama.
Abella Tomlin of Beaverton, Oregon, was in the backseat of her car and her mother was listening to the Democratic National Convention.
Obama s the only president this four-year-old has ever known, but this was the first time she had to face the hard reality of term limits.The video starts off with Abella seeming to cry over whatever four-year-olds cry over.
She asked her mother Andrea if she could watch a movie to make (her) feel better.
Then, Andrea asked what was wrong and Abella cried, I miss Obama.
Andrea explained: Abella has been an Obama fan since day one.
She has grown up with him as a hero in our household, and as such has always talked about how much she loves him.
I was just listening to the DNC speeches, and she asked me what they were talking about.
So I explained to her that the country is getting ready to elect a new president.
She immediately had tears running down her face and explained to me that Barack Obama was our president and how could we get a new one when we already had one.

She thinks Hillary Clinton will be a good president.Andrea told Abella that maybe Obama should know how she feels, and she offered to send the President the video.
Hopefully, as with Kameria, Abella will soon get an invitation to the White House.Featured image via video screen capture
