Samantha Bee, of Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, provided the world with the perfect response to Donald Trump s Cinco de Mayo mega-gaffe and pseudo-advertisement for his hotel chain on Thursday.
Trump had posted a photo of himself online that shows him seated at a desk eating a taco bowl where he said: Happy Cinco de Mayo!
The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill.
I love Hispanics!

She also posted this brilliant comeback: The best taco bowls are made by hardworking immigrants who don t like being called rapists by a rich prick.
I love inauthentic Mexican food!

He has no need to pander to any one particular group except his base assholes.
Trump knows that his Cinco de Mayo announcement is a mega-gaffe.
He has already learned the art of saying just the wrong thing at the just the wrong time in order to rile up his supporters.
He is, as he has been for his entire primary campaign, capitalizing on his supporters xenophobia, racism, and anger.Now, if you see someone defending Trump s post on social media, one of Bee s followers has invented a perfect new term for that person is doing proctolojustification.It applicable way to describe any defense of the new head of the Republican Party.Featured image from Facebook
