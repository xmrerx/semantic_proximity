This ass-clown reminds us of why term limits are so important.
Leisa and I saw Rep. Rangel (D-NY) up close and personal last week when we visited the Capitol building as guests of Rep. Mike Bishop (R-MI).
We were shocked at some of the people who have been elected to represent our nation.
20% of the House members looked like they should be roaming the halls of a nursing home NOT the halls of Congress!
These people have no business making serious decisions on behalf of our country.
Charlie Rangel is a perfect example of our assertion It s no secret that Democrats can t stand the Tea Party, but rarely do they express their hatred out loud like Rep. Charlie Rangel did.
In a moment caught on camera, the Democrat Congressman let reporters know what he really thinks about the coalition of citizens who believe in individual liberty and small government (some of whom are undoubtedly his own constituents).TheBlaze reports:Rep. Charlie Rangel (D-N.Y.) had harsh words for Tea Party Republicans during a town hall he hosted Tuesday in New York City.
The outspoken Democrat was asked by TheBlaze about what he thinks motivates the more conservative wing of the House Republicans.
They come from states that used to own slaves, Rangel said of his Tea Party colleagues.
They come from states that the Confederate Army was pledged allegiance to.
They come from states that the Ku Klux Klan and voters rights and all of those things came into play.
[T]hey left the Democratic Party, thank God, they joined the Republican Party and they like being among themselves, Rangel added.They even got his comments on video here:Via: Deneenborelli
