brussels ( reuters ) - european parliamentarians want britain to end regrettable practices that discriminate against eu citizens in the workplace and elsewhere , a draft resolution published on thursday showed .
lawmakers also urged british authorities to grant broad rights to eu citizens and their families in britain after it exits the eu in 2019 , an issue where eu chief negotiator michel barnier said on thursday big differences remained .
the european parliament expresses concern about regrettable administrative practices against eu citizens living in the united kingdom , the draft resolution said .
lawmakers said there were also cases of british citizens discriminated against in other eu countries .
the british government said on sept. 9 that its equalities office ( geo ) was aware of , and is looking into , reports of discrimination against non-uk eu nationals seeking employment in violation of the 2010 equality act .
the document , agreed on thursday by the leaders of the assembly s political parties , will be voted on by the chamber next week in strasbourg .
the document is not binding on eu negotiators but the 28-nation parliament has the right to veto any deal with britain on its future relations with the eu .
mps also urged britain to protect the rights of eu citizens and their children even if they are born there after brexit .
future family members should continue to benefit from right of residence under the same provisions as current family members , the document said .
eu lawmakers have opposed britain s proposals to create a new category of settled status under united kingdom immigration law for eu citizens .
differences on these issues remain , barnier said on thursday at the end of a fourth round of brexit negotiations .
without sufficient progress on citizens rights , the eu will not move on to negotiations on a future trade deal with london .
