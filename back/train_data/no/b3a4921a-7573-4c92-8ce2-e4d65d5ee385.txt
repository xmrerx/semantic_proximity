ferguson was the a launching pad for obama s war against law enforcement following the shooting of a sheriff in houston , texas by a black man as well as chants from black lives matter protesters advocating violence against police , gop presidential candidate sen. ted cruz ( r-tx ) issued a statement saying he is proud to stand with law enforcement.while campaigning in new hampshire , cruz addressed the attacks .
both physical and verbal , which have been made against police officers across america.cruz is calling for leadership to act against this assault on all law enforcement officers , in light of the killing of harris country deputy sheriff darren goforth , which took place in cruz s hometown .
we stand with our police officers , we stand with our fire fighters , with our ems , with our first responders , cruz s statement began .
these are brave humans who risk their lives keeping us safe .
we are seeing a manifestation of the rhetoric and vilification of law enforcement that is coming form the top all the way to the president of the united states and senior administration officials .
cruz continued : cops across this country are feeling the assault .
they re feeling the assault from the president , from the top on down as we see , whether it s in ferguson or baltimore , the response of senior officials of the president , of the attorney general , is to vilify law enforcement .
that is fundamentally wrong , and it is endangering the safety and security of us all.i m proud to stand with law enforcement , to stand with the police and fire fighters and first responders .
they are american heroes .
and they need a president who doesn t attack and vilify them and who doesn t seek to tear us apart along racial lines to inflame racial divisions .
instead we need a president who works to bring us together and unify us behind shared american values .
