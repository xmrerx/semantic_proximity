after the horrific terrorist attack in orlando , which became the deadliest shooting in american history , a new poll from cbs shows that support for banning assault rifles has skyrocketed across the nation.the poll , conducted june 13th and 14th , shows that 57 percent of americans support banning them , while 38 percent oppose .
but the most surprising thing about these numbers is that in december of last year , only 44 percent of americans supported a ban .
that s a thirteen point difference in just six months.the poll also shows a shocking statistic almost half of republicans ( 45 percent ) support the ban , while 78 percent of democrats and 47 percent of independents do.according to the poll : on whether laws governing gun sales should be made more strict , americans seem split along party lines .
a majority 57 percent believe that laws should be stricter , while 11 percent believe they should be less strict .
about three in ten americans think they should be kept as is.not surprisingly , republicans were in the minority on this issue as well.the overwhelming majority of americans support such a ban , and only one candidate wants to see that happen hillary clinton .
donald trump doesn t because , in his own words , there are already too many of them on the streets so it would be fruitless ( but deporting 11 million immigrants in this country ?
no problem ) .there is no doubt that the number has risen thanks to the ever eminent threat of mass gun violence plaguing this nation , and the attack in orlando certainly didn t ease any fears.when it comes to the issues of expanding background checks , all political ideologies are in agreement .
over 92 percent of republicans , 97 percent of democrats , and 82 percent of independents support stricter , universal background checks.if this trend continues , guns will become a serious policy point in the upcoming election ( as it should be ) , and with the two candidates taking completely different approaches , the difference could not be starker.featured image via david mcnew/getty images
