The capital city s fireworks festivities, aired on PBS, are to include performances by The Beach Boys, The Four Tops, country musicians Kellie Pickler and Trace Adkins, and two characters who fought for independence in a galaxy far, far away Star Wars droids R2-D2 and C-3PO.
This year marks the movie s 40th anniversary.But before the picnic, Trump kicked off his holiday at his golf club in Virginia.
The president arrived at the club in Sterling just before 10 a.m. and spent nearly four hours there before returning to the White House.
Aides did not answer questions about whether he was golfing.
