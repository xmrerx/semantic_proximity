21st Century Wire says Congresswoman and Iraq War veteran Tulsi Gabbard continues to face down the mainstream propaganda machine with her based and skeptical opinion surrounding the war on Syria, including the recent attacks on Shayrat air base by the United States as a reprisal for the alleged chemical attack on Idlib by Damascus.It s not surprising within the American political party system that if you don t agree with the gang , they come for your blood, and this is exactly what s happening to Gabbard.
Her previous fact finding visit to Syria in 2016 had already began to turn heads, but now after the CNN interview with Wolf Blitzer, who happens to all of a sudden like Donald Trump, the Democrats are circling Tulsi Gabbard in increasing droves.More on this report from The Duran Alex Christoforou The DuranNo room for free speech.

There s responsibility that goes around, Gabbard said.
Standing here pointing fingers does not accomplish peace for the Syrian people.
It will not bring about an end to this war.
