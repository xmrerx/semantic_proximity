GENEVA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump must convey to Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte the deep sense of alarm about his apparent shirking of his duty to prosecute human rights violations, U.N. human rights chief Zeid Ra’ad al-Hussein said on Monday.
The White House on Sunday defended Trump’s decision to invite Duterte to Washington, saying his cooperation was needed to counter North Korea, even as the administration faced human rights criticism for its overture to Manila.
“So one hopes the message will be very clear and undiluted from the President of United States to the President of the Philippines,” Zeid told a news briefing.
