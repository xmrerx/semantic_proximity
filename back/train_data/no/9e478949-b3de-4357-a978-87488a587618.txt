washington ( reuters ) - a senior republican on the u.s. senate judiciary committee said on thursday that president barack obama was looking for someone who was “ very moderate ” to be his nominee to fill a vacancy on the supreme court .
“ he said he was going to try to find a justice who would be very moderate , ” senator orrin hatch told fox news channel .
but hatch said even if obama were to put forward a republican for the empty seat , the senate should not consider it during “ the throes of a very intense , and some people think horrific , presidential campaign. ” separately , house democratic leader nancy pelosi told reporters she thought it would be a good idea for obama to consider nominating a republican .
