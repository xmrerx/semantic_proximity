washington ( reuters ) - the pentagon said on tuesday that u.s. forces had moved a person who is under 18 years old to iraq from syria and two u.s. officials said she was a pregnant american teenager .
u.s. forces recently relocated a minor from syria safely to iraq , the pentagon said in a statement .
the u.s. officials , speaking on condition of anonymity , said she was in the hands of state department officials in iraq and would travel back to the united states , although they did not say when .
while not identifying her by name , one official said she was the same person interviewed by cbs news earlier this month near raqqa , the syrian city that islamic state once called its capital .
u.s.-backed militias declared victory in raqqa earlier this month .
in that interview , she said she was 15 and had been brought to syria by her father , an islamic state supporter .
the teenager had told cbs that she was from kansas .
last month , the pentagon said a u.s. citizen fighting for islamic state in syria surrendered to u.s.-backed militias and was handed over to u.s. forces .
