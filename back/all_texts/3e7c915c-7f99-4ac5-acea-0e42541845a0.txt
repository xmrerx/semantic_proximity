Alabama Senator Jeff Sessions has been the lone fighter in the battle against the invasion at our southern border.
This is why the endorsement of Trump s immigration policy is a big deal.
Sessions is a good man of high character who wouldn t endorse the Trump plan if he didn t feel it was worthy.
This is great news!The Senate s leading proponent of enforcing and toughening immigration laws said late Sunday that Donald Trump s immigration outline, his first major position white paper, is exactly the plan America needs.
In a strong endorsement of Trump s bid to close the border to illegal immigration, the Alabama senator that regular native Americans and especially minorities would benefit by being put first in line for jobs.
This plan puts the needs of working Americans foremost, and develops an effective strategy for improving their wages and job prospects.
Crucially, this plan includes an emphasis on lifting struggling minority communities, including our immigrant communities, out of poverty by preventing corporations from bringing in new workers from overseas to replace them and drive down wages, said Sessions in a statement.
