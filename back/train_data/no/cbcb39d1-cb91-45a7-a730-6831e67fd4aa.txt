( reuters ) - former california democratic state senator leland yee received a five-year prison sentence on wednesday for conspiracy in a corruption case that involved bribery , weapons trafficking and money laundering , federal prosecutors said .
lee , 67 , pleaded guilty to the conspiracy charge after his arrest in 2014 in a sweep that included suspected leaders of organized crime in san francisco , the city he represented in the state legislature .
prosecutors had sought an eight-year sentence for yee , whose guilty plea in federal court in san francisco last july marked the end of a long political career that included two terms on the san francisco board of supervisors , as well as election to the california assembly and senate .
yee was the third california state senator charged in 2014 in separate criminal cases .
all three eventually left office , costing the democrats a key two-thirds legislative majority .
