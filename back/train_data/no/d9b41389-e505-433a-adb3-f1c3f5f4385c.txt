it s interesting to note the terrorist organization linked to this mosque ( and funded with our taxpayer dollars ) , is same terror group obama and the democrats supported during the arab spring uprising in egypt a kansas city mosque owned by an islamic umbrella organization with deep ties to the u.s. arm of the muslim brotherhood has received millions of dollars in federal grants over the past several years , according to a federal spending database.the islamic center of greater kansas city has received $ 2,739,891 from the department of agriculture since 2010 , a daily caller analysis has found .
the money largely went to the mosque s crescent clinic to provide services through the women , infant and children nutrition program , known as wic.the most recent federal payment in the amount of $ 327,436 was handed out oct. 1 .
property records show the mosque is owned by the north american islamic trust ( nait ) , which acts as a financial holding company for islamic organizations .
it offers sharia-compliant financial products to muslim investors , operates islamic schools and owns more than 300 other mosques throughout the u.s.founded in 1973 as an offshoot of the muslim brotherhood-backed muslim students association , nait s most controversial connection is to the 2007 and 2008 holy land foundation terror financing cases .
along with other muslim brotherhood-linked organizations like the islamic society of north america ( isna ) and the council on american-islamic relations ( cair ) , nait was named a co-conspirator in the federal case but was not indicted.at the holy land foundation trial , evidence was presented that isna diverted funds from the accounts it held with nait to institutions linked to hamas and to mousa abu marzook , a senior hamas leader.federal prosecutors introduced evidence in the case that established that isna and nait were among those organizations created by the u.s.-muslim brotherhood .
hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of checks drawn from isna s account and deposited in the holy land foundation s account with nait were made payable to the palestinian mujahadeen , which is the original name for hamas military wing.while hamas was designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the u.s. government in 1997 and is considered the palestinian branch of the muslim brotherhood , the larger muslim brotherhood is not itself designated as a terrorist group.and while the obama administration has largely remained agnostic towards the organization , the british government released a scathing report earlier this month noting that the muslim brotherhood remains supportive of hamas and that much of its ideology and many of its tactics are contrary to our values and have been contrary to our national interests and our national security .
