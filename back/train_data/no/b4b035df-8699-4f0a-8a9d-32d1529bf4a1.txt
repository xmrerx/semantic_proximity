brussels ( reuters ) - britain has only 10 days left to deliver on all three areas of its divorce terms with the european union if london wants to start talks on a transition period after brexit and a future relationship , the chairman of eu leaders donald tusk said .
we need to see progress from uk within 10 days on all issues , including on ireland , tusk tweeted on friday after a meeting with british prime minister theresa may in brussels .
sufficient progress in brexit talks at december council is possible but still a huge challenge , he said on twitter .
an eu official said that may agreed in the one-hour discussions that dec. 4 was the absolute deadline to allow the eu s brexit negotiator michel barnier to recommend moving onto the next stage on trade and future ties .
tusk presented the timeline ahead of the december european council , with dec. 4 as the absolute deadline for the uk to make additional efforts , allowing barnier to be in a position to recommend sufficient progress , the official said .
may agreed to this timeframe , the official said .
the official said tusk had warned that if there was no progress within next 10 days , that would make moving forward impossible .
the official said that the way ireland s border with northern ireland functioned after britain leaves the eu in march 2019 was still an issue .
the uk will need to give credible assurances as to how to avoid a hard border before dec. 4 , as it is still unclear how this can be done , the official said .
