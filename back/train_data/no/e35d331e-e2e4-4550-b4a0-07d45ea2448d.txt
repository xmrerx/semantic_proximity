kinshasa ( reuters ) - police fired tear gas to disperse supporters of democratic republic of congo s opposition chief on sunday as they gathered in the capital amid high tensions over election delays keeping president joseph kabila in power , a reuters witness said .
felix tshisekedi , head of an opposition coalition , is due to fly back to the capital kinshasa on sunday after a prolonged absence abroad .
around a dozen supporters had gathered at his family residences in the morning , although there was no sign of violence .
tshisekedi intends to call for a civil disobedience campaign in order to pressure kabila , whose mandate expired last year , to step aside .
congolese authorities banned the coalition s planned meeting on sunday , citing a risk of violence in the central african country of more than 70 million people .
