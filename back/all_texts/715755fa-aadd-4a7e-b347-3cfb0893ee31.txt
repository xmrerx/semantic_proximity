NFL reporter Jason LaCanfora updated football fans about former San Francisco quarterback Colin Kaepernick who found himself without a job after he began kneeling during the playing of our national anthem before the games.
Kaepernick kneeled to try to bring attention to the plight of Black Lives Matter, a group who s placed a target on the backs of law enforcement, claiming they unfairly single out and target blacks.
LaCanfora spoke on NFL Today host J.B. or James Brown about where Colin Kaepernick is today, and why he has remained silent during his quest to find a job in the NFL.LaCanfora told J.B. that Kaepernick is not planning on kneeling.
He s going to donate all of his sales from his jersey s and he s planning on standing for the anthems if given the opportunity to play again, J.B.. After sitting down with Colin Kaepernick for several hours, @JasonLaCanfora says the QB is still actively trying to play in the NFL.
