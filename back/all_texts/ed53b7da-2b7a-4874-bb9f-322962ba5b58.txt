There s some funny business happening this weekend at the Jersey Shore, and it s not the usual shenanigans you have in mind.
A Democratic group is flying a HUGE banner today over the very busy beaches of the Jersey Shore with a hilarious anti-Trump message.The banner that reads TRUMP IS ON VACATION WITH YOUR $$ is being flown by the outspoken Bridge Project.
They are flying it from Beach Haven all the way up north to Sea Bright.The group cleverly chose this location and weekend because the President is spending a leisurely weekend golfing at his NJ beach resort.
Flying this banner is the perfect way to highlight the fact that Trump is spending every weekend golfing at the beach rather than doing his job and to embarrass him about it, bigly.The irony of Trump spending all his weekends golfing is that he used to slam President Obama on Twitter for playing golf while in the office.
Now, even Trump s fellow Republicans are recognizing that he is majorly out-golfing Obama.
Senator Joni Ernst from Iowa said in an April town hall speech that Trump needs to spend way less time at Mar-a-Lago in Florida if he wants to be an effective president.
I do wish he would spend more time in Washington, D.C. That s what we have the White House for.
By April Trump had spent as much time traveling during his presidency than Obama did during the entire two terms in the White House.
Besides not being in D.C. doing his job, just one of Trump s weekend getaways cost taxpayers $3.6 million.Maybe this banner will help Trump to see the error of his ways?
OK, probably not, but at least it will embarrass the shit out of him.Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images
