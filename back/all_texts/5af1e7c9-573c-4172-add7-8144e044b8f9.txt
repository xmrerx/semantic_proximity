Donald Trump literally just posted the ultimate do what I say, not as I do tweet and got ripped to shreds for being a hypocrite.After delivering a depressing Inaugural Address on Friday that was full of lies and promises he won t keep, Trump took to Twitter to post some snippets of his speech and included two rules that he expects everyone to follow, except himself of course.We will follow two simple rules: BUY AMERICAN & HIRE AMERICAN!#InaugurationDay #MAGA??
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 20, 2017Yes, the man who buys materials for his hotels from overseas and has his products made by overseas laborers literally commanded Americans to buy American made goods and to hire American workers.And the Internet gleefully took Trump to the woodshed for it.

The real House of Cards!
pic.twitter.com/k6vj7J6Vct The Donald (@LoserDonDrumpf) January 20, 2017Donald Trump is a total hypocrite.
Again, he literally screwed over American steel workers by buying metals from China to use to build his hotels.Trump also furnishes his hotels with goods made outside of the United States, including lamps, sheets, beds, chairs, etc Even David Letterman exposed and humiliated Trump for being a hypocrite.Donald Trump is already setting a poor example as president.
He is telling Americans and American businesses to follow rules that he refuses to follow himself.
Just more proof that Donald Trump is a liar and hypocrite who loves himself more than his country.
And he should be impeached.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images
