what a classy move by the democrats in an attempt to get the ghetto rats interested in the election and back on the reservation for hillary , calvin broadus , aka snoop dogg s latest act will be to bring together the democratic party .

dogg announced that he would be supporting hillary clinton less than a month after she declared her candidacy in may 2015 .
you know i like to be politically correct , but sometimes i m politically incorrect .
watch what happens live .
but i ll say that i would love to see bitches a woman in office because i feel like we re at that stage in life to where we need a perspective other than the male s train of thought .
and just to have bitches a woman speaking from a global perspective as far as representing america , i d love to see that .
so i ll be voting for da bitch ms. clinton .
the groups also announced that the grammy-winning group los lobos will perform .
and i would imagine a heavy presence of police and emergency medical personal will also be in attendance.via : dmf
