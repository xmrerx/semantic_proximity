london ( reuters ) - britain has made substantive changes to its proposed text for a deal with the european union , the leader of northern ireland s democratic unionist party said on friday as prime minister theresa may arrived in brussels to present the deal .
we re pleased to see those change because for me it means there s no red line down the irish sea and we have the very clear confirmation that the entirety of the united kingdom is leaving the european union , leaving the single market , leaving the customs union , arlene foster told sky news .
there are still matters there that we would have liked to have seen clarified , we ran out of time essentially , we think that we needed to go back again and talk about those matters but the prime minister has decided to go to brussels in relation to this text .
