gary cohn , a goldman sachs recruit , now serving as trump s white house economic adviser and has assets worth $ 252 million to $ 611 million , says that under the former reality show star s tax plan you can buy a brand new car for $ 1,000 , but that s not all , folks , in addition to that , you can renovate your entire kitchen for $ 1,000 .
and you can buy a unicorn for just five bucks , and all because trump is the best person ever ! cohn took the podium to tell voters about all of this good news which has to be for real because trump is going to maga so hard , you ll also be able to take your family on a vacation for $ 1,000 .
are you getting goosebumps , too ?
if we allow a family to keep another $ 1,000 , they can renovate their kitchen , they can buy a new car , they can take a family vacation , cohn said.maybe cohn meant you can take your family on a vacay in your basement for $ 1,000 .
as for the brand new car and the renovated kitchen , i got nothin .watch : that time when gary cohn who is worth hundreds of millions of dollars says a kitchen renovation costs $ 1k .

people just like gary cohn .
in fact , the center on budget and policy priorities estimates that the top 1 percent of americans would get half of the tax cuts under trump s plan .
by eliminating the estate tax , the plan would benefit trump , his family , and other wealthy americans .
so , now we know why trump was so vague during his short speech in indiana on wednesday.we re wondering what mr .
fancy pants thinks a new house costs .
by the way , the estimated average transaction price of a new car or truck in 2015 was $ 33,560 .
we re sure that s higher now .
mr. cohn was only off by $ 32,560 .
he was soooo close .
missed it by that much !
the average cost to renovate a kitchen is actually $ 21,797 .
according to american express , the average vacation expense per person in the united states is $ 1,145 , or $ 4,580 for a family of four.image via screen capture .
