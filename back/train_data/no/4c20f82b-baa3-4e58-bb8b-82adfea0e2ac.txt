berlin ( reuters ) - german rail operator deutsche bahn is facing a siege of online criticism over a proposal to name a high-speed train after holocaust victim anne frank , who was deported by train to the auschwitz concentration camp .
the idea to name the high-speed ice 4 train after frank came from proposals made by deutsche bahn customers and the german public , which a panel reviewed .
of 19,400 submissions , anne frank was one of the most popular names , it said .
aware of the historical responsibility we bear , we made a deliberate decision to help keep anne frank s memory alive , bahn said in a statement .
it was not our intention to disrespect the memory of anne frank in any way whatsoever .
critics say the plan was insensitive .
frank was deported from her home in amsterdam and taken to auschwitz by train in september 1944 .
she was later moved the bergen-belsen concentration camp , where she died in early 1945 .
iris eberl , a conservative bavarian lawmaker , said on twitter the plan was disrespectful .
mirjam wenzel , director of the jewish museum in frankfurt , where frank was born , tweeted that the idea was based on historical amnesia .
the anne frank house , the museum that preserves the family s hiding place in amsterdam , said in a statement that the idea of naming the train after her is painful for the people who experienced these deportations , and causes fresh pain to those who still bear the consequences of those times within them .
