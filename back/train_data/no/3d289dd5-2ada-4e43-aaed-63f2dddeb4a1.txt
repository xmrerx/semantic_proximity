madrid ( reuters ) - the spanish economy could grow less than initially expected in 2018 due to uncertainty over catalonia , deputy prime minister soraya sainz de santamaria said on friday .
the wealthy region s intention to break away after a referendum has plunged spain into its worst political crisis since an attempted military coup in 1981 .
the events that we are experiencing in catalonia make us more prudent , sainz de santamaria said after the weekly cabinet meeting .
in fact , if there were no quick solution to this issue we should be forced to lower expectations of economic growth for the year 2018 , she said .
the government expects spain s economy to grow 2.6 percent in 2018 .
the deputy prime minister also said that hotel reservations in catalonia were currently falling 20 percent to 30 percent .
