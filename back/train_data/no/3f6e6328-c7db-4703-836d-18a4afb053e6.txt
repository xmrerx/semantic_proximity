oslo ( reuters ) - norway offered on friday to let israeli nuclear whistleblower mordechai vanunu live in oslo with his norwegian wife , but she said it was unclear if israel will allow him to travel .
vanunu , 62 , married theology professor kristin joachimsen in jerusalem in 2015 after first meeting in israel almost a decade earlier .
she applied for him to be allowed to come to norway under rules for family reunification and a spokesman for the norwegian directorate of immigration said permission had been granted .
vanunu was jailed and served an 18-year sentence after discussing his work at israel s dimona nuclear reactor with a british newspaper in 1986 .
the interview led experts to conclude the facility had produced fissile material for as many as 200 atomic warheads .
after his release from jail in 2004 , israeli defense authorities imposed strict conditions on vanunu , including from traveling abroad , alleging he was a security risk and might have new secrets to tell .
joachimsen said the israeli restrictions were up for review in november and expressed hopes they would be lifted .
we have waited long enough for the case to be solved on israel s side , she said .
the restrictions , upheld by israel s supreme court , have been condemned by international human rights groups .
