Fox News Channel host Bill O Reilly and Republican presidential nominee believe that the horrific attack in Nice, France means it s time to push a world war.
Dozens were killed when a tractor trailer truck plowed into a crowd watching Bastille Day fireworks.
The attacker then stepped out his car and was shot and killed by authorities.
President Obama said, I condemn in the strongest terms what appears to be a horrific terrorist attack in Nice, France, which killed and wounded dozens of innocent civilians.
Appearing on The O Reilly Factor while details about the attack were still coming in, host Bill O Reilly said to Trump that if the attack is proven to be a terrorist event I believe it s a world war now, we re in a world war scenario.
It s no longer just isolated ISIS attacks.
Do you agree with that?
Trump told him, I certainly do, adding, it s out of control.
Trump then went on to attack President Obama saying, we have a president that doesn t want to call it what it is.
Trump then called for strong and smart leadership or else the problem is going to get worse.
In contrast to Trump and O Reilly and their world war rhetoric, Hillary Clinton appeared on CNN with Anderson Cooper and stressed that this is a horrific attack and that instead of the O Reilly/Trump push for a wide war, we are at war with these terrorist groups and what they represent.
Trump has regularly argued that Muslims are somehow responsible for all terrorism.
Trump has argued, without evidence, that Muslim communities are slow to report terroristic activities to the authorities.
In reality, Muslims have often done so including in the case of the Orlando night club shooter.Trump has also argued that he would bar Muslims from entering the United States if he were elected president, and has also said he would consider a registry of Muslims that many said sounded similar to Nazi registries of Jewish people.Featured image via YouTube
