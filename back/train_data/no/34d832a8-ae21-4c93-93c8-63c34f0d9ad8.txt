i think it s ludicrous , she opined .
because we have to make up our minds .
either we want to have segregation or integration .
if we don t want segregation then we need to get rid of channels like bet and the bet awards and the [ naacp ] image awards , where you are only awarded if you are black .
so you say there should not be a bet channel ?
fox news host steve doocy wondered .
no , just like there shouldn t be a black history month , dash replied .
you know , we re americans .
period .
that s it .
are you saying there shouldn t be a black history month because there isn t a white history month ?
doocy pressed .
exactly !
dash insisted.according to dash , the real problem was that hollywood s support of president barack obama had not inspired filmmakers to create more black roles .
we ve had a president who is black in office for the past eight years , who gets most of his funding from the liberal elite in hollywood , she said .
yet , there are not very many roles for people of color .
how can that be and why is it just now being addressed ?
