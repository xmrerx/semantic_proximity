MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said on Tuesday he hoped that an international Syrian peace congress would take place in the near future.
The Russian-sponsored Syrian peace congress scheduled for Nov. 18 was postponed after objections by Turkey, President Tayyip Erdogan s spokesman said over the weekend.
Asked whether the congress was postponed, Lavrov told a briefing that the date had not been officially announced.
He added that he hoped that the United Nations would support holding the congress.
