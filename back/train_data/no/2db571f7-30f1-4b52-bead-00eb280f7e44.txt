politics can be a nasty business .
this latest spat proves once again , that in politics , it s not really about color , as much as it is which party you belong to .
in this sense , many prominent black american democrats consider ben carson to be a traitor to their cause.recently , president trump s opponents have begun to intensify their attacks on african-american republican hud secretary ben carson .
democratic congresswoman maxine waters has recently come out threatening carson , and now jumaane williams , a democrat and new york city council member for the 45th district , has accused carson of supporting white supremacist views .
is there any truth to these accusations , or is this a racially-motivated political witch-hunt ?
