donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) february 3 , 2017trump seems to be referencing an iranian official rightfully mocking him as an extremist who has alienated the majority of americans and regularly engages in groundless ranting .

mohamed alabsi ( @ mohamed_alabsi ) february 3 , 2017over this past week trump has started numerous diplomatic fires , threatening to send troops to mexico to deal with bad hombres and somehow managing to f * ck up relations with australia , one of our closest allies .
when you hear about the tough phone calls i m having , don t worry about it , trump recently told the crowd at the national prayer breakfast .
we have to be tough .
we re taken advantage of by every nation in the world , virtually .
it s not going to happen anymore .
trump s horrible attitude has plunged the united states into an uncertain period of turmoil in which he is lashing out at everyone including our allies to satisfy his gigantic and undeserved ego .
think about it : the leader of the free world just openly threatened hostile action toward another nation via twitter.this is bad .
really bad.featured image via getty images ( win mcnamee ) /screengrab
