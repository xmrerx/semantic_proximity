new york ( reuters ) - france said on saturday it was extremely concerned by iran s ballistic missile test and called on u.n. secretary-general antonio guterres to carry out a full report on the launch .
france asks that iran cease all destabilizing activity in the region , foreign ministry spokeswoman agnes romatet-espagne said in a statement .
( france ) will consider with its partners , notably european , the means to obtain from iran the cessation of its destabilizing ballistic activities .
most u.n. sanctions were lifted 18 months ago under a deal iran made with key world powers to curb its nuclear program .
but iran is still subject to an arms embargo and other restrictions , which are not technically part of the nuclear agreement .
guterres reports every six months to the u.n. security council on the implementation of the remaining sanctions and restrictions .
iran said on saturday it had successfully tested a new ballistic missile with a range of 2,000 km ( 1,200 miles ) and would keep developing its arsenal , despite u.s. pressure to stop .
