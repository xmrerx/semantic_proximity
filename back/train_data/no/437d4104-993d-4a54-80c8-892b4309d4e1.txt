tripoli ( reuters ) - air strikes killed at least 15 people in the besieged eastern libyan city of derna late on monday , a medical source and a resident said , in an operation condemned by the united nations due to the high civilian death toll .
the u.n. support mission in libya said at least 12 children and women were among the dead in derna , a city about 265 km ( 165 miles ) west of the egyptian border controlled by a coalition of islamist militants and rebel veterans known as the derna mujahideen shura council ( dmsc ) .
the medical source said all the victims appeared to be civilians .
the coastal city has long been under siege by the eastern-based libyan national army ( lna ) , which has occasionally carried out air strikes against it , as has egypt , which backs the lna .
both denied carrying out monday s strikes .
the air strikes , lasting around an hour , hit the dahr al-hamar district in the south of derna and al fatayeh , a hilly area about 20 km ( 12 miles ) from the city , a resident said .
an egyptian military source said egypt was not responsible for the air strike , while one egyptian tv station said libyan planes had conducted it .
the lna denied this and said there had been a terrorist attack in the area .
egypt s foreign ministry issued a statement condemning the air strikes , which it said had killed innocent civilians .
the tripoli-based u.n.-backed government , which opposes the lna-backed by a rival administration in the east , denounced the air strikes and announced three days of mourning .
islamic state established a foothold in derna in late 2014 , but was driven out by the dmsc the following year .
