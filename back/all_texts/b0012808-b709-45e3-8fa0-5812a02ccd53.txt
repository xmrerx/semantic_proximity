I m going to be talking to white people, we re the ones who have to start listening to the legitimate cries coming from our African-American fellow citizens, she said.
We ve got to figure out what is happening when routine traffic stops, when routine arrests, escalate into killings Clearly, there seems to be a terrible disconnect between many police departments and officers and the people they have sworn to protect, she said.Federal policing guidelines are needed because we have 18,000 police departments [some of which need more training to] go after systemic racism, which is a reality, and to go after systemic bias, she said.
We ve got to start once again respecting and treating each other with the dignity that every person deserves, she said.VIA: BREITBART
