Former Fox News host Megyn Kelly s interview with Trump supporter, conspiracy theorist, fake news purveyor, and general asshole Alex Jones is set to air soon but that doesn t mean that Jones intends to be his usual terrible self no matter how many advertisers run screaming from Kelly s show.On Wednesday Jones, who lost custody of his children over his insane rants and violent attitude, set his sights on CNN s Wolf Blitzer on Thursday:Wolf Blitzer has a guest on: So, this man wasn t a monster, he was just tired of things.
Wolf Blitzer: Ok, thanks for your view.
Hmm, very interesting.
What happens, Wolf Blitzer, when somebody pumps rounds into your little pumpkin head and says, It s just political ?
Hah.
You people.
You guys better have some helicopter jump jets and be ready to get out of here real quick if the actual civil war kicks off, Jones added before attempting to claim that he was somehow innocent in his call for violence against Blitzer: I mean, I m not the one that s calling for violence; you re going to get wrecked bad.
There are a lot of people like Santa Claus been making a list, been checking it twice about who s been naughty and nice.
And you kick off Civil War 2, baby, you ll think Lexington and Concord was a cake walk.
Despite Jones attempt to sic his disgusting fans on Blitzer, NBC still plans to allow his interview to air.Watch Jones outburst below: Featured image via screengrab
