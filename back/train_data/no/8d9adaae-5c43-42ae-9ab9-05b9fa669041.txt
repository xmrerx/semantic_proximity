black lives matter , he said , drawing an audible reaction in a courtroom , the times reported.judge robart added that the recent targeted shootings of police officers across the country signaled the importance of strengthening police and community relations.commissioner enrique gonzalez said he s very encouraged that a federal judge has actually said that black lives matter , because now we know that not only is this movement happening in the streets even a federal judge has acknowledged that people of color have been on the receiving end of police brutality and this needs to change , the stranger reported .
