ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - A vote by Iraq s parliament to reject the results of this month s Iraqi Kurdish independence vote was non-binding, a high-ranking Kurdish official told Reuters on Tuesday.
The Kurdish parliament will definitely have a response to the resolution when it convenes on Thursday, said Hoshyar Zebari, former Iraqi foreign and finance minister and now a senior adviser to Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) President Massoud Barzani.
Zebari said Kurdish lawmakers would convene for the first time since October 2015.
