Republican front runner Donald Trump is still (thankfully) getting blasted for the outrageously offensive comments he made on Wednesday, when he told MSNBC s Chris Matthews that there has to be some form of punishment for women who have abortions.
Trump has been frantically trying to backpedal on those statements, but no one is buying his bullsh*t. Now, he s accusing the network for editing the interview with Matthews in an attempt to make him look bad!
Seriously, as if Trump needs any help with that Trump was doing an phone interview on Fox News The O Reilly Factor Thursday when he made senselessly blamed MSNBC for the awful backlash his abortion remarks have gotten.
As guest host Eric Bolling brought up the comments, Trump accused the network of cutting the controversial discussion on abortion so much that his punishment comments were taken completely out of context.
Trump said: You really ought to hear the whole thing.
This is a long convoluted question.
This was a long discussion, and they just cut it out.
And, frankly, it was extremely it was really convoluted.
It could be that I misspoke.
But this was a long, convoluted subject.
We talked about Catholicism and his religion, and [Chris Matthews] went back and forth about that.
This was a very long, convoluted discussion which, frankly, they don t want on television because it was too long.
You can listen to Trump point his (freakishly tiny) finger at MSNBC in the interview footage below, starting at around the 4:45 mark:Unfortunately for Trump, MSNBC is calling him out as a liar.
In a statement to TVNewser, the network insisted that absolutely no editing had been done to that interview, and that Trump s comments really were as awful as everything thought.
MSNBC said: The town hall interview with Donald Trump was taped in advance and then aired in its entirety.
Absolutely no part of the exchange between Trump and Chris Matthews was edited out.
