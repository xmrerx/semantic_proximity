berlin ( reuters ) - germans should be proud of what their soldiers achieved during world war one and two , the top candidate of the far-right alternative for germany ( afd ) said ahead of the sept. 24 election at which his party his expected to enter parliament .
the anti-immigrant afd is on up to 12 percent in opinion polls , meaning it could become the third biggest party in germany s lower house behind chancellor angela merkel s conservatives and the social democrats ( spd ) .
if i look around europe , no other people has dealt as clearly with their past wrongs as the germans , 76-year-old alexander gauland said in a speech to supporters on sept. 2 that has since been posted on youtube .
the nazis ruled germany from 1933 to 1945 , during which time they killed 6 million jews in the holocaust .
people no longer need to reproach us with these 12 years - they don t relate to our identity nowadays , gauland said , referring to the nazi era .
he said the battle of verdun during world war one belonged to german history , as did erwin rommel , the world war two field marshal celebrated as the desert fox , and army officer claus von stauffenberg , who led an unsuccessful attempt to assassinate hitler in july 1944 with a bomb hidden in a briefcase .
gauland said germany needed to reclaim its history .
if the french are rightly proud of their emperor and the britons of nelson and churchill , we have the right to be proud of the achievements of the german soldiers in two world wars , gauland said .
the afd did not immediately respond to a request for comment .
in january , bjoern hoecke , the afd s chief in the eastern state of thuringia , provoked outrage for describing the holocaust memorial in berlin as a monument of shame and for demanding a 180 degree turnaround in the way germany seeks to atone for nazi crimes .
