paris ( reuters ) - former finalist simona halep survived a first-set wobble to reach the third round of the french open for only the second time in her career with a 7-6 ( 5 ) 6-2 win over kazakhstan ’ s zarina diyas on wednesday .
the romanian sixth seed surrendered her serve twice in the opening four games to trail 4-1 but delved into her wealth of experience to finally subdue her 90th-ranked opponent 7-5 in the tie break .
more exchanges of breaks followed in the second set before halep finally found her groove to take a 5-2 lead and set up three match points on diyas ’ serve .
the first one went begging but halep ’ s gritty baseline play paid off in the next point as diyas bowed out after flicking a forehand long to end a 10-shot rally .
“ the first set was very tough and i was very nervous as i seemed to be fighting for every point , ” halep said in a court side interview .
the good news for halep is that the only previous time she reached the last 32 , she made it all the way to the 2014 roland garros final .
halep and her bizarre black and white zebra print dress will be back on court on friday when she takes on japan ’ s naomi osaka for a place in the fourth round .
