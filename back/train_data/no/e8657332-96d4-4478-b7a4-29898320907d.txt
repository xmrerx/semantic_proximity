beirut ( reuters ) - lebanese president michel aoun said on sunday that saad al-hariri s freedom was being restricted in riyadh , the first time the lebanese government has publicly declared its belief that saudi arabia is holding its prime minister against his will .
aoun said hariri was living in mysterious circumstances in riyadh which had reached the degree of restricting ( his ) freedom and imposing conditions on his residency and on contact with him even by members of his family .
reuters cited senior lebanese government officials on thursday saying that the authorities believed hariri was being held against his will in riyadh , where he unexpectedly resigned as prime minister on nov. 4 , the day after arriving there .
aoun said this threw doubt over anything that hariri has said , or will say , and his statements could not be considered as an expression of his full free will .
hariri is expected to give a televised interview later on sunday .
saudi arabia has denied hariri is being held against his will or that he had been forced to resign .
