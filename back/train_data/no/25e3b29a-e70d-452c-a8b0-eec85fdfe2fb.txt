ankara ( reuters ) - a turkish court has remanded in custody for another two months 21 of the 30 journalists and newspaper executives from turkish newspaper zaman which was shut down after last year s failed coup , broadcaster cnn turk said on tuesday .
the former employees of the zaman newspaper are charged with membership of an armed terror organization and attempting to overthrow the government , parliament and the constitutional order through their links to cleric fethullah gulen .
zaman was affiliated with gulen , the u.s.-based cleric and former ally of president tayyip erdogan .
gulen is blamed by ankara for instigating the failed july 2016 coup , but denies any involvement .
zaman was first seized by the turkish government in march 2016 before the coup attempt , and then closed down by a government decree .
the indictment calls for three consecutive life sentences for the zaman staff on charges of attempting to overthrow the constitutional order , the turkish parliament and the turkish government , and says the newspaper exceeded the limits of press freedom and freedom of expression .
