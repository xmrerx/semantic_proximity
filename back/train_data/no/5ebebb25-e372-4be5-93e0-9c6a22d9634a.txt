it looks as though ted cruz is really proud of himself for everything he believes he is doing for the nation as he is running for president .
on monday , he sent out a campaign email explaining all the sacrifices he s making as he s on the campaign trail .
he said , the sacrifices for our campaign are steep , but i m proud to be making them on your behalf .
then he goes on to list the sacrifices : now , i don t know about you , but i needed a barf bag to get through his list of sacrifices .
someone else who was not at all impressed with cruz s complaints about life for the good of his campaign is senator elizabeth warren from the great state of massachusetts .
she saw his list of sacrifices and took to twitter faster than a locomotive to let him know a thing or two about real sacrifice.yesterday @ tedcruz sent a campaign email whining about the significant sacrifice he s made to run for president .
