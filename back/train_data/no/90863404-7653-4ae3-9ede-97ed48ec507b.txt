dem sherrod brown and gop senator orrin hatch go at it !
they were discussing the tax plan and hatch let brown know he doesn t appreciate the class warfare propaganda the middle class wins with trump tax plan : the senate s plan to rewrite the tax code would go much further than a competing house proposal toward making good on republican promises to focus on the middle class , a new report shows.moderate-income people would consistently see the largest percentage declines in their tax bills , according to an analysis released late saturday by the official , nonpartisan joint committee on taxation.in 2019 , people in the middle of the income spectrum , earning between $ 50,000 and $ 70,000 , would see their taxes fall by 7.1 percent .
those earning between $ 20,000 and $ 30,000 would see a 10.4 percent decline , the report shows , while millionaires would get a 5.3 percent tax cut.unlike with the house plan , that trend holds up throughout the period over which jct analyzed the senate proposal .
in 2027 , for example , millionaires would get a 2.8 percent tax cut from the senate plan , compared with a 6.1 percent decline for people in the middle and a 10.3 percent reduction for those earning between $ 20,000 and $ 30,000.how republicans tax plans would affect people in different income groups has been a hotly contested issue in congress , with the gop contending its plans are aimed at the middle class while democrats call them a giveaway to the rich.the house proposal would have a muddled impact on people in different income groups , jct found earlier this month .
at first , modest-income people would be its biggest winners , but the outlook changes after the first few years .
some modest-income people would face tax increases under the house plan , jct found , and by 2027 , millionaires would be its biggest winners.the analysis of the senate plan , which the finance committee plans to formally take up on monday , shows people in every income cohort receiving a tax cut on average , though it did not examine whether some people within those groups would face tax increases .
