Green Party candidate Jill Stein successfully requested, and paid for, the Wisconsin recount while her attempts for similar statewide recounts in Pennsylvania and Michigan were blocked by the courts.
Stein only got about 1 percent of the vote in each of the states that Trump narrowly won on his way to the White House.
She argued, without evidence, that voting machines in all three states were susceptible to hacking.A Green Party representative said the voting wasn t fair but failed to say exactly why Could it be that it wasn t fair because Jill Stein didn t win?
It s laughable and pitiful that these people have been able to hijack the election results.
