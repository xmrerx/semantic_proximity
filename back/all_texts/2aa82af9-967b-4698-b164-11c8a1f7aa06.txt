This should come as a surprise to no one Yesterday was the 15th anniversary of the worst terror attack in history, in which 15 Saudi citizens, among 19 Muslim hijackers, murdered nearly 3,000 Americans on 9/11.Barack Obama s White House announced today they are spitting right in 9-11 victims faces.The U.S. Congress passed a bill unanimously that would allow families of 9/11 victims to sue governments like Saudi Arabia who we now know for certain were involved in the attack.The bill went right to President Obama s desk.But today, the White House announced Obama will VETO the bill.Unbelievable.From CNN:President Barack Obama will veto a bill that would allow terror victims of the attacks on September 11, 2001, to sue Saudi Arabia, the White House said Monday.
That s the plan, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said when asked if the President planned to veto the bill, saying it would complicate diplomatic relations.
Earnest defended the administration s stance against the bill saying it is not an effective, forceful way for us to respond to terrorism.
Lawmakers are expected to attempt to override the veto, and if successful, would mark the first time in Obama s presidency.Utterly disgraceful, even for Obama.
Now his infamous bow to the Saudi king takes on a new, and sickening meaning.In April, a senior Saudi prince urged Americans not to vote for Donald Trump in the upcoming general election, after Trump promised to blow the lid off secret documents proving that the Saudi government helped plan the 9/11 Attacks.Via: Top Right News
