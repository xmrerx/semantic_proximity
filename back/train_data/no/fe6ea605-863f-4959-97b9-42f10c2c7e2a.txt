donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) january 2 , 2017this is the book cover : get the 2017 inaugural edition of cnn s book unprecedented in stores or online https : //t.co/3ix857a9e5 pic.twitter.com/m23kfq7y49 cnn politics ( @ cnnpolitics ) january 2 , 2017this isn t the first time trump put his massive ego on display .
he never learns .
in late november , he yelled at reporters for using a picture of him which showed his multiple chins .
ever since , people have been tweeting out the image he dislikes so much .
well , it s happening again.the internet responded to the tragically insecure president-elect s tweet with impunity .
twitter users are looking for the picture in question .
( psst : it s in the above linked tweet ) .this is apparently the photo the mirror-gazer in chief hates .
make sure not to retweet it !

pic.twitter.com/kpoukpcniq matthew d ambrosio ( @ drmattdambrosio ) january 2 , 2017the reason for his meltdown , as brian stelter explains , was likely because he was on cnn talking about the unprecedented book and trump s doubts he would win .
then he tweets about both .
coincidences ?
