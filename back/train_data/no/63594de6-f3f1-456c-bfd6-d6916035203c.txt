wake up america !
muslim terrorists , refugees hand-selected by un or foreign citizens who are unwilling to assimilate with american culture , laws and values doesn t appear anywhere in the quote by emma lazarus that is mounted on our statue of liberty : give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , the wretched refuse of your teeming shore .
send these , the homeless , tempest-tossed , to me : i lift my lamp beside the golden door .
after the hayride broke the exclusive story on 10,000 syrian refugees possibly resettling in baton rouge , lafayette and metairie , it has now come to light that refugees are already coming into the new orleans area.catholic charities , which receive federal grants from u.s. department of state/bureau of population , refugees and migration , have apparently taken in two syrian refugee families already and are expecting many more.there are approximately 180 cities in the country that are eligible to accept the 10,000 syrian refugees .
here is the full list of those cities , which includes baton rouge , matairie and lafayette : us refugee public affiliate directorythen , once the refugees arrive in the country , they could be dispersed across the 180 cities listed above , where they are to aided within the first 30 to 90 days in settling and finding employment in the area.after approximately 90 days , refugees are no longer eligible for the state department-funded support that they were receiving through migrant and refugee services .
however , they are able to join support programs through the department of health and human services.additionally , it is unclear how much the screening process for the 10,000 syrian refugees will cost american taxpayers.widespread welfarehowever , the narrative by the national media tends to be one where immigrants and migrants are portrayed as coming to america and not taking any sort of federal government help .
in our research , we found that to be the biggest fallacy of all when it comes to the immigration and migrant issue.in a report by the congressional office of refugee resettlement , nearly 92 percent of refugees in the country were on food stamps between 2008-2013 .
additionally , 73 percent of refugees were on medicaid , 68 percent were receiving some kind of cash welfare almost 20 percent were in public housing.as americans continue to debate what to do about the humanitarian crisis in the middle east , this analysis attempts to estimate the costs of resettling refugees from that region in the united states .
although we do not consider all costs , our best estimate is that in their first five years in the united states each refugee from the middle east costs taxpayers $ 64,370 12 times what the un estimates it costs to care for one refugee in neighboring middle eastern countries.the cost of resettlement includes heavy welfare use by middle eastern refugees ; 91 percent receive food stamps and 68 percent receive cash assistance .
costs also include processing refugees , assistance given to new refugees , and aid to refugee-receiving communities .
given the high costs of resettling refugees in the united states , providing for them in neighboring countries in the middle east may be a more cost-effective way to help them .
via : the hayrideamong the findings of this analysis : on average , each middle eastern refugee resettled in the united states costs an estimated $ 64,370 in the first five years , or $ 257,481 per household.the un high commissioner for refugees ( unhcr ) has requested $ 1,057 to care for each syrian refugee annually in most countries neighboring syria.for what it costs to resettle one middle eastern refugee in the united states for five years , about 12 refugees can be helped in the middle east for five years , or 61 refugees can be helped for one year.unhcr reports a gap of $ 2.5 billion in funding that it needs to care for approximately four million syrians in neighboring countries.the five-year cost of resettling about 39,000 syrian refugees in the united states is enough to erase the current unhcr funding gap.the five-year costs of resettlement in the united states include $ 9,230 spent by the office of refugee resettlement ( orr ) within hhs and the bureau of population , refugees , and migration ( prm ) within the state department in the first year , as well as $ 55,139 in expenditures on welfare and education.very heavy use of welfare programs by middle eastern refugees , and the fact that they have only 10.5 years of education on average , makes it likely that it will be many years , if ever , before this population will cease to be a net fiscal drain on public coffers using more in public services than they pay in taxes.it is worth adding that orr often reports that most refugees are self-sufficient within five years .
however , orr defines self-sufficiency as not receiving cash welfare .
a household is still considered self-sufficient even if it is using any number of non-cash programs such as food stamps , public housing , or medicaid.refugees are admitted for humanitarian reasons , not because they are supposed to be self-sufficient , so the drain on public coffers that middle eastern refugees create is expected .
however , given limited resources , the high cost of resettlement in the united states means careful consideration should be given to alternatives to resettlement if the goal is the help as many people possible .
