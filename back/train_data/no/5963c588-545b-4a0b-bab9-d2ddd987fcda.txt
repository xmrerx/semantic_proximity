beirut ( reuters ) - the syrian national coalition , a group fighting the syrian government , said on wednesday it opposed a russian-sponsored congress of syrian groups , calling it an attempt to circumvent u.n.-backed geneva peace talks that aim for a political transition for the war-torn country .
the coalition will not participate in any negotiations with the regime outside geneva or without u.n. sponsorship , snc spokesman ahmad ramadan told reuters .
russia s call for a conference for syrians in sochi is an attempt to circumvent geneva and the international desire for a political transition in syria in accordance with u.n. security council resolutions , the turkey-based snc said .
