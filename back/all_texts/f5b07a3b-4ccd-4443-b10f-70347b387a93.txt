It appears that a hacker had a bit of fun with McDonald s corporate Twitter account Thursday morning.
You are actually a disgusting excuse of a President and we would love to have Barack Obama back, also you have tiny hands, the account tweeted to Donald Trump and whichever nameless hero did it even pinned the tweet.Apparently, the hacker wanted to take the opportunity to make a completely accurate statement about Trump but The Donald s fans will surely be boycotting the fast food giant by buying cheeseburgers and writing TRUMP on the wrapper or something stupid like when they tried to boycott Starbucks by buying coffee.Naturally, the internet is lovin it :Can't wait for @realDonaldTrump to tell us McDonald's is overrated and that he doesn't even eat mcdonalds.

We deleted the tweet, secured our account and are now investigating this.
