MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico’s finance ministry will evaluate whether to make fiscal changes in response to the U.S. tax reform, according to a document seen by Reuters on Friday.
In the document, the ministry said Mexico would not make changes that left it with a higher public sector deficit.
“Nevertheless, there will be an assessment of whether modifications should be made to Mexico’s fiscal framework,” the document said.
