ankara ( reuters ) - a turkish teacher who has been on hunger strike for months to protest about losing his job in the government s purge since a failed coup attempt last year , has been released from jail pending her trial on terrorism-related charges .
defence lawyers said primary school teacher semih ozakca , 28 , was released , but another detainee , literature professor nuriye gulmen , 35 , who has also survived for seven months on water , herbal tea and sugar and salt solutions , was remanded in custody .
the ankara court released ozakca on condition that he wears an ankle monitor .
gulmen , who has been hospitalized due to her worsening health , was ordered to remain in custody until the trial , which resumes on nov. 17 .
the pair began their hunger strike before being jailed .
a court ordered their detention pending trial after ruling that their protest was being conducted on behalf of an outlawed far-left group , dhkp-c .
both deny any links to the group .
the teachers said their hunger strike aimed to highlight the plight of some 150,000 state employees - including academics , civil servants , judges and soldiers - suspended or sacked since the abortive coup in july 2016 .
turkish authorities blame the coup attempt on u.s.-based muslim cleric fethullah gulen and his supporters .
gulen denies involvement .
human rights groups and the european union have said president tayyip erdogan is using the crackdown to stifle dissent in turkey , something he denies .
