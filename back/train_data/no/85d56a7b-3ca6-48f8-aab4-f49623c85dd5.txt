moscow ( reuters ) - russia should scrap the 13 percent profit tax on funds repatriated from abroad and renew an amnesty from penalties for businesses returning capital , as washington moves toward tougher sanctions , president vladimir putin said on monday .
amid huge capital outflows in 2014 , deteriorating relations with the west over the ukraine conflict and weak oil prices , moscow offered the amnesty for those returning capital to russia .
the amnesty , which expired in mid-2016 , scrapped responsibility for past taxes and currency violations for those who declared assets abroad .
but few agreed to take part in the amnesty .
russian finance minister anton siluanov said on friday that his ministry was proposing such an amnesty be restored in 2018 for at least a year .
speaking at the meeting with the leadership of the russian parliament , putin said he had two proposals which he had not previously spoken about publicly .
the first is to extend the amnesty timeline , i mean external restrictions are not easing , but , on the contrary , tending to rise , he said .
u.s. president donald trump signed into law a new package of sanctions in august .
one provision asked the u.s. treasury secretary to submit a report on the impact of expanding sanctions to cover russian sovereign debt , with an outcome expected as early as february .
putin s second proposal was to scrap 13 percent taxes for transfers of capital to russia by businesses .
among other tools to encourage the return of money will be a special bonds program .
russia plans to adjust the terms of a sovereign eurobond issue next year so that businesses can use the bonds to repatriate funds in a way that would protect them from being damaged by new sanctions on moscow .
reuters reported earlier this month that wealthy russians facing the prospect of targeted u.s. sanctions next year had floated the idea of a special treasury bond to help create favorable conditions for them to bring their cash home .
