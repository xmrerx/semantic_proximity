ever since he began his run for president , donald trump and his poorly educated ( his words , not mine ) followers have boasted that the 2016 gop nominee has self-funded and will continue to self-fund his campaign ( though he has accepted donations the entire time , and has in actuality been loaning his campaign money ) .
i don t think it is fair to say that a person is self-funding if a significant share of those contributions come from someone other than the candidate , rick hasen , an expert in election and campaign finance law at the university of california irvine , said of trump s claims that he is self-funding his efforts .
nor do i think a candidate who loans money to his campaign , but who expects to be paid back by the campaign , is fairly characterized as self-funding .
while it may not have been fair before , new developments reveal it to be an outright lie , not that trump supporters will care .
on saturday morning , the trump campaign sent out an emergency email begging his vapid followers to give him a whopping $ 100,000 by the end of the day .
right now we re facing an emergency goal of $ 100,000 to help get our ads on the air .
we need your contribution by 11:59 p.m. tonight , the email reads .
crooked hillary is about to invade your tv with ads attacking mr. trump .
but we re preparing to fight back .
trump is desperate .
with his poll numbers in a free-fall , with a civil war brewing in the gop , and with trump finally facing the reality that he will lose in november if he makes it to november , the facade is falling away .
all that is left is the truth that donald trump is a conman whose worth as a candidate matches his worth as a human being .
both , of course , are severely lacking.featured image via getty images/branden camp
