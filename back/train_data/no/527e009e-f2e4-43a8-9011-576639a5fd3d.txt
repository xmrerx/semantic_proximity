london ( reuters ) - a 102-year-old man given a suspended sentence on monday for sexually abusing a girl in the 1970s is thought to be the oldest person convicted of a crime in britain , prosecutors said .
douglas hammersley was given a two-year suspended sentence after pleading guilty to three counts of indecent assault .
the crown prosecution service said the incidents took place in the buckinghamshire area , to the west of london , when the victim was between five and eight years old .
we were able to prosecute hammersley thanks to the victim coming forward , even though the offences were committed more than four decades ago , said jennie laskar-hall , senior prosecutor for the cps .
in december , a 101-year-old man was jailed for 13 years for a string of historical sex crimes against two young sisters and their brother .
police said he was the oldest person to have been found guilty of a crime in british legal history .
