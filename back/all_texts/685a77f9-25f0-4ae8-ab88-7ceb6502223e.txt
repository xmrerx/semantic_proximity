Remember when comedians were funny?
Those were the good ole days, before the cancer that is liberalism exposed their hatred for anyone who doesn t agree with them Actor-comedian George Lopez sent a message to President Donald Trump: instead of deporting Latinos to make America s streets safer, he should deport the police.
In a post published on his Instagram Friday, Lopez is seen standing next to a caption that reads, The Trump administration is deporting Latinos to make the streets safer You wanna make the streets safer deport the police.
The former Lopez Tonight host also said, This is not an indictment of all Law Enforcement , some still just beat you #gacho #georgelopezonhbo #TheWall ( @momorodriguez #gracias.
Lopez s Instagram account is now set to private, but an archive of the post can still be found online.The Instagram caption caused outrage among many of the comedian s fans.
This is a very irresponsible comment bro.
You have really disappointed me bro, I thought you were better than that, wrote one commenter, who claimed to be a police officer.
Not cool @georgelopez.
I m Latina and I ve been pulled over more than enough times for speeding.
All but one cop were nice and respectful, wrote another user.
I realize there are some bad apples in the bunch but your statement puts all cops in the bad bunch category.
Please stick to comedy.
You re not that funny when you bring politics into your posts.
Another commenter wrote, Keep calm george i got two brothers that are police officer ..and we are Mexican/Americans.. A couple weeks later at a show in Phoenix, Arizona, the comedian led a crowd in a chant of fuck that puto.
(Puto is Spanish slang for male whore.)
Breitbart NewsPrior to the general election a TMZ interviewer asked comedian and actor George Lopez if Trump had any chance of winning the election (2:20 mark).
Lopez replied, Yeah, sure.
There s enough racists in this country to get him elected It s unfortunate.
Lopez then stated that if Trump wins, He won t have to worry about immigration, we ll all go back.
Lopez of course, chose to remain in the United States of America.Feb.
2017: Lopez was just caught on tape making racist comments about black people during one of his comedy stints (see video below).When a woman in the audience objected, Lopez went off on an unbelievable, vile rant against her ***WARNING***Strong language*** There are only two rules in the Latino family.
Don t marry somebody black, and don t park in front of our house, Lopez said during his set, which prompted a woman in the audience to put up her middle finger.In a clip of the incident obtained by TMZ, Lopez is seen responding to the woman s gesture by calling her a bitch and telling her, Sit your f**king ass down or get the f**k out.
Sit your f**king ass down, Lopez repeated three times.
I m talking, bitch.
You paid to see a show.
Sit your ass down.
You can t take a joke, you re in the wrong motherf**king place.
Sit your f**king ass down or get the f**k out of here.
You have two choices, he continued.
Shut the f**k up or get the f**k out.
I ll tell you what.
I ll make the choice for you.
Get the f**k out of here.
I ll make the choice for you.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Perhaps George Lopez and Kathy Griffen can find one of those jobs Americans won t do when nobody will hire the formerly funny comedians
