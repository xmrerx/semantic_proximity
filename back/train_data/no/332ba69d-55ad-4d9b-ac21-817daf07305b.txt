old navy posted a completely innocent photo of an interracial family to twitter over the weekend .
despite the fact that is 2016 , racists almost instantly began attacking old navy for helping to support white genocide .
this just proves once again that any type of inclusion in society terrifies racists.here is the photo that ruined every racists day .
the photo simply shows an interracial family standing together , in the way almost every family seems to pose for an old navy advertisement.oh , happy day !
our # thankyouevent is finally here .

those who believe in it think that racial equality is a covert attempt to exterminate the white race .
they view any display of racial diversity as a part of a giant brainwashing scheme cooked up by people who hate white people .
of course , displays of racial diversity are really just showing the reality of the world .
reality being something these racist trolls seem to have completely distanced themselves from.my family and i will never step into an @ oldnavy store again .
this miscegenation junk is rammed down our throats from every direction .

pic.twitter.com/i9oiyq0fux tiara henderson ( @ disneymommy22 ) may 2 , 2016it s sad that these racist clowns exist in the first place but they do have a tendency to bring out some of the most beautiful responses to their ignorance .
as martin luther king jr. famously said darkness can not drive out darkness ; only light can do that .
hate can not drive out hate ; only love can do that .
what could possibly be more beautiful than family ? thank you once again social media .
you re the only thing that can both destroy a person s faith in humanity and restore it in just a few minutes.featured image from twitter
