republican presidential candidate donald trump decided to attack the family of a u.s. soldier who died in combat in iraq .
responding to khizr khan s statement at the democratic convention that trump had sacrificed nothing for his country while pushing for bans on muslims , trump told abc , i think i ve made a lot of sacrifices .
i work very , very hard .

humayun khan was a muslim immigrant who died serving in iraq in 2004.on twitter , the dismissive , callous , and insensitive remarks from the former reality tv star and self-described billionaire ( an assertion that has not been independently verified ) were quickly attacked.the hashtag # trumpsacrifices became the top trending hashtag in the world and thousands of posts mocking trump followed.many of the posts associated with the tag pointed out trump s well documented luxury life that has been the selling point of his presidential run.once survived an entire weekend at mar-a-lago with just one can of hairspray .

trump received military deferments during vietnam and has compared avoiding sexually transmitted diseases to serving in combat.gave up his 5 spots in the military for another 5 men .
that 's generous !
no one thanked him # trumpsacrifices sarah ( @ redpainter1 ) july 30 , 2016despite the public outcry and condemnation of his comments , senior republican officials like speaker paul ryan and senate majority leader mitch mcconnell failed to directly condemn the nominee s attack on a military family , and did not rescind their support for the candidate.featured image via screen capture
