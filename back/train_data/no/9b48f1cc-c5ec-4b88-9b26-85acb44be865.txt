the university of chicago s admissions office is offering a reward to its student tour guides who can dispel the notion among prospective students and their families that the city is unsafe and scary .
in an email obtained by the chicago maroon , colleen belak , the assistant director of admissions at the university , offered a $ 500 cash prize to those who find a creative way to dispel the negative perception about chicago s violence epidemic .
fox if you ve paid attention to the national news ( or donald trump s tweets ) over the last few months , you ll notice that the city of chicago is often painted with a broad brush as an unsafe or scary place to reside , belak wrote to the campus tour guide listhost .
of course , certain realities should not be ignored , but at the end of the day most of us are proud chicago residents with a deep love of the city .
with that spirit in mind , we have an opportunity for you to win some money $ 500 to be exact .
if you are able to come up with a creative way to approach this negative perception , be it a video series , blog post , photo , or something else ( and better ) entirely keep in mind that the audience is a high school student and his/her family .
