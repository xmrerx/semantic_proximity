Obama told CBS News March 7, 2015 that he did not know about Clinton s private email while she was his secretary of state from Jan. 21, 2009 to Feb. 1, 2013.Q: Mr. President, when did you first learn that Hillary Clinton used an email system outside the U.S. government for official business while she was secretary of state?Obama: The same time everybody else learned it through news reports.President Barack Obama used a pseudonym in email communications with Hillary Clinton and others, according to FBI records made public Friday.The disclosure came as the FBI released its second batch of documents from its investigation into Clinton s private email server during her tenure as secretary of state.The 189 pages the bureau released includes interviews with some of Clinton s closest aides, such as Huma Abedin and Cheryl Mills; senior State Department officials; and even Marcel Lazar, better known as the Romanian hacker Guccifer.
In an April 5, 2016 interview with the FBI, Abedin was shown an email exchange between Clinton and Obama, but the longtime Clinton aide did not recognize the name of the sender.

the report says.
Abedin then expressed her amazement at the president s use of a pseudonym and asked if she could have a copy of the email.
The State Department has refused to make public that and other emails Clinton exchanged with Obama.
Lawyers have cited the presidential communications privilege, a variation of executive privilege, in order to withhold the messages under the Freedom of Information Act.
The report doesn t provide more details on the contents of that particular email exchange, but says it took place on June 28, 2012, and had the subject line: Re: Congratulations.
