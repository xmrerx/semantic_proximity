tampa , fla. ( reuters ) - defense secretary jim mattis said on wednesday that the military was looking into what changes , if any , should be made after an ambush in niger killed four u.s. soldiers last week .
the incident , which u.s. officials suspect was carried out by a local islamic state affiliate , has thrown a spotlight on the u.s. counterterrorism mission in the west african country .
mattis , addressing the incident for the first time publicly , said the ambush had taken place in an area where the enemy has not operated before and that the patrol had been hit hard .
he said french aircraft were overhead within 30 minutes and that he did not believe there was a delay in evacuating those wounded and killed , although he did not say how long it took to move them .
we will look at this and say was there something we have to adapt to now , should we have been in a better stance , you know , autopsy , you always find a lot out in them , mattis told reporters on board a military plane .
we re not complacent , we re going to do better , he added .
from initial accounts , the 40-member patrol , which included about a dozen u.s. troops , came under a swift attack by militants riding in a dozen vehicles and on about 20 motorcycles .
at least four nigeriens were also killed and , according to one niger security source , militants seized four vehicles in the ambush .
a diplomat with knowledge of the incident said french officials were frustrated by the u.s. troops actions , saying they had acted on only limited intelligence and without contingency plans in place .
u.s. forces do not have a direct combat mission in niger , but their assistance to its army includes intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance in their efforts to target violent extremist organizations .
