the arizona republican s verbal put-down of dictator kim jong un earlier this month this crazy fat kid was met with a stiff , angry response from the communist regime , which warned mccain of dire consequences to follow .
as such guys as john mccain and ted cruz made a provocation tantamount to declaration of war against the korea , the dprk will take steps to counter it , said an official dprk statement , published by the korean central news agency .
they will have to bitterly experience the disastrous consequences to be entailed by their reckless tongue-lashing and then any regret for it will come too late .
the statement , also coming in the wake of cruz s efforts to label north korea as a state sponsor of terror , went on to characterize mccain and cruz as being like a puppy knowing no fear of the tiger .
mccain , in a wednesday tweet , responded : what , did they want me to call him a crazy skinny kid ?
kim jong un , the 33-year-old strongman who presides over a starving populace , is estimated to weigh upwards of 275 pounds and reportedly suffers from gout.mccain made the crack about the tubby tinhorn during a march 22 interview in which he also advocated pressuring china into helping moderate the increasingly hostile behavior of north korea .
china is the only one that can control kim jong un , this crazy fat kid that s running north korea , mccain said on msnbc .
they could stop north korea s economy in a week .
