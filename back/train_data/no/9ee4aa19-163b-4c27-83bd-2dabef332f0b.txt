ottawa ( reuters ) - the united states sees no urgent need for a new energy pipeline between canada and the united states , u.s. secretary of state john kerry said on wednesday , in a broadcast interview ahead of a visit to washington by prime minister justin trudeau .
the u.s. government will evaluate new proposals individually , but is looking at new , cleaner technologies , kerry said to the canadian broadcasting corp. “ we have some 300 pipelines , it ’ s not as if we ’ re pipeline-less , ” kerry said , according to a story on the broadcaster ’ s website .
“ things change , technologies in particular help to change things , and we need to push the technology curve. ” trudeau will attend a state dinner on thursday , becoming the first canadian leader to do so since 1997 , as the two countries aim to fix a frayed relationship .
u.s. president barack obama last year blocked the cross-border keystone xl crude oil pipeline proposed by transcanada corp in a victory for environmentalists .
