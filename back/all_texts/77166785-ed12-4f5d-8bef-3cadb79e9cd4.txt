STREET ART HAS APPEARED on the streets surrounding ABC News Good Morning America studios in New York City.
The posters feature Hillary Clinton with a smiling George Stephanopoulos, the ABC News anchor under fire for failing to disclose $75,000 in donations to the Clinton Foundation, along with the words Pay Pal and Donate.
They were posted near ABC News studios on Peter Jennings Way in Manhattan.
