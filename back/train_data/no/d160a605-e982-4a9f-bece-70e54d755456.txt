bob casey jr. ( d-pa. ) on sunday warned special counsel robert mueller against issuing a report on his findings in the ongoing investigation of russian interference in the 2016 election near the upcoming 2018 midterm elections.speaking to radio host john catsimatidis on new york radio station am 970 , casey said he couldn t make any assumptions about where the mueller investigation is going in light of indictments issued on friday .
but he added that he would recommend mueller not release a report on his findings near the midterms when it would distract from elections or cause people to question the election s integrity .
i don t think we ll know anywhere near the full story until [ mueller ] issues his report , casey said .
but once you get into the summer , and you get close to the election , i think it s a mistake for him to release it late .
i think you should wait until after [ the election ] casey said .
