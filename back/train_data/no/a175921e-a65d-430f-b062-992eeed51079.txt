president trump visited michigan to promote the auto industry and jobs .
while he was at willow run , he had a chance for a photo with the governor of michigan .
a priceless exchange happened between trump and snyder .
trump looked over and asked the governor to come over even though you didn t endorse me .
the best part is when trump says , i never forget hahaha !
people from michigan will appreciate this because snyder is a republican governor who in reality is a democrat .
he refused to endorse trump during the election !
when trump held his very last rally in grand rapids , michigan , snyder was a no-show .
what a putz !
this is why we love trump he calls em as he sees em !
