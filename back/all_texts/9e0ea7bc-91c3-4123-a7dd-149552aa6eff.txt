Kaya Jones, aka Chrystal Neria, the former member of The Pussycat Dolls, was on stage last night with Jason Aldean in Las Vegas.
She was not on stage when the 64-year old shooter opened fire on the crowd below in what is now the worst mass shooting in U.S. history.We were all on that stage tonight.
Every kind of American was in attendance.
Moments later people where shot.It could have been us.
KAYA (@KayaJones) October 2, 2017Only 2 weeks ago, Kaya Jones and Joy Villa were forced to cancel their appearance at the Free Speech Week event in Berkeley, CA over what they called serious and specific death threats on both of their lives.Authorities are still working to uncover a motive for the horrific shooting attack that left 50 people dead and over 200 people wounded by gunshots.
Meanwhile, the fact that Kaya Jones was on the same stage where the mass shooting took place after receiving several serious death threats cannot and should not be overlooked.
The hateful and vile rhetoric by Hollywood, by our so-called educators, by Democrats in Congress and by leftist hate groups like Black Lives Matter and Antifa for our President and any American who dares to support him, has reached a fever-pitch.Watch as Kaya Jones and Joy Villa tell Sean Hannity how their lives have been threatened and how Hollywood liberals and YouTube have been punishing both of them for supporting President Trump.Watch:Here is Kaya s periscope message to her fans and friends, where she lets them know she is okay after the unimaginable violent act by the now deceased 64-yr. old who we will intentionally not name.https://t.co/xdV8PMifOd KAYA (@KayaJones) October 2, 2017Watch, as Hollywood does their part to inspire hatred for our President.
