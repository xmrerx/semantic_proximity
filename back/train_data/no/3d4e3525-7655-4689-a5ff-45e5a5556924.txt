washington ( reuters ) - president barack obama believes congress will lift an embargo on cuba under the next president , whether a republican or a democrat , he said in an interview with cnn espanol that was broadcast on monday .
obama , who will make a historic trip to cuba next week , said there was not enough support among lawmakers to lift the embargo now , but sentiment was moving in that direction in both parties .
“ my strong prediction is that sometime in the next president ’ s administration , whether they are a democrat or a republican , that the embargo in fact will be removed , ” he said in the interview , according to a transcript .
the interview was conducted last week .
“ it makes sense for us to be able to sell into cuba , to do business with cubans , to show us business practices and how we treat workers and how we approach issues of human rights , that will help bring about the kinds of changes that are needed , ” he said .
obama leaves office next january .
