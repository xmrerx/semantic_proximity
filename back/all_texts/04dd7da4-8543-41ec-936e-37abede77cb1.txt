New documents appear to show a pattern of deterioration of security at the State Department under Hillary Clinton.
The State Department s compliance with federal cybersecurity standards was below average when Clinton took over but grew worse in each year of her tenure, according to an annual report card compiled by the White House based on audits by agency watchdogs.
Network security continued to slip after Kerry replaced Clinton in February 2013, and remains substandard, according to the State Department inspector general.In each year from 2011 to 2014, the State Department s poor cybersecurity was identified by the inspector general as a significant deficiency that put the department s information at risk.
The latest assessment is due to be published in a few weeks.Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, has been criticized for her use of a private email server for official business while she was secretary of state.
