dhaka ( reuters ) - bangladesh s opposition leader , former prime minister khaleda zia , returned home on wednesday to a rapturous welcome from her supporters after more than three months away for medical treatment in britain .
bangladeshi politics has been mired for years in rivalry between khaleda and prime minister sheikh hasina , and khaleda s return could herald an increase in political activity in preparation for a general election due by the end of next year .
both women are related to former national leaders , and they have alternated as prime minister for years .
in khaleda s absence , at least two arrest warrants were issued against her in connection with political turbulence and she was already on bail over several cases .
her lawyers have dismissed the cases as harassment but a spokesman for her bangladesh nationalist party ( bnp ) mohammad shamsuddin , said she might appear in court on thursday in connection with the cases .
mohammad shahidul huq , inspector general of police , told reporters he had no instructions to arrest her .
hundreds of party supporters waving placards and banners gathered outside the international airport in the capital , dhaka , to welcome her home .
bangladesh is struggling to cope with an influx of more than half a million rohingya muslim refuges from myanmar since late august and the crisis could become a divisive issue in the run-up to the election .
