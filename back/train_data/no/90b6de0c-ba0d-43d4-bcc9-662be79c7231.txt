( reuters ) - former new york city mayor michael bloomberg said on monday he will not enter the race for u.s. president in november , because it was clear he could not win and he did not want to risk enabling a victory by republicans donald trump or ted cruz .
last month the financial times quoted bloomberg as saying he found the campaign discussions “ distressingly banal ” and considering running for president .
bloomberg said in a online column that in a three-way race , no candidate was likely to win a majority of electoral votes , handing the choice to the congress .
