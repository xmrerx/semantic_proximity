It was 1991 when Trump testified to Congress about that irrational exuberance as he complained that monetary policy was pushing money into international markets, while construction was being restricted.
Trump said then, watch markets and if housing/building gets too loose, it could be reined in then.
But instead they never reined it in and Dem s like Raines and Gorelick helped push NINJA loans and got their bonuses by selling their junk as AAA to average Joes.
you create jobs, you create so many other things, incentive has to be put back in to the construction of things that are needed, such as housing Trump in 91.
Trump was for keeping jobs in America back in the 1980 s even;
