berlin ( reuters ) - germany regards friday s joint report on progress made in the negotiations on britain s departure from the european union as a step forward but believes much work remains even if the initial stage of brexit talks is concluded , a spokesman said .
i think everyone understands that there is still much work for negotiators to do even if the european council decides to move into phase two of brexit negotiations , german government spokesman steffen seibert told a regular news conference on friday .
he added that the second phase would be highly complex .
the leaders of the other 27 eu countries are due to decide next friday whether to accept the european commission s recommendation that sufficient progress has been made on exit talks to begin discussions on britain s future relationship with the bloc .
