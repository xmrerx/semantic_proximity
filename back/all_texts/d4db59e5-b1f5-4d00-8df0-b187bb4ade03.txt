(Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has issued waivers on certain federal requirements for the sale, production and blending of gasoline to avoid supply shortfalls in the aftermath of Tropical Storm Harvey and as Hurricane Irma approaches Florida, the agency said Thursday.
The EPA said winter-grade gasoline will be allowed to be sold through September 15 in most states in the country other than those on the West Coast and in the Rocky Mountains.
It also temporarily waived federal requirements covering the production and blending of winter gasoline through September 26, it said.
