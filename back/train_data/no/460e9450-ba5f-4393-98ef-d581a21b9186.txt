tunis ( reuters ) - the tunisian navy rescued 98 tunisians fleeing to europe when their boat started to sink off kerkenah on the southeast coast late on saturday , the national guard said .
separately , the army said it had arrested 43 illegal migrants rescued from four boats off zarzis , also on the southeast coast .
tunisia has been praised for its democratic progress after a 2011 uprising against autocrat zine el-abidine ben ali but successive governments have failed to create jobs for young people , some of whom head illegally to europe to seek work .
tunisia arrested about 550 tunisian and african migrants trying to sail to europe in september , against only 170 in august , official data showed on thursday .
human traffickers increasingly use tunisia as a launch pad for migrants heading for europe as libya s coast guard , aided by armed groups , has tightened controls .
the water leaked to a boat carrying 98 migrants , when it was sinking , but the naval guard rescued them off the coast of kerkenah , colonel major khelifa chibani of tunisia s national guard said .
