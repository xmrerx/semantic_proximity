After former Acting Attorney General Sally Yates bravely stood up to intimidation attempts from President* Trump and testified that The Donald s administration is shady as f*ck, Donald Trump put his Twitter thumbs to work attempting to distract from his collusion from Russia with a mix of lies, untruths, and fabrications.Trump claimed that James Clapper confirmed that there is no evidence of collusion with Russia (he didn t), that Sally Yates provided nothing of value (she did), that the Trump-Russia story is a hoax (it isn t), and that the biggest story is his ridiculous claim that Obama tapped his microwave or something (it isn t).Director Clapper reiterated what everybody, including the fake media already knows- there is "no evidence" of collusion w/ Russia and Trump.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017Sally Yates made the fake media extremely unhappy today she said nothing but old news!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017The Russia-Trump collusion story is a total hoax, when will this taxpayer funded charade end?
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017Biggest story today between Clapper & Yates is on surveillance.
Why doesn't the media report on this?
#FakeNews!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 8, 2017In reality, Yates confirmed under oath that she warned the white House that Flynn was compromised and that Trump s former national security advisor was not fired until 18 days later despite the known national security risk.
That s pretty huge, as Trump will learn in his eventual impeachment hearings.Trump is correct that surveillance is a big story in that it s interesting that pretty much every single Republican seemed more concerned with unmasking than the Trump administration s misdeeds.
The FAKE NEWS will almost assuredly be reporting on that in the coming days.To be clear, Clapper did not say there was zero evidence of collusion, and this taxpayer funded charade will end when the truth comes out.Trump may be strutting and ruffling his feathers, but Americans aren t buying it:@realDonaldTrump And Sally Yates reiterated what we already knew: You've been covering for Flynn and ignoring repeated warnings.

(@JordanUhl) May 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump Nope, not what he said.
He said he wasn't even made aware of the investigation.
So of course he wouldn't be made aware of the evidence.

(@RVAwonk) May 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump Wrong!
He said he wasn't made aware of the investigation, so didn't know the evidence.
Today was a disaster for you.

@realDonaldTrump Yea, that s not what he said.
You sure like to misquote people.
Fortunately, there s a thing called video.
Al x Young (@AlexYoung) May 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump She swore under oath that you ignored repeated warnings about Flynn.

(@JordanUhl) May 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump We must have been watching two different hearings.#SallyYates whooped your ass.#TrumpRussia#MarchForTruth pic.twitter.com/tgTlcISfvS Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump Clearly your evening dump is taking longer than anticipated, so thank you for this.
Remember to wipe gently, haemorrhoids can sting.
Mike P Williams (@Mike_P_Williams) May 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump She said you didn't vet your Nat'l Sec Advisor.
That's bad!
When you were told he was a spy, you protected him.
That's worse!
#SallyYates Heather Whaley (@HeatherWhaley) May 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump Ha!
The fact that you hired a compromised Russian spook as your National Security Advisor is now "old news."
Noted.
Good work Donny.
John Kinnear (@askdadblog) May 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump This is the best you can do in response to Sally Yates testimony?
It wasn t exciting enough for the media?Weak, Donald.
So damn weak.

Donald Trump, seemingly un-ironically.#TheResistance pic.twitter.com/SwazfjuefG Holly O'Reilly (@AynRandPaulRyan) May 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump With your resignation, hopefully Edward DeRuiter (@edwardderuiter) May 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump It seems that as a result of today's Senate hearings, Vegas has the odds for impeachment.

This news may have you shitting your pants.

Nick Jack Pappas (@Pappiness) May 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump You seem triggered, Don.

@realDonaldTrump Better question: When will the taxpayer funded charade that is your presidency end?
Al x Young (@AlexYoung) May 8, 2017Trump is done.
He knows he s done.
It s all a matter of time now.Featured image via screengrab
