WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Carter Page, a former foreign policy adviser to Donald Trump’s presidential campaign, told the Senate Intelligence Committee on Tuesday he would not cooperate with any request to appear before the panel in its investigation of possible Russian interference in the 2016 election, Politico reported.
Citing a source familiar with the matter, Politico said Page also informed the committee that if he was called to testify he would decline to answer questions based on his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.
(politi.co/2zcViFP) It is not clear whether the committee has formally asked Page to testify in its probe of Russian meddling in the election and possible collusion with the Trump campaign.
Page came under scrutiny following media reports he met with associates of Russian President Vladimir Putin last year.
Rachel Cohen, a spokeswoman for the committee, declined to comment on the Politico report.
Page did not respond to a Reuter’s request for comment.
Last week, the committee’s chairman, Republican Senator Richard Burr, told reporters the panel had conducted more than 100 interviews in its nine-month-old probe and planned 25 additional interviews this month.
Those who have already come before committee members or investigators include the president’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, and former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort.
Russian officials have denied meddling in the U.S. election, and Trump denies any collusion by his campaign or his associates.
