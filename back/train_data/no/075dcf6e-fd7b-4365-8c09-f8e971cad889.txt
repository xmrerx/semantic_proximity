our good friends at thomas more law center just won a great case for free speech and the unborn !
the judge who rendered the decision is an obama appointee which makes this victory all the sweeter ! in a huge victory for free speech and unborn babies , united states district judge nancy torresen , yesterday , issued a preliminary injunction barring the maine attorney general and city of portland police officers from enforcing the noise provision of the maine civil rights act ( act ) .
under the act , after being warned by a police officer , it is illegal to make noise that can be heard inside an abortion clinic with the intent to interfere with a medical procedure.in a 35 page opinion and order , judge torresen , an obama appointee , held that the noise provision of the act is content-based because it restricts speech based on its purpose , and therefore , is facially unconstitutional .
the thomas more law center ( tmlc ) , a national , nonprofit public interest law firm based in ann arbor , michigan , filed a lawsuit in december 2015 , on behalf of pastor andrew march after a portland police officer officially warned pastor march under the act , and ordered him to quiet his pro-life speech on the public sidewalk outside the portland planned parenthood facility or face prosecution .
despite this threat of prosecution , pastor andrew march courageously continued to plead for the lives of the unborn at the doors of the planned parenthood facility .
