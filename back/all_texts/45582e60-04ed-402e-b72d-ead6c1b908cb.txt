After it was revealed in the leaked Access Hollywood tape that Donald Trump admitted to sexually assaulting women, many of these women have started to come forward.These stories are piling up every day, and of course, Trump is denying every single one.
Even going so far as to call these women too ugly to sexually assault.Now, a former contestant of Trump s show The Apprentice is speaking out on MSNBC with yet another story of Trump s lewd behavior.
She recalls hearing a story from another female contestant while they were both sequestered in housing after being fired from the show.Apparently, during an episode that featured the home repair store Home Depot, Trump told this contestant, I ll show you my 9-inch power tool, clearly insinuating that he wanted to show her his penis.
A statement that seems to line up with several of the stories we ve been hearing lately.This threat of being forced into sexual behavior with Trump seems to be something that happened quite regularly if you were so unfortunate to be working around the Republican candidate.While this story is not confirmed, it s fitting with the profile we ve been hearing of late about Trump, even from his own story he shared on the Access Hollywood tape.He simply cannot be allowed anywhere near the White House.Watch the Apprentice contestant reveal that information here: I ll show you my 9-inch power tool.
Former Apprentice contestant was told Trump said this during a Home Depot task.
