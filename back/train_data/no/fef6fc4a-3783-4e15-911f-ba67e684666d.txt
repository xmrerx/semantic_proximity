tick tock !
time is running out for hillary clinton and george soros to steal the presidency from donald trump .
too bad they didn t get this little snag worked out ahead of time .
it looks like it may not be as easy as jill stein , ( the green party candidate who appears to be doing hillary s dirty work , after getting only got 1 % of the vote ) thought it would be to throw the election oops !
jill stein forgot to mention to her donors that she can not file a direct request for a recount in pennsylvania.stein would have to present a case showing voter fraud took place.trump won pennsylvania by 70 thousand votes .
stein would have to prove that fraud was probable .
that does not seem likely .
then again , we are talking about the clintons here .
gpthe inquisitr reported , via free republic : per pennsylvania regulations , there is only one way remaining for jill stein to get a recount in pennsylvania and it is a complicated process .
billypenn reports that stein would have to file for a court appeal and present a prima facie case showing that voter fraud took place .
while prima facie has a lower burden of proof threshold than beyond reasonable doubt , it is still significant .
stein would have to prove in court that fraud was probable .
this is going to be very difficult given that even the computer specialists recommending the recount say there is no proof of hacking or fraud .
