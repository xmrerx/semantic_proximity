ATHENS (Reuters) - Greece’s far-right Golden Dawn party hailed Donald Trump’s election as president of the United States, calling it a victory against “illegal immigration” and in favor of ethnically “clean” nations.
Golden Dawn, Greece’s third-largest party, took its first seats in parliament in 2012 on a backlash against austerity policies in Greece, which has received three international bailouts since 2010.
“This was a victory for the forces which oppose globalization, are fighting illegal migration and are in favor of clean ethnic states, in favor of self-sufficiency in the national economy,” a spokesman of the party said in a post on YouTube.
“A great global change is starting, which will continue with nationalists prevailing in Austria, Marie LePen in France and Golden Dawn in Greece.”
