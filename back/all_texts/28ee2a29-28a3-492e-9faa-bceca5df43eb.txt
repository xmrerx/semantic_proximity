The New York Daily News is becoming well-known for its political, controversial and not-so-subtle covers, especially when it comes to the Republican party.
So when former Alaska governor and ex-vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin endorsed GOP front runner Donald Trump, the Daily News certainly didn t disappoint.TwitterOn its front page, the NYDN blasted Palin for endorsing such an imbecile, showing a photo of the two conservatives with enormous text that read, I M WITH STUPID.
Implying that it was a match made in heaven, the smaller text read, Hate minds think alike: Palin endorses Trump.
Judging from the reactions on social media, there were a lot of people who felt the same exact way.TwitterTwitterTwitterWhen you consider the things Palin has said in the past, as well as her more recent comments when she announced her support for Trump as president, the I m with stupid reference makes absolute sense.
Especially when you consider this statement, in which Palin talked Trump up: He builds things, he builds big things.
Things that touch the sky.
Big infrastructure that puts other people to work.
He has spent his life looking up and respecting the hard hats and the steel-toed boots and the work ethic that you all have within you.
He, being an optimist, passionate about equal opportunity to work.
This self-made success of his, you know that he doesn t get his power, his high, off of opium other people s money like a lot of dopes in Washington do.
They re addicted to opium, where they take other people s money and then their high is getting to redistribute it, right?
The NYDN has never been a fan of The Donald when the real estate mogul announced that he was running for the White House, the Daily News published a cover that said CLOWN RUNS FOR PREZ with Trump s face covered in clown makeup.While Palin has put in her completely nonsensical endorsement of Trump, it s probably safe to say that NYDN won t be.Featured image via Twitter
