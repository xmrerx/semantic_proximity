MANCHESTER, England (Reuters) - Britain is worried by violence during a banned referendum in Spain s northeastern region of Catalonia but sees the vote as unconstitutional, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said on Sunday.
We are obviously worried by any violence but clearly the referendum, as I understand it, is not constitutional so a balance needs to be struck, Johnson told Reuters.
We hope very much that things will calm down.
