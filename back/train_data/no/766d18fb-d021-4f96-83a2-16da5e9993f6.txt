it s bad enough that democrat senators are speaking this way but rino susan collins didn t even defend her fellow senator !
she took it to a new low .
you can hear the harsh comments at the 1:30 point : sen. jack reed ( d. , r.i. ) was caught on a hot mic telling sen. susan collins ( r. , maine ) on tuesday that she could beat the shit out of a republican congressman who had criticized her and other female republican senators who were hampering obamacare repeal efforts.the two senators were at the markup of the transportation , housing and urban development , and related agencies appropriations act of 2018 discussing multiple issues among themselves when reed skewered rep. blake farenthold ( r. , texas ) .farenthold said in an interview last friday that he might settle republican opposition to health care efforts aaron burr-style if the senators were men from his home state of texas , according to cnn.reed said that there were some crazy people in the house , which prompted collins to ask him whether he had heard of farenthold s remarks .
the comment appeared to be a reference to the 1804 duel between aaron burr and alexander hamilton , which resulted in hamilton s death .
i know , trust me .
you know why he challenged you to a duel ?
because you could beat the shit out of him , reed said .
he s huge !
he s so unattractive , it s unbelievable collins would be a democrat in any other state !
we re hoping she s defeated next time around !
