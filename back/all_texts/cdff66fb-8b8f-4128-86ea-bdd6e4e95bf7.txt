Nigel Farage: I don t think it s worth getting angry about Hillary.
I just think she looks sad and pathetic.
From now on, let s just ignore her.Amen!
We agree with Farage but it s so interesting to listen to Clinton s delusional take on what happened in the 2016 election.
It confirms for everyone that we made the right choice in the election.
This woman needs a reality check!
It s so revealing to see just how out of touch with reality she REALLY is and how petty and bitter she has been.Aren t we so lucky we dodged THIS bullet!IN CASE YOU CAN T LOOK AWAY:Hillary Clinton continues on the path to complete and total denial.
#CODECON 2017 included a blah, blah, blah session by Clinton.
She spews ridiculous victimhood it s embarrassing!
Nobody said don t do this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9_nKOL4h0iUThis woman needs to go off into the woods for another walk.HILLARY S EXCUSES HER FAVORITE THINGS:Enjoy:
