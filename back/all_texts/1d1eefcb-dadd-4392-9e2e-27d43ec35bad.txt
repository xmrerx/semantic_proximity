When approached by countless people if I m a Hillary supporter, I will reply, yes.
However, this is usually followed up with, is it because she s a woman?
Which is the most absurd thing I ve ever heard.
Sure, I m excited for the possibility of the first-ever female president, but in all honesty, it comes down to experience and ability to get the job done, which she has done time and time again throughout her career.Being tired of this question being posed, and having a decent size Facebook audience to deliver my message, I took to my page to lay out my answer once and for all.Here s my response: I can t tell you how many times I ve been asked, are you voting for Hillary because she s a woman?
Well, to that I have to say, no, but if you re going ask, with that criteria, if I m voting for Hillary just because she s a woman, well, I m going to assume you re not voting for her just because she s a woman.
And if you use the same attacks that Republicans have been using against her for decades, well, that means you re really no better than a Republican.
And if you use her voting record against her, but then willfully ignore Bernie s anti-gun reform votes well, sorry, you re a hypocrite.
And if Hillary is the nominee this November and you refuse to vote for a Democrat or you refuse to vote, you might as well be voting for a Republican.
As far as experience, don t even go there.
She s clearly the most qualified person for the job.
So no, I m not voting for Hillary because she s a woman.
I m voting for her because she s the best damn person for the job.
However, how revolutionary would it be to finally have the first woman president?
It s pretty badass.
And as I was going to keep this solely to my page it became apparent when Hillary was accused of ruining the Democratic party with her ambition, that this really needed to be seen again, because that is a ridiculously sexist remark.
I mean, how dare a woman have the audacity to be ambitious enough to seek the White House.
Is that ever asked of men?
Is it?
No, it s not.So no, I m not voting for Hillary because she s a woman, but I sure as hell am voting for a woman with ambition and the go-get-it attitude that she has displayed throughout her entire career.
But let it be known, that if she s not the nominee for any reason, I will vote blue no matter who, because I m able to be an adult and realize the needs of the country are far more important than just the needs of my ideal candidate winning, and if a Republican wins, we all lose.
