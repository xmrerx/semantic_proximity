Last night, the Republican primary went where no debate has ever gone before when it literally became a contest about penis size.This happened less than fifteen minutes into the eleventh GOP debate, when Trump addressed rival Marco Rubio s comments about his unnaturally small hands by assuring America that there was no problem with the size of his junk.
No one could believe that a presidential debate could devolve into such an immature, petty discussion but you can always count on Trump to help the country sink to new lows.While many of us were probably stuck in a depressive state, wallowing over the fact that a nationally-televised event to vet the future president of the country has just been overtaken by a penis joke, Twitter swooped in to save the day.
As soon as Trump made his ill-timed joke, Twitter was flooded with the most clever, hilarious reactions and gave everyone some much-needed perspective to keep us afloat as Trump continues to dominate the Republican polls.Here are some of the most amazing responses to Trump, to momentarily distract you from the fact that the guy who made a penis joke at the GOP debate might actually win the nomination:TwitterTwitterMany were anticipating what the media was going to do with this disastrous frat boy moment.TwitterThe New York Post and Huffington Post didn t disappoint:Twitter TwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterTwitterLast night s GOP debate was less about policy and the future of America than it was about Trump and his innate ability to made any serious political matter an absolute circus and spectacle.
America cannot risk having someone like him fronting the GOP.
Even though it would be an easy win for the Democrats, the fact that Trump has been able to gather the support of so many Americans is depressing.
