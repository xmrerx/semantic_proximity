president trump met for the first time with members of nato and scolded them for not paying their fair share : members of the alliance must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations .
twenty-three of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying and what they are supposed to be paying for their defense .
this is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the united states .
