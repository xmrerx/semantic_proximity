Tonight the Boiler Gang brings the internet show with more twists and turns than a Texas tornado.
Spore opens the episode with shocking truths about the treatment of show dolphins and how they are manipulated, the use of Dolphins in MK Ultra backed military programs, we begrudgingly approach the bathroom topic.
We pose the question: Can America or any other atlanticist country break free of the globalism goals of the New World Order and can it even be done at a national level when the financial system is already internationally globalized by technocrat oligarchs?
We laugh at John Kirby dragging his reputation through the muck while blatantly engaging in Orwellian double speak to the press corp, the death of Pop/Rock Icon, Prince leads to a new radio show idea live on air, Trump gets some choice words in with regard to US failed foreign policy in the Middle East and the unfortunate DEATH of Comedy as PC becomes the way of the youth.
