Trump mouthpiece Jeffrey Lord got his a** handed to him by Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night for once again bringing up Juanita Broaddrick in response to sexual assault allegations against the Republican nominee.During the segment, Cooper and the panel were discussing the women who have come forward to tell their stories about how Donald Trump groped them when Lord interrupted to complain that the women didn t talk about Jaunita Broaddrick and her accusations against Bill Clinton, even though Broaddrick has nothing to do with Trump s own behavior.Lord called the women s accusations into question, but Cooper was quick to drop the hammer on his hypocrisy.
Why do you believe Juanita Broaddrick and not these two women, Cooper asked, leaving a dumbfounded Lord to claim that the media isn t giving Clinton s accusers an equal forum.
But Clinton s accusers have no bearing on this election because Bill Clinton is not running for president, as other panelists reminded Lord.
Furthermore, Bill Clinton was never charged with committing any crimes.
Juanita Broaddrick filed a sworn affidavit stating that the rape allegations against Clinton are untrue.
And these accusations against Clinton are 20 years old and have received a ton of media coverage over the years, especially during Clinton s presidency.
The allegations against Trump, meanwhile, are new and haven t received near as much coverage.But Lord whined that the New York Times hasn t interviewed Broaddrick and then brought up a ridiculous anecdotal claim about meeting a couple from Virginia who supposedly think the media the treating Trump unfairly.When it became clear that Lord and Trump s other surrogates were not going to win this fight they resorted to calling Hillary Clinton an enabler of Bill Clinton behavior who supposedly bullied the women accusing Bill of sexual misconduct.But the other panelists would have none of it and proceeded to smack them down.Here s the video via YouTube:[ad3media campaign= 1136 ]The accusations against Bill Clinton have nothing to do with this election.
Hillary Clinton is running for president, not her husband.
Trump, on the other hand, IS running for president and the allegations against him are new and should be covered by the media.Donald Trump is unfit to be president and the fact that his supporters have to resort to bringing up Bill Clinton and his accusers in a lame effort to distract from that proves it.Featured Image: Screenshot
