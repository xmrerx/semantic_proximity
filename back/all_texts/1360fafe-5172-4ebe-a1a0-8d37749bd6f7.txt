Last November, the UNC campus was full of angry students who were unhappy with Trump s election On November 23rd of last year, UNC protesters gathered at the iconic Old Well on the campus, chanting Donald Trump can go to Hell, but we are going to the Well.
The intersection, normally taken over by students to celebrate sports victories a few times a year, was soon occupied by dozens of protesters chanting lines like black lives matter, water is life, and love trumps hate.
What s gotten into our youth?
