dubai ( reuters ) - saudi-led coalition aircraft struck a military police camp in the houthi-controlled yemeni capital sanaa on wednesday , killing at least 39 people and wounding 90 more , including some prisoners , an official and witnesses said .
the strike is part of an air campaign by the western-backed coalition on the iran-allied houthis that has escalated since the houthis crushed an uprising last week led by former yemeni president ali abdullah saleh and killed him .
one official in the camp said the coalition aircraft had launched seven raids on the camp , located in the eastern part of sanaa , where some 180 prisoners were being held .
the official said rescue teams had pulled out 35 bodies from the rubble , while the rest were not accounted for .
it was the latest in a string of air raids the coalition has conducted on sanaa and other parts of the country , sometimes causing multiple casualties among civilians .
a spokesman for the saudi-led coalition could not immediately be reached for comment on the report .
the coalition denies that it targets civilians .
the united states and britain provide political backing as well as weapons and logistical support for the saudi-led coalition , which has been fighting since 2015 to restore yemen s internationally-recognised president , abd-rabbu mansour hadi , to power .
