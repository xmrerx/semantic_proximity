21st century wire says speaking to reporters from his summer golf retreat in new jersey , president donald trump publicly thanked russian leader vladimir putin for previously ordering the us to slash its embassy staff in moscow and close two of its storage facilities there .
much to the chagrin of the adversarial media , trump crowed , that putin has helped him achieve a smaller payroll .
last month 21wire reported how russia ordered washington to remove 755 its 1,200 us embassy staff in moscow as part of a retaliatory diplomatic tit-for-tat after the us leveled another round of sanctions against russia .
i want to thank him because we re trying to cut down our payroll and as far as i m concerned i m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people , said trump.meanwhile , it emerged this week that fbi special counsel robert mueller ordered a pre-dawn raid on former trump campaign manager paul manafort , seizing personal documents and equipment.trump told reporters , they do that very seldom .
i was surprised to see it , and i thought it was a very strong signal .
sympathising with manafort s situation , he added that the raid was a pretty tough stuff .
trump also went on to comment on the north korea situation and defensed his previous comments against the regime in pyongyang.watch the full press conference here : .
