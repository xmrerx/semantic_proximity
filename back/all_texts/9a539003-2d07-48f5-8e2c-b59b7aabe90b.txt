You know how we all joke about Donald Trump s tiny hands because it s a safe way to avoid having to talk about his penis and/or testicles while still cracking wise about his penis and/or testicles?
Well, now we have to talk about those after a photographer managed to catch a perfect shot of The Donald s probably gold-plated moose knuckle.Little Green Footballs Charles Johnson posted a photo that includes both Trump s tiny, tiny hands and his gross old man balls, which are drooping even lower than his approval ratings in the photo:Are you horrified?
So is the rest of the internet.In the name of all that is holy, why didn t you pixelate the lower half of that pic?!
