The green criminals who re working on how to distribute your money to those in far away places had a splendid meal last night in Paris.
Could someone tell Obama we re broke?As working dinners go, President Obama s meal Monday night in Paris with French President Francois Hollande, Secretary of State John Kerry and others wasn t too shabby.No cartons of takeout instead, the gang fueled up after a long day of climate talks at L Ambroisie, the three-Michelin-starred temple of gastronomie in the Marais neighborhood.Per the Michelin Guide, the ornately be-chandelier-ed dining room is known for incomparable classicism and an immortal feast for the senses.
Perhaps worried that Obama would create an international faux pas by ordering a burger or a margarita (two of his faves), a reporter asked what he planned to eat.
Obama was, appropriately, diplomatic: I will get recommendations from the president, he answered, nodding in Hollande s direction.According to the AP, Obama cracked a joke about the opulence of the setting.
Don t break the chandelier, he warned as a reporter s microphone got just a little too close to the crystal.
You can t afford it.
