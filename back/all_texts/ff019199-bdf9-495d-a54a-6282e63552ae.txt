Right wing radio host and pundit Glenn Beck has been on the campaign trail stumping for Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz.
On Saturday at a rally in Provo, Utah, Beck involved a young child in a strange and unsettling campaign moment in order to demonstrate his belief that the conservative Republican is the Christian choice to be the next president.Beck brought up a young boy onto the stage with him, and told the audience that the child s father had contacted him and told Beck that the child had been fasting, apparently in the hopes that Cruz would win the upcoming Utah caucus and after that the election.
In response, Beck yelled to the audience and put his hand on the boy s forehead while crying, saying, This is the priesthood rising!
This isn t something completely new.
About a month ago, ahead of the Nevada caucus, Beck asked his followers to join him in fasting for Cruz.
He wrote, I would like to ask you to join me and my family Monday in a fast for Ted Cruz, our country and the Nevada caucus.
After some criticized the crass act of invoking religious fasting in order to help a right-wing political candidate, Beck struck out against his doubters and wrote, if we ve turned into Christians that deny the power of about to do and the power of fast and prayer in this nation, then we have become Europe.
Beck, who was removed from Fox News Channel after his conspiracy theories and race-baiting attacks on President Obama led to many sponsors dropping his program, has often wrapped himself in the clothing of a religious prophet during his career.The host has claimed that he turned his life over to his Mormon faith after a life of drugs and other substances while he worked as a morning zoo radio personality in the 1980s.
Since then, Beck has made millions publishing conservative books, selling gold and other survivalist items to his devoted followers.Featured image via YouTube
