So many questions have come up in the wake of James Comey s Senate testimony.
House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi is again asking the harsh but necessary question, What do the Russians have on Donald Trump?
Pretty much everyone is in agreement that Thursday s testimony by James Comey was totally devastating for Trump.
Even Trump s buddies over at Fox News are admitting it was very damaging for the president.
By far the most incriminating statement made by Comey was that he couldn t remember any conversations with the president about the Russia election.
The fact the Russia attempted to control the outcome of the U.S. presidential election is indisputable at this point.
What s curious is that Trump had no interest in the fact that our democracy was attacked and how we remain susceptible to attacks in the future.This total lack of concern for foreign election hijack prompted Pelsoi in a press conference on Friday to ask some critical questions.
So again I ask the question, What do the Russians have on Donald Trump politically, personally, or financially that he just won t go to that place and instead enshrines them, sings and dances to their tune.
And Republicans in Congress have been resistant to finding it have resisted finding out the truth.
So I think there are other remedies that we can exhaust.
I respect the opinion of those who think he should come.
But I think we if the Republicans in Congress would be more, shall we say, open to facts and the truth, we can learn a lot without the president coming here.
Comey warned us on Thursday, They re coming after America.
Why does that not concern or pique any interest from the president?
