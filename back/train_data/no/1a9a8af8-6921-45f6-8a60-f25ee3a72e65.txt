the big question is whether or not cruz can get the necessary 1,237 delegates ? senator ted cruz soundly defeated donald j. trump in the wisconsin primary on tuesday , breathing new life into efforts to halt mr. trump s divisive presidential candidacy and dealing a blow to his chances of clinching the republican nomination before the party s summer convention.on the democratic side , senator bernie sanders defeated hillary clinton in a much closer contest.mr .
trump s loss was his most significant setback since mr. cruz narrowly defeated him in iowa , the campaign s first nominating contest .
and after largely dominating the republican field from the moment he announced his candidacy last june , mr. trump now faces a fresh challenge : bouncing back in the face of searing attack ads by republicans bent on stopping him , persistent questions about his demeanor and campaign organization , and a single ascendant challenger in mr. cruz.in winning wisconsin so convincingly , mr. cruz , of texas , showed he was capable of appealing to more than just the hard-line and religious conservative republicans who have been the foundation of his campaign .
but he faces daunting tasks of his own .
one is consolidating the anti-trump vote .
another is capturing more moderate republicans in a series of primaries in northeastern states that are likely to be favorable territory for mr. trump , beginning with new york on april 19.standing in mr. cruz s way is gov .
john kasich of ohio , who finished a distant third on tuesday despite spending considerable time in wisconsin.while mr. trump won among moderates , exit polls showed , mr. cruz and mr. kasich received roughly equal support among those voters in wisconsin .
mr. cruz not only took nearly two-thirds of very conservative voters , he also won among voters who called themselves only somewhat conservative .
notably , mr. cruz also won among those who did not call themselves born-again christians a group with which he has struggled in earlier contests.most striking , though , was how many wisconsin primary voters still harbored deep discomfort with mr. trump despite his wide lead in the race for delegates .

and 35 percent of those who voted in the republican primary said they would support hillary clinton , a third-party candidate or no one at all if mr. trump were the republican nominee.mr .
cruz s strong showing will make it more difficult for mr. trump to wrap up the 1,237 delegates needed for the gop nomination before the primary season ends on june 7 , when california allocates the largest number of delegates.next up on the gop calendar is the april 19 primary in new york , mr. trump s home state , where polls show him enjoying a commanding lead of more than 30 percentage points over mr. cruz , who in some surveys runs behind mr. kasich.new york awards 95 delegates , most of which are allotted proportionately by congressional district .
mr. trump travels to long island on wednesday to kick off his campaign .
trump has more support than anyone else in new york and always had , said state assemblyman bill nojay of pittsford , in north-central new york .
if the vote was held today , we expect he would win every single congressional district .
a week later , a swath of other east coast states vote connecticut , delaware , maryland , pennsylvania and rhode island .
mr. cruz s best hope is in states farther ahead in the calendar indiana on may 3 and nebraska on may 10.wisconsin with its gop electorate dominated by the kind of working-class , white voters who have been drawn to mr. trump elsewhere was long seen as fertile ground for the new york businessman .
but it turned into a hotbed of anti-trump sentiment .

with no other republican contests in the two weeks before or after , wisconsin made for an isolated showdown.for mr. trump , it was an opportunity to add to his wide delegate lead and score an important psychological victory just as the race turns to his native northeast .
