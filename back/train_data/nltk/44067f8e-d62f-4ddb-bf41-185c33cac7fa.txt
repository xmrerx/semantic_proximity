wfb north korea first time week reveal plan use nuclear arm spacebased electronicsdisrupting emp attack addition direct warhead ground blaststhe official communist party newspaper rodong sinmun publish report monday emp might nuclear weapon outline electromagnetic pulse emp attack produce detonate nuclear warhead space
general strong electromagnetic pulse generate nuclear bomb explosion 30 kilometer 100 kilometer 186 mile 62 mile ground severely impair electronic device electric machine electromagnetic grid destroy electric cable safety device say article author kim songwon dean kim chaek university technology pyongyang
discovery electromagnetic pulse source high yield highaltitude nuclear explosion test process give recognition important strike method statedthe official discussion north korea plan conduct emp strike likely fuel debate threat

specialist try determine test involve hydrogen bomb pyongyang assert device design emp attack
also assess whether test use boost fission technologyhydrogen bomb advanced device use twostage explosion process produce massive explosion
boost fission device le sophisticated technologically require nuclear fuel
highly confident test advanced nuclear device see far inconsistent north korea claim u intelligence official saidhowever final conclusion type yield blast expect several day
