Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer broke things down on Sunday and explained why it is that Donald Trump hasn t been able to accomplish squat so far.Appearing on Fox News Sunday, Schumer gave a scathing review of Trump s first 100 days, which he said had hardly been a success.
He laid into Trump for his litany of broken promises, including his failed health care bill and decision to add more monsters to the swamp rather than draining it.
There s been promise after promise that s been either unfulfilled or broken, he said.
The bottom line is very simple: the president, if he works with us, particularly on issues like trade and infrastructure, we can work.
But on the issues so far, taxes and healthcare, he doesn t consult us at all.
According to Schumer, Trump comes up with a plan that s very hard right and then tells Democrats that supporting the plan is the only way to be bipartisan.
That s not how America works, Schumer said.The Senate minority leader then scorched Trump on his failed attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act.
He pointed out that Trump didn t need a single Democrat to vote for his bill in order to pass it.
And it still failed miserably.
He s not governing from the middle, he s governing from the hard right.
That s why his regime has had hardly any major successes, with the exception of Gorsuch.
If he changes, we can work together.
But he can t just dictate what he wants, Schumer said.
The country doesn t work my way or the highway.
Trump, for his part, spent the weekend attacking Democrats, Schumer in specific.
On Saturday, Trump slammed Schumer as a bad leader.
On Sunday, he said that without a leader, Democrats have become the party of obstruction.
He then continued that theme during an interview with Face The Nation on Sunday morning.You can watch Schumer s interview here:Featured image via video screen capture
