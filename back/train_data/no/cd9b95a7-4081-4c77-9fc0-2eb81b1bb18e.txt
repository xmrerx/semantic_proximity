islamabad ( reuters ) - gunmen on a motorcycle shot dead a senior pakistani police officer , as well as his wife , son and grandson on wednesday as the family was driving in baluchistan province , officials said .
two attackers opened fire on the vehicle carrying district superintendent muhammad ilyas and his relatives to quetta , the capital of the southwestern region , police said .
his four-year-old granddaughter survived and was taken to hospital , they added .
authorities say there has been a surge in attacks on security officials in baluchistan , with five suicide bombings and one armed attack targeting police in the past six months .
no group immediately claimed responsibility for wednesday s shooting - though sunni militants and sectarian groups linked to al qaeda and islamic state , as well as the taliban , operate in the region that borders afghanistan and iran .
separatists have also fought a long insurgency there , demanding a greater share of the region s gas and mineral resources and an end to what they say is discrimination .
baluchistan is at the center of the $ 57 billion china pakistan economic corridor ( cpec ) , a planned transport and energy link from western china to pakistan s southern deep-water port of gwadar .
