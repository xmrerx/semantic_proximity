BERLIN (Reuters) - The German government on Friday vowed to work for continued global unity if U.S. President Donald Trump announces that he will not certify Iran s compliance with a 2015 nuclear accord negotiated by world powers, as expected.
We have a great interest in the continuation of this international unity.
If ... an important country like the United States comes to a different conclusion as appears to be the case, we will work even harder with other partners to maintain this cohesion, government spokesman Steffen Seibert told reporters.
Trump is to deliver a speech at 12:45 p.m. EDT (1645 GMT) to announce a confrontational new approach to U.S. policy toward Iran.
In a big shift, he is expected to say he will not certify Iran s compliance with the nuclear deal.
