when trump s white house released a list of terrorist attacks they say the media did not cover , one thing was clear : the dictionary is the trump administration s worst enemy .
attacker was spelled attaker , the list referenced a country called denmakr , san bernardino was missing an r , and so on .
eventually , the merriam-webster dictionary caught wind of the error-ridden list and offered some advice .

? was that an attak ?

https : //t.co/f62w8bbmhl merriam-webster ( @ merriamwebster ) february 7 , 2017trump s team is built from the absolute worst our country has to offer : white supremacists , warmongers , corporate warlords , and the absolute dumbest people one could ever imagine.in just a few weeks , donald trump has managed to make a mockery of almost every aspect of our government , appointing a slew of unqualified people to positions they should never be near and even getting tricked into making a white supremacist one of the most powerful men in the country.take the time to laugh , but be sure to resist the snollygoster in the white house in every way you can for the next four years or , of course , until he is ultimately impeached for being completely and utterly incompetent.featured image via getty images ( pool ) /screengrab
