According to Senator John McCain, Donald Trump s life is about get become very uncomfortable very quickly.
During an appearance on CNN s State of the Union, McCain explained that he was bothered by a number of things involving Trump and Russia, including the strange removal of a call for defensive weapons to the Ukraine to defend against Russia from the official party platform.
Clearly, it was not the will of most Republicans, McCain told Jake Tapper Sunday, adding that there are plenty of shoes about to drop.
There s a lot of aspects with this whole relationship with Russia and Vladimir Putin that requires further scrutiny, and so far I don t think the American people have gotten all the answers.
In fact, I think there s a lot of shoes to drop from this centipede.
This whole issue of the relationship with the Russians and who communicated with them and under what circumstances clearly cries out for an investigation, McCain says.
But I would also point out we should not assume guilt until we have a thorough investigation.
I m not judging anyone guilty.
Unfortunately, McCain s fellow Republicans are doing all they can to avoid investigating the Trump administration s numerous and growing list of shady contacts with Russian oligarchs though Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who perjured himself when he was asked about Russian contacts during his confirmation hearing, has said he may appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Donald Trump s baseless allegations that President Obama tapped his wires at Trump Tower.Watch the interview below:Tapper asks John McCain about the Flynn-Turkey revelations; McCain starts talking about Russia, Russia, Russia.
