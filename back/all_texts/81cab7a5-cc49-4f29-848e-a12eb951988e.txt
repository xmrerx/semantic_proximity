Donald Trump just got caught lying on Twitter again and got totally humiliated with his own tweets.The world is still reeling after Trump signed an executive order banning travelers from entering the United States from seven different countries that he considers a threat to American safety.Trump has been touting his Muslim ban as one of his greatest achievements even though it is totally unconstitutional.Pretty much everyone understands that his order is a ban.But on Wednesday morning, Trump actually tried to claim that his order may not be a ban at all by claiming that everyone is arguing about whether or not it s a ban.
He also claimed that the purpose of the ban is to keep bad people out of the country as if bad people only come from those nations.Everybody is arguing whether or not it is a BAN.
Call it what you want, it is about keeping bad people (with bad intentions) out of country!

@realDonaldTrump makes sense you d kick off Black History Month with a lie, since racist lies is how you started your Presidential campaign.

Blanket generalizations like this are ridiculous and discriminatory.
