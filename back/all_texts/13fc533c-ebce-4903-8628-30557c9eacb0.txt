Former Speaker Newt Gingrich discusses the Russia investigation with Hannity He drops a bomb when he says that Obama should testify under oath before Congress in the Russia probe.
We totally agree!https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fc_t7IOfonUNewt Gingrich: There s no question that Congress should call the former president in to testify under oath to explain what he was doing and why he was doing it, Gingrich said.
There s no question that they should build the case from the ground up.Who was doing the investigating?
Who was reporting to the president?
Who did it go through?
What were the meetings like when they decided not to pursue it?
I mean, talk about an extraordinary failure of national security.
Guess what s about to happen, the Congress is about to have to call Barack Obama in to testify under oath about when he knew about Russia meddling.
Who told him?
Why did he do nothing?
Who was in the meetings when he decided to do nothing?
It s going to turn out, yes, there s a big Russian story.
It s Barack Obama, not Donald Trump.
And you cannot make this stuff up.
