habur , turkey ( reuters ) - iraqi soldiers joined turkish troops for military exercises in southeast turkey near the border with iraq on tuesday , a reuters witness said , as the two countries coordinate steps in response to the iraqi kurdish independence referendum .
a small group of soldiers holding aloft an iraqi and a turkish flag walked across the dusty plain where the exercises , launched last week , were being held some 4 km ( 2.5 miles ) from the habur border gate , the witness said .
the flags were then held aloft from the top of an armored personnel carrier .
national and international media observed the exercises from the main highway leading to the border gate .
kurds voted in large numbers in an independence referendum in northern iraq on monday , ignoring pressure from baghdad , threats from turkey and iran , and international warnings that the vote may ignite yet more regional conflict .
turkish president tayyip erdogan has threatened to cut off the pipeline that carries oil from northern iraq to the outside world , intensifying pressure on the kurdish autonomous region over the referendum .
