Some companies definitely prefer increased profit over principle and, clearly, patriotism.
Yet another U.S. company, this time Carrier, decided that they would be relocating their Indianapolis, IN, plant to Monterrey, Mexico.
This relocation will, in turn, put 2,100 people out of work come 2017.The company, of course, in a state-run by a supposed business friendly Republican, Gov.
Mike Pence, is blaming regulations and the high cost to run business here at home.
In a statement put out by HVAC Systems and Services North America president Chris Nelson: This move is intended to address the challenges we continue to face in a rapidly changing HVAC industry, with the continued migration of the HVAC industry to Mexico, including our suppliers and competitors, and ongoing cost and pricing pressures driven, in part, by new regulatory requirements, Relocating our operations to a region where we have existing infrastructure and a strong supplier base will allow us to operate more cost effectively so that we can continue to produce high-quality HVAC products that are competitively positioned while continuing to meet customer needs.
Nelson, trying to have a heart, but failing miserably, also said: This decision is difficult and we recognize the impact on employees, their families and the community.
We are committed to ensuring that our employees are treated respectfully and to working closely with their representatives throughout this transition.
Actually having a heart, Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett (D) issued his own statement regarding the devastating blow to the local economy: A job lost in any part of our community affects us all, and I believe these are the times we must come together as one city to lift up our neighbors.
That is why this afternoon I will issue and Executive Order to create a task force that will convene local, state, and federal resources and direct every tool at our disposal toward supporting these workers in the days ahead.
You can actually witness and listen to Carrier tell their employees that they will soon be out of work in this video below.
The gasps are audible and the anger is palpable, justifiably so.
You can hear the company try to explain themselves to their employees.
And unfortunately, due to the rotten discourse created by the likes of people like Donald Trump, you can hear one employee blame Mexicans.
To add insult to injury, Carrier simply states: This is simply a business decision.
