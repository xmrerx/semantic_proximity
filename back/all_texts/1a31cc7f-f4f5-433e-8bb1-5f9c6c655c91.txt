Kraig Moss was a die hard Donald Trump supporter.
He followed the then-GOP presidential candidate around the nation, playing his guitar and singing special songs he had written especially for Trump.
He was well known in Trump supporter circles, due to his guitar decorated with Trump stickers and other campaign items.
He became known as the Trump Troubadour.
In the end, Moss had attended 45 Trump rallies.
However, all of that has changed now.Moss tragically lost his son to a heroin overdose.
He sincerely believes that if his family had had health insurance at the time of the overdose, his son might still be alive.
That s why Moss no longer supports Trump: because of his pushing the new healthcare bill that is being trotted out by House Republicans.
Moss knows how awful the bill is, and how many people it will rob of healthcare.
Thanks to this fact, he no longer sings his Trump songs, and he no longer supports the president.
Moss says of his turning on Trump: The bill is an absolute betrayal of what Trump represented on the campaign trail.
I feel betrayed.
The disastrous healthcare bill will result in terrible losses for addiction services.
For Kraig Moss, this is personal.
So, now, instead of promoting Trump, Moss held a fund raiser to help a drug rehabilitation facility, raising $3,000 in his son s name.Hopefully, more and more people begin to realize what a massive con Trump has managed to pull off, and he gets annihilated in four years if he isn t impeached first.Watch the video below:Featured image via video screen capture
