paris ( reuters ) - turkey on friday released french journalist loup bureau who was seized by security forces on the iraqi border last month , his lawyer said on friday .
bureau was detained by turkish border guards in early august after he was found to have photographs and interviews with kurdish militia fighters among his possessions .
we are pleased to announce the release of journalist # loupbureau .
he will be expelled from turkey shortly , lawyer martin pradel said via twitter .
french president emmanuel macron last month expressed his concerns about bureau s detention in a telephone call with turkish president tayyip erdogan .
the announcement came as french foreign affairs minister jean-yves le drian concluded a two-day visit to turkey .
turkey considers the kurdish ypg militia , with which bureau is accused of having links , to be an extension of the kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) militant group .
the pkk has fought a three-decade insurgency in southeast turkey and is designated a terrorist organization by ankara , the united states and the european union .
bureau s lawyer said a turkish court had not closed the case .
we must continue to fight , pradel said in another tweet .
