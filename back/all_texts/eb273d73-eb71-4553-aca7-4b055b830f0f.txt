In case you haven t heard yet, creepy GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz has somehow decided that math doesn t matter and that he will win the Republican Party s nomination for president anyway.
To that end, he has picked an equally creepy running mate in failed candidate Carly Fiorina.
It seems that Fiorina wanted to make sure that she was just as creepy as Cruz, so during her speech when her status as running mate was announced, she chose to, for some bizarre reason, start singing to the crowd.It was seriously the worst thing ever for those listening, and the best thing ever for late night comedians.
Late Show host Stephen Colbert wasted absolutely no time in ripping Fiorina for that ridiculous display.
First, Colbert roasted Cruz himself for thinking he actually needed a running mate, since it s clear he won t be winning.
The host began: That is bold.
After Tuesday s huge wins by Clinton and Trump, Bernie Sanders saw the writing on the wall and laid off hundreds of staffers.
Meanwhile, Ted Cruz saw the writing and covered it up with a hang in there, baby poster.
He then pivoted to Fiorina, who he said was clearly honored to accept this important job that will never exist.
After that, things got really good.
Colbert ran tape of Fiorina s creepy singing about Ted Cruz s daughters.
The whole thing was just downright weird.
Colbert said of Fiorina s bizarre and creepy attempt at spontaneous singing: It s like Disney gave the wicked stepmother her own song.
Colbert is right, of course.
Carly Fiorina doesn t need to be singing to anyone, much less two little girls who are probably just as creeped out by her as America is by their own father.
But hey, at least it s good for a joke or two.
Hopefully both Ted Cruz and Carly Fiorina disappear into the dustins of history where they belong when this primary is finally over.Watch Colbert s brilliance below:Featured image via video screen capture
