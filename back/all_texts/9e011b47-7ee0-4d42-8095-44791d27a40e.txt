WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton is scheduled to return to the campaign trail on Friday after taking a few days off to recuperate from pneumonia, MSNBC reported on Tuesday.
The network, citing what it said was a release from Clinton’s campaign, said she was scheduled to appear at a “Black Women’s Agenda” event in Washington, although it said if she were not feeling well that plan could change.
