Leftist activist and mediocre filmmaker Michael Moore made a very lame attempt at shaming President Donald Trump on Friday.
Moore feigned concern on Twitter that Trump s Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, FL wasn t being used as a shelter.
Moore tweeted on Friday, Has he [President Trump] opened up Mar-a-Lago as a shelter yet?
, suggesting that President Trump should have opened the doors to his public club to help those looking for shelter from Hurricane Irma that was set to pound the southern and eastern shores of Florida.Has he opened up Mar-a-Lago as a shelter yet?
Michael Moore (@MMFlint) September 8, 2017After Micheal Moore s tweet got over 56K likes and 17K shares from equally ignorant liberals, Donald Trump Jr., gave Moore a lesson on geography.It's on an island on both the ocean & intercostal and in a mandatory evacuation zone probably not the best idea, but you know, narrative!

The more you hate on Donald Trump and his family, the more voters the Democrat Party will lose in 2018 and beyond As a side note, Trump ruffled a lot of feathers in the exclusive enclave of Palm Beach, FL when he opened the doors to Mar-a-Lago to both Blacks and Jews, when other private clubs in the area were excluding them.
Put that in your pipe and smoke it, Moore
