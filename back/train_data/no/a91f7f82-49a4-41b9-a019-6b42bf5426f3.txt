isn t it a conflict of interest that clinton is giving money to the dnc ?
ya think ! thanks to breitbart news for finding an email that exposes the money transfer from the clinton campaign to the dnc .
the dnc hasn t responded so it would be a great idea to get a freedom of information request to see just how much is bring funded to the party since they re $ 8 million in debt .
yes , the dnc is asking taxpayers to fund their convention no kidding ! the hillary clinton campaign is quietly making cash transfers to the democratic national committee ( dnc ) to fund state party efforts in the south .
hillary clinton s deputy national political director brynne craig , 30 , sent money to a state party chairman .
craig assures the chairman that the clinton campaign will be making another transfer to the dnc .
then craig said she would follow up to let you know the amount that is transferred .
the email sheds new light on the relationship between the financially insolvent dnc , led by rep. debbie wasserman schultz , and the clinton campaign .
the sen. bernie sanders ( i-vt ) 16 % camp is suing the dnc in federal court ahead of saturday night s debate in goffstown , new hampshire after the dnc banned the sanders camp from its voter targeting data after it accessed data on hillary clinton voters , which was originally supposed to be shared over all of the democratic campaigns.the clinton campaign is clearly gearing up for the southern democratic party s vaunted sec primary in march , where hillary clinton lost her lead for the nomination in 2008 to then-senator barack obama.asked to comment , the clinton campaign did not immediately respond with an answer that provides information about how much money the clinton campaign transfers to the dnc .
the dnc also did not immediately provide that financial information.here s the email : from : brynne craig < * * * * * * @ hillaryclinton.com > date : november [ ] , 2015 at * * * * pm cst ( to : [ ] cc : richard mcdaniel < * * * * * * * * * @ hillaryclinton.com > , charles olivier < * * * * * * * * @ hillaryclinton.com > subject : next week { } i hope this email finds you well .
happy early thanksgiving !
i wanted to check in since december is quickly approaching .
we are planning to do another transfer to the dnc on december 1st .
we will follow up to let you know the amount that is transferred .
please let us know if you have any questions .
thanks , brynnevia : breitbart news
