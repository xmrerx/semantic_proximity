hillary is pictured ( below ) in a sort of bikini/monokini that is pretty raunchy .
it s a copy of a photoshopped image that s been on the internet for years .
this really is censorship of the worst kind because it s a known image .

melbourne ( afp ) an australian mural of us presidential nominee hillary clinton in a revealing , stars and stripes swimsuit may be taken down , after it has reportedly been deemed offensive.the creator of the painting , the street artist who goes by the name lushsux and who has also painted murals of the likes of donald trump and kim kardashian , branded calls to remove it pathetic .the provocative mural is on the wall of a small business in the melbourne suburb of footscray , and reports say the business has been asked by the local maribyrnong council to remove it .
we believe it is offensive because of the depiction of a near-naked woman , not on the basis of disrespect to hillary clinton , in accordance with the graffiti prevention act 2007 , the council s chief executive stephen wall told fairfax media on friday.wall said local police had been asked to urgently provide their opinion on the mural , adding that the council intended to issue a notice to the building s owner to remove it within 10 days.lushsux accused the council of being out of control , telling fairfax the mural was on par offence-wise with a deodorant ad.speaking on melbourne radio , lushsux said he suspected that his instagram account , which he said had some 110,000 followers , was deleted due to him posting a photo of the raunchy hillary image .
it s hard enough to be an artist to lose your social media following in this day and age is a big loss , he told 3aw on friday .. via : yahoo
