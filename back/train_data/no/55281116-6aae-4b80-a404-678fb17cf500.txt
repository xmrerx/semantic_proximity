march 4 at 12 pm in berkeley at mlk civic center park : confront and defeat the trump movement !
counter-protest the pro-trump rally in berkeley ( scheduled for 2 pm ) .
very proud that the anti-trump and civil rights movement organizing has already accomplished so much .
the pro-trump groups are dropping like flies .
first neo-fascist group proud boys dropped out , now the racist berkeley college republicans have promised not to come .
but the organizer of the event is still trying to get people to come from other parts of california .
let s make clear that hate speech has no place in berkeley or anywhere.https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=ysy7ov_07pq & feature=youtu.belatina speaks out against antifa anarchists :
