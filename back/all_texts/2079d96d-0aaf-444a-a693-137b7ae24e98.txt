Last night President Donald Trump caved into the Pentagon, the political left, the Neoconservative pro-war lobby and mainstream media pressure to act after the release of YouTube videos produced by the US and UK-funded NGO the White Helmets of an alleged chemical weapons attack by the Syrian Airforce in the al Qaeda stronghold of Idlib in Syria.
Following the US missile strike, Al Qaeda leaders in Syria have hailed the move by Trump, expressing their gratitude for the US President s knee-jerk military action.Al Qaeda and ISIS supporters Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Turkey have also expressed thanks to Trump for helping to degrade the Syrian military who have been fighting and winning against al Qaeda in Syria, ISIS and a host of other Gulf-sponsored terrorist groups operating in Syria.Salafist Jihadist group Ahrar al-Sham welcoming the strikes.
Thanks America.

There was an angry response in Russia, where the Kremlin warned that the strikes would cause significant damage to US-Russia ties .NOTE: Tillerson has now gone so far as to blame Russia for allowing Syria to mount this attack They would act as the guarantor that these weapons would no longer be present in Syria.
Clearly Russia has failed in its responsibility to deliver on that commitment from 2013.
Either Russia has been complicit or Russia has been simply incompetent in its ability to deliver on its end of that agreement.
