frankfurt ( reuters ) - frankfurt s city center , an area including police headquarters , two hospitals , transport systems and germany s central bank storing $ 70 billion in gold reserves will be evacuated on sunday to allow the defusing of a 1.8 ton world war two bomb .
a spokesman for the german bundesbank said , however , the usual security arrangements would remain in place while experts worked to disarm the bomb , dropped by the british air force and uncovered during excavation of a building site .
the bundesbank headquarters , less than 600 meters from the location of the bomb , stores 1,710 tonnes of gold underground , around half the country s reserves .
we have never defused a bomb of this size , bomb disposal expert rene bennert told reuters , adding that it had been damaged on impact when it was dropped between 1943 and 1945 .
airspace for 1.5 kilometers around the bomb site will also be closed .
frankfurt city officials said more than 60,000 residents would be evacuated for at least 12 hours .
the evacuation area would also include 20 retirement homes , the opera house and the diplomatic quarter .
bomb disposal experts will make use of a rocket wrench to try and unscrew the fuses attached to the hc 4,000 bomb .
if that fails , a water jet will be used to cut the fuses away from the bomb , bennert told reuters .
the most dangerous part of the exercise will be applying the wrench , bennert said .
roads and transport systems , including the underground , will be closed during the work and for at least two hours after the bomb is defused , to allow patients to be transported back to hospitals without traffic .
it is not unusual for unexploded bombs from world war two air raids to be found in german cities , but rarely are they so large and in such a sensitive position .
