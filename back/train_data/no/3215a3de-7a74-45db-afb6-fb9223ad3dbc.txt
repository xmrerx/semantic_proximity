this story is from 2006 and is the first in a long series of hillary s lies that we ll be exposing over the next couple of months for more than a decade , one piece of senator hillary rodham clinton s informal biography has been that she was named for sir edmund hillary , the conqueror of mount everest .
the story was even recounted in bill clinton s autobiography.but yesterday , mrs. clinton s campaign said she was not named for sir edmund after all .
it was a sweet family story her mother shared to inspire greatness in her daughter , to great results i might add , said jennifer hanley , a spokeswoman for the campaign.in may 1953 , sir edmund and his sherpa guide , tenzing norgay , became the first men to reach the summit of mount everest .
in 1995 , shortly after meeting sir edmund , mrs. clinton said that her mother , dorothy rodham , had long told her she was named for the famous mountaineer .
it had two l s , which is how she thought she was supposed to spell hillary , mrs. clinton said at the time , after meeting sir edmund .
so when i was born , she called me hillary , and she always told me it s because of sir edmund hillary .
even though bill clinton repeated the story in his 2004 autobiography , my life , hillary clinton did not mention it in her own autobiography , living history , which was published in 2003.but one big hole has been poked in the story over the years , both in cyberspace and elsewhere : sir edmund became famous only after climbing everest in 1953 .
mrs. clinton , as it happens , was born in 1947 .
