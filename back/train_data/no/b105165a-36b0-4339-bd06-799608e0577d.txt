san fransisco 49er s quarterback colin kaepernick refused to stand during the national anthem during a recent nfl football game .
he claimed he would no longer stand for a flag that represents a country who oppresses blacks .
does he even know what oppression is ? 1 ) .
kaepernick coincidentally converted to islam only two months ago.2 ) .
he is engaged to nessa diab , a black lives matter activist who promotes what she calls authentic islam .
the kaepernick s will also have a traditional muslim wedding.3 ) .
kaepernick was abandoned by his black family as a child and was adopted by a white family .
did he suffer like he claims or was he taken care of when no one else wanted him ?
you only hear him talking tough now because something else is driving his anti-american anger.4 ) .to date , kaepernick has donated $ 0 ( zero ) to black lives matter or any other group affiliated with helping minorities .
his net worth is estimated to be over $ 100 million , yet he has donated zero dollars to the issues he claims to be so passionate about .
when the national anthem is played , i salute because i am a black man born and raised in the inner city afforded the opportunity for greatness in my own right .
may you seek god s forgiveness and find humility , because we , the people are not going to forget what you did and said .
conservative daily postformer us rep. , allen west had these tough words for anti-american pro-blm colin kaepernick : blm activists are thugs that vandalize cities and collect welfare checks while our veterans are sleeping under a bridge overpass because they fought for kaepernick to have the freedom to utter ignorant remarks like he did .
