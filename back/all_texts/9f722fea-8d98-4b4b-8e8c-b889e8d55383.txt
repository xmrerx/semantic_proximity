President Trump skipped the White House Correspondents Dinner to hold a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania instead.
How could anyone blame him for wanting to be as far away from that group of piranhas as possible?President Donald Trump railed against the media at a rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, just as the annual White House Correspondents Dinner was set to begin in Washington, DC.In case anyone was wondering if Trump had any facts to back up his assertion that he was and continues to be under siege by the media, he reminded the crowd of a recent poll from MRC:He then went on to mock the White House Correspondents Dinner by reminding his audience who he chose not to spend his evening with: A large group of Hollywood actors and Washington media are consoling each other in a hotel ballroom in our nation s capital right now, he said.
They are gathered together for the White House Correspondents Dinner without the president.
He continued: And I could not possibly be more thrilled than to be 100 miles away from Washington s swamp, spending my evening with all of you and with a much, much larger crowd and much better people.
He also proved that the American people who elected him have not grown any fonder or become more trusting of leftist attack dog media outlets like CNN and MSNBC.
Watch as he mentions CNN during their live broadcast and the audience chants, CNN sucks!
