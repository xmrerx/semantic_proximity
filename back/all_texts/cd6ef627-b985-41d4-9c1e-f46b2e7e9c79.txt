Last week, news broke that white supremacist and former Breitbart head Stever Bannon had been given a seat on the principals committee a role usually reserved for generals while the roles of the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the director of national intelligence had been downgraded and they were told to only attend meetings when issues in their direct area of expertise are being considered.But why would Trump choose to place this much power in the hands of Steve Bannon?
It turns out it wasn t a choice.
The New York Times reports that Trump is signing executive orders without bothering to find out what is in them, and that it was not until after he had signed it that Trump realized one of his numerous executive orders had made Bannon one of the most powerful men in the country:Mr. Priebus bristles at the perception that he occupies a diminished perch in the West Wing pecking order compared with previous chiefs.
But for the moment, Mr. Bannon remains the president s dominant adviser, despite Mr. Trump s anger that he was not fully briefed on details of the executive order he signed giving his chief strategist a seat on the National Security Council, a greater source of frustration to the president than the fallout from the travel ban.Yes, you read that correctly: our President cares so little about doing his job properly that he doesn t even bother to find out the details of the executive orders he is signing even if he is granting an insane amount of power to someone who should not be taken seriously when offering his opinion on ice cream flavors.Bannon s influence has steadily grown as Trump s time in office has passed, to the point that it is not unreasonable to call him not Trump President.
While this is a popular turn of events among white supremacists, a group that was courted heavily by Bannon s propaganda outlet, the rest of the country is steadily growing weary of dealing with someone like Bannon who has described himself as a Leninist who wants to destroy the state having any power at all.Featured image via screengrab
