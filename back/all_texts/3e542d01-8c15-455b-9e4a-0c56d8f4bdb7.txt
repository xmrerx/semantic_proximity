Statues of Donald Trump have appeared in five cities across the country, and it s clear that they re not meant to honor him.
They re almost caricatures, and they portray him stark naked in a rather ahem insulting way.
The intent is essentially to unmask Trump, and portray him as the disgusting little prick he is.The statues were placed in L.A., San Francisco, Seattle, Cleveland and New York City.
The one in New York City was quickly removed, but ABC 7 Chicago reports that the West Coast statues still stand.
An activist group known as INDECLINE, which speaks out against Trump, issued a statement claiming responsibility for the works of art.
They said their hope is that Trump is never installed in the most powerful political and military position in the world.
They also said: It is through these sculptures that we leave behind the physical and metaphorical embodiment of the ghastly soul of one of America s most infamous and reviled politicians.
On their website, INDECLINE calls this particular protest The Emperor Has No Balls, and they ve made it very clear on the statues that they see Trump as the ball-less wonder of the GOP.
A three-minute video on their website shows exactly how they made the statues, complete with sound bytes of some of the worst things Trump has said in his speeches.
You can watch the video below, if you can bear it (warning: Explicit imagery, very NSFW):The Trump campaign didn t comment on the statues, but that may change at some point.
Trump can t stand being portrayed in a bad light, and these statues make him look very bad, indeed.Nude statue of Donald Trump appears on Los Feliz sidewalk https://t.co/65Ot7SDqs6 pic.twitter.com/8scXOCwjFR ABC7 Eyewitness News (@ABC7) August 18, 2016
