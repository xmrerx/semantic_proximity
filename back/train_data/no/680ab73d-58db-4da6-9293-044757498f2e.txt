kuwait ( reuters ) - an annual summit of gulf arab heads of state will convene in kuwait on dec. 5 and 6 , gulf officials said on wednesday , despite an ongoing dispute between some members of group .
a rift between the gulf cooperation council members saudi arabia , bahrain and the united arab emirates ( uae ) , on one side , and qatar on the other has put this year s annual meeting in doubt .
a senior kuwaiti official confirmed on wednesday that the meeting would take place on dec. 5 and 6 , but said the level of representation was not clear yet .
two gulf diplomats also said kuwait , which had led unsuccessful mediation efforts between the two sides , would try again to use the meeting to resolve the rift .
the crisis , which began in june , revolve around allegations by saudi arabia , the uae , bahrain and egypt that qatar supports terrorism , a charge doha denies .
qatar says the four countries are trying to force doha to fall in line with their own foreign policy views .
the u.s.-allied council was founded in 1980 as a bulwark against bigger neighbors iran and iraq .
bahrain said last month it will not attend the summit if qatar does not change its policies and qatar should have its membership in the six-nation group suspended .
