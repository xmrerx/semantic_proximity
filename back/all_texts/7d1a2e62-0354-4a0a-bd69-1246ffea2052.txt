Joy Reid once again proved that she isn t putting up any nonsense on her show.
During a segment of AM Joy, Reid eviscerated a Donald Trump supporter who implied that Planned Parenthood is part of a eugenics program meant to racially cleanse people of color.
Alfonso Aguilar, the executive director Latino Partnership for Conservative Principles went on the program to discuss Trump and his spreading of white supremacist propaganda via his Twitter account when he decided to bring up this conspiracy theory about Planned Parenthood.
He does control his own Twitter account, Reid said.
He is retweeting white nationalists.
Which, if you re following them, and they re somehow in the stream of your social media.
Aguilar responded to Reid, saying: I think I could argue that is a double standard.
Margaret Sanger.
Let s talk about Planned Parenthood That is not a double standard.
You re mentioning a dead person gone for many decades, Reid shot back.
Planned Parenthood is not a eugenicist organization.
And I think that is incredibly offensive.
Planned Parenthood is a health organization.
Good gracious.
Aguilar persists with the line of questioning, saying: 52% of all abortions are performed on Latino and African-American That s as far as Aguilar gets before Reid shuts him down entirely.
Good gracious.
Okay, I think that smear on Planned Parenthood cannot go forward, we are not going to continue with that line of questioning, Reid finished.It s nice to see that there are still people on cable news willing to not give their guests the time of day with their outrageous theories.You can watch a clip of the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot
