I saw this live today and it was fantastic!
This is the difference in the special moments with Donald vs the manufactured moments with Hillary.
It s the real deal!
Guess what, we re gonna do the National Anthem, OK, Donald Trump told the raucous crowd.Speaking at a rally in Anaheim, California, Wednesday, Trump said he was informed that there was not enough time for the National Anthem to be performed something that usually occurs before the presumptive Republican nominee takes the stage because of the television cameras.
I got here, and they all said, We have a great crowd.
We don t have time for the National Anthem, Trump recalled.
I said, Yes we do we have time for the National Anthem, right?
The billionaire businessman then introduced a woman, identified as Sherry Wilkins, who was at the rally and apparently slated to perform the National Anthem but was cut due to time constraints.After Wilkins completed the song, Trump thanked the singer, telling her she had a great voice.
At that, the New York real estate developer continued with the rest of his speech, going to great measures to prove to the crowd that he has great support among women.
I m telling you women do like me, I m telling you, Trump told the cheering crowd as he welcomed a group of women who support his campaign onto the stage.When the group joined Trump on stage, one woman said into the microphone, Thank you, God, for sending us Donald J. Trump to be our next president of the United States of America.
