london ( reuters ) - british foreign secretary boris johnson said on tuesday that his remarks last week about a jailed iranian-british aid worker could have been clearer , and said he had not wanted to add credence to iranian allegations against her .
on nov. 1 , johnson said that nazanin zaghari-ratcliffe had been teaching people journalism before her arrest in iran in april 2016 .
the uk government has no doubt that she was on holiday in iran when she was arrested last year and that was the sole purpose of her visit , johnson said .
my point was that i disagreed with the iranian view that training journalists was a crime , not that i wanted to lend any credence to iranian allegations that mrs zaghari-ratcliffe had been engaged in such activity , he said .
i accept that my remarks could have been clearer in that respect and i am glad to provide this clarification .
johnson said he would travel to iran in the coming weeks and discuss all consular issues there .
