His accusation that President Obama wiretapped him has been thoroughly debunked but Donald Trump attacked NBC anchor Chuck Todd for not covering the fake story.Last month, Trump posted a series of tweets openly accusing President Obama of wiretapping him.Terrible!
Just found out that Obama had my wires tapped in Trump Tower just before the victory.
Nothing found.
This is McCarthyism!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Is it legal for a sitting President to be wire tapping a race for president prior to an election?
Turned down by court earlier.
A NEW LOW!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process.
This is Nixon/Watergate.
Bad (or sick) guy!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017Trump s accusation set off a firestorm around the country because Trump literally accused a former president of a felony.As it turns out, Trump s accusation was totally wrong.
FBI Director James Comey dropped a bombshell on Trump s claim by stating under oath that there was no such wiretap.
Furthermore, when given a deadline to provide evidence to Congress supporting Trump s claim, the Justice Department didn t deliver because there is no such evidence.Trump s claim was merely meant to distract Congress and the media from focusing on the growing Russia scandal.NBC anchor Chuck Todd was not distracted by Trump, and that s why Trump attacked Todd on Saturday and repeated his accusation against President Obama in yet another embarrassing rant on Twitter.When will Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd and @NBCNews start talking about the Obama SURVEILLANCE SCANDAL and stop with the Fake Trump/Russia story?
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017It is the same Fake News Media that said there is no path to victory for Trump that is now pushing the phony Russia story.
A total scam!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 1, 2017Again, Trump is falsely accusing President Obama of wiretapping him even though the claim has been debunked by high level authorities.
Also, Comey told Congress that the FBI is investigating Trump for colluding with Russia during the 2016 Election.And the evidence against Trump continues to pile up.
Even disgraced former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn is asking for an immunity deal.
His testimony could blow the lid off the Russia scandal and put Trump behind bars for high treason.Thus far, Todd has not responded to Trump s attack, but Twitter did it for him.
@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews I love how the president calls people names.
You should reassess your life and learn to be an adult & do your job.

There is NO surveillance scandal (ask the FBI) and #TrumpRussia is very real Jack Schofield (@jackschofield) April 1, 2017@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews So the dead Russians who have connections to you and Putin is all just a coincidence right?
Brandon Neely (@BrandonTXNeely) April 1, 2017@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews The only scandal around Obama surveillance is the fact that you invented it, and @DevinNunes traded his credibility to falsely support it.
Tom Bonier (@tbonier) April 1, 2017@realDonaldTrump @NBCNews Your behavior is that of a guilty man.
