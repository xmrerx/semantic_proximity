maputo ( reuters ) - mozambique s president filipe nyusi will run for re-election in 2019 , his ruling frelimo party said on monday , a step toward a vote meant to end sporadic clashes .
nyusi is expected to square off with opposition renamo party leader afonso dhlakama , whose supporters have fought with government forces since a disputed election three years ago .
both leaders met for the first time since 2015 in august , raising hopes of a resolution to the conflict , whose scale is difficult to gauge because fighting takes place mostly in the remote interior .
nyusi told delegates at the ruling party s conference he would continue with efforts for peace dhlakama , who has been in hiding at the gorongosa mountains with hundreds of fighters .
it is an urgent task that belongs to everyone , regardless of political affiliation , religious or social position , nyusi said .
competition over natural resources could be exacerbating unrest : mozambique is on the verge of developing huge offshore gas reserves which could transform one of the world s poorest countries into a middle-income state .
members of the current government and renamo fought on opposing sides in a civil war from 1975 to 1992 that killed an estimated 1 million people .
nyusi , 57 , an engineer , has been in power since 2014 when he was picked by frelimo to succeed armando guebuza .
frelimo has ruled mozambique since its independence in 1975 .
the former guerrilla commander dhlakama , 64 , has lost every major election to frelimo since the end of the civil war but topped the vote count in several central and two northern provinces in 2014 .
