Alison Camerota interviewed former NH Governor John Sununu and decided to do some pouting when she didn t hear what she wanted to.

Do you?
Camerota: No.
Sununu: Ok that should end your reporting right there!
You should put an exclamation point after your No !
Camerota went on to say that we re still at the beginning of the investigation despite the fact that we are several months in.Sununu: You re seven months into the investigation!
You re seven months!
How much crow are you going to eat?
