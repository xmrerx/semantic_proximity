The Constitution in everyday life causes people pain Wendy Kozol, Oberlin CollegeAdministrators at Vassar College and Oberlin College agreed to personally shred a pocket Constitution after an undercover reporter posing as a student complained that she felt triggered by its distribution on campus.The video was produced by Project Veritas, a non-profit established by conservative journalist James O Keefe, and employs a similar style to the undercover ACORN videos that first brought him to prominence.
Last week something kinda happened on campus that kind of really upset me and I ended up having a panic attack, the reporter tells Vassar College Assistant Director of Equal Opportunity Kelly Grab.
It s just I ve been kind of hiding out in my room ever since kind of scared, so, finally somebody told me I should maybe come talk to you about it and see if there s anything that can happen or anything They were handing the Constitution out on campus.
Oh, CATO Institute, Grab murmurs while looking the booklet over.
They were handing it out and as soon as I saw it you know I started to not be able to breathe, hyperventilating, the reporter elaborated.
My vision went blurry and I just kind of just lost control.
After establishing that the reaction was triggered merely by the offering of copies of the Constitution and not by anything the group had said, Grab offers her sympathies to the reporter.Via: Campus Reform
