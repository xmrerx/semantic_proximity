MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia will veto a draft U.N. resolution being pushed by the United States, Britain and France which aims to bolster support for international inquiries into a deadly toxic gas attack in Syria, the Interfax news agency reported on Wednesday.
The U.N. Security Council could vote on the draft resolution later on Wednesday.
It is similar to a text circulated to the 15-member council last week that condemns the April 4 attack and pushes Syriaâ€™s government to cooperate with investigators.
Interfax cited Russian deputy foreign minister Gennady Gatilov as saying Russia would veto it in its current form.
