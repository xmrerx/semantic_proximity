WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States is closely watching the situation in Saudi Arabia amid reported asset agreements between Saudi authorities and some detainees in an anti-corruption crackdown, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Friday.
Asked about the agreements to hand over wealth for detainees freedom, Mnuchin told CNBC I think that the Crown Prince (Mohammed bin Salman) is doing a great job at transforming the country, adding that the United States was obviously monitoring the situation.
