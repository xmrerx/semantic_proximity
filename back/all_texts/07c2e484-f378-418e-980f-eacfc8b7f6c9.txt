We are supposed to have a government of the people, by the people and for the people, but instead we have a government of the elite, by the elite and for the elite.
Most people do not realize this, but today most members of Congress are actually millionaires.
The disconnect between members of Congress and average Americans has never been greater than it is right now, and I think that is a very troubling sign for the future of this nation.Sen.
Ted Cruz (R-Texas) and Rep. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) are pushing for an amendment to the Constitution to place term limits on lawmakers, arguing the move will help overhaul Washington.
The American people resoundingly agreed on Election Day, and President-elect Donald Trump has committed to putting government back to work for the American people, Cruz said in a statement on Tuesday.
It is well past time to put an end to the cronyism and deceit that has transformed Washington into a graveyard of good intentions.
Under an amendment the two GOP lawmakers filed on Tuesday, House members would be allowed to serve three two-year terms and senators would be able to serve two six-year terms.

Jan. 4, 1995 As you looked over those lists, you probably noticed that they contain many of the members of Congress that Americans complain about the most.Unfortunately, because the vast majority of these individuals come from states or congressional districts that are basically a lock to vote a certain way, there is very little hope of ever removing them.
That means that most of these Congress critters are going to get to keep coming back for as long as they want.No matter which political party you prefer, this should greatly disturb you.Our founders certainly never intended for a permanent class of elitists to rule over us.But that is what we have.
