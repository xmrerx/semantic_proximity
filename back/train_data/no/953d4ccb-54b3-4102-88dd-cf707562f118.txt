buckle up america .
barack doesn t give up easily .
when he wants something , he ll stop at nothing to get it .
chicago politics can get really ugly , and when we have a chicago community organizer lives in our white house all bets are off .
it doesn t help that we have a congress who is willing to sit back and watch him trample our constitution when president obama spoke in reaction to the heinous october 1 attack on umpqua community college , he went beyond his usual calls for more gun control and suggested instead that america consider following the path blazed by australia and great britain.in the mid-1990s australia and great britain both instituted what were virtually complete bans on firearm possession.obama referenced the bans thus : we know that other countries , in response to one mass shooting , have been able to craft laws that almost eliminate mass shootings .
friends of ours , allies of ours great britain , australia , countries like ours .
so we know there are ways to prevent it .
