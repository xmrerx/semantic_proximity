Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump s adviser, says that all information about Russia s interference in the U.S. presidential election and the president-elect s Russian ties should be kept secret.
Not because Trump has something to hide, but to protect the public.
Conway appeared on Fox and Friends Sunday morning and when she was asked about FBI Director James Comey, she spun the conversation around to whine that classified information should not be handed out to the public.
In other words, she s upset the world found out about Trump s Russian pee pee party.
I m always disappointed how public and sometimes political some of these figures can seem to be, Conway said.
I m very concerned, very concerned.
You realize it is the Trump team, only us at this time, that is not divulging what occurred in a classified briefing.
Ladies and gentlemen, she continued.
It s called a classified briefing for a reason.
You had the vice president of the United States making a comment about it the other day.
You have intelligence officials confirming or denying.
This classified information, it s top secret.
Why is it top secret?
It s not top secret to keep it from the public, but to protect the public.
That s right folks, you shouldn t know anything about Trump s Russian escapades.
The American people should be kept totally in the dark about the foreign government meddling in the highest levels of our democracy.
And it s for your own good, dammit!Conway then added that Trump is going to do all the things he promised to do, including building his stupid wall and snatching health care away from millions of Americans.Watch Conway insist we should keep Trump s pee party top secret to protect the public, here: Featured image via video screen capture
