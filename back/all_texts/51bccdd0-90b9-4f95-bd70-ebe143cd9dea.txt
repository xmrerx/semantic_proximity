The GOP presidential candidate who couldn t seem to find his spine when he had the perfect opportunity to stop Barack Obama from serving a second term, has suddenly discovered how to fight.
The only problem is, the Never-Trumper has taken his fight to our President, who happens to very popular with Republicans.
Does Mitt Romney believe he can win a US Senate seat in the conservative state of Utah by criticizing President Trump?
Will Romney s gamble pay off, or will he find himself in the loser s column again in a state where 46% of the residents voted for Trump, while only 28% voted for Clinton.But Romney, not a lifelong resident is taking heat for carpet bagging:Romney has lived in Utah for approximately 5 five years after losing his 2012 presidential bid to Barack Obama.
The former Massachusetts governor has been accused of carpetbagging by Republican officials in the state.
I think he s keeping out candidates that I think would be a better fit for Utah because let s face it, Mitt Romney doesn t live here, his kids weren t born here, he doesn t shop here, Utah GOP chairman Rob Anderson told the Salt Lake City Tribune.Watch Romney ad here:I am running for United States Senate to serve the people of Utah and bring Utah's values to Washington.
