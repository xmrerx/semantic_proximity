washington ( reuters ) - the united states is ending temporary protected status for citizens of sudan as of 2018 but extending it for citizens of south sudan through mid-2019 , the department of homeland security said in a statement on monday .
temporary protected status allows nationals of certain countries , often facing armed conflict or major natural disasters , who are already in the united states to temporarily remain and work there .
both sudan and south sudan s designations were due to expire on nov. 2 .
instead , sudanese nationals are allowed to stay legally for another year , but then must leave .
dhs urged them in a statement to use their remaining time to prepare for and arrange their departure from the united states or apply for other visa types allowing them to stay .
but acting dhs secretary elaine duke decided to extend south sudan s tps status until may 2 , 2019 , dhs said , because the ongoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions that prompted the 2016 decision to grant the status to south sudanese have persisted .
south sudan was the world s youngest country when it became independent from neighboring sudan in 2011 following decades of conflict .
but the new nation dissolved into civil war less than two years later , after president salva kiir , an ethnic dinka , fired his deputy , riek machar , a nuer .
since then tens of thousands have died , and 3.5 million of the country s 12 million citizens have fled their homes , creating africa s largest refugee crisis since rwanda s 1994 genocide .
el salvador , haiti , honduras , nepal , nicaragua , somalia , syria and yemen are the other countries whose nationals can qualify for temporary protected status in the united states .
