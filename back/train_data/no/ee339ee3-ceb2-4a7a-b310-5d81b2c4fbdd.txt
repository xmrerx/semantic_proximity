tonight was so disappointing !
ted cruz did what we tell our children not to do in the face of doing the right thing even though it sucks to lose .
cruz never endorsed the man who clearly beat him donald trump .
he proved himself to be a small man who put himself before what s best for america .
because , let s face it , if you re not endorsing trump by now then you re campaigning for hillary.so cruz spoke about cruz most of the speech making us wonder if he was just doing this to promote himself for the 2020 presidential election ya think ?
when the convention crowd realized cruz wouldn t endorse trump they went nuts !
trump pulled a great move and stepped on the end of ted s speech well played donald ! delegates at the # rncincle booed @ tedcruz after he finished his speech w/out endorsing nominee @ realdonaldtrump .

then ted pulled a fast one on dr. carson and trump came to carson s defense .
remember that ? looks like teddy clinton wants hillary to be president since he never endorsed donald trump .
who s the true conservative now ?
