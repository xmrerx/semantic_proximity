geneva ( reuters ) - the u.n. independent expert on the independence of judges and lawyers criticized poland on friday for legal reforms that have already attracted unprecedented censure from the european union , dubbing them a serious breach of the rule of law .
diego garc a-say n , a special rapporteur mandated by the u.n. human rights council to investigate the independence of judges and lawyers , said poland s newly adopted laws threatened the independence of the judiciary .
these new laws are part of a larger plan aimed at placing the judiciary under the political control of the ruling party , garc a-say n said in a statement .
he said poland had been comprehensively reforming its judicial system since parliamentary elections in 2015 , aiming to increase its effectiveness and restore public trust .
such reforms were a legitimate objective , he added .
what is happening in poland today , however , is a vicious attempt to place the whole judicial system under the control of the executive and legislative branches .
the eu executive launched an unprecedented action against poland on wednesday , calling on other member states to prepare to sanction warsaw if it fails to reverse judicial reforms that brussels says pose a threat to democracy .
[ nl8n1ok2yj ] poland s government rejects accusations of undemocratic behavior and says reforms are needed because the courts are slow , inefficient and steeped in a communist era-mentality .
