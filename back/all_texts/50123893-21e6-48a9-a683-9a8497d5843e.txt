What happens when a thin-skinned bully becomes President?
Apparently, he will even threaten children who hurt his precious little fee-fees.A 17-year-old girl known only as Lucy from San Fransisco created a cute website for her resume that featured kittens punching Donald Trump.
Lucy created TrumpScratch.com as a fun little project.
It s pretty simple users click on The Donald s face to punch him with tiny kitten paws.But her project, which was intended for fun, caused Lucy to fall into a legal nightmare because at his core, Donald Trump is nothing more than a schoolyard bully who can t deal with any form of criticism whatsoever.After the website was live for three weeks, Lucy received a cease and desist letter from Trump s general counsel.The letter calls Trump a well-known businessman and informs Lucy that As I m sure you re aware, the Trump name is internationally known and famous.
And, of course, as a public figure he opens himself up to criticism even if it is in the form of a kitten-themed website it took a high school girl three hours to code.
I was going to just let this go, but I think it s, pardon my French, fucking outrageous that the president of the United States has his team scouring the internet for sites like mine to send out cease and desists and legal action claims if we don t shut down, Lucy told the Observer.
Meanwhile, he tweets about The Apprentice ratings and sends out power-drunk tweets about phone tapping.
HOW ABOUT BEING THE PRESIDENT?
She changed the website to KittenFeed.com, but says they still came at me.
It s so sad that his administration is focused more on being liked, burying real news and taking down sites like mine as they supposedly make him look bad, she says.You can view her masterpiece here.Featured image via screengrab
