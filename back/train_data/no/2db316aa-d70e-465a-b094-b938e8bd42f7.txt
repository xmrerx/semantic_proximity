london ( reuters ) - spanish foreign minister alfonso dastis said on sunday he hoped that people in catalonia would disregard any instruction from the regional leadership if spain moves to suspend the region s autonomy .
all the government is trying to do , and reluctantly , is to reinstate the legal order , to restore the constitution but also the catalan rules and proceed from there , he told the bbc s andrew marr show .
we are going to establish the authorities who are going to rule the day-to-day affairs of catalonia according to the catalan laws and norms ...
i hope everyone will disregard whatever instructions they will be planning to give because they will not have the legal authority to do that .
