ankara ( reuters ) - turkish president tayyip erdogan said on sunday businessmen who attempted to move assets abroad were traitors , and called on his cabinet to block any such moves .
i am seeing signals , news that some businessmen are trying to move their assets abroad , and i call on firstly my cabinet from here to never allow this exit for any of them because these people are traitors , erdogan said .
speaking to members of his ruling ak party in the eastern province of mus , erdogan did not say to whom he was referring , nor did he single out a single business , person or country of destination .
his comments come after the state-run anadolu news agency said on friday that turkish prosecutors were set to seize the assets of turkish-iranian gold trader reza zarrab , who is cooperating with u.s. prosecutors in the trial of a turkish bank executive charged with evading u.s. sanctions on iran , and his acquaintances .
the trial has caused already strained ties between nato allies ankara and washington to deteriorate further as zarrab detailed in court a scheme to evade the u.s. sanctions , saying that erdogan personally authorized two turkish banks to join the scheme when prime minister .
ankara has cast the testimony as an attempt to undermine turkey and its economy , and has previously said it was a clear plot by the network of u.s.-based fethullah gulen , who it alleges engineered last year s coup attempt .
we can not take kindly to those who earn in this country and then try to take those earnings abroad , erdogan said .
