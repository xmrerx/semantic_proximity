Let s face it, 2016 has been a hero-stealing rat of a year so far.
From David Bowie to Prince and every amazing person in between the world has had its legend population culled this year.
Yet, Arizona s cruel ultra-conservative Sheriff Joe Arpaio not only lives on, but gets to make despicable comments about those who died, like he just did with Prince.To put Arpaio s comments in some context basically the whole nation and much of the world, regardless of political stripe, is openly grieving over the untimely death of a cultural icon.Minneapolis chose to rock out to Purple Rain:This is what it sounds like when thousands of Prince faithful sing Purple Rain.

#RIPPrince https://t.co/B6aHzYUCoG NFL (@NFL) April 21, 2016Artists, fans and political and humanitarian leaders from around the globe have been busy commemorating Prince s life and work.
But for Sheriff Arpaio, the death was nothing more than a chance for a little self-promotion.Condolences to Prince family.
He allegedly was treated for a drug overdose days ago.
I celebrated 20 yrs of drug rehab in my jails today.

We remember the horrific scenes when Vice President Joe Biden s son died, and conservative trolls literally celebrated.
It left many of us thinking: surely brain cancer doesn t need to be a partisan issue?
Surely we should be able to mourn the untimely death of a person with compassion, whoever they vote for?
Can we not just be human beings together in these moments?For some it seems, the answer is a resolute Hell no!
