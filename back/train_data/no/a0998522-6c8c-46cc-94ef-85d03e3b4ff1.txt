manila ( reuters ) - philippine president rodrigo duterte on wednesday announced that russia would donate defense hardware to support the military s fight against pro-islamic state militants , who he said could regroup and attack anywhere and everywhere .
duterte said russia would provide about 5,000 assault rifles in a deal to be signed this month , and the philippine military would no longer have to use second-hand arms .
we will have the kalashnikov , he said in a speech to troops , adding that russia wanted to keep the donation secret .
moscow s gift would follow china s donation of more than 6,000 assault rifles and 100 sniper rifles , among the fruits of duterte s efforts to form partnerships with two arms-producing powers that are rivals to the united states .
the united states has for decades been the philippines defense treaty ally and its biggest source or hardware and training , providing about $ 1 billion in equipment since 2000 .
duterte has made no secret of his animosity toward washington and his disdain for the u.s. military alliance .
a senior defense official told reuters the russian weapons would arrive later this month , when russia s defense minister attends a regional meeting .
the rifles would be accompanied by millions of rounds of ammunition and dozens of army trucks .
five russian warships were due to visit in manila to deliver the equipment , the official said .
four have visited the country this year , in two separate visits .
duterte said the military needed to be properly equipped to handle islamic state loyalists who had established a dangerous foothold in mindanao in the south .
they will not disappear , they will regroup anywhere and everywhere , duterte said .
