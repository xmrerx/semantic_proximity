berlin ( reuters ) - germany has extended temporary passport controls on its border with austria and for flights coming from greece for six more months amid continuing concerns about attacks and illegal immigration , the interior ministry said on thursday .
the european commission last month offered initial backing to a franco-german proposal to allow more permanent border checks within the bloc s schengen free-travel zone .
germany notified the european commission , the council of the european union , the president of the european parliament and the interior ministers of the eu-schengen states about its decision in a letter on wednesday .
the commission allowed germany to control its border with austria in 2015 after a surge of refugees and migrants began arriving in western europe .
the temporary permission was due to expire on nov. 11 .
immigration will be a key issue in coalition talks by chancellor angela merkel s conservatives , the pro-business free democrats and the environmentalist greens .
interior minister thomas de maiziere justified germany s move given continued security concerns , and said a complete return to free travel within the schengen area was contingent on an improvement in the overall situation .
germany was hit by five islamist attacks in 2016 , including one in december on a berlin christmas market that killed 12 people .
we are working hard on this , all member states , the eu commission and the eu council , but there is still a long way to go , de maiziere said in a statement .
border controls also apply to flights to germany from greece , which was the gateway for thousands of migrants from iraq and syria .
ministry data on wednesday showed that 140,000 asylum seekers have registered in germany since the beginning of 2017 .
