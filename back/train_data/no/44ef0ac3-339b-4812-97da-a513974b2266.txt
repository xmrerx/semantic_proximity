no challenge poses a greater threat to future generations than climate change .
obama state of the union speech , 2015there is a very good reason why the left is now shaming anyone who doesn t believe in the phony science of global warming .
in what amounts to essentially a money laundering scheme , the campaigns of some of the most dishonest politicians in washington are being funded by the business owners who are hand-selected by those crooked politicians to receive billions for global climate change initiatives.the liberal media machine has spent decades bulldozing anyone who tells you global warming is a sham.they even came up with a clever little title deniers .
every time a heat wave hits , every time a picture of a lone polar bear gets taken .
.
.
the left pounds the table for environmental reform , more policy , more money to combat climate change .
but how much has the world really warmed ? their message is simple : get on the man-made global warming bandwagon .
.
.
or you re just ignorant.but how much has the world really warmed ? it s an important question , considering the u.s. government spends $ 22 billion a year to fight the global warming crisis ( twice as much as it spends protecting our border ) .to put that in perspective , that is $ 41,856 every minute going to global warming initiatives.but that s just the tip of a gargantuan iceberg.according to forbes columnist larry bell , the ripple effect of global warming initiatives actually costs americans $ 1.75 trillion .
.
.
every year.that s three times larger than the entire u.s. federal budget deficit.so , has anyone stopped to ask .
.
.
how much has the globe actually warmed ? well , we asked , and what we found was striking.according to nasa s own data via remote sensing systems ( rss ) , the world has warmed a mere .36 degrees fahrenheit over the last 35 years ( they started measuring the data in 1979 ) .hardly anything to panic about ; however , that does mean the world is warmer , right ? the problem with that argument is that we experienced the bulk of that warming between 1979 and 1998 .
.
.
since then , we ve actually had temperatures dropping ! as can be seen in this chart , we haven t seen any global warming for 17 years.weakening the global warming argument is data showing that the north polar ice cap is increasing in size .
recent satellite images from nasa actually reflect an increase of 43 % to 63 % .this is quite the opposite of what the global warming faction warned us.in 2007 , while accepting his nobel prize for his global warming initiative , al gore made this striking prediction , the north polar ice cap is falling off a cliff .
it could be completely gone in summer in as little as seven years .
seven years from now .
al gore could not have been more wrong.however , despite this clear evidence that the temperatures are not increasing , the global warming hysteria only seems to be increasing.for example : president obama himself tweeted on may 16 , 2014 : 97 % of scientists agree : climate change is real , man-made and dangerous .
john kerry , al gore , and a host of others have championed this statistic.since then , it has become clear that this statistic was inaccurate.the wall street journal went as far as to say , the assertion that 97 % of scientists believe that climate change is a man-made , urgent problem is a fiction .
forbes headlined global warming alarmists caught doctoring 97 % consensus claims .
come to find out , the study president obama was citing was botched from the start.a host of other problems for the global warming crowd are emerging , such as .
.
.leaked emails from global warming scientists state that the earth is not warming , such as this one from kevin trenberth that states , the fact is that we can t account for the lack of warming at the moment and it is a travesty we can t. claude allegre , the founding father of the man-made global warming ethos , recently renounced his position that man has caused warming.proof is emerging that al gore and even president obama have financially benefited from fueling the global warming hysteria ( click here for an internal report on this ) .it is becoming harder and harder for the global warming community to ignore some of the scientific data that show the earth is not getting warmer .
.
.
instead , the world is getting cooler.which makes one wonder why are we still spending $ 22 billion a year on global warming initiatives , and where is the money going ?
global warming has been kept on life support for another crucial reason : it has been a practical atm for every in-the-know political figure.al gore , for example , has been one of the most vocally aggressive crusaders for global warming .
in 2001 , before leaving office as vice president , gore was worth less than $ 2 million .
since then , he has grown his wealth to $ 100 million .
.
.
almost entirely by investing in a handful of green-tech companies .
.
.
14 of which received more than $ 2.5 billion in loans , grants , tax breaks , and more from the obama administration.the telegraph reports al gore could become the world s first carbon billionaire thanks to his investments in green companies .
.
.
all of which benefit from tax dollars and government loans to prevent global warming .
and he s not alone.you are likely familiar with the story of the failed solyndra green energy initiative , which cost taxpayers $ 500 million ; president obama took a lot of flak for that.but here s a little-known side of the solyndra story i bet you haven t heard : obama , in essence , used taxpayer money to finance his re-election campaign .
.
.
by funneling it through solyndra.you see , when solyndra fell on hard times , it passed into the hands of two large private equity investors .
.
.
goldman sachs and george kaiser .
when $ 500 million in taxpayer money was given to solyndra , both goldman sachs and george kaiser benefited .
coincidentally , both have made contributions to obama s election campaigns adding up to roughly $ 1.25 million.it doesn t stop there.in 2010 , another federal loan of $ 400 million went abound solar .
that resulted in a bankruptcy as well .
but investors in abound solar seemed to do just fine .
.
.
investors like billionaire heiress patricia stryker .
stryker has famously contributed $ 500,000 to the coalition for progress while throwing $ 85,000 toward obama s inaugural committee .
it s just a coincidence that the government handed a company she invested in $ 400 million just before bankruptcy .
.
.
right ? there s also a123 systems , which paid one lobbying firm $ 970,000 to secure money from the government and received $ 279 million in federal assistance .
the ceo of a123 systems went on to fund multiple democratic senators and contributed to obama s campaign.first solar received $ 646 million in government loan guarantees , and has since contributed more than $ 180,000 to democratic campaigns.ge is notorious for spending tens of millions of dollars a year to buy green energy credits for its wind turbines and other green technologies credits which helped the firm pay zero taxes in 2011.there are a host of other examples of liberals getting wealthy off global warming initiatives just like these.you can see why green energy is such a profitable business ceos and executives get to rake in millions of dollars , while politicians get lucrative donations for their campaigns .
.
.
and scientists get all the funding they need to keep them going .
.
.
all on your dime.but here s the cherry on top .
.
.while $ 22 billion of our money is being redistributed every year to greedy scientists , politicians , and corporations .
.
. $ 22 billion is just what is spent on these global warming initiatives.the reality is , these initiatives have ripple effects .
.
.
mainly the regulations ( from government agencies like the environmental protection agency ) that shackle free enterprise and force us to rely on foreign energy.according to forbes , the total cost of these ripple effects is a staggering $ 1.75 trillion annually.i want you to really think about that for a moment.we re watching $ 1.75 trillion per year .
.
.
$ 3,329,528 per minute .
.
.
go to waste.it s worse when you note that the u.s. energy information administration says these regulations could ultimately cause gasoline prices to rise 77 % over baseline projections .
.
.
send 3 million americans to the welfare line .
.
.
and reduce average household income by a whopping $ 4,000 each year.washington knows all of this .
.
.
and is still barreling forward with its nonsense policies ! they re just letting you foot the bill , while they pocket the benefits .
climate change is no longer some far-off problem ; it is happening here , it is happening now .
fact is , organizations like the environmental protection agency have handcuffed capitalism .
.
.
based on a theory even its staunchest supporters have already renounced.the result : reduced business , higher energy and food costs , higher taxes , lost jobs , and more money going overseas.for entire story : newsmax
