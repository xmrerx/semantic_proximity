As the 41 day standoff between federal officials and the Bundy terrorists who occupied Oregon s Malheur National Wildlife Sanctuary finally came to an end, a group calling itself The Harney County Trio released a hilarious tribute to the now arrested patriots.
The trio, identified only as Garrett, Laura and Rob, posted the video to YouTube on February 11, just as the last four Bundy terrorists surrendered to federal authorities.The song, titled The Ballad Of The Malheur Patriots, immortalizes Ammon Bundy and his band of American Heroes, paying tribute to the most significant moments that occurred during the occupation.From the group s first desperate plea for supplies, sent out just two days into the siege, to the table full of dicks and dildos they got in response, the ballad is both historically accurate and genuinely hilarious.The video incorporates scenes from the standoff, along with authentic footage of the Malheur Wildlife Sanctuary.During the chorus, the group belts out the heartfelt lines, Patriots, patriots storming a building surrounded by ducks.
They didn t stand down.
They vowed to stand up, even if they didn t know for what.
