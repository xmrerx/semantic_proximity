delta air lines and bank of america became the first companies to announce they are pulling their sponsorships of a manhattan-based theater company s portrayal of julius caesar as a donald trump look-alike in a business suit who gets stabbed to death on stage.delta and bank of america both announced their intentions on sunday .
no matter what your political stance may be , the graphic staging of julius caesar at this summer s free shakespeare in the park does not reflect delta air lines values , the company s statement said .
their artistic and creative direction crossed the line on the standards of good taste .
bank of america added it was withdrawing funding for the production .
the public theater chose to present julius caesar in such a way that was intended to provoke and offend , the bank said in a tweet .
had this intention been made known to us , we would have decided not to sponsor it .
fox news american express also took to twitter and announced their sponsorship doesn t support the play.a statement from american express : pic.twitter.com/ig0ju3b2dp american express ( @ americanexpress ) june 12 , 2017 we would like to clarify that our sponsorship of the public theater does not fund the production of shakespeare in the park nor do we condone the interpretation of the julius caesar play , the financial corporation tweeted.customers of american express responded on twitter : i 'm am considering not accepting ae cards at my business and reminding customers why just to clarify .
rex prescott ( @ rex1956 ) june 12 , 2017sadly , we expect the new york times to support a production of president trump being assassinated , but amex customers like myself who currently use an american express card can just as easily switch to visa or mastercard .
the fees are generally less and both alternatives seem to be more widely accepted by businesses .
seems almost like a no-brainer
