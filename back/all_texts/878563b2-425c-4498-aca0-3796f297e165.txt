THE HAGUE (Reuters) - Former Bosnian Serb military leader Ratko Mladic will appeal his conviction and life sentence, his legal team said on Wednesday after a U.N. war crimes tribunal found him guilty of genocide.
It is certain we will file an appeal and the appeal will be successful, attorney Dragan Ivetic told journalists.
