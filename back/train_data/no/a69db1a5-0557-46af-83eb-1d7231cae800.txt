obama has filled his cabinet with radical yes men and women who hold similar anti-american , leftist views .
his radical treasury secretary , jack lew is no exception.treasury secretary jack lew announced yesterday that alexander hamilton s face will remain on the front of the $ 10 bill and harriet tubman will replace andrew jackson on the face of the $ 20 bill.what the left forgot in their haste to replace a racist white ( democrat ) president on the front of the $ 20 bill was the fact that harriet tubman was more than just a black abolitionist , she also serves as an excellent example of why our second amendment is so important.harriet tubman ( born araminta harriet ross ; 1820 march 10 , 1913 ) was an african-american abolitionist , humanitarian , and union spy during the american civil war .
she carried a revolver , and was not afraid to use it .
.
.once a slave agreed to join her expedition , there was no turning back ; she threatened to shoot anyone who tried to return .
tubman told the tale of one journey with a group of fugitive slaves , when morale sank and one man insisted he was going to go back to the plantation.she pointed the gun at his head and said , you go on or die .
several days later , he was with the group as they entered canada .
it is more than likely that tubman carried the handgun as protection from ever-present slave catchers and their dogs.via : the truth about gunsbreaking : treasury throws founder of the democratic party off $ 20 bill , replaces with gun-toting republican pic.twitter.com/g9dvxptaxv david burge ( @ iowahawkblog ) april 20 , 2016tubman s reliance on her firearms to fulfill her mission of freeing slaves was essential .
so it only seems fitting that the us treasury would use this picture of republican , harriet tubman to replace the first democrat president of the united states , andrew jackson .
