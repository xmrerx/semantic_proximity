i feel like i ve been drugged by obama s rhetoric greg gutfeldyes , obama held a rhetoric-filled press conference today and confirmed he ll nominate someone for the supreme court .
he poked the republicans for their wish to delay the process until a new president comes into office .
obama spoke of the constitution and what it says about the process for picking a new supreme court justice .
it s funny that all of a sudden obama wants to pay attention to the constitution .
don t you just love the hypocrisy in all this .
obama painted republicans as obstructionists in this nominating process yet he forgets that he obstructed the nomination of justice alito .
he claimed that republicans have blocked numerous judicial appointments yet 201 of his nominations since 2009 have been approved with two being supreme court justices.the most interesting comment came when he spoke of hillary clinton s great as secretary of state ( even though she s currently being investigated by the fbi ) but then took a swipe at trump : i continue to believe mr. trump will not be president being president is a serious job it s not a reality show .
it s not promotion .
