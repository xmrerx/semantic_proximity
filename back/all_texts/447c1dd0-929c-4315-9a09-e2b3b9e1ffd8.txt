President-elect Donald Trump loves bragging about two things: things he doesn t deserve and things that aren t true.
He kills two birds with one stone when he boasts about his landslide win, which is technically a loss when you consider that Hillary Clinton beat him by millions of votes.Despite how much Trump feels he deserves the presidency, many Americans disagree and we re seeing direct proof of this resistance as Trump is finding it impossible to get people to perform at his inauguration in January.
With only a few weeks to go and no A-list entertainers up for the task, Trump had hoped he could turn to his longtime pal, opera singer Andrea Bocelli.
It was reported: Trump has a long-standing relationship with Bocelli, and wants to ask him in person to perform.
The plan is to have acts at the inauguration that are meaningful for Trump, and he s a huge fan of Bocelli.
But unfortunately for Trump, this too is falling apart.
Despite being friends with Trump for years, Bocelli has chosen to bail on him due to the intense backlash the singer faced on social media.
Some threatened to Boycott Bocelli , while other fans warned him, You will lose millions of fans.
According to another close source: Bocelli said there was no way he d take the gig .
.
.
he was getting too much heat and he said no.
As time runs out, so are Trump s options.
He s already faced multiple rejections from artists such as John Legend, Adam Lambert, and Elton John.
Trump became so desperate that he started to offer U.S. ambassadorships to talent agents if they could find him someone to perform, but that hasn t worked either.But Trump still has one more option.
Considering that Trump ditched a critical press conference to have a meeting with artist Kanye West last week, perhaps Trump might consider asking him.
It would only make sense to have an artist just as egotistical and narcissistic as Trump perform at his inauguration.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images
