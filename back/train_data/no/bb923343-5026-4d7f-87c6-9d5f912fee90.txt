washington ( reuters ) - eight republican candidates have qualified for the prime-time fox news/google debate on thursday , with donald trump winning the center-stage spot as the top-polling candidate , fox news announced on tuesday .
but trump said on tuesday he likely will not attend the debate .
this will be the last one before the iowa caucuses on monday marking the first contest in the nomination race for the nov. 8 presidential election .
trump has been engaged in a public spat with fox news that began at a debate last august in which he said he was subject to unfair questioning by moderator megyn kelly .
“ let ’ s see how much money fox makes without me in the debate , ” trump told the news conference in marshalltown , iowa .
senator rand paul of kentucky , who failed to qualify for the main event in the last debate , made the cut this time .
the other participants in the 9 p.m. est debate will be texas senator ted cruz , florida senator marco rubio , retired neurosurgeon ben carson , new jersey governor chris christie , former florida governor jeb bush and ohio governor john kasich .
former hewlett-packard chief executive carly fiorina , former arkansas governor mike huckabee , former pennsylvania senator rick santorum and former virginia governor jim gilmore qualified for the 7 p.m. est debate for low-polling candidates .
after failing to qualify for a prime-time debate held earlier this month , paul declined to participate in the so-called undercard debate .
