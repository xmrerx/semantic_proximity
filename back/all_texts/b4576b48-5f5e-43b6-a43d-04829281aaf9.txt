We know without a doubt that Trump s blatantly racist campaign has had a massive effect on adults in this country.
Suddenly, the bigots that were too afraid to voice their opinions aloud have found the courage to spew their hate speech openly and Trump has only encouraged more division and violence throughout America.
But if you think that adults are the only ones being affected by this, you re wrong.Thanks to a new ad from progressive group Move On, we re able to see that Trump s campaign is taking a devastating toll on non-white and Muslim children, who are getting bullied in school.
The ad, titled Our Kids, runs through several powerful news clips where minority children have been threatened or harassed by their white, racist peers who have undoubtedly latched onto Trump s messaging after learning it from their parents or from the media.In one news bit, white students were chanting Trump s name at black and Latino players during a high school basketball game in Chicago.
In another, Latino students were humiliated when vandals in Oregon hung a banner that said, Build a wall.
One student who was interviewed in the clip said that Students don t feel safe.
Students don t want to go to school anymore.
Another said, Lately, it s just been getting worse.
This ad is less than 90 seconds long, but it perfectly sums up that the biggest motivating force behind Trump s campaign and its voters is racism, regardless of what Trump s surrogates try to say.
Move On s ad gave viewers a brutal reality check when it said: Donald Trump is endangering our kids.
Perhaps the next most powerful message in the ad was the call to action for adults to do something to protect all the children in the country.
The ad said: Protect our kids from Trump s hate speech.
Vote November 8th.
