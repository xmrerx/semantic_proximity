MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - Mexico on Friday urged the governments of the United States and Cuba to find points of agreement and resolve their differences “via dialogue”, following U.S. President Donald Trump’s announcement of a tougher policy towards Cuba.
“The Mexican government reiterates its friendship and solidarity with the Cuban people, and the desire to continue working with the Cuban government in the many areas of common interest,” Mexico’s foreign ministry said in a statement.
