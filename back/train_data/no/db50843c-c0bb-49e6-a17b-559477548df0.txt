( reuters ) - two of north carolina ’ s congressional districts were racially gerrymandered in a 2011 redistricting and must be redrawn within two weeks , a u.s. appeals court panel ruled on friday .
the order written by fourth circuit court of appeals judge roger gregory bars elections in the majority black districts , the 1st and the 12th , until the new maps are approved .
north carolina congressional primaries are scheduled for march 15 “ this court finds that congressional districts 1 and 12 as drawn in the 2011 congressional redistricting plan are unconstitutional , ” gregory wrote .
the ruling said race had been the main factor when the republican-controlled legislature redrew the boundaries and state lawmakers were not justified in using that benchmark .
three voters filed suit in 2013 to invalidate the districts .
both are represented by democrats , with g.k. butterfield in the 1st , and alma adams in the 12th .
state senator bob rucho and house member david lewis , who guided the redistricting plan through the legislature , were quoted on the raleigh news and observer website as saying they would appeal the ruling by the three-judge panel .
