beirut ( reuters ) - the syrian army and its allies recaptured an oilfield from islamic state near the eastern city of deir al-zor on saturday in further advances against the militants , state tv reported .
government forces also seized part of a main highway running from deir al-zor down to the city of al-mayadeen , to which many islamic state militants have retreated , the syrian observatory for human rights monitoring group said .
the syrian army this week broke through islamic state lines to reach a government-held enclave of deir al-zor besieged for years by the jihadists , and is fighting to reach a nearby air base which is still surrounds .
on saturday , the army and militias fighting alongside it seized the teym oilfield in desert south of deir al-zor , state tv said .
deir al-zor is in an oil-rich area of syria .
to the east of teym and south of the air base , government forces also recaptured part of the main road running from deir al-zor to al-mayadeen , downstream along the euphrates river and closer to the iraq border , the observatory reported .
the british-based monitoring group said that advance would block potential islamic state reinforcements from al-mayadeen .
the advances put yet more pressure on islamic state s shrinking caliphate , which once stretched across northern and eastern syria , and northwestern iraq .
in syria , the group holds much of deir al-zor province and half the city , as well as a pocket of territory near hama and homs in the west of the country .
