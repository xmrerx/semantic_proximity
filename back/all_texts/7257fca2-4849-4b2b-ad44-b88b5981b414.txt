Donald Trump s fired campaign manager Corey Lewandowski has found a new home on CNN, in which he shills for Trump 24/7.
So, it comes as no surprise that Lewandowski is defending the indefensible, and saying that there was nothing wrong with Trump s using a Star Of David in an image where he is calling Hillary Clinton corrupt.
As if that weren t bad enough, a huge pile of cash completes the clearly anti-Semitic imagery.Lewandowski went on CNN, though, and insisted that the backlash his former boss faced over the tweet is political correctness run amok.
The bottom line is this is political correctness run amok.
If this were to be a star next to [presumptive Democratic presidential nominee]Hillary Clinton without the cash behind it, no one would be questioning this.Here is video of that exchange:Lewandowski: Criticism of Trump s star tweet is political correctness run amok https://t.co/jhYzAouS3r #CNNSOTU https://t.co/78dMzH38Mn CNN Politics (@CNNPolitics) July 3, 2016 The thing is, though, it s not political correctness, it s calling out bigotry.
And this is just the latest incident in a very long line that suggests that Donald Trump is a world class bigot.
Here are just a few things he has done since this national embarrassment of a campaign started:We could go on forever when it comes to the stunningly bigoted statements and incidents that have surrounded Donald Trump and his campaign.
The thing is, though, everyone knows that Trump is dog whistling white nationalists and other racists with this tweet and everything else he s done.
The man is courting bigots.
There s more than enough evidence to make that case.
It shouldn t be surprising to anyone, though, because at the end of the day, the GOP s base is riddled with bigots of every stripe imaginable, and they have absolutely no problem with Trump s activities.
Quite the opposite, in fact, as Donald Trump just made public bigotry okay again.Featured image via Al Drago/CQ Roll Call/Getty Images
