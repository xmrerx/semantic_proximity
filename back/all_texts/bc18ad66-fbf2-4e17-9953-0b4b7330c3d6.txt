Corporate sponsors like Coke should think again before hiring this potty mouthed anti-American hack singer for anything.Rihanna performed American Oxygen live for the first time at Saturday s March Madness Music Festival.If, by chance, corporate sponsors, broadcasters and the NCAA advised acts playing the March Madness Music Festival to not comment on the controversy that s gripped Indiana, Rihanna and supporting act Bleachers didn t heed that memo on Saturday.Rihanna paused during her performance to verbally slam RFRA in two expletive-laden sentences.The 2015 installment of the annual three-day event was held in Indianapolis, timed to the NCAA s Final Four competition.
Rihanna was the headliner of the Coke Zero Countdown concert at White River State Park.Rihanna sang American Oxygen .
It s a sluggish number that frames itself as a 21st-century The Times They Are A-Changin .
We are the new America, sang Rihanna in a performance that TBS picked up for broadcast during Saturday s basketball coverage.Rihanna wrote on Twitter afterward, Thank you Indiana!!!!
I would never forget how much fun I had with you tonight!!
You blew me away!!!

And even though American Oxygen hasn t been officially released, the crowd responded to the performance quite strongly.
You SANG EVERY F*CKING WORD!!!!
tweeted Rihanna.
