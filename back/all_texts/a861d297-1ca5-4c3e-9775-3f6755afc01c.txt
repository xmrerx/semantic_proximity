Like many other comedians, Seth Meyers is not impressed with the healthcare bill that was passed by the U.S. House of Representatives.
Like the other comedians, he has been very vocal about his feelings.
For his part, House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI) was not pleased with Meyers description of the legislation.
Meyers said the newly passed American Health Care Act is a tax cut for the wealthy, and that it will hurt the poorest and sickest among us.In order to make his views known, Ryan had his staff send Meyers an email detailing all the ways he felt the comedian got it wrong.
Not one to back down from a fight, Meyers used his show s segment, A Closer Look, to respond.Meyers said to his audience: Unlike Republicans and their healthcare bill, we actually read the whole email.
This was clearly a jab at the many House members who did not take the time to read the bill they had passed.
Many of these same representatives complained up one side and down the other about the same sort of thing going on when the Affordable Care Act was passed back in 2009.
They vowed they d never vote for a bill they hadn t read.Watch Meyers eviscerate Ryan s email below: Featured image via screen capture from embedded video
