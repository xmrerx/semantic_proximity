It s no secret that conservatives and Republicans (not all) despise President Obama simply because he is black.
After years of insisting he s an Arab, from Kenya, a Muslim, or anything else you can name, it s telling that some Americans hold him to a completely different standard simply because he s black.Now take Hillary Clinton, who is on the cusp of making history as the first female President of the United States, just as Barack Obama did as the first African American president.
For years, Clinton has been in the public eye as a governor s wife, a First Lady, a senator, a Secretary of State, and now a presidential candidate.
But like their hate for President Obama simply because he is black, there are those on the right who hate her simply because she is a woman.
Like the dog whistle politics that follow President Obama, conservatives have unleashed their own dog whistle on Clinton and they are even louder.Whether it be the sound of her voice, her boisterous laugh, her vagina politics or making an honest woman of herself, Hillary Clinton has been besmirched by the right based not on her policies, but by her gender.Don t believe it?
The commentary speaks for itself: Throughout her career, the attacks have become worse.
But yet here she is, making history (yet again), not brought down by the good old boys club.This is why Hillary Clinton is the epitome of what it takes to be president: no matter what is thrown her way, she stands tall, and never relents.
Unlike another presidential candidate, Clinton also doesn t take it personally, instead focusing on the real issues.Th sexist attacks will continue should Clinton win the presidency, and it may hamper some of her legislative hopes in a Congress that is still disproportionately Republican male.
But like President Obama, Clinton will make us proud (should she stick to her campaign promises).Featured image via Justin Sullivan/Getty Images
