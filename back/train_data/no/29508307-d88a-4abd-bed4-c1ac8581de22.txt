pic.twitter.com/xzljarz9cs sarah huckabee ( @ sarahhuckabee ) july 26 , 2017the liberals try their best to prove the letter is fake : the washington post reported : handwriting and children s cognitive experts were called and asked whether the letter appeared to be written by a child .
we called one ourself .
two , actually.deborah mccutchen is a professor at the university of wisconsin who studies cognitive processes in reading and writing ability .
she looked at the letter .
she noted that the handful of small spelling errors followed the phonetic sounds of words pitcher instead of picture which would be common in the writing of a young child .
then again , the letter also included a hyphen , which seemed sophisticated for a 9-year-old.sheila lowe , president of the american handwriting analysis foundation , said she didn t see anything that would be inconsistent with a 9-year-old s writing , but she also clarified that she did not specialize in analyzing the writing of children .
she noted that the margins on the right side of the paper were very wide , which can indicate a feeling of concern about the future. # pickletruther suddenly appeared on twitter as the lefty media furiously tried to prove that the letter was fake.we hope dylan has a chance to meet president trump and isn t bullied for his support of trump like so many adults are .
he s adorable !
