istanbul ( reuters ) - turkish authorities issued detention warrants for 99 suspects including doctors and lawyers and have so far detained 78 of them , the state-run anadolu agency said on thursday , as part of a widening crackdown since last year s failed coup attempt .
the suspects were believed to be users of bylock , an encrypted messaging app which the government says was used by the network of u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen , accused by ankara of orchestrating last july s abortive putsch .
gulen , who has lived in self-imposed exile in pennsylvania since 1999 , denies involvement .
anadolu said security forces were seeking the remaining suspects in southern turkish province of antalya .
turkey has identified 215,092 users of bylock and has launched investigations on 23,171 of them , the interior minister said earlier this week .
more than 50,000 people , including soldiers , teachers and journalists , have been jailed pending trial in a sweeping crackdown following last year s coup attempt .
in the judiciary alone , 5,920 people have been sacked from their jobs due to suspected links to the 2016 coup attempt , justice minister abdulhamit gul said on thursday .
rights groups and some of turkey s western allies have voiced concern about the crackdown , fearing the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent .
the government says only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by gulen s network , which it says deeply infiltrated institutions such as the army , schools and courts .
