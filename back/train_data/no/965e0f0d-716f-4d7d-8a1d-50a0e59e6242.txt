manila ( reuters ) - philippine president rodrigo duterte urged the united states on tuesday to help control drugs smuggling , blaming taiwan and hong kong-based criminal gangs for using his country as a shipping hub .
in a speech , he also said illegal drugs had funded the seizure by islamist militants of large parts of the southern city of marawi in may .
more than 800 people have died in the conflict , which duterte said was triggered by an attempt to arrest a drug personality , who he did not identify .
the philippines is a transhipment of shabu to america , duterte told members of the philippine constitution association , referring to the local term for methamphetamine .
it behoves upon america to work closely with the republic of the philippines , especially on this serious matter .
duterte , who was elected 16 months ago on promises to fight corruption , crime and drugs , said the so-called 14-k triads in hong kong and the taiwan-based bamboo triads were using the country as a transhipment point .
we are flooded with drugs .
this is the first time i would reveal it ... the philippines today is a client state of the bamboo triad .
they have taken over the operations , he added .
duterte gave no details of the source of his information .
washington has said it supports the country s anti-drug efforts but has also urged manila to respect human rights and the rule of law in its operations .
more than 3,800 people have died in gunfights with police and soldiers in anti-drug operations nationwide since june last year , according to the government .
human rights groups say the figure is much higher .
