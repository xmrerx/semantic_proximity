baghdad ( reuters ) - the iraqi government accused kurdish authorities on sunday of bringing fighters from turkey s separatist kurdistan workers party ( pkk ) to the disputed oil-rich city of kirkuk , and said it considered the move a declaration of war .
vahal ali , a media assistant to kurdistan regional government ( krg ) president masoud barzani , denied the accusation .
this is false , there are no pkk in kirkuk , only peshmerga , he told reuters , referring to krg military forces .
in a statement published after a meeting chaired by prime minister haider al-abadi in baghdad , and attended by top military and security commanders , the government said it would seek to impose its authority over kirkuk and other disputed areas .
iraq s kurdish leadership rejected on sunday a demand by the iraqi government to cancel the outcome of an independence referendum as a precondition for talks to resolve the dispute .
barzani and other kurdish leaders , who met to discuss the crisis in the town of dokan , renewed their offer to resolve peacefully the crisis with baghdad .
they rejected what they described as military threats from iraqi forces against kurdish peshmerga fighters , and pledged to defend kurdish-held territory in the event of an attack .
the krg and the shi ite-led central government in baghdad have been at loggerheads since the sept. 25 referendum and its loud call for kurdish independence .
tensions between the two parties have flared around the multi-ethnic oil city of kirkuk , which peshmerga forces took in 2014 when iraqi security forces collapsed in the face of an islamic state onslaught .
the peshmerga deployment prevented kirkuk s oilfields from falling into jihadist hands .
