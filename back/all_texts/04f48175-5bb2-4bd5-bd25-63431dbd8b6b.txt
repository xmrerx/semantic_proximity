After a hard-fought race between herself and Senator Bernie Sanders, Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is looking towards the general election.
She now has the majority of pledged delegates, superdelegates and popular vote in the Democratic race, making her the clear victor, and the first female presumptive presidential nominee of any major party in the history of the republic.And while she has earned a moment to revel in her historic victory, she still has her eye on the goal of the White House and defeat of presumptive Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump.Knowing how crucial it is that Hillary move forward to defeat Donald Trump, her campaign tweeted out an image that was beyond perfect.
They say a picture says a thousand words, and this image is further proof of that point.With a shot of Donald Trump on a screen in the background, appearing small and blurry, just like his message, it also shows Hillary prepared to take on her next challenge.The image only had one word to describe it, because only one word was needed: Ready.
Ready.
