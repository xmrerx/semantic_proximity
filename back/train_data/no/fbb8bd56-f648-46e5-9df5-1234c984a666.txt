the 2014 irs filings for the clinton foundation were recently released and the numbers were absolutely sickening .
out of $ 91.3 million spent in 2014 , the organization s irs filings show that only $ 5.2 million of that went to actual charity .
that s because the candidate who says she represents the everyday american can t be bothered with helping the poor she needs to focus on providing a lifestyle for her and her lovely daughter chelsea that only 1 % of americans can enjoy .
the clinton s have mastered the art of getting rich in politics it s not quite the kennedy compound in hyannis port , but bill and hillary clinton are expanding their westchester spread by buying the house next door , the post has learned.the clintons shelled out $ 1.16 million for the three-bedroom , 3,631-square-foot , ranch-style home set on 1.51 leafy acres on old house lane in chappaqua.westchester county land records and tax records from the town of new castle where chappaqua is located list william and hillary clinton as owners of the property.a source said the home could be used as a weekend retreat for their daughter , chelsea , her hubby , marc mezvinsky , and their children , charlotte and aidan .
rumor has it that the clintons plan to use this as a mother/daughter house for chelsea and her kids to visit on the weekends when they want to escape the city and their flatiron digs since the chappaqua house has a nice pool and plenty of rolling green lawn for kids to play on , the source said .
