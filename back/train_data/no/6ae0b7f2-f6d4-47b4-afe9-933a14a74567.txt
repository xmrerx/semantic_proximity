manila ( reuters ) - philippine soldiers have killed 14 maoist guerrillas in an offensive south of the capital , manila , an army officer said on wednesday , days after president rodrigo duterte ended peace talks with the rebels .
more than 40,000 people had been killed in nearly 50 years of fighting between the leftist guerrillas and government forces , a conflict that has stunted economic growth in resource-rich rural areas .
duterte , who took power last year , had raised hopes for peace with the communists as well as with muslim insurgents in the south of the predominantly roman catholic country , but peace has proved elusive .
this is a big blow to their organization , major mikko magisa , executive officer of the army s 202nd brigade , told reporters , referring to the late tuesday clash in batangas province .
five soldiers had been wounded in the 20-minute clash involving army and air force commandoes , he said .
the bodies of 13 rebels were found , including a suspected secretary and a platoon leader of the guerrilla unit , he said .
one of two wounded rebels who were captured died in hospital .
duterte signed a proclamation ending peace talks with the communists last week after complaining that rebel violence had continued during the negotiations .
talks , which have been held intermittently since 1986 , were revived in august last year , and were brokered by norway .
government troops have been ordered to be on alert for movements by the estimated 3,800 leftist guerrillas , military officials have said .
government troops have in recent months been engaged in the biggest battle in the philippines since world war two , with islamist militants who occupied a southern town for several months .
