is this common sense law even practical given how many muslims migrants with ties to terrorism have already embedded themselves in communities across europe .
the mass sexual assaults and rapes that took place on new years eve in germany should be a pretty good indicator of how interested these male muslim migrants are in assimilating .
german chancellor angela merkel s ruling coalition agreed thursday on tough measures to spur the integration of migrants and refugees , including sanctions for failing to take part in programs such as language classes.the deal , hammered out in six hours of late-night talks between merkel s conservative christian union bloc and the social democrats ( spd ) , also included plans for new anti-terror legislation .
now that hundreds of thousands ( over a million ) refugees have arrived in our country , we have a double task : to manage and control refugee flows , and not only to register but to integrate the large numbers , merkel said at a berlin press conference on thursday .
we will differentiate between those with good and bad prospects for being allowed to stay , but there will be an offer for everyone who comes to us , she added .
integration in a society with people from very different cultural backgrounds doesn t happen by itself , said vice-chancellor sigmar gabriel , who claimed the new law was a truly historic step .indeed , it is the first time a law covering immigration and integration has been mooted since germany began a postwar programme to invite turks and other guest workers to fuel its economic miracle , which was criticized for failing to provide millions of immigrants and their descendants a stake in german society and a path to citizenship.the integration bill would take a carrot-and-stick approach , providing subsidized courses to help newcomers find their way in german life but , in some cases , denying residence permits to those who fail to take up the offer.under the new pact seen by afp , federal funds would be used to create 100,000 jobs for asylum seekers receiving benefits.those facing imminent deportation would be excluded , but asylum seekers taking part in job training would be shielded from expulsion for the length of the programme.refugees who abandon state-assigned housing would face unspecified consequences , but waiting periods for acceptance courses teaching german language and customs are to be slashed to six weeks from three months currently .
learning the language is also necessary for temporary stays in germany , the document states.the draft law is to be completed on may 24 and then presented to parliament , where the so-called grand coalition has a large majority.germany took in more than one million asylum seekers in 2015 and merkel has faced mounting criticism from sceptics , particularly from within her conservative camp , arguing that europe s top economy is ill-equipped to cope with the influx.the closure of the so-called balkan route taken by many migrants has led to a sharp decline in new arrivals in recent weeks.via : the local de
