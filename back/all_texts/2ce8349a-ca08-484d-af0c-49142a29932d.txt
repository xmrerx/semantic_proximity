Court documents show deceptive behavior by Donald Trump s company that is part of a pattern for the Republican presidential nominee.
The company behind a Trump construction project a taxpayer-financed project to convert the Old Post Office Building in Washington D.C. into a luxury hotel made up two sets of financial books, deceiving investors.Lenders were told the hotel could earn millions of dollars more than the more conservative, internal estimates, the financial analyst, Raymond Flores, testified.
He said those internal projections generally tend to err on the side of being pretty conservative.
Later he said, And then there are other projections where, you know, we re pitching to a lender or an equity source, where it s rosier.
With these projections, he said, we re pushing the boundaries of we re pushing ranges of reasonability at those at those projections to show, you know, what the hotel could be.
As Trump s finances have been probed during his election run, time and time again his companies have been shown misleading and deceiving, with Trump benefiting as others lose their shirts.His Trump University took in thousands, as many customers claimed they did not receive the real estate education they were promised.
As a result, attorneys general opened investigations and the company closed its doors.Another Trump enterprise, building condominiums in Baja California, went belly-up as investors were told that Trump and his children were buying in they weren t.Trump s casino in Atlantic City also failed, while other casinos were doing well and thriving.
Trump, again, made a bag of money and left investors holding on to the business debts and obligations.Time and again Trump has shown that he uses his name and brand to paint a picture for people interested in investing, but it has often been nothing more substantial than smoke and mirrors.
This time he has even gone so far as to involve tax dollars.The pattern continues.Featured image via Flickr
