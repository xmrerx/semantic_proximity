SEATTLE (Reuters) - A U.S. federal judge on Monday said courtroom proceedings over President Donald Trump’s travel ban should continue in Seattle during an ongoing appeals court review.
At a hearing, U.S. District Judge James Robart in Seattle said he was not prepared to slow down the case.
Robart directed attorneys for the U.S. Justice Department and Washington state’s attorney general to prepare for further proceedings in Seattle.
