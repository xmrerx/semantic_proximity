moscow ( reuters ) - russia will supply turkey with four batteries of s-400 surface-to-air missiles for $ 2.5 billion under a deal that is almost complete , sergei chemezov , head of russian state conglomerate rostec , told the kommersant daily on wednesday .
the deal has caused concern in the west because turkey is a member of nato but the russian missile system can not be integrated into nato s military architecture .
in addition , relations between moscow and the western military alliance are strained , in part because of russia s annexation of ukraine s crimea peninsula .
turkish defence minister nurettin canikli said ankara would purchase two s-400 systems and four batteries and that all agreements were made , the state broadcaster trt haber reported .
turkey will pay 45 percent of the cost up front with russia providing loans to cover the remaining 55 percent , chemezov said .
moscow expected to begin the first deliveries in march 2020 , he said .
chemezov told kommersant that turkey was the first nato member state to acquire the advanced s-400 missile system .
he said the russian and turkish finance ministries had already completed talks on financing the deal and that the final documents just needed to be approved .
