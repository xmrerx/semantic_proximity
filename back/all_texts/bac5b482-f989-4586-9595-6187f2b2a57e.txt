***LANGUAGE WARNING*** Why is it acceptable for people who come from other damn countries to be proud of their country, but if American who is proud of the American flag is deemed racist ?
Why are you here is you re so proud of Mexico?
Nobody else wants to say it, but Mexico is a f*cking hell-hole.
They come over here and use our system because of our weak-ass politicians.
Mexican pride this, and Mexican pride that.
Then why the hell are you over here?
Stop the bullshit.
If I was saying a country was so great, I wouldn t have my ass in another country screaming about how great that country is that I ran away from!
