kuala lumpur ( reuters ) - malaysia said on tuesday it has received proposals from three companies offering to continue the search for malaysian airlines flight mh370 , which has been missing since 2014 , but no decision has been made yet .
mh370 vanished three years ago somewhere in the southern indian ocean en route to beijing from kuala lumpur with 239 people aboard .
its disappearance has become one of the world s greatest aviation mysteries .
malaysian transport minister liow tiong lai said proposals were received from u.s.-based seabed exploration firm ocean infinity , dutch firm fugro and an unidentified malaysian company .
we wont be deciding anything now on whether we are embarking on a new search or not , liow told reporters on the sidelines of an event in kuala lumpur .
we have to discuss with the companies .
it will take some time as it s some detailed discussions , he said .
liow was commenting on media reports from australia that said malaysia could resume the search as early as this week .
australia , malaysia and china called off a a $ 200 million ( $ 159.16 million ) , two-year search for the plane in january , amid protests from families of those onboard .
liow said the proposals would eventually be presented to the other countries in the tripartite committee - china and australia - before a decision was taken .
representatives for ocean infinity have said the company would only want to be paid if the aircraft was found .
the boeing 777 aircraft disappeared on march 8 , 2014 , and is thought to have been diverted thousands of miles off course out over the southern indian ocean before crashing off the coast of western australia .
