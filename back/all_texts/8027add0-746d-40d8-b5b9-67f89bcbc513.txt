Senator Elizabeth Warren just responded to Donald Trump s 3am temper tantrum by dropping the hammer on him.Early Friday morning, the Republican nominee threw a hissy fit on Twitter about Hillary Clinton and Alicia Machado instead of simply apologizing for his sexism and moving on.
The results were more insults against the two women and a claim that his tweets prove he is ready to take the 3am phone call as president.Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U. Hillary floated her as an angel without checking her past, which is terrible!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT!
Hillary was set up by a con.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U.S. citizen so she could use her in the debate?
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016For those few people knocking me for tweeting at three o clock in the morning, at least you know I will be there, awake, to answer the call!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 30, 2016Well, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren is no stranger when it comes to kicking Trump s ass on Twitter so when she fired back on Friday afternoon she went for the jugular.Is this what keeps you up at night, @realDonaldTrump?
Thinking of new & interesting ways to call women fat or ugly or sluts?
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) September 30, 2016You never tweet at 3am with ways to help students getting crushed by debt or seniors struggling on Social Security, @realDonaldTrump.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) September 30, 2016You never tweet at 3am with ways to create new jobs for workers or hold Wall Street accountable, @realDonaldTrump.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) September 30, 2016Nope, @realDonaldTrump: the only things that keep your mind racing at night are your next racist, sexist tweets & disgusting lies.
Elizabeth Warren (@elizabethforma) September 30, 2016A thin-skinned bully who thinks humiliating women at 3am qualifies him to be President does not understand America & is not fit to lead.
