(Reuters) - Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane announced her resignation on Tuesday, one day after a jury convicted her of perjury and other crimes for leaking sealed grand jury material to a news reporter.
“I have been honored to serve the people of Pennsylvania and I wish them health and safety in all their days,” Kane said in a statement.
Her deputy, Bruce Castor, is scheduled to address the media later on Tuesday.
