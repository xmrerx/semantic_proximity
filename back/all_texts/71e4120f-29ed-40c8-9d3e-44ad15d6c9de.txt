MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Thursday it was confident the United States was using sanctions in an attempt to turn Russia s business elite against President Vladimir Putin.
We are sure that s what it is, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.
Reuters reported earlier on Thursday that the threat of new U.S. sanctions has spread anxiety among Russia s wealthiest people that their association with Putin could land them on a U.S. government blacklist.
