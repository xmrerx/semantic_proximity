is it a coincidence that more and more evidence keeps magically appearing in the case against hillary and the misuse of her private email account ?
is the timing with joe biden s ( obama s puppet ) entry into the presidential race and the release of more damning evidence against hillary accidental or is the chicago mob politician just getting warmed up it looks like hillary might be beaten by barack yet again the denver-based company that stored hillary clinton s private email server said that the emails might still be recoverable , because there s no evidence that the server was properly wiped clean .
platte river has no knowledge of the server being wiped , platte river representative andy boian told the washington post .
all the information we have is that the server wasn t wiped .
if the server was not wiped clean , and investigators can still get all of the information off it , then clinton-world s attempts to stonewall the investigation could be rendered null and void.clinton did , in fact , delete all of her emails earlier this year , but it is possible that she never managed to physically damage the server itself to the degree that all of the information on it would be lost forever .
thus , the server , which is now in the possession of the fbi and department of justice investigators , could still pull up some of the confidential emails that clinton thought would never see the light of day.but platte river s statement to the post might also be an example of the company running interference for the clintons.boian , it should be noted , is representing platte river networks through his small , colorado-based public relations firm dovetail solutions , which also employs top clinton operative david goodfriend , a major washington cyber security lobbyist and friend of clinton campaign chairman john podesta .
platte river networks vice president david decamillis also went to high school with clinton s 2008 tech chief nathaniel pearlman , who supervised clinton s server manager bryan pagliano.pagliano has pleaded the fifth to protect himself from having to give up any information about his work on clinton s server.via : breitbart
