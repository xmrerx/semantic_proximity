the french president expressed his concern over the possibility that the united states would unilaterally recognize jerusalem as the capital of israel , the statement said , after macron and trump spoke over the phone .
mr emmanuel macron reaffirmed that the question of jerusalem s status had to be dealt with in the framework of peace negotiations between israelis and palestinians , with the aim in particular to establish two countries , israel and palestine , living in peace and security side by side with jerusalem as capital .
trump has not yet made a decision on whether to formally recognize jerusalem as israel s capital , his adviser and son-in-law jared kushner said on sunday , a move that would break with decades of u.s. policy and could fuel violence in the middle east .
