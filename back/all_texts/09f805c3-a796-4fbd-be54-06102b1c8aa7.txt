This truth doesn t hurt Donald Trump, it amuses him.That s probably why he flashed a smile after a heckler at a Kissimmee, Florida campaign rally on Thursday called the Republican nominee Putin s b*tch over his ties to Russian oligarchs.Trump paused during his speech after someone in the audience drew his attention and yelled You love Russia.
You re Putin s b*tch, before being escorted out of the building by security as Trump said goodbye to the unidentified man several times.A few seconds later Trump asked, Where the hell did he come from?
Here s the video via YouTube:I don t know where the heckler came from but I know why he called Trump Putin s b*tch.
Donald Trump has borrowed a lot of money from his Russian business pals and they just so happen to be close with Russian President Vladamir Putin.
So, let s just say Trump owes them and if he can t pay them back with money, becoming president would give him the power to pay them back in other ways.
You know, like lifting sanctions placed on the Russians after they attacked Ukraine, like Trump advisor Carter Page suggested earlier this year, or weakening NATO so that Russia can continue their aggressive stance, or softening the Republican Party s condemnation of Russia s attack on Ukraine which Trump actually fought to make part of the GOP platform.In short, Trump would essentially be Putin s puppet.
And it s not like Russia and Putin have not been enthusiastic about this prospect seeing as how Putin directed state media to tout Trump s campaign and Russian hackers broke into the DNC in what amounts to a cyber-Watergate in an effort to hurt Democrats by giving Trump fodder to use to attack Democrats.So the heckler at Trump s rally was absolutely right to call him Putin s b*tch.
And Trump could only smirk because deep down he knows it s true.Featured Image: Screenshot
