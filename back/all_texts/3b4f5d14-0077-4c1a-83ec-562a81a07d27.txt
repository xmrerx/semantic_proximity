Even the Democrat ministers can t help themselves from shutting down anyone that would dare to come into their city with an (R) after their name.
And people ask why Republicans don t do more outreach in minority communities.
These people are clearly not throwing out the welcome mat for the man who will likely be our next President of the United States.
Wouldn t it have been refreshing to see this minister embrace Donald Trump s message of jobs for citizens and of hope for broken communities that have been ignored by Democrat ruled cities for decades?
The minister of a Methodist church made national headlines after she scolded Donald Trump for injecting politics into a campaign stop.The Rev.
Faith Green Timmons came on stage and stopped Trump in the middle of his remarks at Bethel United Methodist Church.Watch:She told him to stay focused on the water crisis and not Hillary Clinton.
I invited you here to thank us for what we ve done in Flint, not give a political speech, the reverend told Mr. Trump.Trump graciously complied with her demand.But something doesn t pass the smell test.
Check out this screen screen shot from Rev.
Timmons Facebook page: We have our chance to show Donald Trump that this nation is filled with intelligent, wise black citizens of integrity many of whom live right in Flint, Michigan, she wrote.
What he will see is how we are braving a man-made catastrophe.
HE WILL NOT USE US, WE will EDUCATE HIM!!!
Well, I guess the Rev.
Timmons showed Mr. Trump ambushing him in a House of Worship.
I will give her credit for hushing up a protester who kept interrupting his remarks.Mr.
Trump showed great restraint and class as he complied with her request.
And he deserves credit for at least trying to start a dialogue.
