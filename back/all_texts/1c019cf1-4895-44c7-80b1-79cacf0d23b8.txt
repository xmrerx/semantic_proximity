Whether during the time of the ancient Greeks, the 1930s, or 2016, a demagogue is a demagogue.
Bill Maher proved this last night on his show Real Time when he had a speech of Nazi dictator Adolph Hitler translated to English in order to contextualize Donald Trump s hate speeches.
[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hPAVj8NCt8I]It has been reported that Trump has kept a compilation of Hitler s speeches next to his bedside over the years and according to his wife Ivanka, he would go through it sometimes.
As first reported in a 1990 Vanity Fair profile of Trump, this alarming practice has been added to the arsenal some in the crumbling Republican party are using to try and potentially block a Trump nomination at the Republican Convention in July.
Here s the transcript of Mahar s translation : We re going to make Germany great again, that I can tell you.
Germany doesn t win anymore.
England, France, America they re laughing at us.
The Treaty of Versailles?
A terrible deal!
And look, I love the Jews nobody loves the Jews more than me, but folks, either we have a Fatherland or we don t. So we re gonna have to build a camp.
And I will make the Jews pay for it.
When putting Trump s words in the context of both Hitler s words and deeds, Trump s statements and antics are truly revealed for their xenophobic and racist tones.
After all, a demagogue is a demagogue whether then or now.
