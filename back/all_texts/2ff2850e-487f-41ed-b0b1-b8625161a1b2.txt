HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai said on Thursday President Robert Mugabe should resign in the interest of the country after the military seized power.
Mugabe is insisting he remains Zimbabwe s only legitimate ruler and has balked at mediation by a Catholic priest to allow the 93-year-old former guerrilla a graceful exit after a military coup, sources said on Thursday.
In the interest of the people, Mr. Robert Mugabe must resign and step down immediately, Tsvangirai, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change, told a news conference, reading from a statement.
