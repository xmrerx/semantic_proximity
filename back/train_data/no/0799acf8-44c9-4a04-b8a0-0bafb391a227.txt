kellyanne conway responded to a new york times article that actually claimed conway is being unfairly attacked by the media because she s a woman .
during the interview with howard kurtz of fox news , kellyanne conway blasted the fake pro-women feminists like nancy pelosi : she and i went to the same small catholic women s catholic college , the nation s oldest all women s catholic college , trinity in washington dc .
and that small women s catholic college can boast the first female speaker of the house , nancy pelosi , and the first successful female presidential campaign manager , and the way they treat the two of us , the president of the college is unbelievable .
and you would think some of the alumni that went to an all women s catholic college would maybe be pro-life , or at maybe object to nancy s abortion anyone , anytime anywhere stance .
in my view , you have to be pro-abortion .
you have to be anti-male .
look at all of these commercials on tv about men , they can t open a garbage bag unless their wife shows them how .
i mean we treat men like they re fools .
i don t look at my husband , my son , my cousins , my colleagues that way .
