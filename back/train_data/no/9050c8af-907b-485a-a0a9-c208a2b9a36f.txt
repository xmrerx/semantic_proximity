isiolo , kenya ( reuters ) - an expelled student shot dead six of his former schoolmates and a security guard at his school in northern kenya on saturday , and was then himself lynched by a furious mob , officials said .
the attack took place at a school in the remote town of lokichogio in kenya s turkana region , close to the border with war-torn south sudan .
at least six other students were flown to hospital with bullet wounds .
the assailant was a 17-year-old from south sudan - one of thousands of refugee children who have been living in kenya and going to school there since civil war broke out in their country in 2013 .
he was detained in possession of an ak-47 , the basic assault rifle of choice in conflicts across africa and the middle east .
the school was not attacked by bandits but an errant student on expulsion for disciplinary cases , regional government official wanyama musyambohe told reporters .
security officials said the assailant , whose name has not been disclosed , had been arrested , but then killed by a mob while in police custody .
the attack ... is a painful reminder of the state of insecurity along the border , tweeted turkana county governor josphat nanok .
close to 2 million people have fled south sudan since fighting broke out in december 2013 , sparking what has become africa s largest cross-border exodus since the 1994 rwandan genocide .
some 75,000 of them are now in kenya .
perennial conflicts have left the region awash with arms , which are smuggled across borders with relative ease .
