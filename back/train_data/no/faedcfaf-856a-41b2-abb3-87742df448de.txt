barack obama and first lady , michelle , attended their final kennedy center honors gala on saturday night.there s something very satisfying about reading the obama s and final in the same sentence .
anytime the obama s attend an event for the last time as our president and first lady , i find myself counting our blessings .
but seriously what was michelle wearing ? on saturday night , obama was joined by first lady michelle to honor actor al pacino , gospel singer and civil rights activist mavis staples , members of rock band the eagles , singer-songwriter james taylor , and pianist martha argerich.stephen colbert hosted the star-studded gala in washington dc , and secretary of state john kerry doled out the medallions for one of the country s most prestigious awards for performing artists.before the gala kicked off , barry struck an arrogant pose during our national anthem .
( perhaps we should just be grateful the obama s didn t take a knee .
) kennedy center president deborah rutter said obama and kerry have enthusiastically welcomed the honorees every year , and the honorees have been eager to spend time with them as well.kerry in particular went out of his way this year , flying from rome to washington on saturday to attend the honors dinner before a scheduled trip to berlin on sunday .
dmhow wonderful that kerry was able to fly back to washington on the taxpayers dime from rome and then back to berlin , just so he could rub shoulders with the honorees and other invited celebrities.rutter noted that obama has a very personal relationship with quite a number of artists .
( donors ) remember when mooch s designer announced she would refuse to design clothes for first lady-elect melania trump ?
based on some of the get-ups michelle has worn to public events in the official capacity as our first lady , perhaps a thank you note is in order
