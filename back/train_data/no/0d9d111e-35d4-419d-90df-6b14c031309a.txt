wellington ( reuters ) - new zealand labour party leader jacinda ardern said on saturday evening she did not expect any immediate talks with populist politician winston peters , whose party was poised to play kingmaker after the hotly contested national elections .
i don t expect there ll be any conversations for a little while yet , ardern told local media as she left her home to drive to the opposition party s function in downtown auckland .
the comments came after 86 percent of the results counted showed labour on 35.7 percent of the vote and the incumbent center-right national party on 46.3 percent .
those results suggested each major party would need nationalist new zealand first to form the next government .
the final tally of all votes would not be released until oct. 7 .
