it s always interesting when people decide to use social media to point out how ridiculous someone or something is .
such was the case with trump hotels , where someone dredged up an old tweet asking people for their favorite travel memories .
people angry about trump s muslim ban and other executive orders decided to use that tweet to , ahem , vent , and it s pretty epic.people tweeted that their favorite travel memory was staying with a competing hotel chain , others talked about president obama , and still others tweeted about visiting family and friends who are immigrants .
still others pointed out hospitality in other countries , or with what overseas airbnbs are doing.if trump saw this , he d be pacing back and forth in the white house , grousing about how people need to be reminded of how beloved he is.in short , it didn t go very well for trump hotels .
but it went amazingly good for anyone who stands against trump and his dangerous , white supremacist agenda .
here s the original tweet : tell us your favorite travel memory was it a picture , a souvenir , a sunset ?
we d love to hear it !

rick wright ( @ birdernewjersey ) january 29 , 2017it seems clear that trump s brand is going to take a major beating .
we d say until he becomes sane but we all know that s never going to happen .
he s too hung up on the minutiae associated with his personal image , and he s letting steve bannon run the show.featured image by spencer platt via getty images
