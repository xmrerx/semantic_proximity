Love him or hate him Trump s speaking up and saying the things conservatives in America have been dying for someone in the Republican party to say.
Republicans just want a presidential candidate with a backbone.

Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump took a jab at CNN anchor Anderson Cooper during an interview that aired Wednesday, telling him bluntly, The people don t trust you.
Trump grew visibly irritated after Cooper cited a poll that the Republican said he didn t even know existed.
He also accused the anchor of focusing only on the negative.
I am leading across the board, and then you hit me with this poll that I didn t even see before, Trump said.
Let me tell you, the people don t trust you and the people don t trust the media.

Those days are over, he said.
I find that 60-70 percent of the political media is really, really dishonest, he said.
