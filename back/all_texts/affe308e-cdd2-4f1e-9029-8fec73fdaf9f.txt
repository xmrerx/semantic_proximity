When it comes to Donald Trump one thing is clear: he loves himself a lot.
He admires himself to the point where he may actually believe everything he touches turns to gold.
He tells crowds of people, that for some reason believe him, that he s going to Make America Great Again.
How?
Pfft, who needs details?
He s just going to do it, duh.Noticing what a braggadocios windbag the Republican presidential frontrunner is, is well, everyone, but taking to the next level is Full Frontal host Samantha Bee.
On her Monday show she completely skewered the living heck out Trump and his speeches full of how much winning he is going to bring to the nation.During a rally in Albany, NY, Trump said: We re gonna start winning again.
We re gonna win so much.
We re gonna win at every level We re gonna win economically.
We re gonna win with the economy.
We re gonna win with military.
We re gonna win with healthcare and for our veterans.
We re gonna win with every single facet.
We re gonna win so much, you may even get tired of winning, and you ll say please, it s too much winning.
We can t take it anymore.
Mr. President it s too much, and I ll say no it isn t. Noticing how clearly this speech is more reminiscent of Fifty Shades of Grey than any sort of policy proposal, Bee appears in a blindfold asking Trump to win me harder win all over me just, try not to win in my hair.
Bee then says: Sorry, I thought I was listening to my audio book of Fifty Shades of Great.
I listen to the audio book because I need my hands free and the rest you ll have to see below.Let s just say, she hits the nail on the head on how much Trump loves himself, as well as how much he thinks we should all love him and his ideas and how much he s going to be winning for the country, and we should just take it, because you know, even if we hate it, we re gonna love it.Well done, Sam.Featured image via video screen capture
