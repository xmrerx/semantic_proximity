geneva ( reuters ) - veteran prosecutor carla del ponte signed off from the united nations syria investigation on monday by criticizing the u.n. security council and telling syria s ambassador his government had used chemical weapons .
the former swiss attorney general , who went on to prosecute war crimes in rwanda and former yugoslavia , said in august she was resigning from the u.n. commission of inquiry on syria because of a lack of political backing .
bidding farewell to the u.n. human rights council , which set up the commission of inquiry six years ago , del ponte said she had quit out of frustration .
we could not obtain from the international community and the security council a resolution putting in place a tribunal , an ad hoc tribunal for all the crimes that are committed in syria , she said .
seven years of crime in syria and total impunity .
that is not acceptable .
del ponte told a swiss newspaper last month enough evidence existed to convict president bashar al-assad of war crimes .
her departure leaves only two remaining commissioners of the inquiry , karen koning abuzayd and the chairman , paulo pinheiro , who said that eventually , a great many people would have to answer as to why they did not act sooner to stop the carnage .
the deadlock at the security council on syria is reprehensible and , at times , bewildering , he told the human rights council .
leaving the council , del ponte told syria s ambassador that she had been right to quickly reach the conclusion that assad s government had used chemical weapons during an attack on the town of khan sheikhoun in april .
it was me , mister ambassador , she said .
i said that in my opinion and based on the elements we already had , the syrian government was responsible .
today we have the confirmation after an official commission s inquiry .
so now , we ask for justice , we ask justice for those victims .
