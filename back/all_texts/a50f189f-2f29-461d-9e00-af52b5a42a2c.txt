Thanks to the CATO Institute we know for sure that government workers are paid waaay too much!
An average of $84,153 for government pay is unbelievable!
No wonder the suburbs surrounding Dc are some of the wealthiest in the Country.
Ridiculous!Employees for the federal government earn far more than their counterparts in the private sector, according to a new study by the Cato Institute.Federal workers pay and benefits were 78 percent higher than private employees, who earned an average of $52,688 less than public sector workers last year.The study found that federal government workers earned an average of $84,153 in 2014, compared to the private sector s average of $56,350.
Cato based its findings on figures from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).But when adding in benefits pay for federal workers, the difference becomes more dramatic.
Federal employees made $119,934 in total compensation last year, while private sector workers earned $67,246, a difference of over $52,000, or 78 percent.via: WFB
