21st century wire says this is why nobody takes the mainstream media seriously.foreign policy has released a new article hyping up the dangers of mass surveillance , specifically talking about the relatively unknown national geospatial-intelligence agency .
it talks of the potential for drones to be able to track the movements of every person in a city , and 90 % of the article is solely concerned with generating fear.then , in literally the final two paragraphs the author links the fear and problems , which they have just spent the previous twelve paragraphs hyping up , saying that trump could use these systems against , innocent american citizens .
this is not journalism.stuart j. hooper examines the propaganda piece in the following video , and also discusses which candidate foreign policy supported during the election .
can you guess who it was ?
