santiago ( reuters ) - a group of opposition-appointed venezuelan judges arrived on thursday in chile as exiles after more than two months holed up at the chilean ambassador s residence in caracas to avoid arrest in the crisis-hit country .
chile s foreign ministry had granted the five parallel magistrates asylum in august .
threatened with jail by venezuelan president nicolas maduro , they remained in venezuela until last week , when they said they fled the country .
four of the five resurfaced in santiago on thursday morning .
another is expected to arrive later in the day .
all we can say today is that we were forced to abandon our beloved home of venezuela , but that another nation has embraced us , and will protect our freedom , beatriz ruiz , one of the five , told reporters at santiago airport .
ruiz is one of 33 unofficial magistrates who were threatened with jail by maduro after the opposition-led national assembly appointed them in july to challenge the country s supreme court , which has heavily favored the ruling socialist party .
maduro and the supreme court , however , contend that the designation of the opposition magistrates was illegal .
the status of the remaining unofficial magistrates remains unclear .
three were detained , although local media reported they were subsequently freed .
others have fled to the united states and colombia .
chile is among 12 countries in the americas that form the so-called lima group that criticized venezuela s entirely pro-government 545-member legislative superbody , known as the constituent assembly , elected in july .
the lima group this week criticized a nationwide election held in venezuela on sunday , when the ruling socialist party took 18 of 23 governorships in a nationwide vote despite widespread anger over economic hardship , that has left millions suffering food shortages , a currency collapse and soaring inflation .
