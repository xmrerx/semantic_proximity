The rogue government Twitter accounts, which all consider themselves to be helping resist Trump, go about their missions in different ways.
Some are keeping the flow of information alive with an administration that wants everyone to shut it.
Some are simply relaying news and explaining it.
And some, who don t call themselves rogue but still have alt Twitter handles, are actively trolling Donald the Trump.Enter the account known as Alt_Dept of Interior, which actually has more to do with interior design than it does the actual Department of the Interior.
Nevertheless, the people behind it spend a lot of their time trolling Trump.
