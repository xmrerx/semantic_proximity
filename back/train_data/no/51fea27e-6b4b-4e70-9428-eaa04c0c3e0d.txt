gaza ( reuters ) - at least 31 people were wounded by israeli army gunfire and rubber bullets , medics said , in palestinian protests in the occupied west bank and the gaza strip on thursday after the united states recognized jerusalem as israel s capital .

some palestinians threw stones at soldiers .
eleven protesters was hit by live fire and another 20 by rubber bullets , medics said .
a military spokeswoman said soldiers had used riot-dispersal gear against hundreds of rock-throwers .

palestinian authorities called a general strike in protest at u.s. president donald trump s announcement about jerusalem on wednesday .
israel considers jerusalem its eternal and indivisible capital .
palestinians want the capital of an independent state of theirs to be in the city s eastern sector , which israel captured in the 1967 middle east war and annexed in a move never recognized internationally .
