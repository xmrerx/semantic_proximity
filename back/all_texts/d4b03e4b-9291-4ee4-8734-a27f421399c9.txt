Maybe being a racist bigot isn t good for business after all.
As Donald Trump ascends to power within the Republican ranks, his day job of being a hotel mogul is taking a serious hit.
As the stupidity spews from his mouth on a daily basis, Hipmunk, a Priceonomics customer and travel search engine, shows that bookings for Trump s hotels have plummeted by 60 percent.The methodology used was an in depth analysis of the total US Trump Hotel property bookings made in the first quarter of both 2015 and 2016.In other words, Trump is losing more than half his business.What s even more shocking is Hipmunk has hotel bookings, on average, on the rise while Trump s are among the only going against the grain.
Before running for President of the United States, Trump s hotels saw a 1.7 percent increase annually.According to Priceonomics:In New York City and Vegas, Trump Hotels share of each city s total hotel bookings dropped more than 70 percent.
Even in Atlantic City, where Trump Hotels claim the highest percentage of a city s total hotel bookings, Trump Hotels took a major hit year-over-year.
The Trump Taj Mahal s share of bookings is down 17% in the first quarter of this year.One of the only Trump hotels that has seen an increase in attendance is the International Hotel Waikiki Beach Walk, which has seen a jump of 4 percent.The biggest decline comes from Trump s Soho New York, which shows a staggering 74 percent net loss in bookings.While Trump lambasts who he calls the losers and haters, the American people are saying no thanks to his shady and most likely illegal hotel business.
It looks like the only loser is the Trump Organization.
If this trend continues, Trump may have to file for a bankruptcy for the fifth time.
While Republicans hope and prey Target goes under, maybe they should pay attention to their frontrunner s business instead.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images
