Cops are out of control when it comes to getting away with murdering black people with impunity and without consequence.
The case you re about to read about just got much, much worse, though.As we recently reported, Chicago cop Robert Rialmo shot and killed Quintonio LeGrier when the teen called the authorities for help three times, only to be hung up on.
Another casualty of the trigger-happy Rialmo was 55-year-old Bettie Jones.
As if the murders weren t bad enough, the cops already investigated themselves and cleared themselves of all wrongdoing, as seems to be so typical in these cases.
But it gets worse.
Much worse.As if this family hasn t been through enough, Rialmo is now suing the LeGrier family for emotional distress after he murdered their child.Also, it smacks of a potential cover-up, because Mayor Rahm Emanuel was forced to release text messages relating to the shooting.
One string alluded to his probing to see what the media what up to, and what kind of coverage this story was getting.
Emanuel s texts say, in part: Media acting breathlessly?
You are positive no public negative reaction?
Further, the LeGriers lawyer, Bill Fourtis, has a very good point: Quintonio was shot in the back four times by this deranged cop.
This lawsuit comes at an awfully convenient time just as details that make what happened that night look less than kosher become public, and just as the LeGrier family sues the city of Chicago for the wrongful death of their loved one.This cop needs to be in jail, as does everyone involved what is clearly a cover-up.Watch a news report on this developing story below:Featured image via video screen capture from Latest
