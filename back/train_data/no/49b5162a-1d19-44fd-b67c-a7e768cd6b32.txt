male ( reuters ) - two maldivians suspected of having links to islamic state ( is ) militants were planning to carry out a suicide attack in the country s capital , government officials said on wednesday .
the two , in their 20s , have been in detention since september but officials are now asking for them to be charged in criminal court .
the police investigation found out that they are affiliated with is and they had planned to carry out an attack in male , adam thaufeeq , a spokesman at the prosecutor general s office told reuters .
he declined to elaborate on specific location or the time of the planned attack .
male city , a two square mile island with a population of 150,000 , is one of the most densely populated cities in the world .
maldives authorities made several arrests in september , after the united kingdom updated its maldives travel advisory , saying militants were very likely to carry out an attack in the country .
officials have also told reuters that the authorities detained two maldivians in turkey en route to syria to join is fighters in september .
significant numbers of radicalised maldives youths have enlisted to fight for islamic state in the middle east and president abdulla yameen s government has brought some new laws to arrest maldivians joining the group .
