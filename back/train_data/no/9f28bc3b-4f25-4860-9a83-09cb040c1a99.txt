moscow ( reuters ) - russia is preparing to hold large-scale military exercises it says will be of a purely defensive nature , amid concerns in neighboring nations that the drills may be used as a precursor for an invasion .
a total of around 12,700 servicemen will take part in the war games , code named zapad 2017 , which will be held on sept. 14-20 in western russia , belarus and russia s exclave of kaliningrad .
these will include around 5,500 russian troops .
lieutenant general ben hodges , the u.s. army s top general in europe , told reuters last month that u.s. allies in eastern europe and ukraine were worried the exercises could be a trojan horse aimed at leaving behind military equipment brought into belarus .
this week russia s defence ministry rejected what it said were false allegations it might use the drills as a springboard to launch invasions of poland , lithuania or ukraine .
