cairo ( reuters ) - an egyptian court sentenced top muslim brotherhood leader mohamed badie to another life term in prison on thursday in the latest example of a crackdown against islamists since the army overthrew president mohamed mursi .
the sentence relates to violence that broke out in 2013 after the army toppled mursi in the wake of mass demonstrations against him .
general abdel fattah al-sisi led the military at that time and was elected president the following year .
authorities outlawed the brotherhood after mursi was ousted and arrested thousands of its supporters .
they also dissolved its freedom and justice party , which mursi led .
mass life and death sentences have been common since then in what rights groups call an unprecedented crackdown .
fifteen others were sentenced to life in prison in the same case on thursday while 77 were given 15-year sentences with hard labor .
only 38 of those sentenced on thursday were present at court while the rest were sentenced in absentia .
the judgment can be appealed in a higher court within the next 60 days .
those sentenced were charged with inciting terrorism , leading an outlawed group , raiding and vandalizing government facilities among other crimes related to clashes in beni suef , south of egypt in august 2013 .
the clashes took place the same day security forces dispersed two islamist sit-ins in central cairo and killed hundreds of mursi s supporters .
those sentenced on thursday included former members of parliament and members of the freedom and justice party .
badie was sentenced to life in jail in 2014 after being convicted of murder and inciting violence during clashes that took place during the same period .
