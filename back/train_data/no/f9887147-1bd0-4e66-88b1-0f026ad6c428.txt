don t you just love all the lies coming out of hillary s lying pie hole ?
she says she was really eager to meet with the fbi sure she was !
i d beg to differ that she was probably so nervous trying to keep all her lies straight .
the only way she would be eager to meet with the fbi is if the fix is in and she knows she ll not be charged with anything .
we ll see ! the lie that really stood out is that she said she heard of the bill/loretta meeting in the news .
do you think for one minute that she didn t hear this from bill first ?
she also claims it was a short chance meeting so a 30 minute meeting where no pictures or reporters were allowed is a chance meeting .
this is laughable ! in hillary clinton s first interview since meeting with fbi officials regarding the investigation into her use of a private email server , she told nbc s chuck todd she was eager for the meeting , and pleased to have the opportunity to assist the department in bringing its review to a conclusion .
however , she declined to comment on reports that charges will not be filed against her in the case.clinton also revealed that she first learned of her husband s tarmac meeting with attorney general loretta lynch from the news .
she described it as a short , chance meeting at an airport tarmac and that the two did not discuss the department of justice s review .
yet she acknowledged that both the former president and attorney general have admitted they wouldn t do it again .
hindsight is 20/20 , clinton said : interview with political hack chuck todd :
