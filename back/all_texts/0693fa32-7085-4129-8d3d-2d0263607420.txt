HARARE (Reuters) - The Zimbabwean military is in charge of a paramilitary police support unit depot in Harare and has disarmed police officers there, an army source told Reuters.
They are now in charge of all armory, all gates and roads leading in or out of the camp.
Arcturus Road (which leads to the camp) is closed and all Support Unit details with guns have been disarmed, the source said.
