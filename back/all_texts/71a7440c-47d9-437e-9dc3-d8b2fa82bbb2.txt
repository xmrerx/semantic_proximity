LONDON (Reuters) - A top aide to Iran s Supreme Leader warned the United States on Tuesday against designating the elite Revolutionary Guards as a terrorist group, saying Tehran has all options on table , news agency ISNA reported.
The Americans are supporting Daesh (Islamic State).
That s why they are angry with the Revolutionary Guards.
But they are too small to be able to harm the Revolutionary Guards, Ali Akbar Velayati, the top adviser to Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, was quoted as saying by ISNA.
Whatever they do we will take reciprocal measures.
We have all options on the table, he added.
