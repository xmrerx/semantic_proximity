Fox is not only number one with racists, the network is apparently number one at hiring racists as well.After a video of a school valedictorian went viral because Mayte Lara Ibarra told the audience that she is an undocumented immigrant during her speech, a Fox Sports reporter simply could not accept that a Latino is smart enough to be at the top of the class.During a Barstool Rundown associated with Republican nominee Donald Trump and his plan to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, Fox reporter Emily Austen openly questions the intelligence of Mexicans and made racist comments about Asians and Jews.
I didn t even know Mexicans were that smart, Austen said.
She also derided Jews as stingy and claimed the Chinese guy is always the smartest guy in math class.

Austen s remarks begin at the 24 minute mark.Well, while racist Trump supporters probably appreciated Austen s comments, they didn t go down well with her bosses at Fox Sports, who promptly removed her from the air for the time being.Fox Sports General Manager Steve Tello condemned Austen s comments and quickly made it clear that Fox Sports had nothing to do with them.
We were made aware that Emily Austen appeared in a social media video unaffiliated with Fox Sports in which she made insensitive and derogatory comments.
She was not speaking on behalf of Fox Sports, nor do we condone any of the statements she made in the video.
Emily has been advised that her comments were unacceptable, and she is not scheduled to appear on any upcoming Fox Sports Florida or Fox Sports Sun broadcasts.
These kinds of stereotypical precepts have no place in our society, but this is the kind of America that Donald Trump is hoping to create.
As a public media figure, Austen should have known better.
It would like someone saying that all blondes are dumb.
However, that stereotype appears to be true in Austen s case.Featured image via YouTube
