washington ( reuters ) - u.s. republican presidential candidate marco rubio ’ s campaign urged a tactical vote against party front-runner donald trump on friday , saying rubio supporters in ohio should vote for the state ’ s governor , john kasich , next week .
ohio is one of five states holding republican primary contests on march 15 .
“ if you ’ re a republican primary voter in ohio , and you don ’ t want donald trump to be the nominee , john kasich is your best bet , ” rubio spokesman alex conant told cnn in an interview .
“ if you ’ re a republican primary voter here in florida and you don ’ t want donald trump to be your nominee , marco rubio is your best bet .
that is indisputable , ” he added , referring to the u.s. senator ’ s home state .
rubio , kasich and ted cruz , a u.s. senator from texas , are battling to stop trump from winning the nomination to represent the party in the nov. 8 presidential election .
some republicans , most notably 2012 republican nominee mitt romney , have urged conservatives who oppose trump to vote for which ever alternative candidate is most likely to win certain states in the upcoming primary contests .
