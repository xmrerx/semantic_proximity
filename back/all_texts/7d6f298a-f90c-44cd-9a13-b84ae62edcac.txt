WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson on Wednesday called Mexico a “long-standing” friend of the United States and said the United States would engage with its southern neighbor.
“We’re going to engage with Mexico because of their importance to us in this hemisphere,” Tillerson said during his Senate confirmation hearing.
