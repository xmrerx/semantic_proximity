tokyo ( reuters ) - a japanese court sentenced a former u.s. military base worker to life in prison on friday for the rape and murder of a woman on the southern island of okinawa , public broadcaster nhk reported .
the naha district court found kenneth franklin shinzato , 33 , guilty of killing 20-year-old rina shimabukuro in april last year , nhk said .
a court spokesman told reuters he was unable to immediately confirm the decision .
the case sparked anger on the island , where locals have long protested the presence of u.s. military bases that they say imposes a heavy burden on okinawa .
okinawa hosts around 50,000 u.s. nationals , including 30,000 military personnel and civilians employed at the bases .
in a bid to assuage locals , the united states last year agreed to limit legal protection and benefits to some u.s. civilian contractors working for the military in japan under a status of forces agreement ( sofa ) that dates back to 1960 .
sofa exempts personnel from requiring visas while in japan , and has been criticized because it has been used by the u.s. military to ship people home before japanese police can capture them .
other incidents involving u.s. personnel have stirred resentment among okinawans .
on nov. 19 , a local man was killed in road accident after his van collided with a car driven by a u.s. marine suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol .
the u.s. military responded by imposing a drinking ban for personnel in japan on or off base .
