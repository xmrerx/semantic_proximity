While spouses are a tradition at the G-20 Summit, the truth is there is very little for them to do while world leaders discuss the problems facing the world.
Donald Trump brought along more than just his spouse this time.
He also brought along his daughter Ivanka, who in this instance, has absolutely no purpose.
Angela Merkel s husband has an idea that might help change the world, though.
He s taking the Trump women on a climate change tour, with the implied hope that perhaps they can have some influence over the man in their live.Donald Trump is proving himself to be one of the most destructive forces in the world in his denial of climate change.
His pulling out of the Paris Climate Agreement put us in the position of being one of only three countries, and by far the biggest carbon emitter, that has not vowed to cut emissions.Merkel s husband Joachim Sauer is a chemist and a professor.
Let s just say he doesn t share Trump s anti-science stances.
His plan is to take the First Daughter and First Lady on a tour of a climate change lab.Sauer is reportedly planning to take US president Donald Trump s daughter, Ivanka Trump, and first lady Melania Trump, as well as the other spouses of G20 leaders, on a tour around a climate change lab.
The spouses of G20 leaders will visit the German Climate Computing Center today (July 7), a facility that uses supercomputers to model climate change and map its effects across the world.
Sauer will also be taking the spouses on a river cruise and sightseeing tour of Hamburg.I wish Sauer luck.
You can bet that if either of these women have any sway with BLOTUS, it s Ivanka.
She is at least somewhat scientifically literate, when it comes to climate change, and she has had absolutely zero influence.
That s not bound to change.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images.
