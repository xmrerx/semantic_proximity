dividing america will be obama s legacy .
hillary continues to prove that she is committed to keeping his legacy of hate and division alive .
what hillary doesn t get is that the majority of americans are not buying into obama s divisive legacy that pits gays against straight people , blacks against whites , everyone against christians and so on the reason donald j.trump is so popular , is that he conveys a feeling of love for our country and gives americans the sense that he cares passionately about putting an end to the manufactured division and hate that obama has spent the last 8 years creating.you may get a lot of retweets and likes from paid trolls and social justice warriors on twitter hillary , but your message of division is not going to play well at the polls with the general public who are 100 % fed up with divisive politics on november 8th keith lamont scott .
terence crutcher .
too many others .
this has got to end .
