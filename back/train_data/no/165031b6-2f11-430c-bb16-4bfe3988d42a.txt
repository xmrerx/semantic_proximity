gayle king was the first to ask sanders if it was a good idea for trump to visit .
sanders said i don t know as he fumbled over his words .
well , there s one school of thought they re still in the middle of it , king interjected.sanders said the focus now was on doing everything that could be done to protect the people of houston .
sanders did not mention trump s visit , which will not include houston due to the ongoing conditions there , but will include corpus christi , where hurricane harvey made landfall .
is it too soon for a presidential visit ?
co-host maurice dubois again asked .
too soon for the president to be there ?
probably it is , but let s not get into that , sanders said .
the focus right now has got to be on doing everything that we can do address the terrible , terrible pain that is taking place in that city .
