Donald Trump s presidency has given rise to an amount of discrimination, hate speech, and racism that most Americans were honestly shocked to discover was hiding in the shadows of our country.
Fortunately, many of Trump s most disgraceful ideas such as his Muslim travel ban have been getting smacked down repeatedly, even when he tries to amend them.
Now, it seems that Trump s racist agenda is suffering another blow, and it s airlines that are standing up to him.The Wall Street Journal reported that Homeland Security s plan to track foreigners that are boarding international flights is getting shut down by airlines across the U.S. who refuse to pay the costs of the expensive technology to comply with Trump s recent orders.The plan involves using cameras to track passengers, and the government has spent over 20 years developing them.
The reason behind the cameras, which the airlines are supposed to pay for, was to avoid the astronomical costs that would involve placing border agents at every single international airport.
However, airlines aren t interested in this national security function and are resisting it.
One airline official said: Right now, there is no benefit to us.
We re not interested in adding another 10 minutes to the boarding process.
The procedure is called exit-tracking , and the technology includes cameras that are able to biometrically track passengers faces.
While Congress has been developing this system for over twenty years now, Trump has fast-tracked the system by recently signing an executive order (probably because he can t get his Muslim travel ban to succeed).
This system seems right up Trump s ally, who can t seem to accept the fact that the biggest terrorist threat to the United States is white conservative men with guns not foreigners.
Either way, we re glad that airlines are pushing back against this.Featured image via Scott Olson / Getty Images
