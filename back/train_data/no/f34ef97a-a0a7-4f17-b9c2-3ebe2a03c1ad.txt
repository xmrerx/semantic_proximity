sofia ( reuters ) - bulgaria s parliament speaker dimitar glavchev resigned on friday in a move he said was to avoid political upheaval as the country prepares to take over the six-month rotating european union presidency in january .
the opposition socialists had demanded glavchev s resignation and said they would boycott parliament sessions until he stepped down after he banned their leader , kornelia ninova , from the chamber over what he called offences to deputies and members of the government on wednesday .
glavchev , who described his resignation as a moral act , said it was his intention to restore calm in the parliament and not cast a shadow over bulgaria s eu presidency .
i have always said that the state and its stability are more important than anything , said prime minister boyko borissov .
parliament voted to appoint tsveta karayancheva , a senior member of the ruling center-right gerb party , to replace glavchev .
glavchev made a mistake , but his resignation is just a preventative measure and it will not lead to a parliamentary crisis or the fall of the government , daniel smilov , an analyst with bulgaria s centre for liberal strategies , told reuters .
gerb is trying not to complicate the situation .
the center-right gerb , led by borissov , returned to power for a third term since 2009 after a snap election in march .
his coalition government has a one-seat majority but is also supported by a small populist party .
