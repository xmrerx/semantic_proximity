WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican U.S.
Senators Marco Rubio and Mike Lee said they want a child tax credit to increase to $2,000 in a Senate tax bill unveiled on Thursday.
“While we are glad to see an increase to the child tax credit, like the House bill, it is simply not enough for working families,” Rubio and Lee said in a joint statement.
The Senate bill would raise the child tax credit to $1,650 from $1,000 currently.
