( reuters ) - two reporters and two editors from breitbart news resigned to protest how the conservative website handled an alleged assault last week on one of the reporters by a senior aide to republican presidential front-runner donald trump .
reporter michelle fields filed a criminal complaint on friday against trump ’ s campaign manager , corey lewandowski , saying he grabbed her arm at a rally on march 8 in florida with such force that he left bruises .
lewandowski and trump have denied the accusation .
the incident sparked a spat at breitbart , with journalists accusing management of kowtowing to the trump campaign .
breitbart published an account on friday of the incident that raised questions over fields ’ version of events and suggested it was not lewandowski who grabbed her .
according to a report on saturday on the buzzfeed news website , breitbart senior editor-at-large joel pollak also ordered staffers in an internal chatroom to stop defending fields .
fields and editor-at-large ben shapiro resigned in response to that late on sunday .
national security correspondent jordan schachtel and editor jarrett stepman resigned on monday , according to a letter by them that was posted to twitter , in which they accused the news site of becoming a propaganda arm for the trump campaign .
( bit.ly/1phhuc9 ) breitbart news chief executive larry solov said in an emailed statement late on monday , “ breitbart news thanks kurt , ben , and michelle for their work for us .
we wish each of them the best in their future endeavors. ” he was referring to kurt bardella , who resigned as breitbart ’ s spokesman last week .
the alleged assault on fields took place days before a series of clashes between supporters of trump , the front-runner to be the republican presidential candidate in november ’ s election , and protesters at campaign rallies .
the allegations were being investigated , a spokesman for the jupiter , florida police department said on monday .
