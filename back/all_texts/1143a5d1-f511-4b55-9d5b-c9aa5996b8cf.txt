BEIRUT (Reuters) - Lebanon s cabinet will meet on Tuesday for the first time since the country entered a political crisis a month ago when Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri offered his resignation in a broadcast from Saudi Arabia.
The cabinet s media office said the session would begin at noon at the presidential palace.
The meeting is expected to address Hariri s resignation which thrust Lebanon back into a regional tussle between Riyadh and its main regional foe, Iran.
