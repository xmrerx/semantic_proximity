Fat ass fraud in a pants suit When Hillary Clinton won the New York primary in April, she called for raising wages and reducing inequality and building ladders of opportunity while sporting a $12,495 Georgio Armani jacket.It was just one small part of a major wardrobe overhaul that one fashion expert pegged as a six-figure operation, the New York Post reported.It wasn t just in New York, where Clinton was photographed recently leaving a Ralph Lauren store on 5th Avenue accompanied by longtime aide Huma Abedin, where Clinton sported fancy fashions.She also wore a $4,000 white jacket by Susanna Beverly Hills on the campaign trail in rural Iowa.
She s had to have spent in the six figures on this wardrobe overhaul, Los Angeles-based image consultant Patsy Cisneros told the paper.For her campaign kickoff on Roosevelt Island, Clinton wore a custom blue silk Lauren suit that cost upwards of $2,200, according to the paper.For a New York funder, she opted for a beaded coat by Andrew Gn comparable to a $3,000 selling at Bergdorf Goodman.Her counterpart, real estate mogul Donald Trump, has been reported to favor Brioni suits that can cost more than $7,000.
