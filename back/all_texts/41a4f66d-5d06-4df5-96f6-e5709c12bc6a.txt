WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Thursday said the appointment of a special counsel to investigate possible collusion between his presidential campaign on Russia was dividing the country, and he repeated his contention there was no such collusion.
“There’s been no collusion between certainly myself and my campaign, but I can always speak for myself, and the Russians.
Zero,” Trump told reporters at the White House.
“I think it divides the country.”
