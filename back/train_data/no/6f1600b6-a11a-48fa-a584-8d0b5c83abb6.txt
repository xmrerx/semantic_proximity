jakarta ( reuters ) - indonesian authorities have detained a fireworks factory owner and a manager on suspicion of negligence after explosions and fire ripped through a warehouse on the outskirts of jakarta , killing 48 workers and injuring dozens , police said on saturday .
the blaze in the manufacturing hub of tangerang was one of the worst industrial disasters to hit southeast asia s biggest economy , where safety standards are often weakly enforced .
police said the fire started when sparks from a welding operation lit a stack of raw materials used for making fireworks , causing at least two explosions that could be heard miles away .
the men are suspected of negligence that led to deaths , said jakarta police spokesman argo yuwono .
the owner of the pt panca buana cahaya sukses factory and an operations manager were detained while police looked for the welder .
the owner was also suspected of employing underage workers , police said .
neither of the two detained was available for comment .
tangerang regent ahmed zaki said on friday that the company , which had been operating for two months , had a permit for packaging but not producing fireworks .
preliminary investigations and witness accounts showed that more than 30 victims were found at the back of the factory , where they had run to try to escape while others had to break holes in the walls to get out .
police denied reports that the front gate and only exit of the factory was locked at the time of the fire .
all bodies , many of them charred beyond recognition , had been taken away from the gutted factory , and family members were providing dna samples to try to identify them .
dozens of workers have been admitted to hospital with burns of up to 80 percent of their bodies .
hospital officials said some remained in critical condition and expected the death toll to rise .
