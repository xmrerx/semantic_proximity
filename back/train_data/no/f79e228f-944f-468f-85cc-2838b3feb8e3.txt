london ( reuters ) - crashing out of the european union without a deal would cause major problems for britain s health service and risk chaotic disruption to medicine supplies , according to a report on tuesday .
the nuffield trust , an independent health charity , also warned that brexit without a deal on future relations with the eu would lead to worsening staff shortages in the national health service ( nhs ) .
and it could create particular problems for healthcare in northern ireland , where treatment programs for some rare and serious diseases are designed to work across the entire island of ireland .
a scenario where the uk leaves without any deal would cause extensive problems for the nhs .
it would risk a chaotic disruption to supplies of medical products , and a rise in prices that would push hospitals deeper into deficit , the report stated .
many different parts of eu law and eu institutions play an important role in enabling care to be delivered to the standards we see today .
suddenly ending them with no replacement would do serious damage to an already strained british nhs .
the warning chimes with concerns from pharmaceutical companies , which are already drawing up plans to protect supply chains .
stringent medicine regulations mean manufacturers face multiple brexit uncertainties , such as the potential need to retest drugs shipped across borders and transfer product licences to different jurisdictions .
