dubai ( reuters ) - an air strike by a saudi-led military coalition killed 26 people at a hotel and an adjoining market in yemen s northern saadah province on wednesday , according to medics and a reuters witness .
the attack , which struck the sahar district of the vast territory that borders saudi arabia , demolished the budget hotel and reduced market stalls outside to a heap of twisted sheet metal .
medics retrieved corpses from the rubble .
the military alliance led by saudi arabia has launched thousands of air strikes against yemen s armed houthi movement , which hails from saadah and now controls much of the country .
the coalition said in a statement carried on state news agency spa that it was looking into media reports of the strike and would release its findings after a comprehensive review .
the 2-1/2 year war effort has yet to achieve its goal of restoring to power the internationally recognized government , but the conflict has unleashed one of the world s worst humanitarian crises and killed at least 10,000 people .
saudi arabia and its allies , which receive logistical and intelligence help from the united states , accuse the houthis of being a proxy of iran .
the houthi group denies those charges and says it is conducting a patriotic resistance against outside aggressors in thrall to the west .
