ljubljana ( reuters ) - slovenia s prime minister , miro cerar , has canceled a visit to croatia , accusing the neighboring state of reigniting a long-running maritime dispute , his office said on friday .
cerar called off next week s trip after his croatian counterpart , andrej plenkovic , told the u.n. general assembly that an international ruling on their shared waters was invalid .
the permanent court of arbitration ruled in june that slovenia should have uninterrupted access to the sea it shares with croatia .
croatia objected at the time , and plenkovic said he had merely repeated his country s position at the united nations on thursday .
in my speech there was nothing new about croatia s position , i mentioned the facts ... we remain open for dialogue with slovenia and i invite cerar to come to croatia on some other date , plenkovic told a cabinet session in zagreb .
the countries have been arguing over a stretch of their sea and land border since both declared independence from the former yugoslavia in 1991 as it disintegrated into war and broke up .
the dispute , which centers on the bay of piran , held up croatian accession to the eu for many years .
only after both parties agreed to arbitration was zagreb granted entry to the bloc in 2013 - though it later withdrew from the proceedings .
the hague-based court ruled that slovenia gets the vast majority of the piran bay area recognized as its territorial waters .
in addition , the tribunal established a 2.5 nautical-mile wide and some 10 nautical-mile long corridor through croatian waters to give slovenia much-coveted direct access to international waters .
