It s clear most of America has had just about enough of the GOP clown car and this primary season.
Recognizing this, Seth Meyers absolutely tore apart the most recent Republican debate in a segment called GOP Debate Antics: A Closer Look.
The Late Night host took no prisoners and one by one just completely pummeled them, and righteously so.
From the botched intro to the very end.In pointing out Rubio s robotics he even suggested that he might as well go with a GIF of Donald Trump s facial expressions as a running-mate if he were to get the nomination, because it would work every time.Meyers mercilessly mocked Bush and Trump s back and forth, as well as how Trump went after the New Hampshire debate audience, arguing that the real estate mogul seems to hate them, but loves waterboarding.
Which is true.Ben Carson, of course, didn t escape being lampooned, Meyers roasted him by pointing out the ridiculous introduction portion of the debate, asking: Is Ben Carson really a brain surgeon, or did people just start calling him that sarcastically and it just stuck?
Oh yeah, that guy s a real brain surgeon.
Your surgery will start any moment, we just need to get Doctor Carson in here.
Meyers then pretends to wave him in, just like with what happened at the debate when he didn t seem to realize he needed to walk out on stage.All in all, if these Republicans want to say and do the things that they say and do, they need to realize that it s all being recorded and will be played back and mocked for all eternity.Well done, Meyers.Here s the whole clip: Video/Featured image: YouTube
