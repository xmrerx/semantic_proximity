Ted Cruz is horrible.
According to former classmates, he spent his time in college hanging out near the women s restroom in a bathrobe, and leaves a greasy film behind on all he touches.
His own daughter seems to be repulsed by the very thought of expressing affection toward him.
On Wednesday, MSNBC s Chris Matthews may have solved the puzzle of the Texas Senator s general horribleness.
There s a troll-like quality to Cruz, Matthews told Joe Scarborough during a panel on the topic of Cruz s ability to challenge Trump.
He operates below the level of human life.
That s a little tough!
Scarborough replied.
You have not gotten sleep.
We re going to try that again.
Can I not have an opinion?
Matthews asked, before being told by Scarborough, Not that opinion.
Matthews attempted to better explain his position in a manner that even Joe Scarborough can grasp, which is a difficult task: I think he appeals to people s negativity rather than their joy.
I don t think people feel good about voting for Cruz.
I think they feel I don t know what it is he appeals to.
People say he inherited the Libertarian crowd.
I don t see how.
He doesn t seem Libertarian to me.
He s appealed to the Baptists up here.
I don t understand that.
What is he?
A theocrat?
Maybe he is, the Matthews continued.
There s something about that guy who has always reminded me of Joe McCarthy, and there s something about him that s negative and menacing.
When I say below the level of human life, I mean the good nature of human life, not just being a person, he said, explaining that the 2016 hopeful simply doesn t have a human side.That pretty much explains Ted Cruz.
He s human, certainly, in that he has flesh and breathes and probably has feelings sometimes.
But he is terrible at displaying it.
Like Rubio, he comes off as robotic.
But unlike Rubio, everything about him seems disgusting and evil.Watch the Hardball host reveal Cruz for who he is below:Featured image from screengrab
