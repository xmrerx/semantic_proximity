Acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe testified today in front of the Senate Intelligence Committee.
When asked if the rank and file employees of the law enforcement agency, he said, Director Comey enjoyed broad support within the F.B.I.
and still does to this day.
The vast majority of F.B.I.
employees enjoyed a deep and positive connection to Director Comey, McCabe went on to say, It has been the greatest privilege and honor of my professional life to have worked with him.
When asked about the current investigation into any ties between the Trump campaign, McCabe said that the agency considers this investigation to be very important and serious.
As to what impact Comey s firing will have on the investigation, he said, The work of the men and women of the FBI continues despite any changes in circumstances, he said in response to a question from Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida.
There has been no effort to impede our investigation to date.
Simply put, you cannot stop the men and women of the FBI from doing the right thing.
Given what the White House has said this week, both areas are important.
Yesterday, White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders told the press that the reason Comey was fired was because, among other things, that he had lost the confidence of the agents there.
One reason many believe President Trump fired Comey, and no one believes anyone but Trump made this decision, because he thought it might slow down the investigation.
It now appears neither of those ideas are true.Featured image via Alex Wong/ Getty Images.
