new york ( reuters ) - a campaign advisor and longtime employee of republican presidential candidate donald trump has been appointed his social media director , the campaign said on thursday .
dan scavino , who was executive vice president and general manager at the trump organization , the republican frontrunner ’ s real estate company , from 2003 to 2013 , has worked directly with trump on social media strategy in his bid to become president .
trump has actively used social media platforms such as twitter inc and facebook inc to reach his supporters , often launching personal attacks on those who cross paths with him or simply retweeting his fans .
so far , the real estate mogul has had some success with that approach , receiving the biggest share of mentions on twitter during republican presidential debates .
during saturday ’ s debate , he garnered 33 percent of the social conversation , according to twitter .
while social media traction doesn ’ t necessarily translate to votes , it can indicate overall interest in a candidate .
trump finished first in the new hampshire primary on tuesday and second in last week ’ s iowa caucuses .
the candidate will continue to tweet for himself despite scavino ’ s new role , said hope hicks , a spokeswoman for the trump campaign .
scavino , who tweets under the handle @ danscavino , has more than 51,000 followers on twitter .
many of his tweets are jabs at trump ’ s competitors .
