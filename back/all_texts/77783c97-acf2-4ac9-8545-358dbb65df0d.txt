WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Zimbabwe s military has told regional leaders its move to seize power from President Robert Mugabe was not a coup, the head of the African Union commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat, said on Wednesday.
Faki, on a visit to Washington for talks with U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, said he had not spoken to Mugabe but added: The military have reassured us this is not a coup d etat.
The African Union is against any unconstitutional change of government.
Zimbabwe s military seized power early on Wednesday saying it was targeting criminals around Mugabe, 93, who has ruled Zimbabwe since independence in 1980.
