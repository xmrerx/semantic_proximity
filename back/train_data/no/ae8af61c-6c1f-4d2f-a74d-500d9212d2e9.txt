21st century wire says here s something quite pavlovian to think about .
what if it were a goal of government and their security services to ensure that we feel we re being watched at every turn , in every-way feasible ; but reality is not exact what we think it is and we re doing most of the censoring all by ourselves.adam garrie from the duran takes us on an interesting journey in the below article .
it also contains an important element of what we ve talked about on shows at 21st century wire and alternate current radio s the boiler room regarding this fourth wall that people find it difficult to push through , which is fear .
the fear of losing their job , loved ones , social acceptability , and so forth.more on this article from the duran adam garrie the duraneven prior to the release of vault 7 from wikileaks , people knew that so-called intelligence agencies in western states had the means to spy on their own citizens .
many also assumed that the typical illegality of such activities was of no consequence for agencies and individuals in those agencies who regard themselves as being above the law.now that we know the cia and other institutions have such abilities to digitally hack just about every household device from the smart phone and smart-tv to the good old fashioned pc , the biggest question is , when do these deep state organisations implement these measures to spy on civilians and compromise their lives ? the answer can be found without needing to resort to conspiracy theories nor even speculation .
the answer lies in the private sector.organisations like the cia , mi5 , fbi etc. , need only do what the private sector isn t all ready doing for them and as it is , the private sector is doing a hell of a lot.if one wonders why major financial , academic , diplomatic , trading , banking , security and even artistic institutions in the west tend to have people on their payrolls who follow the western ideological narrative , there are two reasons.the first is that people are attracted to like-minded people and by extrapolation like-minded professions.but there is a second more devious reason .
those who think outside the western box , those who question more simply can not get a foot through the door .
technically , one needn t have any view on vladimir putin to be on the board of a major western construction company , law firm , private bank or hedge fund .
these professions do not involve knowledge of russian politics or society .
but those who have and even casually express a view of putin or of the arab world or of east asia and latin america that differs from the neo-lib/neo-con point of view , are blacklisted.social media has made this blacklisting easier to do than ever .
if two equally qualified candidates were applying for a high level position at a financial institution and one person had a picture of himself at a hillary clinton fundraiser on his facebook and the other had a save palestine picture or a pro-putin meme on his social media accounts , there would be no prizes for correctly guessing who would almost certainly get the job.in the words of george carlin , it s a big club and you ain t in it .the punitive blacklisting of those who don t follow the cnn/bbc/nyt script has a double effect.first of all , it keeps those who think outside the box away from positions of power in the private sector and in most western countries , without a prominent position in the business or mainstream entertainment community , achieving political office is next to impossible.secondly , there is a powerful deterrent effect .
many people would like to post pro-putin , pro-donbass , pro-syria or pro-palestine items on social media , but they are afraid that it could cost them their job , their bonus or even their friends .
in the west such things can break-up families .
it happens every day .
at this very movement , someone in a western country is contemplating suicide because of being on the losing end of a divorce settlement .
very sad , yet very true.this kafkaesque reality is achieved without the cia needing to hack people s phones or computers .
the private sector does the job for them.for every tabloid story about a woman losing her job because she posted a photo of her genitals on-line , there are many more people who are professionally compromised for posting photos of patriotic russian or arab leaders.throughout the 20th century , the private sector has always been happy to do the bidding of the deep state .
hollywood was largely compliant with the red scare tactics of the 1950s and frankly , hollywood producers did more to censor free-speech than the drunk and soon discredited joseph mccarthy ever could have done.why should the cia waste time and money to read people s emails , when their much more local boss , or chairman of human relations can take a quick look at facebook and achieve the cia s goal far more easily ? the answer is that they don t. the beauty of a police state is that unquestioning citizens are deputies of the secret police and they work for free .
