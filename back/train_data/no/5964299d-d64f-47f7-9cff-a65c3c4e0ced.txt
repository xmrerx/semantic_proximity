washington ( reuters ) - senate banking committee chairman richard shelby on tuesday started to ease the backlog of 16 obama administration nominees stalled before the panel , scheduling a march 15 confirmation hearing for two securities and exchange commission nominees .
the move follows shelby ’ s resounding republican primary victory in alabama a week ago for a sixth term in the senate .
the committee will question lisa fairfax and hester peirce for the sec positions at the hearing as well as matthew jeppson to be director of the u.s. mint .
but 13 other nominations remain , including for two federal reserve board governors , the u.s. treasury ’ s top anti-terrorist finance official and a u.s. export-import bank board member .
without the exim board member approved , the trade bank can not approve large loans or guarantees above $ 10 million , effectively locking it out of deals for boeing co commercial aircraft or major power equipment made by general electric .
conservatives , including shelby , had waged a major campaign to close the trade bank last year , idling it for more than five months before congress voted to renew its charter .
he told reuters in december that the exim nomination would be a “ lower priority for him. ” the fed nominees , former community banker allan landon and university of michigan economist kathryn dominguez , would restore the central bank ’ s board to its full capacity of seven members .
many had written off their chances of being confirmed , in part because of the testy relationship between congress and the fed , which has opposed republican bills it says would curb its independence .
