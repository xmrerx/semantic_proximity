if this cop s comments were in lock-step with the leftist narrative , that it s okay to use violence to punish innocent cops as long as it brings attention to a few bad cops , would this even be a news story ?
why is this man , who is a target of the violent black lives matter movement , unable to speak out against the very people who seek to do him and his brothers/sisters harm ? detroit police say they have launched an investigation into an officer s viral facebook rant about the black lives matter movement in reaction to the dallas police shooting.the post by officer nathan weekley has been viewed more than 40,000 times , and reacts to the tragic dallas shooting that left five police officers killed and several others injured.the post reads : for the first time in my nearly 17 years as a law enforcement officer i contemplated calling into work in response to the outrageous act perpetrated against my brothers .
it seems like the only response that will demonstrate our importance to society as a whole .
the only racists here are the piece of ( expletive ) black lives matter terrorists and their supporters .
that post has already led to an ugly viral backlash against weekley .
so far , he s declined to speak with 7 action news due to an internal investigation , but the president of the detroit police officer s association did talk to us.via : wxyz
