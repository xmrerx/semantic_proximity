GAZA (Reuters) - Palestinian rivals Hamas and Fatah have agreed to hand over responsibility for the Rafah border crossing in Gaza to the unity government on Nov. 1, two sources said on Thursday.
The crossing agreement was part of a broader reconciliation deal brokered by Egypt and signed in Cairo on Thursday by the two Palestinian delegations.
