Even though the fact that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee tweeted out Anti-Semitic imagery is bad enough, Donald Trump has now decided to defend himself.
Because of course.
Trump doesn t believe he s ever wrong, and an apology would be sacrilegious to whom he worships most himself.Here s the original tweet before his campaign staff scurried to replace the Star of David with a circle: And even though it s already been proven that the original meme came from a white supremacy forum, Trump still takes to Twitter to try and spew the same cover-up story others have been trying to claim, and that is that the star is not actually the Star of David, but just a sheriff s badge, or a regular star.Here s Trump Monday morning: Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff s Star, or plain star!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 4, 2016Well, which is it, Trump?
A sheriff s star or a plain star.
Or maybe it s just a poor excuse for a poor excuse of a human being tweeting out imagery from white supremacists depicting Hillary Clinton on top of a pile of money next to a Star of David.It s surprising Trump still has internet privileges at this point in his campaign.
In all honesty, he could have just let this topic go and within a few news cycles it might have been gone, but nope, he decides to make a horrific thing even worse by defending it.We need to make sure we do all we can to keep him out of the Oval Office.
