WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate will most likely vote on four gun control measures on Monday, the No.
2 Republican in the Senate said, after the weekend shooting massacre at a gay nightclub in Florida.
Two of the proposals are sponsored by Democrats and two by Republicans, Senator John Cornyn of Texas said on Thursday.
“I think it’s pretty definite,” he said of the Monday time frame.
