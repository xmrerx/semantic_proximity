South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott, the only African-American Republican in the U.S. Senate, emotionally detailed his own experiences of being unfairly targeted by the police.During a speech on the Senate floor this Wednesday, Scott revealed that in his first year serving as a senator, he had been stopped by police seven times.In the course of one year, I ve been stopped seven times by law enforcement, Scott said.
Not four, not five, not six, but seven times in one year as an elected official.The speech was the second of three that the senator is delivering this week following the fatal police shootings of two black men and the slaughter of five police officers in Dallas.
Scott said that this speech was by far the most difficult because it is the most personal.
