beijing ( reuters ) - china will keep up its years-long battle against smog to ensure blue skies and promote a revolution in clean energy , president xi jinping said on wednesday at the opening ceremony of a key communist party congress .
improving the notoriously toxic air across the northern regions of the world s second-largest economy has been a cornerstone of beijing s economic and social policy in recent years .
china has ordered factories to cut output in a bid to enforce bigger emission cuts in coming months and avoid a repeat of the near-record levels of choking smog that enveloped key northern areas at the start of the year .
in the long term , it has also launched a series of measures to curb the use of coal , the nation s favorite fuel , and boost use of renewable power , like wind and solar .
the government will also take measures to improve rural areas by restoring soil and waterways , xi added , as china moves to modernize its vast agricultural sector .
