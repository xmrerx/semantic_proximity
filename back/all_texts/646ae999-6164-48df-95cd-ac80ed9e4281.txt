Donald Trump s ties to Vladimir Putin have been questioned again and again, and for good reason.
Trump has previously said good things about Putin and has done so once again, but not before he released the holiday letter he received from the Vladimir.Putin wrote the letter to Donald just over a week ago, on December 15th, saying: I hope that after you assume the position of the President of the United States of America, we will be able by acting in a constructive and pragmatic manner to take real steps to restore the framework of bilateral cooperation in different areas as well as bring our level of collaboration on the international scene to a qualitatively new level.
In the letter he also wished the Trump family happiness and success.During his annual news conference Putin suggested that America and Russia should discuss ways to normalize our relations.
During his election campaign, Trump said it would be proper to normalize and it can t be worse, and I agree with him.
Putin has also tweeted about his hopes to ally with the US:On the first meeting with Trump: We will discuss how to put Russia-US relations back on track President of Russia (@KremlinRussia_E) December 23, 2016Trump responded in a short statement: A very nice letter from Vladimir Putin; his thoughts are so correct, I hope both sides are able to live up to these thoughts, and we do not have to travel an alternate path.
However, Trump s tweets say he s definitely willing to travel down an alternate path.
Yesterday, on the 22nd, Donald Trump tweeted The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 22, 2016He also made a statement to Morning Joe host Mika Brzezinski of MSNBC Let it be an arms race.
We will outmatch them at every pass and outlast them all, So it s certain that Trump is perfectly fine with starting an arms race, even though that generally leads to war.
Trump probably doesn t have enough knowledge of history to know that though.What will happen between these superpowers remains unclear, but hopefully it doesn t involve nuclear war, and with it the destruction of the world as we know it.Featured image via Mark Wilson/Getty Images
