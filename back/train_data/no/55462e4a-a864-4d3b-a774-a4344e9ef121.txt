stockholm ( reuters ) - support for the far-right , anti-immigration sweden democrats party has fallen to its lowest level since surging during the migration crisis of 2015 , a government poll showed on tuesday .
the sweden democrats approval rating shot to nearly 20 percent in november 2015 after hundreds of thousands of people arrived in sweden to seek asylum .
but a stricter immigration policy has led to a big reduction in numbers , and the issue has slipped from the top of the political agenda .
support for the sweden democrats stood at 14.8 percent in november , compared to 18.4 percent in june , sweden s statistics office found in its twice yearly poll for which it interviewed 9,000 people between oct. 27 and nov. 28 .
the government , comprised of the social democrats and greens , had a 36.4 percent approval rating , compared with 35.6 percent in the june poll .
prime minister stefan lofven has wooed voters with a pledge to boost spending by almost 44 billion crowns ( $ 5.23 billion ) in the budget for 2018 with much of the money going on welfare , education and the police .
immigration is no longer dominating the political debate in sweden , jonas hinnfors , political scientist at gothenburg university said .
together with the left party , which supports the coalition in parliament , the government has 43.4 percent support , up from 41.9 percent in june .
at its current level of support , the sweden democrats would still have enough clout to block either the centre-left or centre-right blocs from forming a government after the next election in september 2018 , should they fail to reach a majority .
the sweden democrats , shunned by all the major parties due to their far-right roots , have said they would help vote down either a centre-left or centre-right coalition in 2018 , making it unclear how either bloc will be able to form a government .
