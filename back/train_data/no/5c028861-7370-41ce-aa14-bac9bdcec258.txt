soooo the irs lied to americans to prod them to comply and sign up for obamacare .
they lied about the cost of obamacare .
does anyone see the criminality in this ?
it s a classic bait and switch but by our government !
the obama administration misled americans into thinking signing up for obamacare would be cheaper than it really was , according to an inspector general s report thursday that said the irs dramatically understated the actual cost of enrolling .
irs officials sent the letters to try to prod americans to comply with the 2010 health law s individual mandate that penalizes them for not holding coverage.but as part of the letters , the irs said most people could find plans for $ 75 a month or less once government subsidies were figured in .
that was untrue in fact , the average cost was more than twice that figure , at $ 168 a month , the treasury inspector general for tax administration said .
many of the nearly 7.5 million taxpayers who receive letters and seek insurance may feel misled if the actual cost of their insurance is much higher than the $ 75 per month detailed in their notification letter , the inspector general concluded .
the irs said it was only using numbers provided by department of health and human services and verified by the treasury department .
they said the $ 75 figure was true for some taxpayers.the inspector general said it asked for that documentation but never received it.auditors said their own analysis found the hhs studies were based on a smaller sample and was limited to those who chose lower-coverage plans with fewer benefits.according to the new audit , federal regulations require agencies to present accurate information.investigators uncovered the misleading information as part of a broader audit about how the irs was handling its role in alerting americans who aren t complying with obamacare s mandate to hold insurance.read more : wt
