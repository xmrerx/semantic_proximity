In an unprecedented move, the Trump administration is considering not submitting a budget to Congress next year.
He would do this to avoid criticism and it s not illegal even though the Congressional Budget Act requires the president to submit the fiscal 2018 budget to Congress between January 2nd and February 6th.
As Forbes notes, Trump could easily say that it was the responsibility of the outgoing Obama administration to comply with the law before the new president was sworn in on January 20.
Forbes source of this news was someone in the GOP congressional leadership.Again, this is unprecedented, but there s a reason #TrumpFirsts was trending on Twitter yesterday.
Clearly, the man doesn t know how to President:Every in-coming president since the Congressional Budget Act went into effect in the mid-1970s has submitted a budget.
In many years, those budgets (or amendments to the outgoing president s final budget) were submitted months after the first-Monday-in-February deadline and were truncated versions of the usual multi-volume presentation.
But, a fiscal plan with the new president s priorities was consistently released for over 4 decades.A newly elected President is typically eager to submit a budget the first year because it s an opportunity to display the details and plans for things to come.
It s showing the new President s priorities.
But after a budget is submitted, it gives a platform for those who will criticize the administration.
So if there s no proposal then there s no criticism.And as for those promises Trump made: it would also eliminate the need for the administration to publish a table with the very optimistic GDP growth promised during the campaign, the high interest rates many economists think are coming and Trump s unrealistic assumptions on jobs and unemployment.This is coming from a man who didn t release his taxes during his campaign.
That, too, is not presidential.
We d love to hear a good defense on this from Trump supporters.
Y all got burned and we re going to have to clean another Republican President s mess up when he creates an apocalyptic economy.
By the way, the jobless rate is 4.6 percent right now.
Watch how fast that increases._____________________________________________________________________________________Photo by Alex Wong via Getty.
