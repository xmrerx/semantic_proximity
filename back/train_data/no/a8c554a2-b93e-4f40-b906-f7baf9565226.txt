tallinn ( reuters ) - the european union should add more sanctions on north korea as part of international pressure following pyongyang s largest nuclear test to date , the bloc s foreign policy chief federica mogherini said on thursday .
while sanctions have so far done little to stop north korea boosting its nuclear and missile capacity , federica mogherini said more such steps were required along with piling on political pressure .
i would propose to ministers today to strengthen the economic pressure on north korea , supporting a new u.n. security council resolution adopting tougher economic measures , starting new autonomous eu sanctions ... and working with other partners in the world to make sure that everybody implements fully and strictly the already-decided economic measures , mogherini told reporters before meeting the eu defense and foreign ministers in the estonian capital .
the united states and china are discussing options to rein in pyongyang and south korea has deployed a defense system aimed at countering north korean missile attacks .
no formal eu decision is expected from the bloc on thursday and its leverage on pyongyang , as well as russia and china north korea s main ally is limited .
it has to be pursued because the alternative in our view is and could be extremely dangerous , especially if in front of you have an interlocutor that might act quite irrationally .
