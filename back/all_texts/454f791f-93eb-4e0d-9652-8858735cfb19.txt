BRUSSELS (Reuters) - The head of the European Parliament s biggest group, the center-right European People s Party, said British Prime Minister Theresa May s speech on Brexit on Thursday did not clarify London s position and had left him more concerned than before.
In substance PM May is bringing no more clarity to London s positions.
I am even more concerned now, Manfred Weber said on Twitter.
Prime Minister Theresa May called on Friday for Britain to stay in the European Union s single market during a roughly two-year transition out of the EU as she appealed for a revival of Brexit negotiations.
