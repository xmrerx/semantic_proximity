london ( reuters ) - a speech in italy by prime minister theresa may created momentum in brexit talks with the european union , her spokesman said on monday , but was non-committal on whether it would provide the breakthrough the british government says it wants .
asked if may was confident of a breakthrough in the current round of talks , her spokesman said : the ( florence ) speech was intended to create momentum , we believe we are seeing that momentum , but lets see what happens in the next round of talks .
the spokesman told reporters that the government was pressing on with may s brexit plans and would publish policy papers on its plans for customs and trade legislation after britain leaves the bloc in march 2019 .
he also said the prime minister , who was left weaker than ever after her party s annual conference last week , had full confidence in her finance minister , philip hammond , and foreign secretary , boris johnson , after a raft of negative briefings against both of them by unnamed sources in local media .
