It would make sense why Trump claimed wages are too high as is, and why he supports getting rid of minimum wages standards and hates foreigners.A report-turned-documentary on HBO s Vice shows that the Trump International Golf Club in Dubai has been recruiting migrants from countries like Pakistan, promising them $3 an hour, but instead paying them just half of that.
If a migrant is lucky, they will make only $231 a month.Also documented was the inhumane treatment and near enslavement of these migrants, including the confiscation of their passports so they cannot leave, and packing 20 or more migrants at a time in a small room for hours on end.
Their rooms, miles outside the city and sitting in the dark desert, are infested with rats, mold and mildew.Sharing one kitchen for 100 people, and forced to bathe in troughs, the migrants are forced to relieve themselves where they wash.
The bathrooms, as described in the documentary, are not fit for human use.Promising them standard eight hour shifts with the possibility of two hours overtime and a decent salary, the migrants were interested.
But as the documentary shows, non of the promises were delivered.And of course Donald Trump declined to be interviewed, and instead had his organization release a statement saying Trump himself has no idea what s going on and that he doesn t take direction action in supervising, hiring, or building of entities he lends his name and brand to.When asked if they preferred working in Dubai or living in Pakistan, they responded with the latter.With his workers being treated with such little dignity, it s no wonder Trump has no problem being a war-hungry, xenophobic, racist monster.How can he claim to value life when his organization enslaves hard working migrants who just want to have a decent salary?Here is a clip form the documentary detailing just a sliver of the conditions:Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images
