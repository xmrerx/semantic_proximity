When Dr. Ben Carson was in the race for the Republican nomination, Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of accusations against the neurosurgeon, going after him aggressively and even comparing him to a pedophile.
That s why many were bewildered when Carson endorsed Trump after he dropped out of the race for the nomination.
Yet, not only has Carson endorsed Trump s candidacy, he defends Trump and his vile campaign even at the worst of moments.In the latest of a series of bizarre moves, Carson defended Trump s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski during a CNN interview on Thursday, saying that being charged with assault against a female reporter did not make Lewandowski evil.
Carson said, I don t see any reason, quite frankly that we should demonize him.
If you can come up with a good reason, I ll listen to it.
Co-host John Berman pointed out, Well, look, he s been charged with misdemeanor assault.
A lot of people think that is a reason.
Carson then went on a bizarre tangent saying, A lot of people have been charged with various things.
You ve probably been charged with with something too.
Maybe with a misdemeanor or something.
It doesn t mean that you are an evil horrible person.
The stunned Berman responded, I actually haven t been charged with anything.
You have to ask what in the world did Trump offer Carson to make him sell himself in such a manner?
We have to keep in mind that Carson is not only defending Trump, who has spewed racism and bigotry throughout his campaign but in this particular case, he s defending someone who committed assault on camera.The adage if you can t beat them then join them is clearly on display here but nothing is worth the price of selling your soul, something Carson has clearly done in this case.
