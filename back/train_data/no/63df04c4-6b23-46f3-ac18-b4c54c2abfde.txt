tokyo ( reuters ) - a japanese sports official promised on friday to work with the builder of a showpiece stadium for the 2020 olympics to stamp out death by overwork , a designation authorities applied last week to the suicide of a stadium worker .
the parents of the 23-year-old petitioned the government this year to recognize his suicide as karoshi - or death by overwork , with media saying he had worked 200 hours of overtime a month before his death .
to our regret , illegal overtime was recognized as a result of inspection by the labor ministry , said tadashi mochizuki , director of stadium manager the japan sport council ( jsc ) , which is part of a joint venture with construction firm taisei corp. we , jsc and taisei , took it sincerely and we ll do the utmost ( to comply with the law ) in proceeding with construction .
authorities unveiled a model of the new stadium in the japanese capital , which is set to be completed in november 2019 , after construction begun in december 2016 .
japan s fast-ageing society has left employers grappling with an acute labor shortage .
it officially recognizes two types of karoshi : cardiovascular illness linked to overwork , and suicide following mental stress related to work .
employers face few curbs on overtime and pay , so that more than a fifth of company staff exceeded a government overtime threshold of 80 hours a month , a white paper showed in 2016 .
the trend was spotlighted by a high-profile death from overwork in 2015 at advertising giant dentsu inc. last week , public broadcaster nhk said a 31-year-old reporter died four years ago of overwork .
to tackle the problem , the government plans sweeping reforms of job practices , including overtime caps and better pay for part-time and contract workers .
