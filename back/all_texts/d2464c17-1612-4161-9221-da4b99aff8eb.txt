Maybe Donald would change his opinion about this important issue if his home was threatened by an overreaching government I think eminent domain for massive projects, for instance you are going to create thousands of jobs and you have somebody who is in the way, and you pay that person far more.
Don t forget, eminent domain, they get a lot of money.
And you need a house in a certain location because you are going to build this massive development that is going to employ thousands of people, I think eminent domain is fine.
It s called economic development.
