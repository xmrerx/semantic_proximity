caddell s remarks came after hearing michelle obama s now infamous comments to oprah winfrey : the first lady was asked by oprah winfrey whether she thinks that her husband s administration had achieved his promise of hope for america .
yes .
i do , she said .
because we feel the difference now .
see , now , we are feeling what not having hope feels like .
you know .
hope is necessary .
it s a necessary concept and barack didn t just talk about hope because he thought it was just a nice slogan to get votes .
he and i and so many believe , what else do you have when you do not have hope ?
caddell continued , the bush people , they had a certain conduct .
george w. bush kept his mouth shut about obama forever .
what s obama doing saying , i m going to be back here right after vacation .
i need to be in washington .
i need to comment ?
where s the part where you gracefully leave the stage ?
