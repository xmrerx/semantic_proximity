ISIS released a new video yesterday, where they threatened America and every other country they identify as the infidel.
Meanwhile, we have a Commander In Chief who still refuses to identify them as terrorists or admit ISIS is actually fighting a holy war.I don t know maybe we re misunderstanding their message, but we re pretty sure they mention several times throughout the video that they are fighting a war for Allah Their latest video is pretty repulsive and we don t normally share their propaganda, but we thought is was worth viewing, given our President s insistence on convincing the world that ISIL is not Islamic.
Here s the JV team s latest video.
You be the judge.
Are these evil beings waging a holy war, or are they as Obama said only two days ago, just bad guys with guns and good social media?
