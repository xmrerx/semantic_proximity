Donald Trump is again under fire from allegations of misbehavior on the topic of sexual conduct on the set of his reality show, The Apprentice.
Trump has increasingly been criticized for his actions with women, as they have come forward one-by-one making claims that the Republican presidential nominee forced himself on them.The latest claim, uncovered by The Daily Beast, involves Trump s failure to act.Oscar nominee Gary Busey allegedly sexually assaulted a female Apprentice employee during his time on the show, five Apprentice employees tell The Daily Beast.
Donald Trump knew about the incident, laughed it off, and kept Busey on his TV series, these staffers said.Multiple Apprentice employees, including the alleged victim herself, told The Daily Beast that the Academy-Award-nominated actor grabbed one of their colleagues firmly between [the] legs during the 2011 season of Celebrity Apprentice.
Busey also forcibly put the female staffer s hand on the crotch of his pants.
The alleged incident, which they say took place during a location shoot in SoHo in New York City, prompted a firestorm among members of the Apprentice crew.The report comes as the Trump campaign has begun a public relations offensive featuring Trump s current wife, Melania.
She appeared on several outlets and claimed that the women coming forward to accuse her husband were all lying.
Melania Trump also claimed that the audio tape in which Trump joked about sexually assaulting women was simply a matter of the 59-year-old Trump acting like a boy and being egged on by Access Hollywood host Billy Bush.Newly released polls show that a majority of woman voters do not take such a charitable view of Trump s actions, and instead are overwhelmingly choosing Hillary Clinton as their candidate.
Clinton is even winning a plurality of support with married women, previously a weak spot for Democratic candidates.Featured image via YouTube
