bern ( reuters ) - european commission president jean-claude juncker said on thursday that it would be seen in the next few days whether brexit talks with britain had made enough progress to enter a second phase of negotiations .
we are in intense negotiation with the uk to end the first phase of the talks about topics such as citizen rights , the ireland problem , the bill that will have to be paid , juncker told a news conference during an official visit to switzerland .
the worst is behind us , but there has not been sufficient progress for me to say that we can enter the second phase of the talks about our relationship in the future .
we ll see that within the next few days , he said .
asked about a report the uk could pay 45 billion pounds for its brexit divorce , he said : i m not crazy enough to give an immediate answer to the question .
