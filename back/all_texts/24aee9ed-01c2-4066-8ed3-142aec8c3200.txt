Bill Maher is all about telling it like it is, and that is just what he did on his New Rules segment of Friday night s edition of his HBO show Real Time.
First, the comedic host took the terrorists who are currently occupying the Malheur Wildlife Refuge in Oregon to task, and rightly pointed out that they really don t have a reason for being there.
He zeroed in on notorious anti-Muslim nutjob Jon Ritzheimer, who infamously filmed a hilarious goodbye video to his children, saying your daddy swore an oath, and that s why he can t be there.
Maher said of Ritzheimer and his video: Just listen here to one them, patriot Jon Ritzheimer, explaining to his kids in a video he posted from his truck, why he had to leave.
After playing a clip of Ritzheimer, Maher said: Wow, seems like a lot of trouble to go to just to get out of spending time with your family at the holidays Why not just drink like the rest of us.
The host then went on to mock the shopping list of supplies the Oregon militants were requesting from the public so that they can continue their lawless occupation of federal property indefinitely.Maher didn t stop, there, though.
After blasting the militants, he reminded those of us on the left that we have our own brand of crazy.
He played a clip of a Yale student s expletive-filled rant regarding offensive Halloween costumes at a professor that was trying to make an argument for free speech.While microaggressions and cultural appropriation are definitely a problem, there are people who go too far in their opposition to such things.
That kind of ranting behavior only makes the cause and its supporters look nuts, and makes everyone who shares the ideology lose credibility to seem just as crazy.In conclusion, Maher also pointed out that there s not much difference between the extremists of the two sides, and that s something everyone should think about, regardless of political ideology.Extremism in either direction just not a good thing.Watch the hilarious, and oh so true, clip below:Featured image: screen capture
