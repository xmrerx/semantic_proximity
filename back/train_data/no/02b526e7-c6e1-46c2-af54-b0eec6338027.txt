kirkuk , iraq ( reuters ) - a car bomb killed one person and injured ten in kirkuk , an iraqi oil city where local kurdish authorities plan to hold a referendum on independence despite opposition from the central government and the region s non-kurdish population .
the blast targeted a liquor store , according to a security source .
an iraqi interior ministry statement described the attack as terrorist aggression and did not link it to the tension caused by the kurdish plan to hold the vote , on sept. 25 .
kirkuk is home to sizeable arab and turkmen populations and lies outside the official boundaries of the kurdistan region .
it is claimed by both the kurds and the central government in baghdad .
kurdish peshmerga fighters seized kirkuk and other disputed territories when the iraqi army collapsed in the face of islamic state in 2014 , preventing its oilfields from falling into militant hands .
