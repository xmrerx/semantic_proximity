dubai ( reuters ) - bahrain s top shi ite muslim cleric underwent surgery on friday , activists said , after he was hospitalized following months under virtual house arrest .
news of ayatollah isa qassim s fragile health has stoked tension in bahrain as the sunni muslim-led monarchy pursues a crackdown on dissent by majority shi ites .
the leading shia cleric was transferred this morning at 7:30 am to ibn al-nafees hospital to undergo urgent surgery , the london-based bahrain institute for rights and democracy ( bird ) said in a statement .
upon his arrival , he went into surgery and he is expecting further operations .
qassim , who is believed to be in his 70s , was suffering constant pain and excreting blood , citing a groin hernia , diabetes and a form of heart disease , the group said on nov 27 .
the interior ministry said in june 2016 that qassim s citizenship had been revoked , accusing him of trying to divide bahraini society , encourage youths to violate the constitution and promote a sectarian environment in the gulf arab state .
the decision sparked angry protests in bahrain and drew sharp condemnation from regional shi ite power iran and statements of concern from the united states and britain .
in may , five people were killed when security forces raided qassim s homevillage to disperse followers .
the sunni-ruled kingdom where the u.s. fifth fleet is based has pursued a crackdown on members of the shi ite community since , with saudi help , it quashed 2011 arab spring protests calling for more rights and representation .
authorities have closed opposition political groupings , revoked dissidents passports and arrested suspected militants accused of being backed by its arch-foe , shi ite iran .
