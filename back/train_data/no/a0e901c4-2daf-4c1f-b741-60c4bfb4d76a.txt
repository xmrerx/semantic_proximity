donald trump has taken a beating on his favorite playground twitter from many notable individuals ( and multiple dictionaries ) , so the pope decided to try to reach the donald that way.pope francis has tried in every way possible to reach trump , including a direct inauguration-day message and multiple statements indirectly condemning the policies of our resident manchurian couch potato , all to no avail .
despite his best efforts , donald trump is still a useless , racist , xenophobe who hates the poor and anyone too brown or too muslimy for his small-minded world view .
recently , many of his holiness tweets seem to be directed at mr. trump .
i invite you not to build walls but bridges , to conquer evil with good , offence with forgiveness , to live in peace with everyone , pope francis posted on saturday , a clear reference to the big beautiful wall that will solve all of america s problems.i invite you not to build walls but bridges , to conquer evil with good , offence with forgiveness , to live in peace with everyone .
pope francis ( @ pontifex ) march 18 , 2017at around the time the white house announced the budget one that guts social programs like meals on wheels that are aimed at helping the disadvantaged was announced , the pope reminded everyone that people who actually follow the teachings of the bible love life , especially when it is weak and vulnerable .
of course , this could easily be a reference to the gop s ongoing effort to strip healthcare from our most poor and vulnerable.the word of god helps us to open our eyes to welcome and love life , especially when it is weak and vulnerable .
pope francis ( @ pontifex ) march 15 , 2017the prior day , pope francis reminded us to open our doors to the weak and poor .
let us pray for one another so that we may open our doors to the weak and poor .
pope francis ( @ pontifex ) march 14 , 2017naturally , people who call themselves christians are not happy with the pope : @ pontifex easier said than done when a society ( muslim ) wants to destroy anything christian ( and has ) .
