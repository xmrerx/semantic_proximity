planning is necessary and best done when they are still with us , she wrote to top clinton aide abedin .
as well , huma , i would make the same suggestion to you for her it will be a little different and once affirmed it will be very hard for someone to deny the type of ceremony she wanted as well i understand that the president can request certain arrangements for her that she/her rep can not ( ie if you want the motorcade to go through dc stop somewhere ) , marshall wrote in one email.she told the aides she needed to contact the military to prepare for the funerals as protocol has a lot to do with planning , notification etc .
