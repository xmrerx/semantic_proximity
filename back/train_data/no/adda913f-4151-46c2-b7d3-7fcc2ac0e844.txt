cnn anchor don lemon got snarky during reporting on republican karen handel s win in georgia s 6th district .
he made a claim that this is pretty much no big deal .
that s funny the democrats spent 50 million dollars and went all in on this election but are now downplaying or making excuses for the loss .
lemon should do his homework : donald trump won the 6th district by slim margins in the 2016 election .
this was a huge win for republicans ! https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=-hrjs0qwecilemon said , what s interesting is that , breaking news , a republican wins in georgia , it shouldn t be breaking news .
this is the way it should happen .
but the fact , david , that it was so close , at least it appeared in the polling and in the results , as well .
the results are actually really close .
he then asked , what does this say about the state of affairs , especially the trump is there a mandate for donald trump ?
will he keep his support ?
will it stay the same ?
are democrats looking at this as necessarily a loss , or they got close and maybe there s hope for them in the midterms ?
the democrat delusion continues
