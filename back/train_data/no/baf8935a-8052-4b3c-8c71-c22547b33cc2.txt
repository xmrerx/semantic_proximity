glasgow , scotland ( reuters ) - scotland s former first minister believes the independence movement has a three-year window after britain quits the european union to push again for seccession , despite the scottish national party s losses in an election in june .
salmond , who is still very influential in the movement , said the independence drive could be refreshed by proposing to join the european free trade association , which would give scotland european single market membership .
the snp lost a third of its seats in the national election , including salmond s own seat , in a sign of waning enthusiasm for another scottish independence referendum after the uncertainties thrown up by brexit .
despite that , support for independence itself has remained at the 45 percent level it was when it was voted down in 2014 and the snp still holds 35 of scotland s 59 seats in the westminster parliament .
salmond said brexit was proving to be disastrous for britain and would only end in humiliation .
scotland and northern ireland voted to keep eu membership while wales and most-populous england voted to leave at last year s referendum , straining the ties of the four-nation united kingdom .
so the snp were and are right about brexit , but as we found out to our cost in the election just being right does not necessarily make for popularity .
nor does it absolve us of a responsibility to attempt to create order out of chaos , he told a business for scotland annual dinner .
we have 18 months of brexit negotiations and after that perhaps a three-year period of transition to get our ducks in a row .
salmond said , in a speech peppered with jibes at the government s brexit talks , which have faltered in recent weeks .
he said that efta membership could be a prelude to full eu membership if necessary .
we have to offer something which is doable , feasible and speedily deliverable for the european connections of an independent scotland , he said ,
