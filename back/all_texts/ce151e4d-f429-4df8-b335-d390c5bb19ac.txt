UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The United States and Japan have requested that the United Nations Security Council meet on Wednesday to discuss North Korea s latest missile launch, diplomats said on Tuesday.
North Korea has been under U.N. sanctions since 2006 over its ballistic missiles and nuclear programs.
Typically, China and Russia view only a test of a long-range missile or a nuclear weapons as a trigger for further possible U.N. sanctions.
