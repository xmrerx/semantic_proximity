The takeaway from the first debate is that the FOX news moderators tried to pose gotcha questions and should have asked more substantive questions about the issues facing America.
It was disappointing to watch Megyn Kelly and Chris Wallace attack certain candidates and play favorites to others (RINO s).
If we didn t know better, we d almost believe FOX News had an agenda last night.
Hmmm What do you think?
