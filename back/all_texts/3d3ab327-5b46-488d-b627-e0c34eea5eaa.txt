WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch warned on Tuesday of dire consequences if Congress fails to repeal Obamacare, including the collapse of health insurance markets.
“Among other things, it means a congressional bailout of failing insurance markets, probably before the end of 2017,” Hatch said in a statement.
“Frankly, that ship may have sailed on that one after last night’s developments.
We’re probably looking at an insurance bailout one way or another.”
