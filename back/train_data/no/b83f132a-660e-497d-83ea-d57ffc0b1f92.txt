jakarta ( reuters ) - indonesia s constitutional court on tuesday affirmed the rights of devotees of faiths outside the country s officially recognized religions , in a move activists welcomed as a new chapter for religious freedom .against a backdrop of rising intolerance toward minorities in the world s largest muslim-majority nation , the court said indonesians would not be required to identify as either muslim , catholic , protestant , hindu , buddhist or confucian on their national identification cards.the ruling reviewed by reuters followed a legal challenge by followers of some of indonesia s indigenous faiths .
bonar tigor naipospos from the setara institute , a group that advocates for religious harmony , said indonesians who refused to embrace one of the regulated religions on their identity cards had limited access to education , restricted employment opportunities and were denied legal marriage .
the court recommended that a seventh , catch-all category be created - believers of the faith - for id cards .
this is a new chapter for religious freedom in indonesia for both government and followers of indigenous religions , naipospos said .
this is a door for the government to recognize their rights .
a spokesman for indonesia s president joko widodo could not immediately be reached for comment.indonesia s founding constitution says the state is based on the belief in the one and only god but guarantees each and every citizen the freedom of religion and worship .however , blasphemy laws passed in 1965 stipulated only six religions would be protected .
subsequent regulations and laws effectively enshrined those as the only religions recognized by the state .
the ruling ( on tuesday ) means the end of indonesia recognizing only six religions , said andreas harsono of human rights watch.in the 2000 census , about 400,000 people identified as holding beliefs outside the six main religions , although harsono said this probably underestimated the extent of believers in non-recognized faiths.across indonesia s vast chain of islands , more than 200 distinctive native faiths , such as the sundanese people s wiwitan , the dayak s kaharingan and the torajan s aluk to dolo survived even as buddhism , hinduism and islam dominated during different eras.its people also blended elements of the major religions over time and infused them with animist and mystical beliefs .
the court ruling should also apply to followers of non-indigenous religions such as baha i and judaism that are not formally recognized in indonesia , said nia sjarifudin of the unity in diversity alliance .
in recent decades , indonesia s reputation for tolerance has been tarnished as its unique syncretic form of islam has been challenged by more fundamentalist interpretations imported from the middle east.in the past year , an alliance of islamist hardliners pushed successfully for the imprisonment of then governor of jakarta basuki tjahaja purnama , an ethnic chinese christian , for insulting islam under the 1965 blasphemy laws.atheism is not legal in indonesia , and non-believers have also been charged with blasphemy .
