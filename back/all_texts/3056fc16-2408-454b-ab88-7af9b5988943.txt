I forgot oh, yeah That s an awfully hot coffee pot Should I drop it on Donald Trump?
Probably not But that s all I got til I come up with a solid plotGot a plan and now I gotta hatch it Like a damn Apache with a tomahawk Imma walk inside a mosque on Ramadan And say a prayer that every time Melania talks She gets a mou Ahh, Imma stopBut we better give Obama props Cause what we got in office now s a kamikaze That ll probably cause a nuclear holocaust And while the drama pops And he waits for s**t to quiet down, he ll just gas his plane up and fly around til the bombing stops Intensities heightened, tensions are risin Trump, when it comes to giving a s**t, you re stingy as I am Except when it comes to having the b***s to go against me, you hide em Cause you don t got the f**king n**s like an empty asylum Racism s the only thing he s fantastic for Cause that s how he gets his f**king rocks off and he s orangeYeah, sick tan That s why he wants us to disband Cause he cannot withstand The fact we re not afraid of Trump F**k walkin on egg shells, I came to stomp That s why he keeps screamin Drain the swamp Cause he s in quicksandIt s like we take a step forwards, then backwards But this is his form of distraction Plus, he gets an enormous reaction When he attacks the NFL so we focus on that Instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for NevadaAll these horrible tragedies and he s bored and would rather Cause a Twitter storm with the Packers Then says he wants to lower our taxes Then who s gonna pay for his extravagant trips Back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?
Same s**t that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered Then does it moreFrom his endorsement of Bannon Support for the Klansmen Tiki torches in hand for the soldier that s black And comes home from Iraq And is still told to go back to Africa Fork and a dagger in this racist 94-year-old grandpa Who keeps ignoring our past historical, deplorable factors Now if you re a black athlete, you re a spoiled little brat forTryina use your platform or your stature To try to give those a voice who don t have one He says, You re spittin in the face of vets who fought for us, you bastards!
Unless you re a POW who s tortured and battered Cause to him you re zeros Cause he don t like his war heroes capturedThat s not disrespecting the military F**k that!
This is for Colin, ball up a fist!
And keep that s**t balled like Donald the b**ch!
He s gonna get rid of all immigrants!
He s gonna build that thang up taller than this!
Well, if he does build it, I hope it s rock solid with bricks Cause like him in politics, I m using all of his tricks Cause I m throwin that piece of s**t against the wall til it sticks And any fan of mine who s a supporter of his I m drawing in the sand a line: you re either for or against And if you can t decide who you like more and you re split On who you should stand beside, I ll do it for you with this:F**k you!
The rest of America stand up We love our military, and we love our country But we f**king hate Trump
