addis ababa ( reuters ) - at least five people were killed in a town in ethiopia s restive oromiya region on thursday after police opened fire during a protest , witnesses said .
protesters had blocked the main road in ambo , some 130 km ( 80 miles ) west of the capital addis ababa , to demonstrate against sugar shortages , before police arrived to disperse the crowd .
they ( police ) then fired live rounds .
we know of ... five people who died from gunshot wounds , one of the protesters told reuters .
another witness said he saw up to 10 wounded people taken to hospital .
the regional government s spokesman confirmed that deaths had occurred , but did not give details .
demonstrations happening in ambo have resulted in death and injuries , addisu arega kitessa said in a facebook statement , adding that they were organized by enemies of the region .
the province was wracked by protests for months in 2015 and 2016 .
nearly 700 people were killed last year in one bout of unrest provoked by plans to implement a development scheme for addis ababa that opponents said amounted to a land grab , according to a parliament-mandated investigation .
broader anti-government demonstrations over politics and human rights abuse then followed , forcing the government to impose a nine-month state of emergency that was finally lifted in august .
separately , ethnic clashes killed at least 11 people this week in the same region .
another bout of violence along oromiya s border with the country s somali region last month displaced hundreds of thousands of people .
the developments highlight tensions in the country where the government has delivered high economic growth but it often accused of curbing political freedoms .
the government denies clamping down on free speech and blames rebel groups and dissidents abroad for stirring up violence .
