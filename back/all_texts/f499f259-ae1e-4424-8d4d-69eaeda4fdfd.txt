LONDON (Reuters) - It does not make sense for Britain to retain the European Union s Charter of Fundamental Rights after it leaves the bloc, Britain s Brexit minister David Davis said.
Parliament began debating legislation on Thursday to sever political, financial and legal ties with the EU, but the opposition Labour Party has said it cannot support the bill without it being amended to better protect workers rights.
We also do not believe it would make sense to retain the Charter of Fundamental Rights, Davis told parliament.
The charter only applies to member states when acting within the scope of EU law.
We will not be a member state nor will we be acting within the scope of EU law once we leave.
He added: The charter catalogues the rights found under EU law which will be brought into UK law by the bill.
It is not, and never was, the source of those rights.
