MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump left the Philippines on Tuesday without attending an annual East Asia Summit, due to delays in the schedule of the program of meetings.
Trump told reporters on Air Force One that he delivered his prepared remarks during a lunch with the leaders instead.
Secretary of State Rex Tillerson would attend Tuesday s summit in his place, a senior White House official said, adding the event was running too late.
The meetings in Manila were approximately 90 minutes behind schedule.
