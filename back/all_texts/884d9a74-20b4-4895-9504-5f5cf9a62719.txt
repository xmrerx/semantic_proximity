Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned, and Donald Trump has definitely pissed off women across the country.
His latest tweets aren t helping.During the 2016 campaign, Trump talked disparagingly about women and even got caught bragging about grabbing women by the genitals without their consent, which is sexual assault.
Since taking office, Trump has punished women by trying to defund Planned Parenthood, threatened funding for organizations that help women obtain an abortion, and trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act.Trump was furious over the Women s March on Washington and criticized it.
He also has few women in his Cabinet.
Only two, as a matter of fact.Oh, and here s ten straight minutes of the various times Trump has demeaned women.Overall, Trump has treated women like shit his entire life.
And on Wednesday morning, he had the gall to claim that he has tremendous respect for women in recognition of International Women s Day.I have tremendous respect for women and the many roles they serve that are vital to the fabric of our society and our economy.

BernadetteGiacomazzo (@berngiacomazzo) March 8, 2017@realDonaldTrump You respect women almost as much as ISIS does.

It is insulting for him to claim that respects women when he has repeatedly demonstrated that he has no respect for them whatsoever over the course of several decades.
He should be ashamed of himself.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
