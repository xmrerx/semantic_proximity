when columbia university s internal investigation of its chaplain for religious discrimination came up empty , an ex-employee went to the government .
a former employee of columbia s office of the university chaplain has alleged that they faced discrimination for their muslim faith in a complaint filed with the new york city commission on human rights last month.now the ivy league institution is facing fines up to $ 250,000 and could be ordered to reform its internal policies on religious accommodations , the columbia daily spectator reports.according to campus reform , the muslims on campus recently demanded a prayer space and a muslim advisor.the complaint charges that university chaplain jewelnel davis denied the employee s requests to work earlier shifts during ramadan instead increasing their workload during that time and reprimanded them for taking daily breaks to pray , all while * allowing similar accommodations for non-muslim employees .
* who else insists on praying 5 times a day during the workday ? when confronted about this behavior , davis allegedly responded that she was unused to accommodating such prayer breaks.columbia s employee policy states that it will accommodate any religious practices that doesn t place undue hardship on the university.does praying 5 times a day during the workday qualify as undue hardship ? we ve reported on somali muslims who tried to do the same thing in minnesota and colorado and failed .
work productivity is harmed greatly by taking so many breaks .
the muslims were fired from this company ! muslims fired after breaking ups rules file lawsuit claiming rules don t apply to themsomali muslims stage walkout on the job in protest of prayer dispute and then they got a dose of realitywe re hoping the policy isn t changed at columbia to accommodate these muslims .
