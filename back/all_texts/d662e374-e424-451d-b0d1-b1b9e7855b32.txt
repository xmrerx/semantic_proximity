I Haven t Had an Abortion, But I Wish I Had LENA DUNHAMActress Lena Dunham says she has never had an abortion, but wishes she had because it s a sign of bravery and self-knowledge.
I always thought that I myself didn t stigmatize abortion, Dunham says in the most recent episode of her podcast, titled Choice.
I m a uh abortion rights activist, it s a huge part of who I am, she added, but then said she had distanced herself from the issue of abortion in the past.She continued:But one day, when I was visiting a Planned Parenthood in Texas a few years ago, a young girl walked up to me and asked me if I d like to be a part of her project in which women share their stories of abortions.
I sort of jumped.
I haven t had an abortion, I told her.
I wanted to make it really clear to her that as much as I was going out and fighting for other women s options, I myself had never had an abortion.And I realized then that even I was carrying within myself stigma around this issue.
Even I, the woman who cares as much as anybody about a woman s right to choose, felt it was important that people know I was unblemished in this department.
So many people I love my mother, my best friends have had to have abortions for all kinds of reasons, Dunham said.
I feel so proud of them for their bravery, for their self-knowledge, and it was a really important moment for me then to realize I had internalized some of what society was throwing at us and I had to put it in the garbage.
Now I can say that I still haven t had an abortion, but I wish I had, she said.As Newsbusters notes, Dunham has now become an avid supporter of abortion.Read more: Breitbart
