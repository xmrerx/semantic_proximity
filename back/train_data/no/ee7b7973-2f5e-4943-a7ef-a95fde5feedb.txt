a recent poll showed that 40 % of black voters support donald trump .
the media is in full panic mode over the very real possibility that trump could win the general in a landslide .
the only hope they have of stopping him from winning with the black voter is by somehow effectively tying him to the kkk .
msnbc did their best to do just that in this ridiculous discussion where collectively , the hosts made 6 attempts to tie donald trump to the kkk in a span of 3.5 minutes .
lyin brian williams opened up the the segment with an immediate tie in to donald trump and the kkk.msnbc republican pundit , and fired host of the view , nicolle wallace mentioned the kkk in relationship to donald trump four times in less than 2 minutes , where she was actually part of the conversation : listen , i talked to folks today who ve been involved in previous presidential campaigns .
ken mehlman a former campaign director and former rnc director put out the and they put out the same message about the kkk .
i don t know that we ve ever gone into a super tuesday where someone was going to clinch the nomination on the heels of his kkk scandal .

but you can t do that if you re acting ambivalent about just how abhorrent the kkk endorsement would have been .
i think the party could grapple with a policy debate .
that s not what we re having .
we re having a wall-to-wall twenty-four-seven scandal where the speaker of the house and the senate majority leader has to go before cameras and disavow the kkk .
watch msnbc cut the sound off when black trump supporter tries to say we re all americans we need to stop the race stuff :
