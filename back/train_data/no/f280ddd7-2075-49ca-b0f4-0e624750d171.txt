berlin ( reuters ) - members of germany s social democrats ( spd ) will get to vote on any decision by the leadership of the center-left party to join a future coalition government , leader martin schulz said on friday .
there is nothing automatic about the direction we are moving in , schulz said .
if a discussion results in us deciding to participate in any form whatsoever in the formation of a government , we will put it to a vote of party members .
schulz made the remarks said during a brief news conference , shortly after the german president announced he would host a meeting next week with schulz and chancellor angela merkel to find a way out of a political impasse .
