anti-trumper and faux conservative jedediah bila rarely takes a position on anything that may be in contrast to her fellow leftist hosts .
in fact , if we didn t know better , we d almost think nbc gave her the job as their token conservative host to make the other dingbats appear to be correct , as they are never challenged by the trump hating host.the view co-host stepped out of her comfort zone and actually criticized fired fbi director james comey in the most recent episode .
while discussing the comey hearings in front of the us senate intelligence committee , bila referred to comey as a coward .
jedediah went on to mock comey s whiny testimony until not funny comedian joy behar reminded her that what she thinks of comey is irrelevent .
behar was finally correct about one thing .
sadly , what bila says is considered irrelevent to both the left and the right .
she rarely takes a position and when she does , it s such a weak position , it wasn t even worth the minimal effort she put forth.after a few minutes of defending her views on comey , the view hacks were left somewhat stunned when bila actually called out comey for going along with attorney general loretta lynch s suggestion to refer to hillary s case as a matter as opposed to an investigation .
bila s co-hosts wasted no time in attacking her .
whoopi quickly interjected and warned bila to not to muddy the waters , as they try to do .
bila should know by now not to question the all-knowing leftist dingbats of the view.watch :
