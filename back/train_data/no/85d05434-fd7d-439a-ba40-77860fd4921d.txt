the outspoken liberal comedian posed for a photo shoot with controversial photographer tyler shields in which she was seen holding a bloodied mask of president trump.donald trump was quick to condemn her on twitter : tmz later reported that 11-year old barron trump actually saw the image of his bloodied and decapitated father while watching tv.tmz reports : barron trump was watching tv & saw @ kathygriffin holding the severed head .
he thought it was his dad .
my heart is broken .
liz wheeler ( @ liz_wheeler ) may 31 , 2017melania trump weighed in on the horrific image her 11-yr old son was subjected to with this statement : as a mother , a wife , and a human being , that photo is very disturbing .
when you consider some of the atrocities happening in the world today , a photo opportunity like this is simply wrong and makes you wonder about the mental health of the person who did it .
it s a question a lot of comedians are asking themselves lately : what should comedy look like during the trump presidency ?
now more than ever we must absolutely go for all the absurdities , kathy griffin told vulture at the equality now gala tuesday night .
for me , that s trump and all things trump .
it s not about trying to be an equal-opportunity offender anymore because hillary got such a beat down .
it s his turn .
so i m happy to deliver beat down to donald trump and also to barron .
you know a lot of comics are going to go hard for donald , my edge is that i ll go direct for barron .
i m going to get in ahead of the game .
so , of course , griffin supported rosie o donnell when she tweeted a video asking if barron trump , 10-year-old son of donald and melania , was on the autism spectrum .
after the beat down he gave her , she can say whatever she wants to say to that piece of shit , griffin said before correcting herself .
oh , that s president piece of shit .
