brent bozell does political commentary on fox news .
he just put the hurt on fake conservative senator jeff flake with a great oped calling flake out for being a rino on behalf of my late father and my family , i am denouncing senator jeff flake and his new book , dishonestly titled , conscience of a conservative.since entering the senate in 2013 , jeff flake has , time and again , proven he is part of the indulgent hypocrisy in washington .
while he waxes poetically about conservative principles , his conservative review liberty score is an abysmal 53 % , also known as : f .
in 2013 , i watched first-hand as flake refused to sign a letter pledging to defund obamacare , among his many betrayals to conservatism .
jeff flake is neither a conservative nor does he have a conscience.as every conservative leader knows , my father , l. brent bozell , jr. , ghost-wrote conscience of a conservative for barry goldwater .
while the goldwater institute may own the rights to the book s title , neither the organization nor senator flake have the right to unjustifiably trade on my father s work .
conscience of a conservative is the greatest selling polemic in history , and senator flake is trading on its reputation to shamelessly promote himself and disguise his own conservative deficiencies .
my father would be appalled to see this fraud as the author of the so-called sequel , which it most certainly is not.the media need to know , when reporting on senator flake and his book , that the author is a deceiver out for personal and financial gain .
i also call on my conservative brethren to denounce this impostor , who dishonorably claims to speak for conservatism , in the strongest possible terms .
