in a press conference on thursday , president trump called out cnn as being not only fake but downright hateful and uninteresting.trump pointed out that the news would actually be more interesting to watch if the stories were real instead of all being a part of an attempt to discredit his administration.he freely admits to being flawed and making mistakes but says that the media should be focused on real stories instead turning to slander in order to get ratings.in a segment after the press conference , cnn s jake tapper proved president trump s point by calling the president unhinged and unfocused on real american needs .
tapper apparently missed the first part of this press conference , before the press battered him with questions about russia for half an hour.here s a segment of the press conference.and here is the hard hitting journalistic response by tapper .
