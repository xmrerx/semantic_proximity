tokyo ( reuters ) - tokyo governor yuriko koike on monday said she will lead a new national party that will challenge prime minister shinzo abe s ruling liberal democratic party ( ldp ) in a general election expected to be called for next month .
koike , who named her new political group the party of hope , has emerged as a serious threat to abe after she won the tokyo governorship a year ago and in july fielded candidates who routed the ldp in elections for the metropolitan assembly .
i want the japanese people to believe that there is hope for tomorrow , she said at a televised press conference .
our ideal is to proceed free of special interests , she added .
koike is an ex-defense minister and former ldp member , and the challenge to her old party could pose a greater risk for abe , who is expected to call a snap election for next month .
abe is benefiting from improved ratings and opposition disarray , but should he suffer a big loss of seats it could spur a challenge to his leadership from within the ldp .
a weekend survey by the nikkei business daily showed 44 percent of voters will back abe s ldp with only 8 percent supporting the main opposition democratic party .
