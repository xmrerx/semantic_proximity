This is priceless!
President Trump just gave the best response ever to a reporter s question!
He said he wanted to thank Russian President Vladimir Putin for reducing his payroll by firing U.S. embassy staff in Moscow.
Hysterical and so quick!
Watch how Trump doesn t skip a beat with his response:After Sanctions on Russia were put in place in July, Putin ordered 755 embassy personnel out of Russia.President Trump was asked today during a press conference what he thought of the firing.
His response was quick and decisive.
He said he wanted to thank Putin for the firing: No.
I want to thank him, because we re trying to cut down on payroll.
And as far as I m concerned, I m very thankful that he let go of a large number of people because now we have a smaller payroll.
He continued: There s no real reason for them to go back.
So I greatly appreciate the fact that they have been able to cut our payroll for the United States.
We ll save a lot of money.
AWESOME!
