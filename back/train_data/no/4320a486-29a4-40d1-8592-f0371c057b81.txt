kabul ( reuters ) - the afghan taliban said on monday that kevin king , one of two professors from the american university of afghanistan who were kidnapped in kabul last year , is seriously ill and needs urgent medical attention .
taliban spokesman zabihullah mujahid said king , an american , was suffering from dangerous heart disease and kidney problems .
his illness has intensified , his feet have swollen and sometimes he becomes unconscious and his condition worsens every day , mujahid said in a statement .
we have tried to treat him time to time but we do not have medical facilities as we are in a war situation , he said .
the u.s. state department called for the immediate and unconditional release of king and other hostages .
king and his australian colleague timothy weeks were kidnapped in august 2016 as they were returning to their compound in the afghan capital .
afghan and western officials believe the men are being held by the haqqani network , a militant group affiliated with the taliban that has carried out many other kidnappings .
they acknowledge that an unsuccessful rescue attempt was made in eastern afghanistan months after the two were taken .
the taliban statement came around two weeks after pakistani troops rescued canadian joshua boyle and his american wife caitlan coleman from an area near the afghan border .
they had been held by the haqqanis since being kidnapped in 2012 .
earlier this year , the taliban released a video of king and weeks showing them pleading with their governments to release taliban prisoners in turn for their freedom .
kidnapping high profile targets has become a lucrative business for the taliban and other militant groups in afghanistan who in return often demand huge ransom or release of their members .
