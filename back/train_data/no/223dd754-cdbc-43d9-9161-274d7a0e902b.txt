san diego ( reuters ) - u.s .
senator mark kirk on wednesday introduced legislation that would give the pentagon more flexibility in funding electronic warfare programs and speed often sluggish acquisition times .
current acquisition rules make it tough for the u.s. military to quickly procure and field electronic warfare weapons systems before they are overtaken by developments around the world .
kirk , an illinois republican and retired naval intelligence officer , said the bill would help the u.s. military accelerate work on electronic warfare weapons and stay ahead of other countries that are rapidly developing their own capabilities .
“ it is critical our military dominate the offensive and defensive ends of electronic warfare , ” kirk said in a statement .
“ the need for enhanced electronic capabilities is even more pronounced on today ’ s battlefield. ” senator kristen gillibrand , a new york democrat , is co-sponsoring the bill .
the bill would amend the fiscal 2016 defense policy bill to include electronic warfare , or ew , under the pentagon ’ s rapid acquisition authority ( raa ) program .
that program lets program managers waive some acquisition rules to more quickly field technology .
it would also allow the department to use different contract types , including those used for commercial items , when it buys ew weapons .
the bill also includes directives for the pentagon ’ s new joint electronic warfare executive committee , which is headed by air force general paul selva , vice chairman of the joint chiefs of staff , according to a kirk aide .
the bill directs the committee to provide a strategic plan for the services to work together on electronic warfare systems , and tackle acquisition and budget processes , bolster training , fill capability gaps and advance offensive capabilities .
kirk is expected to discuss the legislation during a visit to a northrop grumman corp facility in rolling meadows , il .
on friday , the aide said .
