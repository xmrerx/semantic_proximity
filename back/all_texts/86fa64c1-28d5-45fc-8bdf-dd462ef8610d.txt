Sunlight is the best disinfectant That s why we think we can t get enough of the evidence coming out about corrupt FBI agents who took it upon themselves to try and destroy Trump.The Daily Caller reports:South Carolina Rep. Trey Gowdy said Tuesday that FBI agent Peter Strzok s anti-Trump text messages show an unprecedented level of bias you rarely see from FBI officials.In particular, he was asked about a cryptic message that Strzok sent in Aug. 2016 to FBI lawyer Lisa Page referring to an insurance policy that appears to refer to the FBI s investigation of the Trump campaign.
I want to believe the path you threw out for consideration in Andy s office that there s no way [Trump] gets elected but I m afraid we can t take that risk.
It s like an insurance policy in the unlikely event you die before you re 40, reads the Aug. 15, 2016 text message.
He s in the middle of major investigations, he said of Strzok, adding, Thank God he s gone, but I want to know how the hell he got there in the first place.
We say Amen to that!
