If there s one conclusion to draw from the horrific shootings that have been happening over the course of this past week, it s that we, as a society, need to have more understanding and compassion for one another.
No one deserves to die, especially not for merely existing, or protecting your community.Two black men were shot and killed by police officers who didn t even try to keep them alive for reasons yet to be determined, and five police officers were shot and killed, with seven more injured while serving and protecting protesters who were out voicing their concern over police brutality.Many have been offering their opinions on the violence that s been happening, but one voice of reason seems to really get at the heart of what needs to be heard, and that is the voice of Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-MA).The simple, yet solid truth of all the killings that have occurred over the past week was summed up in this tweet by Warren: Black Americans shouldn t be killed in routine traffic stops, and police shouldn t be killed while protecting and serving their communities.
Black Americans shouldn't be killed in routine traffic stops, & police shouldn't be killed while protecting & serving their communities.
Elizabeth Warren (@SenWarren) July 8, 2016It s really that simple.
We can be on both sides of this issue and not be against the other side.
We can have compassion for the rights of Black Americans to exist without fear of being shot and killed by the police, and we can also have compassion for police officers who are merely trying to protect the community they serve.We need to stand up to and against violence wherever it is, period.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
