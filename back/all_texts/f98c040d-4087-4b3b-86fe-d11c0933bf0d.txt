It s hard to tell what these Black Lives Matter crybabies hate more gays with a different opinion than them or free speech Meanwhile, security guards that were hired and paid by the speaker stood by passively as they threatened and berated the guys who were paying them Milo Yiannopoulos event at DePaul University had to be cut short Tuesday night after protesters stormed the stage, blew whistles, grabbed the microphone out of the interviewer s hand, and threatened to punch Yiannopoulos in the face.Yiannopoulos attempted to continue the event, but protesters refused to leave the stage and the group of security guards (which DePaul forced both the organisers and Breitbart to pay for) refused to intervene.The male ringleader continued to pace along the stage with his whistle, refusing to let Yiannopoulos speak for extended amounts of time, while the female ringleader forcibly snatched the microphone from the interviewer s hand and shouted at Yiannopoulos just inches away from his face.It turns out the male who threatened Milo is a minister at a local church:https://twitter.com/Nero/status/735325590438481920The good Minister following in the foot prints of Reverend Al Sharpton tried the same tactics at a Donald Trump and bragged about it on Twitter:The guy that tried to silence @Nero tonight did the same to @realDonaldTrump I hope Soros got his money's worth.

When security refused to intervene, Yiannopoulos posed for pictures with fans in the audience, and ordered the crowd to follow him to the college president s office..@nero brought the party outside after inaction from spineless cops pic.twitter.com/0ZjljPHAp8 Furby.jpg (@duckspeakeasy) May 24, 2016Responding to the amount of black female protesters who had turned up, Yiannopoulos hypothesized that it was because he had sex with their brothers.
