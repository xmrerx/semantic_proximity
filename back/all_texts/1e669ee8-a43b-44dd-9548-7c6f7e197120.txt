WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland is currently seen as a force for disintegration of the European Union (EU) and hence it is important to end the destruction of Warsaw s reputation, European Council President Donald Tusk said on Wednesday.
Poland is perceived today as a disintegrating force in this part of Europe and this is why I believe that it is important to end this devastation (...) of Poland s reputation, Tusk told local media, commenting on European Commission s decision to launch Article 7 procedure against Warsaw.
Tusk also said he did not expect sanctions to be imposed on Poland in the near future.
