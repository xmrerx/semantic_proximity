The Police Union came out almost immediately after the Mosby press conference today with a response against her assessment of the Freddie Gray Case.
They are fighting back against the claim that the 6 officers did anything wrong during the arrest and transport of Mr. Gray.Fraternal Order of Police lodge is asking Baltimore State s Attorney Marilyn Mosby to appoint a special prosecutor to the Freddie Gray investigation because of her personal connection to the Gray family s attorney, William H. Billy Murphy Jr., and her marriage to a city councilman.
Not one of the officers involved in this tragic situation left home in the morning with the anticipation that someone with whom they interacted would not go home that night, the letter states.
As tragic as this situation is, none of the officers involved are responsible for the death of Mr. Gray.
Ryan requests that Mosby appoint a Special Independent Prosecutor.
I have very deep concerns about the many conflicts of interest presented by your office conducting an investigation in this case, the letter states.
These conflicts include your personal and professional relations with Gray family attorney, William Murphy, and the lead prosecutor s connections with members of the local media, the letter states.
Based on several nationally televised interviews, these reporters are likely to be witnesses in any potential litigation regarding this incident.
