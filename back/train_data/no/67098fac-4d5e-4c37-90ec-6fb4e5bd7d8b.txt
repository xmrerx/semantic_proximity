in the wake of tom koppel telling sean hannity to his face that he is bad for america , eric trump came to the fox news host s rescue .
eric trump , who has never served in the military just like his father and sean hannity , declared on fox and friends that there is no better patriot in the world than sean hannity .
adding , i think he s just a great , great man .
he said that beliefs are what get america to a great place .
he has strong beliefs , eric trump said .
and you know , beliefs are what get america to a great place , beliefs on quite frankly , both sides of the aisle .
he then demonized the tolerant left , saying that they re very tolerant until they disagree with you .
watch : there s no better patriot in the world than @ seanhannity .

literally any member of the military-active , reserve or vet-is a better patriot .

vaishali deshpande ( @ valdeshpande ) march 28 , 2017sean hannity s net worth is about $ 80 million .
he lives a lavish lifestyle , owning several homes , each worth millions .
but yeah , hannity is more of a patriot than a man or woman who puts their lives on the line to protect our country and for very little pay .
eric trump is a trophy hunter and he probably thinks he s a brave patriot , too.the two have much in common .
both of them will justify anything alleged president donald trump does , even if he marched into a high school and opened fire.in response to his interview with mr. koppel , hannity tweeted that it was fake edited news , because of course he did.hannity is no patriot .
those that served in the military must be cringing right now .
donald trump s son just threw them under the bus for a wealthy fox news host who has been sucking up to the amateur president on his show while calling liberals snowflakes .
by the way , sean , 2016 called and they want that ineffective word back.an interesting tidbit about koppel : the legendary journalist s jewish parents fled germany following the rise of adolf hitler and nazism.image : screen capture with added tweets .
