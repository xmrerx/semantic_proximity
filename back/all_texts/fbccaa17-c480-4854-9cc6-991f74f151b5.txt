As there is more and more demand by politicians and Electoral College electors for a bipartisan investigation into Russia s involvement in the 2016 election, our President-elect has very conveniently decided to go into hiding.According to Bloomberg, Trump is unable to handle the heat and rising suspicions so he has canceled his first press conference since his undeserved win.
Bloomberg said: President-elect Donald Trump is postponing until next month a previously announced news conference to outline how he ll handle his far-flung business operations while in the White House, according to senior Trump transition officials.Trump had planned to make the announcement Dec. 15 but wants more time because he s been occupied with filling out his cabinet and top administration posts, according to the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss internal deliberations.
He s preparing to reveal his choice for secretary of state as soon as Tuesday, they said.
First of all, all you need to do is look at Trump s Twitter history to know that he hasn t been SO swamped with his cabinet appointments to have a press conference after all, he still has time to insult people on social media and attend his victory tour rallies!
This is merely the pathetic excuse Trump s advisors are using to prevent Trump from screwing up even more before the Electoral College has to vote on him in a few days.
And of course, Trump s team recognizes that having a press conference where Trump is supposed to address his conflicts of interests and business issues is probably not a good idea right now.The cancellation of this contest marks another first for Trump he s the first President-elect since 1978 who has not held a press conference after winning the election.
In fact, Trump hasn t done any press conferences since July and ironically he invited Russia to hack Hillary Clinton and leak her emails during that press conference.
Not suspicious at all, Trump!Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images
