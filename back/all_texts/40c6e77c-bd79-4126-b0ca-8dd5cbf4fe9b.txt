Donald Trump s statements are frightening to those who see the danger of his rise and his antics are certainly theatrical.
Maybe that s why he fits in perfectly in this amazing Game of Thrones mashup clip.Watch Video Here: [youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I0tE6T-ecmg]His face, along with quotes from his speeches and interviews, is cut into a mashup of the HBO hit drama as the viewer gets a sense of both the hilarity as well as the absurdity that is Donald Trump.
It seems that Trump fits in quite well in the Seven Kingdoms.
Produced by Australian satirist Huw Parkinson, the video begins with Trump turning away Daenerys Targaryen from the city of Quarth.Trump later attacks Pope Francis for criticizing him and complimented himself, saying he was a nice guy.
He also said that he s going to build a massive wall and negotiates with Littefinger.Although the video is entertaining, it also sends a strong message about both the absurdity and the danger that is Trump.
If his current stances on everything from banning Muslims to attacking Mexican immigrants are backed up with actual power by winning the presidency, then he ll not only be a danger to those communities, but will bring to power all of the racists that have backed him thus far, making America quite a dangerous place.
