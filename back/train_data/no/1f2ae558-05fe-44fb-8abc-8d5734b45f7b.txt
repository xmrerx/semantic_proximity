salerno , italy ( reuters ) - italy held a mass funeral on friday for 26 young nigerian women who drowned while trying to cross the mediterranean sea .
a roman catholic bishop and a muslim imam both said prayers at the simple ceremony in the southern city of salerno , with 26 wooden coffins laid out on a stone dais .
a single white rose was placed on the lid of each .
just two of the women were identified .
it is very likely that these girls were victims of trafficking for sexual exploitation , said federico soda , director un migration agency iom for the mediterranean .
a recent iom report had estimated that 80 percent of nigerian girls arriving in italy by sea might be trafficking victims .
the 26 bodies were retrieved from the sea on nov. 3 by a spanish rescue ship , while some 64 people were unaccounted for and feared lost , bringing the total dead to around 90 , said flavio di giacomo , an iom spokesman .
survivors found on nearby rubber boats said the women were all nigerian and had left libya hoping to make it to italy .
the only two identified were named as marian shaka , who was married , and osato osaro .
both were pregnant .
some of those who died were believed to have been as young as 14 .
almost 115,000 migrants , mainly african men , have reached italy so far this year , according to government data released on friday , against just over 167,000 in the same period last year .
iom said at least 2,925 people died trying to cross the mediterranean from jan 1.-nov. 5 against 4,302 last year .
the italian government has worked with libyan authorities to block migrants from leaving the north african state , leading to a sharp fall in new arrivals since the summer .
the government says its policy has cut the number of sea deaths , while critics say it has left thousands of refugees and migrants trapped in appalling conditions in libya .
