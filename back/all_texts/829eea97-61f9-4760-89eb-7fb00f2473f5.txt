A week ago, Susan Sarandon attended the 2016 SAG awards looking absolutely fabulous.
She proudly wore an outfit that showed off her cleavage because she s Susan Sarandon and she doesn t care what you think.
The internet promptly melted down in worship at the sight of this feminist icon doing what she does.
But a few days later, Piers Morgan inexplicably took issue with Sarandon s wardrobe choice on twitter:Would Susan Sarandon wear this to a funeral?
No.
It was thus horribly inappropriate for an In Memoriam tribute.

I m not entirely sure why the sight of cleavage in public places offends some people and I understand even less why they think anyone cares about their opinion on the matter.Still, Sarandon decided to tease Morgan and sent out the following Time Warp:Today s #TBT is dedicated to @piersmorgan.

Their solution to the problem?

They re only scandalous because we ve been conditioned to think that way.
Sarandon clearly didn t think it was inappropriate and there s exactly zero reason she, or any other woman, should be beholden to anyone else s prudishness.Featured image via twitter.
