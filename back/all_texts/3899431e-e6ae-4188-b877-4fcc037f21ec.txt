BERLIN (Reuters) - German Vice Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel on Wednesday called Donald Trump’s U.S. election victory a warning for Germany and Europe, urging policy makers to listen more closely to people’s concerns.
“Trump is the pioneer of a new authoritarian and chauvinist international movement.
He is also a warning for us,” Gabriel told German newspaper group Funke Mediengruppe in an interview.
“Our country and Europe must change if we want to counter the authoritarian international movement,” Gabriel said.
