With 28 days left to go until election day, a new poll from NBC/Wall Street Journal, a gold-standard in polling, shows Hillary Clinton posting an unprecedented double-digit lead over Donald Trump.The first major poll since the revelations exposed in a recent audio leak in which he boasted about sexually assaulting women by grabbing their genitals without consent shows that not only has Clinton posted a 14 point lead in a head-to-head contest, she has opened up an 11-point lead in the four-way race with the Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and the Green Party s nominee, Jill Stein.Because of Trump s admission to sexually assaulting women doesn t bode well for voters, the House is now in play something that no one, just one week ago, thought would be possible.
Forty-nine percent of voters want to see a Democratic Congress while 42 percent want to see a GOP Congress.
That s a three point uptick for Democrats.Forty-one percent of voters called the tapes completely unacceptable and 52 percent said it should be an issue in the campaign.While Republicans try desperately to write it off as simple locker room talk, the electorate isn t buying it and they are actually, reasonably so, disgusted by it.The poll also shows that Clinton has opened up a 21 point lead with women.
That is a nine point difference than it was in mid-September when it was a smaller (yet still significant) 12 point lead.Remember: John McCain lost the female vote by 13 points, and Mitt Romney lost by 11.
Both times women made up 53 percent of the total electorate.
You can t lose female voters this bigly and win a national election.If Trump continues to lose by a whopping 21 points, he s absolutely done.With future tapes on the horizon, the Trump campaign has pretty much run out of time.
Republicans are abandoning him, the electorate is abandoning him, and his campaign is crashing and burning.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images
