michelle obama told oprah winfrey in her final interview as our divisive first lady , now we re feeling what not having hope feels like .
sadly , for michelle obama hope for her is strictly based skin color .
when her husband barack obama was being received like a rock-star across america ( by mostly white supporters ) , she admitted that she suddenly found herself feeling pride in america for the first time in her adult life .
now that donald j. trump is about to become our next president , she openly admits to oprah that she s lost all hope .
michelle has spent much of her 8 years as first lady speaking about and obsessing over skin color .
many of the accusations she s made about white people in america are inaccurate and divisive , yet she curiously depicts herself as a victim during her interview with oprah where she whines that americans accuse her of being , an angry black woman .
michelle never bothers to acknowledge that her hateful , racist rhetoric has helped to earn that title , and not the color of her skin.trump responded beautifully to her implied criticism of him by saying , i assume she was talking about the past and not the future .
i actually think she made that statement not meaning it the way it came out .
ironically , trump actually stepped up and saved her from making herself look like , an angry black woman .
