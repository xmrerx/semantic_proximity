BEIRUT (Reuters) - The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitoring group said on Monday that air strikes on a market had killed at least 29 people in a rebel-held area of northwest Syria.
Three air raids hit the town of Atareb, west of the city of Aleppo, the Britain-based observatory said.
It said the death toll was likely to rise.
Atareb is inside what is known as a de-escalation zone under a deal agreed between Turkey, Russia and Iran to reduce violence in the area.
