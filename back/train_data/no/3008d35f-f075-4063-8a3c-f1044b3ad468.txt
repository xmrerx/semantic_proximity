london ( reuters ) - britain ’ s interior minister said u.s. republican presidential candidate donald trump was “ just plain wrong ” to say that muslims in britain were failing to report suspicious activity by extremists .
“ i understand he said that muslims were not coming forward in the united kingdom to report matters of concern .
this is absolutely not the case - he is just plain wrong , ” theresa may said in britain ’ s parliament .
earlier on wednesday , trump said in an interview with britain ’ s itv television that it was “ a disgrace ” that one of the suspects behind last november ’ s attacks in paris had been found in an area of brussels where he lived .
he also said people in the muslim community in california had known in advance about an attack that killed 14 people in december .
