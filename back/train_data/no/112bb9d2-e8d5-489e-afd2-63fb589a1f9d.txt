the most crooked person to ever run for president the obama administration is moving to dismiss charges against an arms dealer it had accused of selling weapons that were destined for libyan rebels.lawyers for the justice department on monday filed a motion in federal court in phoenix to drop the case against the arms dealer , an american named marc turi , whose lawyers also signed the motion.the deal averts a trial that threatened to cast additional scrutiny on hillary clinton s private emails as secretary of state , and to expose reported central intelligence agency attempts to arm rebels fighting libyan leader moammar qadhafi.government lawyers were facing a wednesday deadline to produce documents to turi s legal team , and the trial was officially set to begin on election day , although it likely would have been delayed by protracted disputes about classified information in the case.a turi associate asserted that the government dropped the case because the proceedings could have embarrassed clinton and president barack obama by calling attention to the reported role of their administration in supplying weapons that fell into the hands of islamic extremist militants .
they don t want this stuff to come out because it will look really bad for obama and clinton just before the election , said the associate.in the dismissal motion , prosecutors say discovery rulings from u.s. district court judge david campbell contributed to the decision to drop the case .
the joint motion asks the judge to accept a confidential agreement to resolve the case through a civil settlement between the state department and the arms broker .
our position from the outset has been that this case never should have been brought and we re glad it s over , said jean-jacques cabou , a perkins coie partner serving as court-appointed defense counsel in the case .
mr turi didn t break the law .we re very glad the charges are being dismissed .
under the deal , turi admits no guilt in the transactions he participated in , but he agreed to refrain from u.s.-regulated arms dealing for four years .
a $ 200,000 civil penalty will be waived if turi abides by the agreement.a state department official confirmed the outlines of the agreement .
mr. turi cooperated with the department s directorate of defense trade controls in its review and proposed administrative settlement of the alleged violations , said the official , who asked not be named .
based on a compliance review , ddtc alleged that mr. turi engaged in brokering activities for the proposed transfer of defense articles to libya , a proscribed destination under [ arms trade regulations , ] despite the department s denial of requests for the required prior approval of such activities .
turi adviser robert stryk of the government relations and consulting firm spg accused the government of trying to scapegoat turi to cover up clinton s mishandling of libya .
the u.s. government spent millions of dollars , went all over the world to bankrupt him , and destroyed his life all to protect hillary clinton s crimes , he said , alluding to the deadly sept. 11 , 2012 terrorist attack on the u.s. consulate in benghazi , libya.read more : politico
