While delivering the closing remarks at Tuesday s Professional Business Women of California conference in San Francisco, Hillary Clinton couldn t resist the urge to tell Team Trump to go f*ck themselves for their treatment of women.
Just look at all that s happened in the last few days to women who were simply doing their jobs, Clinton told the crowd, cutting into White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer for the condescending attitude he had toward a reporter who shook her head as Spicy lied to her: April Ryan, a respected journalist with unrivaled integrity, was doing her job just this afternoon in the White House press room when she was patronized and cut off trying to ask a question.
Clinton also took aim at Trump ally, Fox News host Bill O Reilly, for his insanely racist joke about a black congresswoman s hair: One of our own California congressmen Maxine Waters was taunted with a racist joke about her hair.
Too many women, especially women of color, have had a lifetime of practice taking precisely these kinds of indignities in stride.
But why should we have to?
Clinton asked rhetorically.
And any woman who thinks this couldn t be directed at her is living in a dream world.
This administration s treatment of women, Muslims, people of color, anyone whose skin color is darker than a fresh piece of classroom chalk, and people in general, is abysmal.Clinton warned us this would happen.
