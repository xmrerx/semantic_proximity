Donald Trump will be the next president.

His Oval Office meeting with Trump: Probably the most important point that I made was that how you staff, particularly the chief of staff, the national security adviser, the White House counsel that s something that has to be attended to right away, he said.
I think it s important to give him the room and the space to do that.
