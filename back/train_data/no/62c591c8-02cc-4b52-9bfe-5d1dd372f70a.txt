dublin ( reuters ) - irish prime minister leo varadkar said he would prefer to hold a referendum on easing the country s abortion laws next may in june in order to maximize the number of students who can vote .
the government promised last week to hold a referendum in may or june on loosening of some of the strictest abortion laws in the world , and will decide in the coming months exactly what question to put to the irish people .
as many irish students spend the summer months traveling or working overseas , pro-choice activists have warned that holding the vote in june would effectively mean disenfranchising thousands of young voters .
it is very much my preference that the referendum should be held in may , rather than june , so that we can maximize the number of people that can take part in it , varadkar told parliament .
that makes sense .
i ve met student groups and i have said that to them .
abortion remains a divisive issue in once stridently catholic ireland , where a complete ban on the procedure was only lifted in 2013 to allow terminations in cases where the mother s life was in danger .
tens of thousands of people marched in dublin on saturday to demand a more liberal regime , closer to that of england , which allows terminations to be carried out up to 24 weeks after conception .
thousands of irish women travel to england for abortions each year .
anti-abortion supporters demand no further changes to the law .
opinion polls show a large majority of voters want some change .
