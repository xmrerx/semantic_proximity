washington ( reuters ) - the son of a russian lawmaker accused of stealing credit card data and other personal information has pleaded guilty in two criminal cases stemming from a probe into a $ 50 million online identity theft scheme , the u.s. justice department said on friday .
roman seleznev , 33 , the son of russian parliament member valery seleznev , pleaded guilty to one count of participating in a racketeering scheme , and another count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud .
the charges were filed in federal courts in nevada and georgia , and the plea deal for both cases was finalized on thursday .
in april , seleznev was sentenced to 27 years in prison by a federal court in washington for his role in a cyber assault involving hacking into point of sale computers to steal credit card numbers .
he was arrested in the maldives and brought to the united states to face charges .
the russian government has previously criticized the arrest , calling it an unlawful kidnapping .
seleznev s attorney , igor litvak , said his client accepts responsibility for his role in the two cyber cases settled on thursday , but that he intends to appeal his conviction stemming from the third separate washington case .
we still feel the way he was brought to the u.s. was illegal , litvak told reuters .
he was basically kidnapped .
the nevada and georgia cases involved a credit card fraud ring known as carder.su , an internet-based network used by criminals who trafficked stolen credit card data .
in pleading guilty , seleznev admitted he got involved with the ring in january 2009 and sold compromised credit card data to others on the network .
he also admitted to serving as a casher by working with other hackers to defraud an atlanta company that helped process credit and debit card transactions .
that scheme ultimately let the hackers steal 45.5 million debit card numbers and withdraw $ 9.4 million from atms in 280 cities .
