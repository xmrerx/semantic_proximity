This presidential election has been bringing everyone out of the woodwork to reveal their opinions on who is running.
Especially in regards to Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump.One person who seems to be abundantly clear about his opinion on Trump is former Tonight Show host Jay Leno.
Sitting down with The Hollywood Reporter, Leno revealed, in so many words, that Trump needs to have some sense knocked into him, and maybe, just maybe, he d be a better person for it.Leno told The Hollywood Reporter: I think this is the problem with Donald Trump.
I don t think anybody has just ever beaten the crap out of him, so he has this attitude of whatever.
When you have the crap beat out of you, you learn how to negotiate, you learn how to deal with people.
You learn that kindness is the greatest virtue you can have.I know people that say Shut the f ing door and I know people who say Is it cold in here?
If you say Is it cold in here?
someone will shut the door for you, and you haven t annoyed anybody or pissed anybody off.
And that s my attitude about life, just trying to be kind.When you are poor it s easy to be kind.
When you are rich and famous, it s not that it s hard to be kind, but it s harder because people suddenly start catering to your eccentricities or whatever it might be.
And that s just the thing, Trump seems to have never been in a situation in his life where he s been forced to be kind.
He s so used to everyone bending over backwards to please him, that he doesn t seem to think that he actually should be kind to others in return.
This would definitely explain his bully behavior, and how he feels so entitled to pretty much everything, including the White House.Note: This article in no way is suggesting that Trump should be harmed.
