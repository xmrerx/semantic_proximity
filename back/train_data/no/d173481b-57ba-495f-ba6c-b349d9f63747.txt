he got a big surprise however , when a pro-trump , pro-american biker caught a glimpse of the burning american flag.watch video below : https : //twitter.com/ten_gop/status/858700002654388224an iowa city press-citizen photographer captured the incident in which matt uhrin used a fire extinguisher to put out the blaze before taking the flag from protesters .
