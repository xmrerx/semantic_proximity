An Oregon judge has had enough of the hillbilly Bundy militia and is now saying that he plans to bill the leader, Ammon Bundy, up to $70,000 a day for security costs.The armed takeover of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge by the anti-government group has caused major disruptions in Harney County, and it doesn t seem like the merry band of imbeciles plan to leave anytime soon.
According to reports, the group has used federal equipment to remove fences that separated the federal property from a local rancher.In addition to the damage they have caused on the property, the militants forced 800 kids to miss a week of school because the school board was worried about the safety of students.Police also report that they have had to relocate the U.S. Department of Fish and Wildlife employees from their homes out of an abundance of caution because the group possibly found out their personal information.
The group has been accused of illegally accessing the government computers in the building.
Reporters with Oregon Public Radio claim that they say the computers on screensaver mode and a list of social security numbers out on the desks.Harney County Judge Steve Grasty spoke at a town hall meeting on Monday night and said that the militia is costing taxpayers between $60,000 to $70,000 a day.
We re going to send Mr. Bundy the bill, said Grasty.It s ironic that this group of jackasses, who claim to love the citizens of this country, are wasting taxpayer dollars every single day with this nonsense.
Tea Party Republicans claim to be fiscally responsible and then waste $700,000.
What s even worse is that GOP lawmakers are supporting the continued occupation of federal land and that is costing Harney County so much money.
While these lawmakers encourage this behavior, they actively deny all sorts of social programs to low-income families because they claim that we cannot afford it.
Seems legit, right?
