Bernie s combination of calling it like it is, and his tendency to get pissed off a little easily at Republicans often results in some epic smackdowns being delivered by him.
One of these gems came up again during a Democratic town hall event hosted by CNN.Bernie started to talk about the unprecedented decision by Republicans to essentially cut Obama s final term short to only 3 years by blocking ANY effort at nominating a 9th SCOTUS judge following the death of Antonin Scalia.
However, rather than act like it s some kind of new thing, he avoided the rhetoric and called it exactly what it is.It s just the latest link in a very long and unbroken chain of choices made by Republicans to disrespect, delegitimize, and smear the legacy of the first black President of the United States.
Yes, Republicans would love to get a SCOTUS judge installed if they can delay until after the election.
However, they tip their hand too easily in how they attack Obama compared to other Democrats like Bernie.Pointing out a glaring fact, Bernie mentioned that his father came from Poland yet nobody has asked where HIS birth certificate is.
It s so obvious yet no Republican even realizes it.
Bernie has just as much of a reason to have his citizenship questioned as President Obama, yet it never occurred to a single Republican to do it.
As he said, there s one obvious reason, which he mentions in the video clip.Watch Bernie end the discussion on why Republicans are such incredible idiots below: // < !
