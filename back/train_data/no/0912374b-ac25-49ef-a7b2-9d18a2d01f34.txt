beijing ( reuters ) - china has comprehensively implemented united nations sanctions on north korea , a spokesman for the ministry of commerce said on thursday .
commerce ministry spokesman gao feng told reporters in beijing that u.n. sanctions gave a cushioning or buffer period for implementation of the ban on coal and seafood imports from north korea .
the comment was in response to a question about data from china s customs administration showing china imported 1.6 million tonnes of coal from north korea in august , the first since february , when beijing banned purchases of the fuel from its northeast neighbor .
on aug. 14 , the commerce ministry said it would allow any cargoes that were already at port to clear customs as usual before the u.n. sanctions came into force on sept. 5 .
