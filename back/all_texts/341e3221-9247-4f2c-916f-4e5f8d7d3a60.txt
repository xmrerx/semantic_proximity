It s one thing to go after Donald Trump and how bigoted he is, but it s another to look at why he s gotten to where he is in this election cycle his voters.
If he didn t have a large amount of folks who think he s absolutely ideal for the presidency, well, then he wouldn t be the presumptive Republican presidential nominee.On HBO s Real Time, guest Neil deGrasse Tyson, an astrophysicist and one of the most brilliant people on the planet, told host Bill Maher why and how Trump is so popular, and what we need to do to fix it.He said: As an educator I care about the population and the electorate.
And all this attention going to complain about Donald Trump.
You re not really complaining about Donald Trump, there s a major portion of the electorate who likes him, and so they are your obvious object of your ire.
Then shouldn t you be looking at the educational system that somehow allows people to not think about data, to not think about what is or is not true in this world?
Basically calling Trump supporters dumb, because they haven t been properly educated in facts and reality.
Thus, their support for a candidate who is pretty much only qualified to be the president of his own fan club, and not the President of the United States.DeGrasse Tyson added: You can knock Trump out of the contest and the population that supports him will just wait for the next one to rise up and you have to beat the next one over the head!
And he s absolutely correct.
If we don t fix our educational system and start giving people the proper knowledge to discern who should and shouldn t be president, then if it s not Trump, it s just going to be the next raging bigot with absolutely no policy experience.Watch here:Featured image via video screen capture
