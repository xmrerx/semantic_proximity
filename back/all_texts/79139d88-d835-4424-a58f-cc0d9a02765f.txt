JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - Former Zimbabwe finance minister Ignatius Chombo, who was among those detained by the military in an operation against criminals around ousted president Robert Mugabe last week, has been handed over to the police, a relative said on Friday.
The relative, who wished to remain anonymous because of safety fears, said Chombo had been severely beaten while in military custody.
Police spokeswoman Charity Charamba said she had no information about Chombo.
