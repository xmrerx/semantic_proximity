WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Monday it was not backing any proposal to phase-in a planned reduction to the U.S. corporate tax rate.
Asked about a report the House of Representatives was considering a five-year phase-in for the corporate tax cut, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said: “The president has laid out his principles and it doesn’t include the phasing in.” “I don’t have reason to believe we have changes on that front at this point,” she added
