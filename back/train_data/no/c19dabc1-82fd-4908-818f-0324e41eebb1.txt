libreville ( reuters ) - an attacker wielding a knife and crying allahu akbar has wounded two danish journalists in gabon s capital libreville , the gabonese defense minister said .
the two reporters for the national geographic channel were in a popular market for tourist souvenirs on saturday , when a nigerien national living in gabon lunged at them with the knife , defence minister etienne kabinda makaga said in a statement on gabonese television .
after his arrest , the 53-year-old suspect , who has lived in gabon for two decades , told authorities he was carrying out a revenge attack against america for recognizing israel s capital as jerusalem , makaga said , giving no further explanation .
a judicial investigation was immediately opened at the public prosecutor s office of libreville to establish if the acts of the aggressor were isolated or a conspiracy , makaga said .
oil-rich gabon has a small muslim population consisting mostly of foreign workers , although the precise number is not known .
it is not normally considered a high risk country for jihadist violence .
