After a very public falling out, Megyn Kelly finally got her chance to sit down for an interview with Donald Trump.
Rather than make nice, Kelly seized the opportunity to call out Trump to his face on some of the disgusting things he s said about women (including Kelly) over the years.
His reaction was unexpected.In the midst of Trump s lengthy interview with Kelly, he was asked about the way he disparagingly called women bimbos.
For once, Trump, whose face went from orange to deep red, was tongue-tied, awkward and low energy.
He was extremely off his game and it was cringe worthy to watch.Kelly brought up Trump s Twitter activity, which often features the candidate for and it s important to keep this in mind President of the United States passing along messages from his fans that include sexist, racist, or violent remarks.
Trump s defense was lame: You would be surprised at the ones I don t retweet.
Kelly persisted: Bimbo?
Uncharacteristically, Trump could only meekly sputter mindlessly.
No come back.
No counterattack.
Just awkward half-formed sentences punctuated by painfully long moments of silence.Watch the moment Megyn Kelly confronted Donald Trump over the Bimbo retweets.

He claimed Kelly must have been called a lot worse than bimbo over her lifetime, so she shouldn t be upset when he does it.Kelly s response was pitch perfect: It s not about me.
It s about the messaging to young girls and to other women.
Trump had no response.
His message to young girls and to other women is one backed by sexism and objectification.
Kelly may have been called worse than bimbo over her lifetime, but Trump has certainly said worse, too.Featured image via Twitter
