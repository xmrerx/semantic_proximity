Ever since Hillary Clinton generously, yet correctly, identified about half (only half?)
of Donald Trump s vapid, illiterate flock of racist, meth-addled taint-barnacles, as a basket of deplorables, the Right has been in a frenzy as they feverishly attempt to prove her right.
One such deplorable, Trump s son Eric, showed the world on Monday that he is deserving of the title when he attempted to hit back at Clinton over the remark.
Look at the #BasketOfDeplorables in Pensacola Florida last night!
What a horrible statement.
#CrookedHillary, Trump tweeted victoriously.Look at the #BasketOfDeplorables in Pensacola Florida last night!
What a horrible statement.

That photo was not of the Pensacola rally.
In fact, it wasn t even in Florida.
Legendary former news commentator Keith Olbermann was among the many, many people who rushed to point out the obvious lie.
The Pensacola Deplorables relocated to Dallas because they were promised a new arena @KeithOlbermann.
How do you NOT know this?
@EricTrump Orlando Jones (@TheOrlandoJones) September 10, 2016Yes, Dallas.
In Texas.
Eric Trump, as Olbermann postulated, may very well be dumber than his dad.
Others helpfully informed Trump of his error:@BillyBlac LOL.. That picture is from a rally an 1 yr ago at American Airlines Center in DALLAS.
@EricTrump < CON MAN @RickRapscallion Billy Tee (@BillyT_202) September 10, 2016@BillyBlac @BillyT_202 @EricTrump @RickRapscallion there's a Texas state flag right in the picture, genius.
Eric's the one lying to you.

((tay)) (@SensiblySecular) September 10, 2016@EricTrump You intentionally cropped out American Airlines Center.. You're a con man just like your daddy.
https://t.co/0PTsEjgg6p @mcuban Billy Tee (@BillyT_202) September 10, 2016Trump s supporters including his children who participate in The Donald s circus of idiocy deserve their new, cute little nickname, and this is just one example.
His followers consist almost entirely of white supremacists and other assorted racists, Tea Party revolutionaries who desperately crave a new revolution, and xenophobes groups that most of us would consider deplorable.
Unfortunately, to Trump and his friends on the Right, they re patriots.
