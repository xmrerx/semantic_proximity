It s another effort to spread the wealth and I m thinking the American people won t buy it this time.BOSTON (AP) Hillary Clinton called for hundreds of billions in new federal spending on infrastructure on Sunday, kicking off what her campaign says will be a month-long focus on job creation.Standing before a backdrop of union workers and students, the Democratic presidential frontrunner vowed to rebuild ladders of opportunity and give a greater number of Americans a middle-class lifestyle.
Investing infrastructure makes our economy more productive and competitive, she said at the launch of Hard Hats for Hillary, a new effort by her campaign to mobilize union workers.
