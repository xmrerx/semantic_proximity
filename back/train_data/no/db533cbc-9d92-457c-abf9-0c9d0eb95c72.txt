does your child spend time on social media ?
unless they re amish , you should probably assume they do .
my teenage daughter just shared with me one of the most racist , self-loathing articles with me that i have ever seen in print .
this is the most hateful , racist articles aimed at shaming young , white americans that you ve have ever seen .
as we took a closer look at students featured in this buzzfeed article , we were stunned by some of the racist postings we found on their social media accounts.i suppose it s okay for buzzfeed to publish an article with the sole purpose of bashing its young white users , because thanks to barack and michelle obama ( the ultimate victims ) , who have been sowing the seeds of racism , division and hate from the white house , it s perfectly acceptable to trash white americans .
never mind that barack obama is the president of the united states .
what black united states president who was elected twice by a majority white nation would still consider himself and his wife victims of racism ?
here are some of the examples we found from the buzzfeed article titled : 19 school powerpoint presentations that give zero f * cks this article , and hundreds more just like it , show up in your children s snapchat social media feeds , a place where teenagers and young adults frequently go to interact with each other , and where they are constantly bombarded with leftist indoctrination garbage like this : controversial tay appears to be very proud of herself and how she s stirring it up at school , she actually goes as far as to say , one day i feel like my professors just gon stop letting me do presentations .
hmmm wonder why ? one day i feel like my professors just gon stop letting me do presentations pic.twitter.com/gr8oopdqeg controversial tay ( @ misstayamari ) november 17 , 2016robin had the white kids shook by her presentation .
how did she think it was going to make them feel good ?
wasn t that exactly the reaction she was going for ? i had these white kids shook pic.twitter.com/z8e3vplkff robin ( @ thyrobin ) october 21 , 2016here s indigo whose got a bucket ready for your white tears .
when the homie comes through with follow up pic.twitter.com/1lipsjdxxd indigo ( @ miesh_b ) december 14 , 2015as an added bonus , we also found this video on indigo s twitter account : watch this disrespectful black teenage girl attack her teacher during class , and twist his words to fit her narrative after he said , i want [ america ] to control the borders .
she quickly turns it into a race issue , using his statement about the controlling the borders to suggest he , doesn t want too many latinos in our country .
she tells him because you are white and you are so closed-minded that he doesn t accept the truth .
the teacher calls her out on her previous statement that , white people are in control of everything , by asking her what color our current president is ?
watch how she quickly blames congress for being white , which apparently makes a black man who holds the highest office in our nation somehow insignificant .
amazing pic.twitter.com/4fevzv49dh ( @ emotioneiie ) november 16 , 2016one of the most race-obsessed teachers on social media that i have ever seen , posted this tweet to his twitter account .
he calls himself zellie and this is his twitter profile : all black everything .
teacher .
blogger .
activist .
brother .
son .
contact : zellie.imani @ gmail.comdoes anyone wan na take bets about whether or not he would be offended if he saw someone on twitter saying they were all white everything ? in any case , buzzfeed chose one of his twitter posts that shows a student telling a group of students if you believe there is diversity , you re probably a racist .
: i 'm ready for this workshop .
pic.twitter.com/p0okfdy8vp zellie ( @ zellieimani ) november 7 , 2015and another post by the race-obsessed teacher made it to buzzfeed s top 19 most racist social media posts .
here is # 7.oh look white people who wan na be a nigga !
the teacher who calls himself zellie on twitter used laughing emoji s when he shared this on twitter as a way to express to viewers how funny he thought this was : professors about to stop assigning presentations .
pic.twitter.com/4yulajezdx zellie ( @ zellieimani ) december 18 , 2015this user brags about how she s about to shame her fellow students by suggesting , she about to fry them .
# love it !
: now this one is just plain hilarious !
here s a white student who appears to be giving the presenter his full attention and respect , while this black student ( who is the presenter ) places white people are a plague to the planet on the screen for the entire class to see .
pretty funny huh ?
you can see why buzzfeed chose them as their # 9 pick : pretty sure i just got an f on my presentation .
pic.twitter.com/7tdprsquup shahem .
( @ pettyblackboy ) may 12 , 2016this buzzfeed article would lead you to believe this is a common theme among black high school students , that white people are a plague .
and good for him according to his tweet , this racist clown got an a on his racist presentation .
again , it s really no secret why buzzfeed chose this tweet .
it s their # 10 : finessed an a on my presentation pic.twitter.com/rfr44exnmw shi'thead ( @ exroyalty ) november 2 , 2016and then of course , there s the white people are crazy slide .
this student didn t mention the grade he got .
this gem was posted to tumblr and was buzzfeed s # 11 : we re going to end this sickening display of racism at # 12 .
we ve had enough and we re pretty sure you have as well .
it doesn t matter what the color of your skin is , this display of hate and racism is unacceptable from any publication .
buzzfeed should be ashamed of themselves for putting this crap out there , and then paying to promote it on a social media sites geared towards teens and young adults.our final presenter is simply making the point that he is a victim .
can anyone guess who made him a victim ?
if your skin color is white , we re pretty sure it was you.jose lara at ethnic studies panel .
# ethnicstudiesnow pic.twitter.com/ufx30bn9zc mark tschaepe ( @ mdtschaepe ) october 30 , 2015radical publications like buzzfeed are not the only problem .
many of our educators are also indoctrinating our children with the , all white s are racists narrative .
when are parents going to start taking a stand , and tell the educators at the schools their children attend they are not going to stand by and watch them shame their children ?
it may be all the rage in high schools and colleges to unfairly accuse white people of racism and hate , but that doesn t mean you , or your kids have to go along with it.for the entire slide show , go to buzzfeed .
make sure to leave a comment , and let them know how you feel about the garbage they re putting out to your kids disguised as news .
teenagers and young adults have a hard enough time dealing with self-image and everyday teenage insecurities .
suicide rates and depression are off the charts for teens .
buzzfeed is just doing their part to pile on , and make your kids feel guilty or ashamed for the color of skin they were born with .
