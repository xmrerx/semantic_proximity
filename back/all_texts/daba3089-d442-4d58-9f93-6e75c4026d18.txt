Former Republican congressman Joe Walsh supports Donald Trump, but only if the election was won fair and square.And now that the CIA has released an assessment concluding that Russia interfered with the election to help Trump win, he is demanding an investigation and posted an epic Twitter rant ripping them for ignoring the report.Congressional Republicans, the evidence of Russia tampering with our election is too great now to ignore.Investigate.Do the right thing.
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 10, 2016Yes voter fraud is a big problem & we need Voter ID, but come on guys, a foreign government messing with our elections?Can t be tolerated Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 10, 2016It will be utterly disgraceful if Republicans & Conservatives keep their mouths shut in the wake of what the CIA is saying about Russia.
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 10, 2016Hey @SpeakerRyan & @SenateMajLdr, is it ok for Russia to mess with our elections?Do you agree with @realDonaldTrump that the CIA is lying?
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 10, 2016Republican silence will be tantamount to treason.Call 4 an investigation.
Foreign governments can t pick our President.#RussianHackers Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 10, 2016If there was evidence that the Russians helped Hillary win, my fellow conservatives would be yelling for an investigation.#RussianHackers Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 10, 2016I never agree with @chuckschumer but he s correct on this one.
Where is his Republican colleague joining his call?
https://t.co/bKEolLmQvi Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 10, 2016NBC reports Trump has picked Exxon Mobil CEO Rex Tillerson as Sec of State.He s a good buddy of Putin s. https://t.co/tsYmGmjacD Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 10, 2016So wait the CIA says Russia messed with our election to help Trump win and Trump attacks the CIA?Not Russia?
He goes after the CIA?
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 10, 2016The protests, the harassing electors, the recounts that s all not accepting the election result bullshit.But Russia?
That s a big deal Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 10, 2016Where is the Republican outrage today?Where?This isn t a partisan issue.
It s an American issue.#RussianHackers Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 10, 2016Call me naive, but the one person who should call for an investigation is Trump.No foreign country should ever mess with OUR elections.
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 10, 2016There s evidence Russia messed around with our election, but cuz our guy won, people on my side are ok with that?That s so fucking wrong.
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 10, 2016So ..we got a real problem if our soon to be President sides with Russia over our own intelligence agencies.Hello.
Joe Walsh (@WalshFreedom) December 10, 2016As you can see, Joe Walsh may be a conservative prick, but even he wants the election to be fair whether his side loses or not.
The 2016 Election was not fairly won if Russia helped Trump cheat to win.
That s why an immediate investigation needs to happen and if the CIA report is confirmed, Donald Trump should not be allowed to take office.
Either a new election should be scheduled or the Electoral College should install Hillary Clinton as the rightful winner.
Because allowing Trump to win with the help of foreign interference only opens the door for future interference in our elections and our democracy cannot survive if that happens.Featured Image: Mark Wilson/Getty Images
