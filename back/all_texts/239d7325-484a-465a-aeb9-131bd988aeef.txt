PRAGUE (Reuters) - The outgoing Czech government will submit its resignation when it next meets on Nov. 29, Prime Minister Bohuslav Sobotka said on Twitter on Friday, making way for a new administration following an October parliamentary election.
Czech President Milos Zeman plans to appoint Andrej Babis as prime minister in early December.
Babis s ANO party won last month s election by a large margin but fell short of a majority.
It has yet to find any coalition partners and is still seeking votes to support a minority cabinet.
