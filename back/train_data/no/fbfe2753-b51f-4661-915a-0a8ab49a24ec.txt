the washington post nearly a third of territory reclaimed from the islamic state in iraq and syria since 2014 has been won in the past six months , due to new policies adopted by the trump administration , a senior state department official said friday.brett mcgurk , the state department s senior envoy to the anti-islamic state coalition , said that steps president trump has taken , including delegating decision-making authority down from the white house to commanders in the field , have dramatically accelerated gains against the militants.combined islamic state losses in both countries since the group s peak control in early 2015 total about 27,000 square miles of territory 78 percent of militant holdings in iraq and 58 percent in syria .
about 8,000 square miles have been reclaimed under trump , mcgurk said in a briefing for reporters.although the trump administration has yet to announce its new strategy for the campaign against the islamic state , mcgurk cited key changes under trump .
in addition to the delegation of decision-making authority , which he said has allowed much greater responsiveness to opportunities and changing circumstances , he cited a campaign of annihilation that has concentrated on surrounding cities held by the militants before launching offensives , to ensure that no militants will escape.he said the 2,000 militants remaining in raqqa most likely will die in raqqa .
the united nations has estimated that 25,000 civilians also remain in the city.mcgurk , who held the same job in the obama administration , also cited renewed administration efforts to increase burden sharing from the coalition among what he said were 73 countries .
most of them do not contribute to the warfighting but are expected to help with stabilization efforts in cleared areas , including in the iraqi city of mosul , where u.s.-backed iraq security forces declared victory over the islamic state last month .
