sen. jefferson beauregard sessions iii , donald trump s friendly but fierce alabama ally , has a message for republicans still queasy about their party s nominee : tide s about to roll over you .
sessions , a 69-year-old former state attorney general who famously donned the make america great again trucker s cap at a massive rally in mobile last august , thinks trump is more a movement than a man .
and this sprightly son of country preachers and teachers is on a mission to evangelize maybe-trumpers like house speaker paul ryan on the gospel according to donald with a sermon on self-preservation .
my advice is to listen and accept the will of the american people , the republican voters the republican party is the republican voters , he added a pointed reference to ryan s suggestion that he , and not the presumptive party nominee , represents authentic conservative values .
give me a break !
a lot of our drift within our party has gotten away from the will of the voters .
i think the leaders in all parties tend to adjust to reality .
they just have to or they won t remain in office .
already many are sensing it .
