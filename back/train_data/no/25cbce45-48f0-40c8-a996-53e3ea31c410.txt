the problem with this entire thing is that people that broke our laws and are using our tax dollars for education are being celebrated by our lawless president .
that s disturbing but very typical of a leader who constantly puts illegals before legal americans.here s more info about this event : michelle obama flying college-bound illegals to d.c. for special celebration headlined by a dropout rapperwhite house honors nine illegal immigrant teachers including 4 texansthe entire group was flown with a companion to washington for a celebration headlined by a college dropout rapper yes , i thought this was about education too .
