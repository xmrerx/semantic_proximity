moscow ( reuters ) - russia may decide to designate any media as foreign agents if they are financed by a foreign state or citizen , or by a russian organization that gets foreign financing , the interfax news agency reported on thursday .
interfax cited a draft regulation from the justice ministry .
russian president vladimir putin signed a law last month that allowed the authorities to designate foreign media outlets as foreign agents in response to what moscow said was unacceptable u.s. pressure on russian media .
so far , it has been exclusively used to label media sponsored by the u.s. authorities as foreign agents , but the new regulation would appear to go further .
under the existing law media branded foreign agents must provide any news they provide to russians as the work of foreign agents and disclose their funding sources .
