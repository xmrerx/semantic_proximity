Donald Trump has dragged the Republican Party so far down the toilet that former Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele won t vote for him.During a dinner in San Francisco on Friday, Steele declared that he will not be voting for Trump because he has captured that racist underbelly, that frustration, that angry underbelly of American life and gave voice to that.
Indeed, the Republican nominee has aggressively courted the angry white racist vote since the beginning of his campaign, which is why white supremacist groups such as the Ku Klux Klan and neo-Nazis have flocked to him.In fact, Steele finds Trump s rhetoric do disgusting that he admitted that he was damn near puking during the debates.
But while he won t cast his vote for Trump, Steele says he isn t voting for Hillary Clinton either.Regardless, Steele is now the third former GOP Chair to stand against Trump and that s bad news for the Republican Party and their effort to attract minority voters to the ever-shrinking tent.
The longer they cling to their new leader, the more and more Republicans will be pushed away.
And whether they vote for Hillary or not, the GOP is going to find it almost impossible to make up the difference with their hardcore voters.While the Republican base is rabid, it just doesn t have the numbers to overcome the loss of more moderate voters who have rejected Trump.And Republican leaders only have themselves to blame.
They have been pandering to Trump s supporters for years even though racism, sexism, and ignorance are common traits among them.
Rather than moving toward the center, Republicans ended up giving these extremists a seat at the table and have found themselves being pushed out of their own home ever since by fringe conservatives who only want more control.
Now the party has been hijacked and Republican leaders are going to have a hell of a time trying to wrest control back from them.That may be possible after a few years, but it s likely that the Republican Party will be in chaos for many years to come, which means you can bet that more Republicans are going to find another party to vote for or they won t vote at all.Featured Image: Wikimedia
