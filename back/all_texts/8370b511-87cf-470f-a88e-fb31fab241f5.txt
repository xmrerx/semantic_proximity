Donald Trump kicked off his Wednesday morning by launching into another insane rant about fake news, with a bonus guest appearance by a stupid comment about Hillary Clinton.
The fake news media is going crazy with their conspiracy theories and blind hatred.
@MSNBC & @CNN are unwatchable, Trump said, continuing his attack on media that tells the truth about him.
Of course, he was sure to endorse a network that generally distorts stories in his favor on behalf of the U.S. Government: @foxandfriends is great!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017Sorry, folks.
The very real information about Michael Flynn and Russia (the information that led to his resignation) as well as Trump s guest Facebooking a photo of the guy carrying the nuclear football along with his name, Trump reviewing secure documents using a cell phone flashlight during dinner while the waitstaff continued service, the confirmation that his staff stayed in frequent contact with the Russian government during his campaign, and even Kellyanne Conway s free commercial for Ivanka Trump s products all of that is just conspiracy theories and blind hatred.
After taking his traditional half-hour to figure out how he can sound even more like an uninformed madman than with his previous tweet, Trump informed us that any allegations that he or his staff are connected to Russia are simply attempts to cover up Hillary Clinton s massive popular vote victory he keeps denying happened:This Russian connection non-sense is merely an attempt to cover-up the many mistakes made in Hillary Clinton's losing campaign.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017After an 11-minute thinkin session, Trump amped up the stupidity by saying that intelligence agencies leaking information about his ties to Russia makes them just like Russia :Information is being illegally given to the failing @nytimes & @washingtonpost by the intelligence community (NSA and FBI?
).Just like Russia Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017But Trump wasn t done yet!
What good is an unhinged right-wing rant without someone dragging Obama into it?
Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration.
Was Obama too soft on Russia?
Trump writes.Crimea was TAKEN by Russia during the Obama Administration.
Was Obama too soft on Russia?
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) February 15, 2017Before he took office, Trump whined that Obama was too hard on his previous Vladdy Poot Poot, arguing for a substantial rollback of sanctions against Russia (including some of the ones Obama put in place after Crimea was TAKEN.
Naturally, after almost an hour of pure stupidity, Americans just unleashed on The Donald:Haha @realDonaldTrump saying obama was soft on Russia is the best so far.
Practicing your comedy routine, I see!
David G. McAfee (@DavidGMcAfee) February 15, 2017So Trump's defense for borderline-treasonous behavior & collusion: Obama was soft on Russia!
Jordan Uhl (@JordanUhl) February 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump you have Obama tourettes.
You can't say 'but Obama' every time you are in trouble.
Own your own shit.

Bird Peterson (@birdpeterson) February 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump He imposed sanctions in response to Russian aggression.
YOUR ADMINISTRATION conspired with the Russians to lift them.
MatthewDicks (@MatthewDicks) February 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump "Bad things happened under Obama, but no one calls HIM out for the treasonous things that only I did!
Wait " Ben Hooper (@BenHooperWrites) February 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump Russia just violated an arms control treaty under your watch.
We are waiting.
Skip Shea (@skipshea2) February 15, 2017@realDonaldTrump Obama imposed sanctions on Russia ( that you want to lift) for interfering in our election, while you pic.twitter.com/lIHwBX9f3c Frank Funaro (@FrankFunaro) February 15, 2017If anyone is soft on Russia, it s the guy who once tweeted that he wanted Putin to become his new best friend.
If there s one takeaway from this moronic outpouring of what-the-fuck, it s that Trump is scared and is lashing out at everything he can.
His days are numbered.
The real scandal here is that classified information is illegally given out by intelligence like candy, Trump says.
Very un-American!
