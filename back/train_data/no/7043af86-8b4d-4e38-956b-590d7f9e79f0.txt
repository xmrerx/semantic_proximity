harare ( reuters ) - a belgian-based businessman on friday challenged zimbabwean first lady grace mugabe s accusation that he duped her of a $ 1.35 million diamond ring and asked her to provide the court with evidence to back her lawsuit .
president robert mugabe s wife grace this week sued jamal hamed in a harare high court , accusing him of failing to deliver the 100 carat jewel she said she had ordered from him for her wedding anniversary last year .
grace , 52 , who is seen as a possible successor to her 93-year-old husband , said hamed had instead provided an inferior ring worth $ 30,000 and when she had complained had refunded only $ 120,000 .
but hamed filed his own court application disputing the claim and demanded that grace should supply the court with details such as a copy of the sale agreement and proof of payment before he put in his defense .
hamed s lawyer beatrice mtetwa said she had deposed the court papers on behalf of her client on friday .
in the court papers seen by reuters , hamed , a british national , said grace should also provide proof that he in fact owned zimbabwean companies the first lady wished to be sold to recover the money when , exactly , is it alleged the payment was done ?
full dates are required .
full details of the account holder , the account number and a copy of the account statement are required , hamed said in the court application .
grace s lawyer wilson manase did not answer his phone when contacted for comment .
the court case has lifted a veil on the wealthy lifestyle of mugabe and his wife , nicknamed gucci grace for her reputed dedication to shopping , at a time zimbabwe is in the grip of a severe u.s. dollar crunch and cash shortages .
