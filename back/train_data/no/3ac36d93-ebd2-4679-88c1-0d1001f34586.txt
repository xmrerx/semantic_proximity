kuala lumpur ( reuters ) - malaysia has arrested seven philippine men suspected of involvement in activities of the abu sayyaf militant group , police said on thursday , as concern grows in southeast asia over the possible expansion of militant islamist activity .
the abu sayyaf , whose members have pledged loyalty to islamic state , is notorious for bombings , beheadings , extortions and kidnap-for-ransom activities in the philippines volatile south .
the men worked as security guards for private companies in the capital , kuala lumpur , and the surrounding state of selangor , inspector-general of police mohamad fuzi harun said .
one suspect , a 22-year-old , was an abu sayyaf group member involved in clashes with the military and kidnapping of hostages in the southern philippines , he said in a statement .
an extremist faction of the abu sayyaf helped seize large parts of marawi city in the southern philippines in may , leading to a siege that has killed about 670 militants and 149 soldiers .
reuters could not reach the men to seek comment as they are in custody .
it was not immediately clear if they have lawyers to represent them .
malaysian police said their arrests were based on information received after authorities thwarted a plan by an abu sayyaf member to stage an attack at the closing ceremony of the southeast asian games in kuala lumpur last month .
all seven men arrived in malaysia in september 2015 through the town of sandakan in the state of sabah on borneo island , off the southern coast of the philippines , before traveling to kuala lumpur on forged documents , mohamad fuzi said .
since 2013 , muslim-majority malaysia has detained more than 300 people with suspected links to islamic state .
this year , malaysia has arrested 41 foreigners classified as foreign terrorist fighters , mohamad fuzi added .
governments in southeast asia have been worried over the possible expansion of islamic state as the group loses ground in the middle east .
