skopje ( reuters ) - macedonia s main opposition party , the rightist vmro-dpmne formally replaced its leader nikola gruevski on saturday and appointed hristijan mickoski , a technocrat , as his successor .
gruevski , 47 , resigned earlier this month following an election defeat last year and unrest that rocked the small balkan country in april .
in his speech to the party s convention on saturday , gruevski said that a key reason for vmro-dpmne s fall from power was his refusal to yield to what he described as international and domestic pressure to accept a compromise in a dispute with greece .
macedonia , which won independence in 1991 from then-federal yugoslavia , has made little progress towards eu and nato membership due to a long-running dispute with greece which claims macedonia s name represents a territorial claim to its province with the same name .
we wanted a fair compromise and a name solution , but not under dictate , gruevski said .
gruevski s successor mickoski , 41 , a relative novice in politics , became vmro-dpmne secretary general earlier this year .
he served in gruevski s government as the general manager of elem , macedonia s state-owned power plants managing company .
