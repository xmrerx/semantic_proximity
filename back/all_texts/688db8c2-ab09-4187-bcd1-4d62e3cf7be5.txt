Republicans love to say that they are the party of God.
More than a few GOP presidential candidates in the last year have said that God values their bigoted, conservative family values and assorted despicable principles and points of view, but the death of Antonin Scalia really calls all of that into question.
Scalia was about as much of a far-right nut as anyone could ask for, and now that he is dead, the right is terrified that President Obama will nominate someone with a bit of sense, compassion, and knowledge of the Constitution to the Court to replace him.However, the fact that Scalia died when he did completely undermines the idea that some kind of higher power favors far right nonsense, and movie executive extraordinaire Jim Vejoda brillianatly pointed that out on Twitter.
Vejoda pointed out that the stars could not have aligned more perfectly for liberals with the timing of Scalia s death:He s right, of course.
If conservatives are claiming that some divine power is on their side after this one, they really are delusional.
Get it through your heads, right-wingers: Nobody, including the universe, likes ugly, and you folks are as ugly as they come.
Most folks are saying good riddance to Antonin Scalia apparently, including your so-called God.Featured image from Twitter
