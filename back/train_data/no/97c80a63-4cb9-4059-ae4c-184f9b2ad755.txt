it is essential that we find new leadership for the f.b.i .
that restores public trust and confidence in its vital law enforcement mission .
you are hereby terminated and removed from office , effective immediately .
trump interviewed a slew of candidates for the position , including fbi director andrew mccabe , former democratic sen. joe lieberman , former oklahoma gov .
frank keating , former fbi official richard mcfeely and john pistole before settling on wray.the interesting thing about the pick is that this was trump s pick .
this is also a brilliant move from the president to nominate a pick for fbi director one day before comey testifies.christopher wray was the lawyer for chris christie in the bridgegate investigation .
the left will probably go bonkers over that fun fact.here s a little more on wray : wray was nominated by president george w. bush as assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division , according to the u.s. department of justice website .
he held that job until 2005.christopher wray is a graduate of yale law school .
he led the enron task force when he was with the department of justice.as head of the criminal division , wray led investigations and prosecutions in securities fraud , health care fraud , money laundering , public corruption and several other areas of federal criminal law , according the the website of king & spaulding , a washington firm where he currently serves as a litigation partner.via : daily caller
