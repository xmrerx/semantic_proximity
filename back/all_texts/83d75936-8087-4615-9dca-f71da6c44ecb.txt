(Reuters) - British lawmakers voted on Tuesday in favor of handing the governing Conservatives greater say on committees that scrutinize laws, a move denounced by the opposition as an attempt to rig parliament .
The government won by 320 votes to 301, a day after lawmakers passed legislation to sever ties with the European Union.
May lost the Conservatives majority in a June election, forcing her government to rely on the support of a small Northern Irish party to pass laws.
