here s an epic one-liner on the pga move from miami to mexico : i hope they have kidnapping insurance .
presumptive republican nominee donald trump is responding to the pga moving the 2017 world golf championship to mexico instead of holding it at trump doral in miami .
they move the world golf championships from miami to mexico city , trump commented .
they moved the pga tour , moved the world golf championships from miami , where they re furious to mexico city .
if i become your president , this stuff is all going to stop , trump added .
he went on to criticize the u.s. economy for being taken advantage of by mexico.the pga tour said the move happens because it couldn t find sponsors , according to bbc.trump argued the pga put profit ahead of thousands of american jobs .
timothy finchem , pga tour commissioner , suggested trump s profile made it difficult to get sponsors .
it s fundamentally a sponsorship issue , finchem added .
donald trump is a brand , a big brand , and when you re asking a company to invest millions of dollars in branding a tournament and they re going to share that brand with the host , it s a difficult decision .
finchem insisted the move isn t political.trump slammed the decision , saying it s a sad day for miami , the u.s. and the game of golf .
this decision only further embodies the very reason i am running for president of the united states .
i hope they have kidnapping insurance , trump stated during an interview with fox news.via : breitbart
