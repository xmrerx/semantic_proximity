make america conservative again .
there really isn t any downside it might be time to rethink the millennial voter.a new paper suggests that americans are more politically polarized now than they ve been in the past 46 years , and millennials are guiding this trend.the young adults , who were born between 1980 and 1994 , are currently more politically polarized than generation xers and baby boomers , according to the paper , which was published in the journal personality and social psychology bulletin on wednesday .
additionally , millennials are more likely to identify as conservative than either generation xers or baby boomers were at the same age , said jean twenge , professor of psychology at san diego state university and lead author of the paper .
high school seniors are more likely to identify as political conservatives now compared to 10 years ago .
most surprising , more identify as conservatives now compared to the 1980s , presumably the era of the young conservative , such as the character alex p. keaton in the 1980s show family ties .
that goes against the common view of millennials as very liberal , said twenge , author of the book about millennials titled generation me .
so the current view of millennials as liberals might be due to their age young people are more likely to be liberal .
but if you compare young people now to young people in previous decades , those now are more conservative , she said.the data showed that , as entering college students , 23 % of millennials identified as leaning far right , compared to 17 % of baby boomers and 22 % of generation xers.less than half 47 % of millennials identified as middle-of-the-road , compared to 50 % of baby boomers and more than half 53 % of generation xers.millennials have surpassed baby boomers both as the united states largest living generation and as the largest generation in the american electorate .
