donald trump addressed thousands of motorcyclists , many of them military veterans , attending the annual rolling thunder gathering to honor the nation s soldier missing-in-action .
the bikers have been great supporters of trump as he mentioned last week : i am doing it in honor of the great bikers who have been totally supportive of my campaign and now i want to be supportive of them .
i look forward to it !
great !
we made the right choice america !
