Here s the video clip that captured Hillary insulting and writing off nearly half the country.
And here s Mitt Romney s comments at a private event that was secretly recorded.
Many will argue that his 47% of Obama supporters are entitled comment helped to sink his candidacy.
We actually think Romney was unfairly targeted for these comments, because he facts and figures to back up his assertion.
Barack Obama was very vocal about the fact that all of America should be outraged by Romney s insensitive comments.
Will Barack Obama hold Hillary to the same standard as he held Mitt Romney?
You don t need to answer that question.Here s Obama s tweet from 4 years ago.
Only 4 short years later, the same could undoubtedly be said about Hillary s basket of deplorables comment.RT if you agree: We need a President who is fighting for all Americans, not one who writes off nearly half the country.
