bah , humbug !
manufacturers and retailers can face civil and possibly criminal penalties for failing to report any products to the cpsc that do not meet the regulation s requirements .
the best time to wage the war on christmas isn t in december , when regular americans have their defenses up .
a better time is now , and the best way to do it is through faceless , unaccountable federal bureaucracies for our own safety , of course : the consumer product safety commission ( cpsc ) issued a regulation for christmas lights on monday , deeming some holiday decorations a substantial product hazard .
the consumer product safety commission is issuing a final rule to specify that seasonal and decorative lighting products that do not contain any one of three readily observable characteristics ( minimum wire size , sufficient strain relief , or overcurrent protection ) , as addressed in a voluntary standard , are deemed a substantial product hazard under the consumer product safety act ( cpsa ) , the final rule said.the ruling applies to a variety of christmas decorations , including stars , wreathes , candles without shades , light sculptures , blow-molded ( plastic ) figures , and animated figures .
however , solar-powered products are exempt.they will probably also make exceptions for lights powered by windmills , and any holiday lights put up to honor martin luther king day.this is typical : the rule is listed as a voluntary standard .
however , manufacturers and retailers can face civil and possibly criminal penalties for failing to report any products to the cpsc that do not meet the regulation s requirements.ours is the ultimate soft tyranny .
when we get to the point where people are sent to gulags because their neighbors turned them in for celebrating christmas , no doubt it will be voluntary , like paying taxes.via : moonbattery
