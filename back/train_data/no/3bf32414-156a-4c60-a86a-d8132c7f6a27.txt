washington ( reuters ) - former republican presidential candidate senator lindsey graham threw his support behind senator ted cruz in the race for his party ’ s presidential nomination on thursday , saying he thought cruz has the best chance of stopping front-runner donald trump .
graham said he will headline a fundraiser in support of the texas senator on monday , in connection with the upcoming conference of the pro-israel lobby aipac .
cruz is to address the aipac meeting on monday .
“ if we give the banner of the republican party to donald trump , we tarnish it maybe forever .
that might be the end of the republican party as i know it , ” graham told reporters at the u.s. capitol .
graham , a u.s. senator from south carolina who dropped out of the presidential race in december , before the nominating contests had even begun , acknowledged his former harsh criticism of cruz , including joking about cruz being murdered on the senate floor .
“ it ’ s an odd alliance , but it ’ s an alliance i feel comfortable with given my choices , ” graham said .
he said he thought ohio governor john kasich would have a better chance of winning in november , but had concluded that cruz has a better chance of stopping trump .
“ i like john kasich .
i think we could nominate john and john would win the general election going away , ” graham said .
