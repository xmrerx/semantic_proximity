When 2014 Super Bowl champion Kam Chancellor isn t kicking butt for the Seattle Seahawks he is running fitness boot camps for women.
So, when the star came across a recently closed gym in Redmond, Washington he decided that he wanted to buy it for his classes.
Unfortunately, this curiosity resulted in the police being called and him being accused of trying to rob the place.Two female employees of the Redmond Athletic Club called the police when Chancellor looked through the window of the gym and tried to get some information about how to buy it.
Seriously.
Apparently nobody told Kam that he can t buy a business while black.The football player explained what happened on Twitter, Wednesday:The funniest thing just happened too me in Redmond.
I went to go get info on a gym that was closed and 2 ladies called the cops on me Kameron (@Kam_Chancellor) March 3, 2016 They told the cops I was trying to rob the place because I was looking into the glass asking for help.
I took a picture of the two employees Kameron (@Kam_Chancellor) March 3, 2016Good thing the cops know I m a good guy and stealing isn t in my blood.
I work for everything I get Kameron (@Kam_Chancellor) March 3, 2016 No I was mad because all I wanted was a number to call and they waved me off like a fly without answering me https://t.co/eAJnjw3vJv Kameron (@Kam_Chancellor) March 3, 2016Yes two younger ladies.
I took a picture of them calling the cops on me https://t.co/5qzWUpwirB Kameron (@Kam_Chancellor) March 3, 2016 I guess I won t put a gym in Redmond then.
I m not qualified.
I want to post her face so bad on the phone looking disgusted.
Kameron (@Kam_Chancellor) March 3, 2016Although he doesn t tell us the race of the women who called the cops on him, another one of his tweets makes alludes them possibly being white.
@djparker25: @Kam_Chancellor that s crazy bruh smh not all people are like that so I don t blame the world.
I blame their parents Kameron (@Kam_Chancellor) March 3, 2016@Wizdom80@djparker25 true Kameron (@Kam_Chancellor) March 3, 2016I only know of one race that is privileged and that is mine: Caucasians.There is no doubt in my mind that the women who called the police did so because they were scared of the big, scary black guy.
If a white man of a smaller stature had looked in that window and motioned them for help there is little chance the cops would have been called.Thankfully, the police immediately recognized the Chancellor and he wasn t arrested or shot.
We all know that in 2016 it isn t an uncommon thing to see African-Americans gunned down for absolutely no reason, so he s one lucky guy.
