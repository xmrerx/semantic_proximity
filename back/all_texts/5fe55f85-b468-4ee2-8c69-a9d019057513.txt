SEOUL (Reuters) - North Korea said a new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) it test-fired on Wednesday was launched from a newly developed vehicle and that the its warhead could withstand the pressure of re-entering the earth s atmosphere.
North Korean leader Kim Jong Un personally guided the missile test and said the new launcher was impeccable , state media said.
He described the new vehicle as a breakthrough .
Observers and analysts have cast doubt on North Korea s ability to master the technology needed to design a warhead capable of withstanding the enormous pressure of re-entry into the earth s atmosphere and suggested the isolated country may still be years away from developing a credible delivery vehicle for a nuclear weapon.
But Wednesday s launch re-confirmed the safety of a warhead in the atmospheric re-entry environment, state media said, without elaborating.
