baghdad ( reuters ) - iraq said it was increasing oil exports on saturday from the southern basra region by 200,000 barrels per day to make up for a shortfall from the northern kirkuk fields .
the output from the northern kirkuk region fell this week in the course of military operations to take it back from kurdish fighters who have been there since 2014 .
the increase in basra exports keeps iraq s total output within the quota agreed with the organisation of petroleum exporting countries , the oil ministry said in a statement citing oil minister jabar al-luaibi .
he said 200,000 barrels per day will be shipped from southern basra export terminal on top of the usual volumes exported daily which exceed 3.2 million barrels .
these additional volumes will be produced until the northern oil output goes back to its previous level , he said .
iraq won t be able to restore kirkuk s oil output to last week s levels before sunday because of missing equipment at two of the largest fields of the region , avana and bai hasan , an oil ministry official told reuters on thursday .
until these shutdowns , the northern oil region exported about 530,000 barrels per day , of which about half came from the semi-autonomous kurdistan region and the rest from the disputed kirkuk province , claimed by both the kurds and the iraqi central authorities .
kurdish peshmerga forces deployed in kirkuk in 2014 , when the iraqi army fled its positions in the face of an advance by islamic state militants .
the kurdish move prevented the militants from taking control of its oilfields .
