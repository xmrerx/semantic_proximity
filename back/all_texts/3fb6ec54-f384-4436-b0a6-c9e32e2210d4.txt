Fox News went completely predictable in opening tonight s Republican debate.
Megyn Kelly addressed the elephant not in the room, asking Ted Cruz to comment on Donald Trump s absence.
After some sleazy pandering to the people of Iowa, Cruz slung some mud at Trump with the kind of swagger and confidence of a boxer talking about his opponent at a press conference in his absence.Cruz got a nice chuckle from the crowd, and while his comments were witty, they were delivered by that screeching, whiny little voice through those annoying pursed lips.
His egotistical little moment would probably have been smacked down with you re not going to make America great or something equally as clever juvenile had Trump been there.It was a fitting opening for the circus that was sure to come as another 2 hours of hate and fear was sold to the Republican base.
Bravo, Senator.
