srinagar , india ( reuters ) - indian soldiers killed a relative of a top pakistan-based militant in a gunbattle in southern kashmir , police said on tuesday , increasing the pressure on the leader whom it wants placed on an international blacklist .
india , backed by the united states , has been trying to get maulana masood azhar on a u.n. list of groups and individuals with ties to al qaeda , blaming his group for a series of attacks in india , including one on its parliament in 2002 and another last year on an airbase .
on monday , soldiers surrounded a village in pulwama district and killed talha rasheed , a nephew of azhar , along with two associates in the gunfight , police inspector general muneer khan said .
they were all members of the pakistan-based jaish-e-mohammad group .
india has long accused pakistan of harboring militant groups and giving them material support to carry out a 28-year armed revolt in disputed kashmir .
pakistan denies the allegations and says it is doing more than any other country in fighting militant groups .
masood has become a thorny issue between india and china which has blocked its repeated requests to sanction him under the un list of terrorists .
