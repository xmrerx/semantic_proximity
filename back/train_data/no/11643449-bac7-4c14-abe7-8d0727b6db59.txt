tegucigalpa ( reuters ) - honduran president juan orlando hernandez extended the lead over his rival to just over one percentage point in a seesawing , delayed vote count for a presidential election that has sparked a political crisis , latest results showed on thursday .
the website of the electoral tribunal said that with 90.4 percent of ballots counted after sunday s election , hernandez had secured 42.68 percent of the vote in the central american nation , with his centrist opponent salvador nasralla on 41.6 percent .
the process has been disrupted by technical glitches , and nasralla initially held a five point lead over pre-election favorite hernandez until the count ground to a halt on monday with more than half of the ballots counted .
when the count restarted some 36 hours later , the results started to swing in favor of hernandez , and nasralla cried foul , rejecting the figures and saying that he was being robbed .
