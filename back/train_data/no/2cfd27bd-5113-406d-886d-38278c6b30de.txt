united nations ( reuters ) - russia cast its 10th veto on thursday of united nations security council action on syria since the war began in 2011 , blocking a u.s.-drafted resolution to renew an international inquiry into who is to blame for chemical weapons attacks in syria .
the mandate for the joint inquiry by the u.n. and the organization for the prohibition of chemical weapons ( opcw ) , which found the syrian government used the banned nerve agent sarin in an april 4 attack , expires at midnight thursday .
a resolution needs nine votes in favor and no vetoes by the united states , france , russia , britain or china to be adopted .
russia withdrew its rival draft resolution to renew the inquiry shortly before the council vote on the u.s. draft .
