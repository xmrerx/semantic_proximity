dar es salaam ( reuters ) - tanzania shut down another newspaper on friday - the third since june - after a warning from president john magufuli earlier in the year that the days of newspapers his government viewed as unethical were numbered .
hassan abbasi , the director-general of the state-run tanzania information services , said in a statement that raia mwema , a weekly newspaper , had been banned from publishing for 90 days , starting on friday .
the independently-owned outlet was suspended , he said , after publishing an article this week saying magufuli was destined to fail in his job and in which it attributed fabricated statements to the president .
the government ... issued a lenient punishment despite the gravity of the offense because the editors admitted their mistake , he said.tanzania suspended publication of the weekly mwanahalisi newspaper for 24 months on sept. 20 and banned another newspaper , mawio , in june for a similar period.magufuli , nicknamed the bulldozer for his forceful leadership style , has won some praise from western donors for an anti-corruption drive and for cutting wasteful public spending.but opponents accuse him of increasingly undermining democracy by curbing dissent and stifling free speech .
