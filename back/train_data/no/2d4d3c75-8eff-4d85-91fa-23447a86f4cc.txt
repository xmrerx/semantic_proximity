kuala lumpur ( reuters ) - malaysia on tuesday summoned myanmar s ambassador to express displeasure over violence in myanmar s rakhine state , which has displaced nearly 125,000 rohingya muslims .
foreign minister anifah aman said the latest incidents of violence showed that the myanmar government had made little , if any progress in finding a peaceful solution to problems facing the rohingya minority , most of whom live in the northwest myanmar state near the bangladeshi border .
given these developments , malaysia believes that the matter of sustained violence and discrimination against the rohingyas should be elevated to a higher international forum , anifah said in a statement .
muslim-majority malaysia has been particularly outspoken in its concern about the plight of the rohingya .
myanmar says its security forces are fighting a legitimate campaign against terrorists responsible for a string of attacks on police posts and the army since last october .
the latest violence began on aug. 25 , when rohingya insurgents attacked dozens of police posts and an army base .
in a separate statement , malaysia s foreign affairs ministry issued a travel advisory asking malaysians to defer all non-essential travel to rakhine state , and for malaysians in myanmar to take all necessary precautions and be aware of the security situation .
