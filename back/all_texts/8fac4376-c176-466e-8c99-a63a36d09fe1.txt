One of Fox News biggest and most successful news personalities is bringing the network down in a major way.Recently, The O Reilly Factor host Bill O Reilly was exposed for a massive amount of sexual harassment lawsuits that the network settled for him over the span of his career.
As Fox has already gained quite the reputation for its sexist culture and tendency to protect its people from sexual harassment allegations, this is damaging enough to the network s reputation but it s looking like the network will also suffer a big financial hit.So far and this is just the beginning as many as 20 advertisers have pulled ads from O Reilly s show over word of the lawsuits.
These advertisers include major brands such as Mercedes-Benz, Hyundai, BMW of North America, Mitsubishi Motors, Lexus, Constant Contact, Bayer, Ainsworth Pet Nutrition, UNTUCKit, Allstate, Esurance, T. Rowe Price, GlaxoSmithKline, Sanofi, Orkin, and Wayfair.
And of course, Fox News is trying to sweep this under the rug and pretend that these ad dollars are going to be used elsewhere on Fox.
What else would you expect from the most dishonest cable news network?This is really, REALLY bad news for the network.
O Reilly was responsible for bringing in over $400 billion in advertisements from 2014-2016 alone.
If advertisers are deciding to walk away from O Reilly over these new revelations, this could really hurt Fox News bottom line.Fox News is already struggling to begin with, as the network has lost almost all credibility for defending and continuing to support Donald Trump.
The network has been proven to be highly inaccurate, and Trump has helped to make Fox News a joke when it comes to trustworthy media.
O Reilly s recent scandal could be the final straw for the network, as it becomes even less popular than before.Featured image via Ilya S. Savenok/Getty Images
