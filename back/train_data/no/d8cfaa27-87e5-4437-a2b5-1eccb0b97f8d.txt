one critic with a vivid imagination even posited that it was a racial slur aimed at obama.but it turns out that the taxpayer-funded npr allowed that very term to be used four years ago in reference to another female politician , geraldine ferraro , to recall an almost identical political defeat .
talk of the nation host neal conan used schlonged , moreover , in the same breath in which he mentioned ferraro s untimely death , as noted by pj media s michael walsh.here is the transcript.sad news to report from this past weekend .
geraldine ferraro died of blood cancer at the age of 75 , the three-term congresswoman from queens , the first woman to run for vice president of the united states in 1984 , the first woman on a major party ticket to do so .
and chris cillizza , that ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls , but that s a historic moment .
