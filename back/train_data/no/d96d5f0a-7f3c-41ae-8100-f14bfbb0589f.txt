doha ( reuters ) - qatari emir sheikh tamim bin hamad al-thani is expected to attend the annual summit of gulf arab heads of state in kuwait on dec. 5 and 6 , qatar s foreign minister said on sunday , despite a deep dispute within the group .
the ministerial meeting will be attended tomorrow , and ( for ) the summit , god willing , the emir , sheikh mohammed bin abdulrahman al-thani said in a speech .
the rift between the six-nation gulf cooperation council members saudi arabia , bahrain and the united arab emirates ( uae ) , on one side , and qatar on the other had put this year s annual meeting in doubt .
there was no immediate comment from other gulf nations on the qatari announcement .
the dispute , which erupted in june , revolves around allegations by saudi arabia , the uae , bahrain and egypt that qatar supports terrorism , a charge doha denies .
the four countries have severed diplomatic , trade and travel links with doha , in a move qatar says is inflicting collective punishment on its people but its opponents call a legitimate response to its policies .
qatar says the four countries are trying to force doha to fall in line with their own foreign policy .
