washington ( reuters ) - the united states was deeply troubled by the conviction and jail sentence of a crimean dissident opposed to russia s annexation of ukraine s crimea and called on tuesday for his release , the state department said .
a russian court last week found crimean tatar leader ilmi umerov guilty of separatism and sentenced him to two years in a prison colony .
he was convicted for his opposition to russia s attempted annexation of crimea and given a harsher sentence than the russian occupation prosecutor requested , the state department said in a statement .
this compounds past injustices in the case , including his confinement for several weeks of punitive psychiatric treatment in 2016 .
we call on the russian occupation authorities to immediately release umerov and vacate his conviction .
