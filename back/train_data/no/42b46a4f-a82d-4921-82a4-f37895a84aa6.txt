manila ( reuters ) - philippine president rodrigo duterte on friday ruled out a resumption of stalled peace talks with communist rebels if they do not stop guerrilla attacks , two days after lawmakers ousted the last leftist from his cabinet .
an angry duterte in may ordered the scrapping of formal peace talks with the communist party of the philippines ( cpp ) after the military said fighters from the cpp s military wing , the new people s army , stepped up offensives in the countryside .
there will be no talks until you declare a ceasefire , period , he said in a speech in his home city of davao .
and if you say you want another war , be my guest .
duterte gave two cabinet positions to left-wing activists recommended by the cpp when he assumed power last year to show his commitment to ending nearly five decades of conflict , in which more than 40,000 people have been killed .
the legislature s commission on appointments on wednesday rejected the appointment of leftist rafael mariano as agrarian reform minister .
mariano s exit came less than a month after the same panel ousted judy taguiwalo , another leftist , as social welfare minister , in what some commentators say is a move by duterte s allies to punish the cpp .
but duterte s office in both cases expressed disappointment the ministers had not been approved .
in the philippines , all ministers must be approved by the house panel , but the process can take more than a year .
the president is furious about repeated attacks by the communist rebels who , he said , have killed many soldiers and police .
he is also angered by what he sees as duplicity by the cpp s exiled political leaders , to whom he says he has made many concessions and has shown good faith by making the peace process a top priority for his administration .
the rebels chief negotiator , luis jalandoni , has said the government s demand to stop guerrilla attacks is ridiculous because soldiers are attacking villages where rebels are based .
