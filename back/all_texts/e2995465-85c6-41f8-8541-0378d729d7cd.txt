It was just a few weeks ago that President-elect Donald Trump repeatedly attacked the cast of Broadway show Hamilton for giving a respectful speech about equality and diversity to his Vice President, Mike Pence.
Despite the fact that Pence was not offended and did not want an apology, Trump railed against the cast for days, causing his rabid supporters to call for a boycott.It turns out, Trump and his supporters got a brutal reality check today.
Hamilton, the Broadway show that Trump called overrated in one of his tweets, just broke a record for ticket sales.
Guess the #BoycottHamilton movement didn t really have the effect Trump and his minions had hoped!TwitterHamilton shattered the Broadway record for the most money made in a single week, selling $3.3 million in tickets.
The last time any Broadway show came close to this was in 2013, when Wicked sold $3.2 million in a nine-show week.
Hamilton only had eight shows, and it still surpassed Wicked.
And that s not all.
According to the New York Times, whom Trump also attacks regularly, this also happened: [Hamilton] set a record for the highest premium ticket price charged by a Broadway box office $998 although some people have paid more buying tickets from resellers.
TwitterTwitterIt just goes to show that although Trump, Pence and their moronic supporters want to set this country back several decades, that s not what the majority of the country wants.
When the Hamilton cast spoke about freedom, diversity, and equality, those are the values that resonate with most of us.
The outpouring of support that Hamilton has received since the #HamiltonBoycott proves that the majority of the country does not agree with Trump (after all, he lost the popular vote by MILLIONS) and his bigotry has no place in America.Featured image via Alex Wong and Facebook
