diyarbakir ( reuters ) - turkish authorities have issued arrest warrants for 25 soldiers across turkey and the breakaway turkish cypriot state in northern cyprus , security sources said , as part of a widening crackdown following last year s failed military coup .
the soldiers , on active duty and of varying ranks in turkey s military , are being sought across 13 provinces and turkish northern cyprus , the sources said .
prosecutors in the southeastern province of mardin ordered the arrest of the soldiers over the secret military structuring of the network of u.s.-based cleric fethullah gulen , the sources said .
gulen , who has lived in self-imposed exile in the united states since 1999 , is accused by ankara of masterminding the july 15 coup attempt .
he has denied involvement .
since the coup , more than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial over links to gulen , while 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the military , public and private sectors .
rights groups and some of turkey s western allies have voiced concern about the crackdown , fearing the government is using the coup as a pretext to quash dissent .
the government says only such a purge could neutralize the threat represented by gulen s network , which it says deeply infiltrated institutions such as the army , schools and courts .
