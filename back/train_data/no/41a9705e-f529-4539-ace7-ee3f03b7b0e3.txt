a total disgrace !
donald j. trump ( @ realdonaldtrump ) july 5 , 2016a russian government-controlled company signed an agreement to sell nuclear technology to cuba this week.cuba plans to purchase nuclear medical technology , radiation research , training for nuclear specialists , and staff to help manage radioactive waste .
ultimately , the country may purchase nuclear reactors and storage space for nuclear waste from russia.this is not the first time cuba has attempted to build a nuclear reactor .
with the help and financial assistance of the former soviet union , cuba tried the to build two 440-megawatt nuclear power reactors near the city of cienfuegos .
construction of the reactors began in 1983 , but the collapse of the soviet union disrupted construction.former cuban president fidel castro says that the country invested $ 1.1 billion into the project , and cost estimates to complete the partially constructed reactors range from $ 300 million to $ 750 million .
