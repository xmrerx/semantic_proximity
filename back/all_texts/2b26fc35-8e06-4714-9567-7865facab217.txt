WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz’s campaign is vetting former business executive Carly Fiorina as a possible vice presidential pick, ABC News said on Friday.
Earlier, Cruz’s campaign said it had narrowed its running mate options to a short list.
Fiorina, a former CEO of Hewlett Packard, dropped out of the presidential race in February.
