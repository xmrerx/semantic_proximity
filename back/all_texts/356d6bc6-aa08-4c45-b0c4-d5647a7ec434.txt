WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday that fresh sanctions on North Korea approved by the U.N. Security Council were just a small step and nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen.
We think it s just another very small step, not a big deal, Trump told reporters in reference to the sanctions approved on Monday.
I don t know if it has any impact, but certainly it was nice to get a 15 to nothing vote.
But those sanctions are nothing compared to what ultimately will have to happen.
