What a bunch of unbelievable traitors we have in this White House Kerry can t be that naive or dumb to Iran s evil.
The more he opens his mouth, the more I question his motives.Secretary of State John Kerry told NBC s Chuck Todd that the arms and the missiles were thrown in as an add-on to this nuclear agreement.
So this [deal] focused on getting rid of the principal problem in the region, which is Iran s threat to Israel, their threat to the region, to have a nuclear capacity, Kerry said defending the deal.
We believe with this, for years into the future, we have this incredible capacity to have access, to have inspections, to hold them accountable.
And by the way, even though the arms and the missiles, they were thrown in as an add-on to this nuclear agreement.
It was always contemplated if Iran did come and deal on the nuclear program, that was going to be lifted.
