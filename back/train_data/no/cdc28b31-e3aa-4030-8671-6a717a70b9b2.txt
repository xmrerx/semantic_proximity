daily shooter 21st century wirethe dallas sniper production .
what was it really about ? dallas , like so many other mass shooting events , coincidentally triggers a familiar pattern of convenient political and social conditioning effects.brasscheck tv says : it is odd , isn t it ? high profile school shooting , followed by high profile church shooting , followed high profile gay nightclub shooting now this .
it s as if they re checking off all the demographic boxes and the conclusion is always the same:1 .
guns are the problem 2 .
domestic terrorism is out of control 3 .
we need to assemble a list of risky people and take away their guns 4. who do they want to put on these lists ?
veterans , blacks , anyone with political opinions , anyone deemed mentally unstablewe need to do all this to protect school children , church goers , gays , and cops .
what reasonable person can say no to this , right ?
