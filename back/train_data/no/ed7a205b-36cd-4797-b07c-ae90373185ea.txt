yaounde ( reuters ) - a cameroonian journalist jailed for over two years for contact with islamist militant group boko haram is set to be freed after a court on thursday shortened his sentence , his lawyer said .
radio france internationale reporter ahmed abba was arrested in july 2015 and sentenced in april this year to 10 years on terrorism charges that rights groups denounced as a sham .
authorities said they found evidence on abba s computer of attacks planned by boko haram , whose islamist insurgency in nigeria , cameroon and neighboring countries has cost the lives of at least 20,000 people since 2009 .
abba has denied knowledge of attacks and protested his innocence .
the sentence was reduced to two years on thursday when an appeals court dropped the terrorism charges but upheld less serious charges of non-denunciation of terrorism .
technically , mr. ahmed can be outside today , tomorrow or the day after tomorrow , given that he has already been in jail for over two years , his lawyer charles tchoungang told reuters .
abba s forthcoming release comes amid a crackdown on dissent by president paul biya who is seeking to extend his 35-year rule in elections next year .
the government is confronting a growing separatist insurgency in the country s anglophone regions as well as the threat from boko haram .
patrice nganang , a prize-winning cameroonian author who lives in new york , was arrested during a visit to cameroon this month for writing a facebook post critical of biya .
nganang is being held in jail until court proceedings next month .
rights groups and rfi welcomed thursday s ruling .
this ruling is a victory for ahmed abba who has been detained for more than two years simply for doing his job as a journalist , said amnesty international researcher ilaria allegrozzi .
