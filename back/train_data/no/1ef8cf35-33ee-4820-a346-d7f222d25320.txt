and the winner is the anti-billionaire or the guy who detests rich people or how about the guy who made a lot of people rich during his campaign , but did absolutely nothing for the less fortunate with his windfall .
in fact , we reported about hundreds of homeless people who were kicked out of a venue they used as a warming hut on the coldest night of the year because socialist bernie sanders ( who cares so much for the poor and underprivileged ) was about to host a rally in that venue .
oh well the show must go on who has time for homeless people who likely won t vote .right hypocrite bernie ? the small-dollar fundraising juggernaut that has kept bernie sanders s insurgent white house bid afloat far longer than anticipated has generated another unexpected impact : a financial windfall for his team of washington consultants.as donations surged this year , the sanders campaign ratcheted up its spending each month , racing through an astounding $ 45 million in march alone.by the end of march , the self-described democratic socialist senator from vermont had spent nearly $ 166 million on his campaign more than any other 2016 presidential contender , including rival hillary clinton .
more than $ 91 million went to a small group of admakers and media buyers who produced a swarm of commercials and placed them on television , radio and online , according to a washington post analysis of federal election commission reports.while the vast majority of that money was passed along to television stations and websites to pay for the advertising , millions in fees were kept by the companies , the post calculated .
while it is impossible to determine precisely how much the top consultants have earned , fec filings indicate the top three media firms have reaped payments of seven figures.sanders s money blitz , fueled by a $ 27 average donation that he repeatedly touts , has improbably made the anti-billionaire populist the biggest spender so far in the election cycle .
the campaign s wealth has been a surprising boon for vendors across the county who signed on to his long-shot bid.the large profits stem in part from the fact that no one in sanders s campaign imagined he would generate such enormous financial support .
so unlike clinton , he did not cap how much his consultants could earn in commissions from what was expected to be a bare-bones operation , according to campaign officials.a campaign spokesman declined to comment on whether sanders feels the high fees earned by his media consultants are appropriate .
