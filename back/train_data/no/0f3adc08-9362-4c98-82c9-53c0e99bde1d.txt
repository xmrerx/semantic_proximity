as donald trump s support has crumbled in the past month , donations to hillary clinton s presidential campaign have been surging .
in the most recent reports filed with the federal elections commission ( fec ) , clinton has just reported her best month yet of fundraising.the campaign ended july with $ 58.5 million on hand , up from $ 44.4 million on june 30 , according to its report released by the federal election commission on saturday .
its $ 52.3 million raised and $ 38.2 million spent were both the highest of any month this cycle.even more positive for clinton , most of those donors were first time small-dollar donors , of the sort that have been so important to other candidates like senator bernie sanders and president obama .
58 % of the money clinton raised in july was under $ 200 .
before , those donors represented 31 % of her base.clinton has spent most of the money on campaign ads in swing states , while trump only announced plans for a meager advertising buy in the last week .
he did not advertise during the olympics , which most experts believe is a crucial time to reach prospective voters who aren t news junkies .
clinton bought time for an ad which highlighted trump s habit of outsourcing the manufacturing of his clothing lines to other countries.according to the realclearpolitics current average of polling , clinton has a 5.7 % lead against trump nationally .
he hasn t had the lead in a single national poll since the week of july 22 , when the republican national convention was underway.since then trump has been involved in a series of controversies , including his repeated attack on the family of a fallen u.s. soldier .
allegations of underhanded dealings and connections to the russian government eventually led to the ouster of his top campaign official , paul manafort .
trump has brought in the head of the bigoted website breitbart.com , stephen bannon , to run his campaign in an emergency shakeup.featured image via flickr
