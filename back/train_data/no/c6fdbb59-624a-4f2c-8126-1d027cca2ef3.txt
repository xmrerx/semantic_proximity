vince foster part ii ? the death by barbell of disgraced un official john ashe could become a bigger obsession for conspiracy theorists than vince foster s 1993 suicide.ashe who was facing trial for tax fraud died wednesday afternoon in his house in westchester county .
the un said he d had a heart attack .
but the local dobbs ferry police said thursday that his throat had been crushed , presumably by a barbell he dropped while pumping iron.ashe was due in court monday with his chinese businessman co-defendant ng lap seng , who is charged with smuggling $ 4.5 million into the us since 2013 and lying that it was to buy art and casino chips.ng was identified in a 1998 senate report as the source of hundreds of thousands of dollars illegally funneled through an arkansas restaurant owner , charlie trie , to the democratic national committee during the clinton administration .
( ng was not charged with any crime .
) ng and trie had visited the white house several times for democratic fund-raising events and were photographed with then-president bill clinton and first lady hillary clinton.one source told me , during the trial , the prosecutors would have linked ashe to the clinton bagman ng .
it would have been very embarrassing .
his death was conveniently timed .
