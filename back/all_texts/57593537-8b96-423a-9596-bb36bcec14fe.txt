CNN Money has released a report saying that Donald Trump violated Fox News rules during the last Republican primary debate.The claim comes from an unnamed rival campaign.
Apparently Trump consulted with his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, during Thursday s debate in Detroit.
This is a clear violation of the rules that were set before the debate.
What s even more interesting, is that the report indicates that this is not the first time Trump has broken debate rules.
This is just the most egregious example.CNN Money reports: While that exchange was the clearest violation of debate rules to date, the sources said, it followed a pattern: At multiple debates, Trump has consulted with his campaign manager Corey Lewandowski backstage even though it was expressly forbidden by the networks.Thursday night s debate in Detroit marked a new extreme, however, as Lewandowski went directly onto the stage to meet with Trump during the commercial break.
As in previous debates, Fox News had explicitly informed the campaigns that candidates were not allowed to communicate with their campaign staff during commercial breaks, the sources said.When Lewandowski was asked by Fox News staff to leave the stage, he refused to do so, according to a source at Fox News.Unable to get Lewandowski off the stage, Fox News representatives informed the other three campaigns that, because the Trump campaign had broken the rules, they too could consult with their candidates.
It isn t surprising that Trump would need assistance during a debate.
Not to imply that any of the Republican candidates are particularly better than Trump, in terms of policy, but Trump can barely string together enough words to create a cohesive sentence.
Trump isn t a politician; he is a has been reality television star used to having people feed him lines.
This just proves that he will do or so anything to become president.Featured image from Gage Skidmore via Flickr
