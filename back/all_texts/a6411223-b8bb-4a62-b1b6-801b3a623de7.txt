When you go after a city that s home to most of the late night shows that air on television, guess what, you re going to get roasted.
Which is exactly what just happened to Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz when he arrived in New York City after his New York values comments.In a video montage pieced together by Politico, they show host after host going after Cruz, and even Trump, with some jokes that clearly show their disdain for the Texas senator and real estate mogul/reality television star.You ll see Conan O Brien first, and yes, he broadcasts out of Los Angeles now, but was long a New York resident when his show was out of the city.
Then you ll see Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon, Late Show host Stephen Colbert, Late Night host Seth Meyers, and of course Trevor Noah from The Daily Show.One of the best digs at Cruz came from Seth Meyers when he said: Hillary rode the subway with a group of reporters and her Secret Service detail, then after the train was gone, Ted Cruz scurried across the tracks and disappeared into a hole.
And he s absolutely correct, not only is Cruz a rat, is a disingenuous one at that.The gloves came off, and rightfully so.
It was sincerely a beautiful thing to witness.
These Republican candidates are a parody in and of themselves and deserve every ounce of mockery they receive.Watch the video mash-up here from Politico:Featured image via video screen capture
