BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel said on Friday she could well imagine a European finance minister but stressed that the creation of such a position would have to be underpinned with reforms of substance.
We certainly need to strengthen the governance of the euro zone ...
I have nothing against a European finance minister.
I can well imagine that, she told a joint news conference in Berlin with French Prime Minister Edouard Philippe.
But what is important to me is that we underpin the slogans - economic government and European finance minister and budget - with substance.
Merkel added that although monetary policy in the euro zone was harmonized, economic cooperation was still incoherent.
