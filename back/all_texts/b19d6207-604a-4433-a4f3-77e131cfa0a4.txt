We re not sure what s funnier, the fact that he talks about being a pretty good president or that he actually thinks anyone believes him when he says he can t run again because the Constitution prohibits it, saying: the law s the law.
When did this President ever let a little thing like the Constitution or the law get in the way of his agenda?
