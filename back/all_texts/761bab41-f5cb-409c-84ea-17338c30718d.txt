Republicans pledge to make sure Trump s Supreme Court nominee goes through just hit a little bit of a snag with the disappearance of their filibuster-proof majority.On Tuesday, CBS reported that Democrats managed to gather the necessary 41 votes to ruin Donald Trump and his cohorts week:The crucial 41st vote came from Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware who announced his decision Monday as the Senate Judiciary Committee met to vote on Gorsuch s nomination.Coons said that he had decided to oppose President Donald Trump s nominee over concerns that include his vague answers in his hearing.Coons opposition will prevent Republicans from reaching the 60 votes they need to move Gorsuch over procedural hurdles to a final Senate vote.Unfortunately, this doesn t mean that we won t see Gorsuch sitting on the Supreme Court.
Republicans are likely to change the Senate rules to allow Gorsuch to be confirmed with a simple majority of 51 votes rather than the current 60 votes needed.So far, two Democrats have betrayed Americans by siding with Republicans West Virginia s Joe Manchin and North Dakota s Heidi Heitkamp in supporting Gorsuch s nomination.Things are looking grim for those of us who don t want someone who have proved himself to be the enemy of women and disabled children on the Supreme Court.
Keep fighting.
