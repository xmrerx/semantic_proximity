clark freeport zone , philippines ( reuters ) - southeast asian defense ministers on monday expressed grave concern over north korea s nuclear and missile programs and urged the reclusive country to meet its international obligations and resume communications .
north korea is working to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of striking the u.s. mainland and has ignored all calls , even from its lone major ally , china , to rein in its weapons programs which it conducts in defiance of u.n. security council resolutions .
defense ministers from the association of southeast asian nations ( asean ) , in a joint statement , underscored the need to maintain peace and stability in the region and called for the exercise of self-restraint and the resumption of dialogue to de-escalate tensions in the korean peninsula .
they are due to meet with their counterparts from the united states , china , japan , south korea , india , australia , russia and new zealand on tuesday when north korea , the disputed south china sea and terrorism are expected to top the agenda .
u.s. defense secretary jim mattis has said he will talk with asian allies about north korea and the crisis caused by its reckless provocations .
mattis s trip to asia , which will also include stops in thailand and south korea , comes just weeks before donald trump s first visit to asia as u.s. president .
in the same statement , the ministers reiterated the importance of safety and freedom of navigation in and over-flight above the south china sea and called for self restraint in the conduct of activities .
they also vowed to work together to combat terrorism as they condemned the attack by the maute militant group in the southern philippine city of marawi .
the philippines on monday announced the end of five months of military operations in marawi after a fierce and unfamiliar urban war that marked the country s biggest security crisis in years .
