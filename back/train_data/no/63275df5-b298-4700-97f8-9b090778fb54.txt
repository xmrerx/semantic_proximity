here s a partial transcript of her rant about the black community blaming whites for racism : if you believe in what you re doing , why hide your face ?
the kkk came out swinging .
they had a permit .
they had a right to be there .
i am not condoning what the kkk did .
i do not condone what they stand for , not at all .
but they had the right to be there like everyone else .
antifa and black lives matter showed up with weapons , wanting a fight .
we as black people , we have got to get off the plantation .
we have got to stop believing the lies .
we as black people , are just as complicit on slavery as the white people .
not all white people own slaves .
not all black people were slaves .
we are refusing to acknowledge that we as black people had a hand in slavery .
3,076 slaves were sold by black people during the civil war period .
