sydney ( reuters ) - australia s world-famous uluru , formerly known as ayers rock , will be closed to climbers from 2019 , its management board said on wednesday , ending a decades-long campaign by aborigines to protect their sacred monolith in the northern territory .
a board of eight traditional owners and four government officials voted unanimously to close the rock to climbers , a spokesperson told reuters .
the climb is a men s sacred area , the men have closed it , chairman sammy wilson added in a statement .
it has cultural significance that includes certain restrictions .
the unesco world heritage-listed 348-metre ( 1,142 ft ) rock , known for its shifting red-ochre colors , is a top tourist drawcard , attracting around 300,000 visitors each year , despite its remote desert location near alice springs .
the traditional owners of uluru , the anangu people , have called for the climb to be closed since 1985 , when the park was placed in indigenous hands .
the rock s board said in a report in 2010 that they would close the attraction to climbers if the proportion of visitors who tried to climb it dropped below 20 percent .
they took the matter to a vote on wednesday after data showed the number of climbers had fallen below that threshold , from about three quarters throughout the 1990s to just 16.2 per cent between 2011 and 2015 .
the ban will take effect on oct. 26 , 2019 , exactly 34 years after uluru was handed back to its traditional owners .
australians are still the most common visitors to climb the rock , followed by the japanese , according to parks australia .
the climb is closed about 77 percent of the time due to dangerous weather or cultural reasons .
there have been 36 confirmed fatalities at uluru since records were first kept in the 1950s , with the most recent in 2010 .
