There was plenty of crazy material from the Republicans this week and in order to cover as much of their embarrassing antics as possible, NBC s Saturday Night Live broke with their usual format and jammed four openings on their show last night.
The result was a series of hilarious and stinging skits.It all began with Beck Bennett as Jake Tapper when he hosted the week-in-review montage which highlighted Darrell Hammond as Donald Trump telling the world how great he his with a bewildered looking Chris Christie, played by Bobby Moynihan, staring in the background.
Hammond-as-Trump said: I really am running the best campaign, aren t I?
The media s saying they haven t seen anything like this, not since Germany in the 1930s.
I mean, everyone loves me: racists, ugly racists, people who didn t know they were racist.
Then it was the hilarious Kate McKinnon playing Hillary Clinton giving a victory speech for her post-Super Tuesday victory: Thank you for trusting that I, Hillary Clinton, can bring this country together.
Just like I brought these ten black people and one Muslim person together behind me tonight for this speech.
Then it was Bennett-as-Tapper interviewing Ted Cruz, played by Taran Killam, but not before a warning for the audience that they were about to see Ted Cruz s whole face.
Asked about Thursday s GOP debate, Killam-as-Cruz said: The debate was so much fun.
I talked policy, I laid out my plan for America, and right at the end I ate a tiny, little white booger off my lip.
Then finally Mitt Romney, played by Jason Sudeikis, joined Bennet-as-Tapper to discuss Donald Trump: For the last nine months, I ve sat down and watched Donald Trump say something every day that was either racist or sexist.
And we in the GOP we do not say racist and sexist things; we imply them subtly over decades and decades of policy.
