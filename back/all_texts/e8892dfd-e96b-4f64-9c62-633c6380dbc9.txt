Perhaps this young girl aspires to be the First Lady someday.
Is it really fair to fire her for making racist remarks on social media when our President and First Lady have been on a hate/blame the white man media tour since they entered the White House?
Meet Illinois resident Shana Poohpooh Latrice, a Brookfield Zoo employee who made the mistake of sharing an Instagram photo on Facebook with the caption, At work serving these rude ass white people :She made the even bigger mistake of tagging the photo as having been taken at the zoo.As a result, Brookfield Zoo got bombarded with a litany of complaints from pissed-off zoo visitors who found her comments to be clearly hateful and racist.
Some even demanded that Latrice be fired for her mistake, and judging by what spokeswoman Sondra Katzen told reporters, that s exactly what s going to happen.
This employee s statements in social media are in violation of our policies and do not reflect our institution s values, she said.
We have zero tolerance for these kinds of divisive behaviors.
We treat all employment matters confidentially, but rest assured that we have taken prompt action to remedy the situation.
