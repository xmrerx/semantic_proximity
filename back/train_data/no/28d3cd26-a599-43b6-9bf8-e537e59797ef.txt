minsk ( reuters ) - in the shadow of disused soviet-era factories in minsk , a street lined with eclectic bars , art galleries and yoga studios has become a haven from the vigilant eyes of the belarussian authorities .
this place is like an island , said yegor , 21 , who works at popular bar hooligan .
it s the street of freedom .
the government of president alexander lukashenko , who has ruled belarus for the past 23 years and has boasted that he is the last and only dictator in europe , has little tolerance for any opposition .
a powerful police force and feared state security keep citizens in check .
but police patrols are rare in oktyabrskaya , partly due to its location on an out-of-the-way peninsula in a bend of the river svislach .
when the first restaurant opened there in 2012 , few visitors came but now it ranks among the most fashionable quarters of minsk .
such is the growing popularity of that oktyabrskaya that investors such as belgazprombank , a subsidiary of state-owned russian lender gazprombank , have big plans for the district .
earlier this year the bank purchased part of a factory there and intends to turn it into a gallery , restaurant and theater complex .
the manufacturing sector has not entirely abandoned oktyabrskaya - one machine-making factory named after the 1917 october revolution ( mzor ) still operates there .
financial difficulties prompted state-owned mzor to lease or sell some of its facilities to oktyabrskaya s developers , but the firm still maintains some production with a reduced workforce .
mikhail , who has worked at the factory for 42 years , said he approves of the influx of new hipster businesses .
the street has come back to life , he said .
oktyabrskaya s long-term future ultimately depends on the authorities good favor , cultural analyst maksim zhbankov said .
for now they tolerate it .
but i can t say that someone won t turn up tomorrow and say they ve decided to tear it all down , he said .
