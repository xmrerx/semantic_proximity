remember when colleges and university were one of the best places in america to have discussions about politics ?
to be clear , the university does in fact support free speech unless of course , you re a trump supporter several events for ohio university s greek week , an annual , weeklong event focused on philanthropy , have been canceled after some sorority and fraternity life members painted build the wall on an area typically designated for graffiti last week.the greek week events , set to take place between april 11 and 18 , were amended after unnamed members of sorority and fraternity life painted the graffiti wall by bentley hall , including the phrase build the wall , according to a letter sent sunday to sororities and fraternities.the phrase has been a part of republican presidential candidate donald trump s campaign to construct a wall between the united states and mexico to discourage immigration from south and central american countries.the letter was addressed to the ou sorority and fraternity life community and supporters , and was signed by the interfraternity council , multicultural greek council , national pan-hellenic council and the women s panhellenic association .
this phrase is offensive and hurtful to many individuals as it is directly tied to the hispanic/latino/a community , makes them feel marginalized , and the message was interpreted that they do not belong at ohio university , the letter stated .
