paris ( reuters ) - france s foreign minister said on wednesday he was worried that u.s. president donald trump could put into doubt a nuclear deal between iran and a group of major world powers .
the agreement which was passed two years ago enables iran to give up on a nuclear weapon and so avoid proliferation .
we have to guarantee this stance , jean-yves le drian said during a visit to science-po university in paris .
i am worried at this moment in time by the position of president trump , who could put into question this accord .
and if this accord is put into question then voices in iran will speak up to say : let s also have a nuclear weapon .
we are in an extremely dangerous spiral for the world .
