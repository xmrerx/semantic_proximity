edinburgh ( reuters ) - an agreement to keep northern ireland in regulatory alignment with the european union after brexit could be replicated in other parts of the uk , nicola sturgeon , the head of scotland s devolved pro-independence government , said on monday .
earlier , irish government sources said the british government had agreed to maintain such alignment for northern ireland , which is part of the uk but shares a land border with the republic of ireland , an eu member state .
if one part of the united kingdom can retain regulatory alignment with the european union and effectively stay in the single market ( which is the right solution for northern ireland ) there is surely no good practical reason why others can t , sturgeon said on twitter .
in the 2016 referendum in which the uk as a whole voted to leave the eu , a large majority of scots voted to remain in the bloc .
the british government has so far ruled out any special brexit deal for scotland that would reflect that .
the devolved scottish government has been campaigning for the uk to stay within the european single market and customs union , and had originally argued that scotland could stay in the single market even if the rest of the uk left the trading area .
