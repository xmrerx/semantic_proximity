father gerald murphy goes off on hillary clinton following her speech at the al smith elite charity dinner last night in new york , where hillary used a quote of the pope s as a way to fake his endorsement of her .
given what her staff said about catholic faith about an attempt to subvert it , there should have been a statement right at the start saying , i disown everything that was written in those emails .
donald trump has said quite clearly he s pro-life , catholics are quite heartened by that .
i wish hillary clinton would change her position .
but at least don t try and pretend that the pope is endorsing her by quoting him selectively .
thank you , father !
father gerald murray goes off on @ hillaryclinton who refused to apologize to catholics & supports partial birth abortion !
