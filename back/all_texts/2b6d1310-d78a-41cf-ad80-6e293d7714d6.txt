The man suspended from his TV anchor job for faking his own news is furious about the spread of fake news.
Brian Williams, who was forced to take a 6-month vacation before being permanently relieved of his Nightly News duties on NBC, railed about the new epidemic of fake news in his MSNBC show earlier this week.
Fake news played a role in this election and continues to find a wide audience, Williams whined Tuesday night in his middle-of-the-night show.Specifically, Williams singled out Trump s incoming national security adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn, and his son for spreading falsehoods.
Williams is no stranger to fake news.
He was punished in February 2015 for lying about a helicopter ride in Iraq that he claimed came under heavy enemy fire.In 2003, Williams and an NBC team were reporting in Iraq when three Chinook helicopters came under fire.Williams claimed he was on one of the copters that were hit, when he aboard a different helicopter located about an hour behind the other three.
I don t know what screwed up in my mind that caused me to conflate one aircraft with another, Williams told Stars and Stripes after crew members from the helicopters that were hit that day came forward.Questions were also raised about Williams coverage in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans in 2005.Williams claimed he could see bodies in flooding from his hotel room in the French Quarter.But the New Orleans Advocate reported that the French Quarter was largely spared in the catastrophe and saw little flooding.-NYP
