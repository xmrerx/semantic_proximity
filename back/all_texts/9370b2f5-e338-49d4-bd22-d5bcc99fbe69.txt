DUBLIN (Reuters) - Ireland s Deputy Prime Minister resisted calls to resign in a crisis that has left the country on the brink of a general election, saying on Monday it is up to an ongoing judge-led tribunal to judge her conduct.
The Tribunal will objectively judge the appropriateness of my conduct.
I look forward to giving my evidence to the Tribunal early in January, Fitzgerald wrote in a statement on Twitter following further calls for her to step down on Monday over her handling of a case involving a police whistleblower.
