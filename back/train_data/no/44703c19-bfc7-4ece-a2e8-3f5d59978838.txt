president trump spoke of abraham lincoln and ford s theatre with heartfelt fondness.ford s theatre is administered and maintained by the national park service as a historic landmark , but it is also a working theater operated by the ford s theatre society .
the gala is a fundraising event for the fts , whose purpose is to secure private financing for much of the theater s programming .
it dates back to the carter administration.traditionally , the president has hosted a pre-gala reception at the white house .
however , the obamas chose not to attend in 2015 or 2016 , citing the death of beau biden and scheduling conflicts as reasons .
this led to a complete cancellation of last year s gala .
