We couldn t have said it better!
The brilliant Krauthammer rips into Obama for his visit to Hiroshima EPIC!
Krauthammer: Obama closed the apology tour today in Hiroshima.
And to say it wasn t a form of apology, of course he wasn t going to use the word.
And yes he did speak in the abstract but he did it in Hiroshima Look, this is a visit he should have made next year as a private citizen.
In which case he could speak like a naive private citizen about escaping the logic of fear And the president speaking as president, representing the United States, I thought it was embarrassing utopianism and the implicit apology dishonored our nation.
