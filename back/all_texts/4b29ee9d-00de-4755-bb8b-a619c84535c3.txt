The salt police are coming to NYC!
Thanks to the nutty liberal mayor of New York City, we have a new regulation on salt.
Restaurants will be fined up to $600 for not providing salt intro on menus.
Oy vey!
NEW YORK (AP) New York City plans to start enforcing a first-of-its-kind requirement for chain restaurants to use icons to warn patrons of salty foods after getting an appeals court s go-ahead Thursday to start issuing fines.The novel rule took effect in December, and some eateries already have added the requisite salt-shaker-like icons to menu items that contain more salt than doctors recommend ingesting in an entire day.But penalties have been in limbo as the National Restaurant Association fights the measure in court.
That clash is ongoing, but an appeals court Thursday lifted a temporary hold on issuing the fines while the case plays out.
Fines can be up to $600.The city will start enforcing the rule June 6.Democratic Mayor Bill de Blasio applauded the appeals court s decision on what he called a common-sense regulation that will help New Yorkers make better decisions and lead healthier lives.
The city won the first round of the lawsuit in a trial court in February; the restaurant association appealed.Via: FOX 5 NY
