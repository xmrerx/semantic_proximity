BEIJING (Reuters) - The United States is probing North Korea to see whether it is interested in dialogue and has multiple direct channels of communication with Pyongyang, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Saturday.
We are probing, so stay tuned, Tillerson told a small group of reporters during a trip to China.
We ask: Would you like to talk?
We have lines of communications to Pyongyang.
We re not in a dark situation.
