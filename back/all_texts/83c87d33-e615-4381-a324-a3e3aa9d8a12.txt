You can always count on local newscasters to make complete asses of themselves, with invariably hilarious results.
And in the age of YouTube, the best fuck-ups can be permanently preserved for all time.The following compilation was assembled by the folks at NewsBeFunny and includes all of the greatest (and not so great) news fails of 2015.
Of course, they couldn t help but to include some cable news bloopers in the mix.Along those lines is the unbelievably stupid clip of a Fox News Channel reporter hurling an ax at a target, then wildly missing the target and instead hitting a military marching band member performing on the other side of the target.
Worse, the reporter reacted by pulling one of these: \_( )_/ The Fox News ax incident should really be blamed on the producers who decided it d be a great idea to place human beings on the other side of a giant target, then to have a doofus reporter attempt to toss at ax at the target.
Doy.Other bloopers are, naturally, not safe for work, while others involve the usual video trolls disrupting on-the-street reporters during live news coverage.
By the way, not all of the reporters are American.
Included in the mix is a reporter from Scandinavia exclaiming fuck!
while on the air.Predictably, there are more than a few reporters being attacked by animals and bugs the latter of which makes for the some of the funniest clips.
Oh, and there s at least one clip of a reporter setting a table on fire during a cooking demonstration.And there s at least one clip of a bystander giving a flamboyant and over-the-top recap of a violent accident.
No autotune remixes are included in the montage.So, sit back an enjoy the fun.
And the stupid.
Lots of stupid.
