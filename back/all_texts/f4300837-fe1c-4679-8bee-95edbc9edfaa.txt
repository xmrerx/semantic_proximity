In his tweet, President Trump mentioned that he spoke South Korea s President Moon and that he informed the President that long gas lines are forming, indicating that the sanctions are working.I spoke with President Moon of South Korea last night.
Asked him how Rocket Man is doing.
Long gas lines forming in North Korea.
Too bad!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 17, 2017In a brilliant, no-holds-barred speech, President Trump made it clear to every leader in the UN assembly that America will not sit back and allow its citizens or its allies to be threatened by the rogue nation of North Korea.
Trump told the UN assembly: No nation on earth has an interest in seeing this band of criminals arm itself with nuclear weapons missiles.
The United States has great strength and patience, but if it is forced to defend itself or its allies, we will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea.
Rocket Man is on a suicide mission for himself, and for his regime.
The United States is ready, willing and able, but hopefully, this will not be necessary.
That s what the United Nations is all about.
That s what the United Nations is for.
