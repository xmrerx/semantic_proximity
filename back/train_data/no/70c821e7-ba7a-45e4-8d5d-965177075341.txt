equinox los angeles , one of the swankiest gyms in america , where celebrities like chloe kardashian , mickey rourke , renee zellweger and sean combs have been seen exiting is apparently okay with accepting their exorbitant fees from gym members , as long as they don t support our current president , donald j. trump.on their facebook page , equinox makes no secret about the fact that transgenders are welcome at their dc location : members pay $ 200 to $ 300 initiation fees and $ 160 to $ 250 monthly rates .
they rave about the gym s amenities , which include classes taught by former olympians and spa treatments.equinox gym makes it pretty clear however , in one of their facebook posts that they tolerate all people of all beliefs .
they actually tell facebook users that if they have narrow minds that they need not apply .
hmmm .so asking a member to leave because he supports our president isn t narrow minded ?
watch the video below , as one of the sweetest conservative voices in social media , jesse lee peterson tells his story of how he was treated by equinox gym in los angeles .
( the video cuts off part of jesse s head , but his story is definitely worth listening to . )
conservatives and specifically , conservative trump supporters are under attack by leftist bullies everywhere .
we need to stand strong and stick together .
there has never been a more important time to stand your ground and be unafraid of who you are .
we can not allow the left to bully us into submission .
i was attacked , bullied and harassed by management @ equinox los angeles because i support trump !
