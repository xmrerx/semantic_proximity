Congressman Hakeem Jeffries says that, while he would welcome an opportunity for Donald Trump to sit down with the Congressional Black Caucus, he does not think Steve Bannon should be present.
Why?
Because of the obvious: He s a stone cold racist.
During an interview with MSNBC on Friday, Jeffries told Katy Tur that the CBC has reached out to Trump about meeting with him.
Actually, they did so on January 19, the day before he was sworn into office.
They would like nothing more than for him to prove that his commitment to working with minority communities is real.However, Jeffries did say that Trump s reaction to a black reporter who asked him about meeting with the CBC during a press conference was strange.
(For the record, that isn t the word I would use.
But I digress.)
Regardless, Jeffries said, the CBC is still looking forward to an open dialogue.
But that feeling does not extend to Bannon, Trump s white supremacist adviser.
Steve Bannon should not be in the room He s a stone cold racist and a white supremacist sympathizer.
It would be hard for me to participate in any meeting with Steve Bannon that normalizes his presence in the White House.
Beyond that, we ll have to see.
Jeffries and the CBC are hoping that they can work with Trump to address issues facing black America, but working with a white supremacist is just asking too much.Watch the interview here, via MSNBC:Featured image via video screen capture
