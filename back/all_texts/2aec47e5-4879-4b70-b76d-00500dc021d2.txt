The unaccomplished Chelsea Clinton, wife of unemployed and perpetually vacationing husband Marc Mezvinsky, and daughter of America s most famous grifters, Bill and Hillary Clinton, took to Twitter to criticize President Trump s ban on transgenders in the military.
It s worth noting that the woman whose wedding was paid for by the charitable Clinton Foundation, has assumed a new role, as the self-assigned new Democrat leader.
There s only one problem with Chelsea s criticism she neglected to mention her father s ban on any military member who dared to be honest about being gay.Apparently in a hypocritical liberal s world, it s okay to ban openly gay military members, but it s hateful and a violation of human rights to ban openly transexual members of our military.
Who better to make a policy that forces thousands of troops to keep secrets about their sexual lifestyle than the impeached former President Bill Clinton right Chelsea?Yesterday, the Washington Post tweeted about the hit piece they did on Trump s transgender ban:Analysis: Trump s stance on LGBT rights has always been confusing https://t.co/tNaSKJ082u Washington Post (@washingtonpost) July 26, 2017Chelsea replied:No.
President Trump has consistently failed to support LGBT equal rights, dignity & safety in the U.S. & around world (e.g.
Chechnya/Russia) https://t.co/nXY5uYjz4S Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) July 26, 2017Don t Ask, Don t Tell (DADT), byname for the former official U.S. policy (1993 2011) regarding the service of homosexuals in the military.
The term was coined after Pres.
Bill Clinton in 1993 signed a law (consisting of statute, regulations, and policy memoranda) directing that military personnel don t ask, don t tell, don t pursue, and don t harass.
When it went into effect on October 1, 1993, the policy theoretically lifted a ban on homosexual service that had been instituted during World War II, though in effect it continued a statutory ban.
