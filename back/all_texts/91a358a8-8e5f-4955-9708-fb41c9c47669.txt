We love AP Reporter Matt Lee!
He is a lone voice in the effort to get the truth from our government the Stae Department spokespeople are unbelievable in their evasiveness!
How do these reporters get any truth?
Well, they don t it goes in a circle as you ll see in the video below.
Ugh!A newly released State Department email features Clinton Foundation-related requests, raising potential ethical issues about the Clinton Foundation during Hillary Clinton s four years as Secretary of State.
So that s what a bunch of reporters confronted State spokeswoman Elizabeth Trudeau about yesterday.Three separate reporters starting with NBC s Abigail Williams asked Trudeau about whether there was any improper relationship between State and the Clinton Foundation.
Trudeau repeatedly downplayed the emails and said the department is regularly in touch with a wide range of people.One reporter pointed out that Clinton had made a pledge not to involve herself with the foundation while she was Secretary of State.
Trudeau shot back that the agreement did not preclude others from talking to foundation staff.At one point, as another reporter the AP s Matt Lee was getting frustrated with the lack of answers, he said this: I m sorry, are you am I not speaking English?
Is this I mean, is it coming across as a foreign I m not asking you if no one is saying it s not okay or it s bad for the department to get a broad variety of input from different people.
Asking the question is whether or not you have determined that there was nothing improper here.
We love you Matt Lee!
