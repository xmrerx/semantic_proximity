WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Barack Obama spoke to President-elect Donald Trump by phone on Saturday, a White House spokesman said on Monday.
The conversation was “one of a handful” between the two men since the Nov. 8 election, White House spokesman Josh Earnest told a regular news briefing.
He declined to say what they talked about.
