washington ( reuters ) - the u.s. senate on monday blocked democratic legislation expanding federal background checks to all gun sales , including those done at gun shows and on the internet .
the senate fell 16 votes short of the 60 needed for advancing the measure , which would have closed a background check loophole .
the senate is now set to vote on two other gun control measures .
