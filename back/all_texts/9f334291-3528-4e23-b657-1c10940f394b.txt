You remember that running Saturday Night Live joke about Sarah Palin being able to see Russia from her house (the real quote is actually fairly similar)?
Well, it just got a lot closer to reality when Sarah Palin offered to go all eagle-eye on Russian hackers from her home in the crystal meth capital of Alaska.
Russia s getting out of hand?
So says the defeated, Palin tweeted Sunday evening.
Not to worry remember I can keep an eye on them from here.

https://t.co/jQBCDV5O3W Sarah Palin (@SarahPalinUSA) December 12, 2016Palin included a link to a Young Conservatives article that claims the liberal media is jumping to conclusions by correctly pointing out that a CIA investigation found that Russia interfered with our election with the explicit goal of getting Donald Trump elected because the FBI who also interfered on Trump s behalf drew a different conclusion in a completely separate investigation.Naturally, Twitter flocked to this latest opportunity to participate in something that should be an Olympic sport tearing Sarah Palin apart piece by piece on social media:@SarahPalinUSA If you're ok with Russian espionage because it helped your guy win, then don't say you're a patriot DudeDiligence (@DudeDiligence) December 12, 2016@SarahPalinUSA Anyone who condones Russia interfering with our elections is not patriotic & should be banished from this country.

Phyllis Kurtenbach (@Pflorian1) December 12, 2016@SarahPalinUSA Not the defeated, but 17 govt agencys & several @GOP congressmen.
You on the other hand are just a traitor like McConnell Shiva (@shivabeach) December 12, 2016@SarahPalinUSA Dont you think you would be better off keeping an eye on the rope that keeps Bristols legs together?
Shiva (@shivabeach) December 12, 2016@SarahPalinUSA No Sarah, not the defeated.
So say the patriots.
I'm disappointed you would dismiss this so cynically.
Alice (@aphoenixalice) December 12, 2016@SarahPalinUSA You obviously either are a part of Trump's Treason or you can't keep an eye on the Russians from your house.
#treasontrump Laura (@lauras_living) December 12, 2016Palin s former running mate John McCain doesn t take the matter as lightly as does the half-term, half-wit former Governor or Alaska.
On Sunday, he called for a select committee to investigate Russia s interference in our election.
It s clear the Russians interfered, McCain said.
Now, whether they intended to interfere to the degree that they were trying to elect a certain candidate, I think that s a subject of investigation.
Palin is an idiot, but she is a consistent source of entertainment.
Unfortunately, too many think like she does.Featured image via Getty Images (Drew Angerer)/screengrab
