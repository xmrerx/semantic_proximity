Newly unearthed video shows Bernie Sanders giving a hatemongering Republican representative a piece of his mind for referring to homos serving in the military.The video, from 1995, shows then Rep. Bernie Sanders taking to the floor in the House of Representatives in response to the slur from Republican Rep. Duke Cunningham.Cunningham used the term when he said, Is there any shocking doubt, the same people that would vote to cut defense $177 billion, the same ones that would put homos in the military, the same ones that would not fund BRAC, the same ones that would not clean up Then Sanders cut him short:https://www.facebook.com/HuffingtonPost/videos/10153689923086130/ My ears may have been playing a trick on me, but I thought I heard the gentleman a moment ago say something quote unquote about homos in the military, Sanders said.
Was I right in hearing that expression?
Absolutely, Cunningham responded.
Putting homosexuals in the military.
Was the gentleman referring to the thousands and thousands of gay people who have put their lives on the line in countless wars defending this country?
Was that the groups of people that the gentleman was referring to?
You have insulted thousands of men and women who have put their lives on the line, Sanders continued.
I think they are owed an apology.
Even conservative Republicans don t use language like that anymore (at least in public), but it is jarring to hear that kind of slur from a member on the floor of the House, just a little over twenty years ago.While Duke Cunningham didn t back down to Sanders, a decade after this exchange, karma caught up with him.
Cunningham was arrested and charged with accepting at least $2.4 million in bribes and underreporting his taxable income.
In 2005 he pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy to commit bribery, mail fraud, wire fraud and tax evasion.
He spent 2005-13 in prison.Featured image via screen capture
