MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - A man alleged to be behind the murder this year of a crime reporter in northern Mexico has been arrested by federal police, Chihuahua state Governor Javier Corral said in a statement on Monday.
The suspect, identified as Juan Carlos Moreno Ochoa, alias El Larry , was detained in the neighboring border state of Sonora on Monday and was allegedly the intellectual author of the murder of journalist Miroslava Breach, the statement said.
Breach was shot several times as she drove out of her garage on March 23.
One of her children was with her in the car, but was not hurt.
A man alleged to be the gunman in Breach s murder, Ramon Andres Zavala, was assassinated last week in Sonora, Corral s statement said.
Moreno Ochoa was scheduled to be brought before a judge later on Monday to begin proceedings against him, the statement said.
Reuters was unable to locate Moreno Ochoa s lawyer.
At least 16 journalists have been killed in Mexico in the last three years, and 43 since 1992, making Mexico one of the world s most dangerous countries for reporters, according to the Committee to Project Journalists.
