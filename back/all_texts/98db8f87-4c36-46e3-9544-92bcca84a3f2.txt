Walker says Donald Trump is RIGHT when it comes to standing for the national anthem and that Commissioner Rodger Goodell needs to take control of the situation.The viral video above shows Walker lending his support to Trump.
He happens to be a personal friend who worked for the president and was on Trump s hit show The Apprentice .He criticized both the players who have decided to kneel and NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell for allowing the protests: I think it means making a league-wide rule that if you want to protest, protest off the job, Walker said.
Where was everyone before the season started?
I didn t see anyone protesting in front of the White House, protesting in front of Congress or protesting in front of police officers.
Why did we wait until football season to start this again?
If you re behind it, you have to be behind it all the way If you want to protest, protest off the job.
He stated that anthem protests weren t the way to change anything and said everyone needs to stand out of respect: We can t just point the finger at one person, and most of all you can t point it at the president.
