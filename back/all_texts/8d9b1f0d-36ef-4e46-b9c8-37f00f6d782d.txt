WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The White House said on Thursday that there was no need to repair the relationship between President Donald Trump and Republican congressional leaders, despite some recent policy disputes.
“I think the relationships are fine,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said during a White House briefing.
“Certainly there are going to be some policy differences, but there are also a lot of shared goals and that’s what we’re focused on.”
