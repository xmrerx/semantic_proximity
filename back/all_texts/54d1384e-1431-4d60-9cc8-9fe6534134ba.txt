Hillary shouldn t be on FOX News giving interviews She should be in jail!
Queen Hillary didn t quite get the same treatment from FOX News Chris Wallace as she gets when she visits MSNBC s Chris Matthews!Hillary Clinton acknowledges that Americans have a legitimate concern about her trustworthiness, particularly related to her email scandal and the Benghazi terror attacks, but criticized those who have attempted to undermine her Democratic presidential campaign and make a caricature out of her, in an exclusive interview with Fox News Sunday.
I think that it s fair for Americans to have questions, Clinton said, in an interview taped Saturday.
Every time I run for an office, though, oh my goodness, all of these caricatures come out of nowhere.
And people begin to undermine me because when I left office as secretary of state, 66 percent of Americans approved of what I do.
FOX Newshttps://youtu.be/G0XAt7aPYBsLaura Ingraham commented on Hillary Clinton s stunning interview on Fox News Sunday.Ingraham said Clinton has an astonishing ability to look into Chris Wallace s eyes and claim that FBI Director Jim Comey confirmed her statements on her email scandal were truthful.
That comment earned Clinton four Pinocchios from the Washington Post s fact-checker.Ingraham said Clinton s aside about her mother loving Fox News was all well and good, but the fact of the matter is, this is about her tenure as secretary of state.
If she didn t know that you couldn t put a government server in your bathroom, then what does Hillary Clinton really know about basic issues of foreign policy?
Ingraham added that Clinton apparently can lie with impunity to most people in the press, other than some of the folks at Fox News.
