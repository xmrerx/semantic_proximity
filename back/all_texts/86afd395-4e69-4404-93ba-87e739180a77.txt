Wake me when it s over!
What the heck people!
We have all out brawls at political rallies for Donald Trump where the leftists are trying their best to stop free speech and freedom to gather and support their candidate for president.A rally in Virginia today got overheated when a Time magazine photographer grabbed a Secret Service agent by the throat.
Can you believe this?
THE REPORTER SAYS, F*CK YOU , TO THE SECRET SERVICE AGENT AND THAT S WHERE IT STARTED:Here s moments prior.
The reporter says f*ck you that s when it got physical pic.twitter.com/h9K2wIbEWQ Joe Perticone (@JoePerticone) February 29, 2016 This is how reporters are treated at Trump rallies pic.twitter.com/hMxuEoKVeG Gabby Morrongiello (@gabriellahope_) February 29, 2016 Of course, that made the appearance by Black Lives Matter idiots just a faded memory.The irony is that BLM protesters were chanting Stop the hate Ummm, I think the left needs to look in the mirror and thing again about who s being hateful.I ve been watching and listening to all of the news channels and to the people on social media.
Folks, it s gotten really ugly out there.
We even have the candidates talking about the size of one candidate s penis.
Really?
How low can you go?I am really looking forward to when we finally have a Republican nominee so all of this can stop.
Please!
