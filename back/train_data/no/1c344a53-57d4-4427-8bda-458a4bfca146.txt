( reuters ) - exxon mobil corp and rex tillerson agreed to sever all ties to comply with conflict-of-interest requirements as the company ’ s former chairman and chief executive awaits confirmation as u.s. secretary of state .
if his appointment is confirmed , the value of more than 2 million deferred exxon mobil shares ( worth about $ 182 million at tuesday ’ s closing price ) that tillerson would have received over the next 10 years will be transferred to an independently managed trust , the company said in a statement .
the share awards will be canceled and tillerson will also surrender entitlement to more than $ 4.1 million in cash bonuses , scheduled to pay out over the next three years , and other benefits , exxon mobil said .
separately , tillerson also committed to the state department that , if confirmed , he would sell the more than 600,000 exxon shares he currently owns , the company said .
exxon said last month its president , darren woods , will become chief executive and chairman in january following the retirement of tillerson .
tillerson could face a rocky confirmation process , given concerns among both democrats and republicans about his ties to russia .
exxon stock has gained 6.5 percent since election results of nov. 8 up to tuesday ’ s close of $ 90.89 .
