mexico city ( reuters ) - guatemala s attorney general and a united nations-backed anti-corruption body will investigate the nation s political parties on suspicion of illegal campaign financing during the 2015 presidential election campaign , the groups said on thursday .
we have agreed with the attorney general to initiate an investigation into the electoral campaigns of all political parties in the 2015 cycle , said ivan velasquez , head of the international commission against impunity in guatemala ( cicig ) .
the cicig has become a thorn in the side of guatemalan president jimmy morales since it kicked off a graft probe focused on his elder brother and one of the president s sons .
in 2015 , the cicig was instrumental in removing morales predecessor otto perez from office after identifying him as a key player in an alleged multimillion-dollar corruption racket .
perez is now in prison on trial with his former vice-president .
morales , a former comedian who won office in 2015 on a pledge to fight corruption , is scheduled to meet tomorrow with u.n. secretary general antonio guterres in new york .
two government officials told reuters on wednesday morales plans to ask guterres to replace velasquez , a colombian whose tenure as cicig chief is set to run out in 2019 .
a guatemalan government spokesman declined to say whether morales would seek velasquez s removal , but did state that the president would discuss improving the cicig with guterres , and also propose a new model for combating crime .
