We all know that Trump supporters are crazy, but a man in New York City s Times Square took it to a whole other level on Thursday.
The clearly disturbed man is NYC s 21-year-old Krit McClean.
He was reportedly shouting about Donald Trump at the top of a ledge, and was completely naked.
Authorities and bystanders stared as he blew kisses at the crowd that stopped to watch the show, and was shouting, Donald Trump where are you!
It all started when McClean took to the Square early Thursday morning, stripped naked in front of a Disney Store near 46th street, removed the watch from his wrist, hurled it at a nearby woman, and began shouting incoherently.
A security guard told McClean to get dressed, but the order was ignored.
He also was combative when police arrived, shouting Get that bitch Debbie, I want to talk to Debbie!
After that, McClean said he needed to meet with Trump.Then, McClean was atop a 16 foot ledge shouting, Donald Trump where are you, Donald Trump where the f are you?!
Officers on the scene report that he was grabbing and waving his private parts at them, did some sort of dance, and then jumped from the ledge, but unfortunately missed the safety apparatus that first responders had down below for him, and hit the pavement instead.
He was carted off to Bellevue, a psychiatric institution in New York City, and is reportedly in stable condition.Now, this man is clearly mentally ill, but I find it very telling that he appears to be obsessed with Donald Trump, even in the middle of some kind of psychotic break.
That isn t to make fun of McClean, of course.
It s just a very interesting connection.
May he make a full recovery.Featured image via DNA Info
