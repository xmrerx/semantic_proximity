brasilia ( reuters ) - brazilian president michel temer accepted the resignation on friday of his minister of political affairs , whose party is abandoning the ruling coalition to ready for the 2018 election .
antonio imbassahy of the brazilian social democratic party ( psdb ) has handled the government s relations with congress , keeping an unwieldy coalition united in blocking the prosecution of temer on corruption charges earlier this year .
however the psdb , temer s largest ally , has split over whether to stick with the unpopular president in the run-up to a general election next october , when the party plans to field its own presidential candidate .
the psdb will hold its national convention in brasilia on saturday , when it is expected to elect sao paulo governor geraldo alckmin as its new party leader , replacing senator aecio neves , who is under investigation for graft .
that would make alckmin the psdb s most likely candidate in next year s presidential race .
allies say alckmin plans to continue his party s disengagement from the temer government , where the psdb still has two ministers , including foreign minister aloysio nunes , who is expected to stay on the job based on personal conviction .
still , alckmin is expected to mobilize psdb support for temer s signature legislation proposal , the overhaul of brazil s costly social security system .
investors consider the measure crucial to closing a huge budget deficit that cost latin america s largest economy its investment-grade credit rating .
temer needs the psdb s 46 votes in the lower house of congress to win passage of the pension reform bill , which is set for a vote the week of dec. 18 .
