The Democratic ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee dropped a bombshell Wednesday afternoon when he revealed that there is more than circumstantial evidence now of collusion between Donald Trump and Russia.Speaking to MSNBC s Chuck Todd, Rep. Adam Schiff said the evidence that Trump s team colluded with Russia is no longer just circumstantial.
On Sunday, Schiff said that there was circumstantial evidence of collusion and direct evidence of deception, but today, he said there is more.When Todd asked him if the case for collusion was only circumstantial, Schiff said, I can tell you that the case is more than that.
I can t go in to the particulars but there is more than circumstantial evidence now, Schiff said.
You have seen direct evidence of collusion?
Todd asked.
I don t want to go into specifics but I will say that there is evidence that is not circumstantial and very much worthy of investigation Schiff said.This is the furthest a lawmaker has gone regarding proof that Trump was working with Russia to cheat his way into the White House.On Monday, during a hearing before the House Intelligence Committee, FBI Director James Comey publicly confirmed that the bureau is investigation both Russia s interference in the election and the possibility that Trump was in cahoots with Putin the whole time.
Comey also testified that this investigation began way back in July of 2016.You can watch Schiff s interview here:Featured image via video screen capture
