Pop star Madonna got raunchy while introducing comedian Amy Schumer at a performance in New York City Tuesday night, promising the crowd sexual favors in exchange for their support of Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton.
If you vote for Hillary Clinton, I will give you a blowjob.

the 58-year-old Rebel Heart singer told an audience at New York s Madison Square Garden Tuesday night.
I m really good.
I m not a douche, and I m not a tool.
I take my time, I have a lot of eye contact, and I do swallow.
