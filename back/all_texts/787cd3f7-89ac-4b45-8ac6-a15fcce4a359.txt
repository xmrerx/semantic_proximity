In a recent interview with CNN, former senator and Republican presidential candidate Rick Santorum hinted that President Trump s time so far in office would be more successful and that he still has the ability to become a better leader if he makes one simple change Just stop tweeting.During Sunday morning s edition of State of the Union with Dana Bash, Santorum made his point clear in absolutely no uncertain terms.
If you tweet every day and complain about the media and complain about how you are being treated, you re going to be sidetracked and you re not going to get your deals done.
That s the message, Santorum said, almost trying to channel the president directly by staring straight into the camera and using terms that Trump could relate to in order to get his advice across.Donald Trump has just concluded his first ever overseas trip as President of the United States, a nine-day journey into the Middle East, and during that time he had been using social media a lot less, staying more focused on the task at hand.
However, almost immediately upon his return to the White House, the President took to Twitter to voice his displeasure at a number of topics, but mainly on opinions that differ to his own in what has become his latest catchphrase, the Fake News.
British Prime Minister May was very angry that the info the U.K. gave to U.S. about Manchester was leaked.
Gave me full details!

V was poorly covered Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2017 .it is very possible that those sources don t exist but are made up by fake news writers.
#FakeNews is the enemy!
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2017Whenever you see the words sources say in the fake news media, and they don t mention names .
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2017It is my opinion that many of the leaks coming out of the White House are fabricated lies made up by the #FakeNews media.
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 28, 2017It seems more than a little ironic that a President who ran an entire campaign based on information gathered from unnamed sources would be so against their use when others do likewise and Rick Santorum agreed, stating that focusing on these petty grudges is what is preventing Trump from concentrating completely on his duties as President.
The last nine days have hopefully shown the President that if you stay on message, you stick to the script, you focus on policy, you drive home the messages that you talked about during the campaign and that people in America are excited about, you can be a great president, Santorum said.
The fact is that this administration should be doing so well, and could be doing so well, if they just focused on getting their agenda passed.
Not one to take criticism, constructive or otherwise, in his stride, President Trump decided to air his dissatisfaction at Santorum s claims in the only way he knows By taking to Twitter:The Fake News Media works hard at disparaging & demeaning my use of social media because they don t want America to hear the real story!
