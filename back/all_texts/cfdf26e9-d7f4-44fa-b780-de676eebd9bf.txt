U.S. Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson (D-Dallas) argued the beheading of two American journalists by ISIS does not justify U.S. airstrikes into Syria Thursday.
During an interview on Capitol Hill, Johnson said the slayings of James Foley and Steven Sotloff should not lead to bombing ISIS forces in Syria.
We were on their ground.
It was not in the U.S.
I do think we need to protect Americans wherever they are.
But Americans also need to be careful where they are, said Johnson.
The Dallas Democrat also said President Obama does not need Congressional authority to escalate the fight against ISIS.
But she feels he would be wise to seek approval from the U.S. House and Senate.
