the former mayor of fairfax city in virginia is facing up to 40 years in prison after he pled guilty to trading crystal meth for sex .
richard scott silverthorne entered a guilty plea to one charge of distributing methamphetamine on monday.this shocking story began in august of 2016 when silverthorne was arrested .
police say they got a tip that he was using a website to set up casual sexual encounters and distribute meth .
an undercover officer set up a fake profile on the site and silverthorne took the bait .
in just days he had responded to the undercover officer and arranged to meet him at the crowne plaza hotel in mclean , virginia .
the police set up a sting operation and busted him when he gave the undercover cop two grams of meth .
during the raid , police arrested silverthorne and two other men.silverthorne was released on his own recognizance last august and had remained free since then .
it was expected that he would be released today to await his sentencing hearing , but instead , he was sent to jail .
reports say that there were audible gasps in the courtroom when the judge made the announcement.his sentencing hearing is scheduled for june 9 .
he could receive a maximum of 40 years behind bars and a hefty $ 500,000 fine .
however , his attorney , brian drummond , says he is hopeful that silverthorne will get time served and be placed on probation because of the decades he has spent as a public servant with no criminal record.before he was caught trading drugs for sex , silverthorne had been re-elected as fairfax city mayor .
he was also a substitute teacher who worked in the fairfax county public schools .
after he was arrested , a special election was held in february of 2017 to replace him.you can watch more on this story here , via abc7 : featured image via video screen capture
