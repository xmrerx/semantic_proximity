MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin will hold a meeting of his security council later on Friday to discuss the U.S missile strikes on Syria, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.
Russia has suspended its Syria air safety agreement with the United States following the missile strikes.
Peskov said Russia would keep technical and military channels of communication open with Washington, but would not exchange any information through them.
“In light of the missile strikes, risks (of collisions between Russian and U.S. aircraft) are significantly higher,” the spokesman told reporters.
The strikes were carried out in interests of Islamic State and other radical groups operating in Syria, Peskov added.
