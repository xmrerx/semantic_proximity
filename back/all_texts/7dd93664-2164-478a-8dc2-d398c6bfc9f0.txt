ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkey said on Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump told President Tayyip Erdogan he had issued instructions that weapons should not be provided to Kurdish YPG fighters in Syria, and that the Turkish government hoped to see that order carried out.
Our discomfort regarding the provision of weapons to the YPG was conveyed to Mr Trump once again... Trump very clearly said he had given instructions to not provide weapons to the YPG, Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu told a news conference in Ankara.
We welcome the promise of not providing weapons to the YPG, and want to see it implemented practically.
Cavusoglu also said that Russia, Iran and Turkey would decide jointly who would attend Syrian peace talks.
Turkey has said it would not accept the presence of YPG representatives.
