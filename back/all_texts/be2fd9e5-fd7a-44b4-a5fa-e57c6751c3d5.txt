Though he is facing down six intelligence agencies investigations into alleged illegal payments Trump received from the Kremlin to fund The Donald s efforts to become President by any means necessary, Friday marks the day that he becomes President and if you thought assuming the most powerful office in the world would stop Trump from tweeting like an angst-plagued middle schooler, you were sorely mistaken.On Thursday, Trump hopped on Twitter to announce that he s headed to Washington D.C. and, of course, to quote right-wing icon Franklin Graham s idiotic claim that someone who isn t Trump (hint: Obama) being the guy who divided the country rather than the dude who called Mexicans rapists, wants to ban Muslims from entering the country, and who offered to pay legal fees if his supporters beat up black people at his rallies.
It wasn t Donald Trump that divided this country, this country has been divided for a long time!, Stated today by Reverend Franklin Graham, Trump tweeted as part of his daily ritual.
Getting ready to leave for Washington, D.C.
The journey begins and I will be working and fighting very hard to make it a great journey for the American people.
I have no doubt that we will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 19, 2017Naturally, the internet swooped in to remind him how very wrong Mr. Graham is:@realDonaldTrump Going from Barack Obama to Donald Trump is like replacing Ramsay s fettuccine bolognese with a dented can of SpaghettiOs.
Tommy Campbell (@MrTommyCampbell) January 19, 2017@realDonaldTrump yeah, you didn't divide the country by demanding anyone's birth certificate years ago?

https://t.co/DUpTZjIxwA Bess Kalb (@bessbell) January 19, 2017Trump may be taking office, but he is already plagued by who knows how many scandals at this point?
The most important one surrounds Russia not the lady pee bit, but the very serious probability that his team was directly colluding with the enemy to install him in office.
In any case, our country is fucked.
