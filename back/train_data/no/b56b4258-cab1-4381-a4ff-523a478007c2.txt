nuremberg , germany ( reuters ) - a right-wing extremist member of a group that claims allegiance to adolf hitler s world war two-era german reich was convicted of murder on monday for shooting and killing a police officer and sentenced to life in prison .
the conviction was handed down amid growing concern in germany at homegrown right-wing movements that contest the country s post-world war two democratic order and follows the arrival in parliament this month of the first far-right party in decades .
the man , known only as wolfgang p. because of german court rules , fired through a glazed door on policemen who had arrived to search his flat last october for illegal weapons .
one of the officers was killed .
the district court in the southern city of nuremberg found that the shooting had been premeditated , a spokesman said , describing the suspect as malicious .
he knew that a police officer was stationed in front of this door and wanted to kill him , said spokesman friedrich weitner , describing the court s conclusions .
throughout the trial , p. declined to identify himself to the court , in order to signify his rejection of the german state .
the murder led germany s domestic intelligence agency to start monitoring the reichsbuerger ( reich citizens ) movement for suspected extremist and unconstitutional activities .
the movement , which authorities believe may have up to 900 members , regards the modern german state as illegitimate .
its members say they owe allegiance only to the german reich , or state , despite its abolition in 1945 .
