this week s documentary screening , curated by our editorial team at 21wire .
this was quite a groundbreaking investigation and production at the time , which aired on us public television in 1988 , detailing the us government s own role , along with the cia in trafficking in illicit narcotics proceeds that were used to shore up the contra freedom fighters effort in nicaragua .

is the cia using drug money to finance covert operations ?
