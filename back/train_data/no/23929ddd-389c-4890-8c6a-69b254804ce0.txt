21st century wire says us college students continue to be emotionally traumatized and threatened by donald trump s surprise presidential victory this week , sparking a wave of nationally coordinated street protests , organized in part through the george soros funded democratic party community organizing web portal moveon.org .
various protests and riots have been organized around a number university campuses including berkeley , portland , new york city and los angleses .
when asked why she scared by the election result , one female university student claimed that the president elect is a rapist , while another claim that , he [ trump ] is about to have a court case about a 13 years old girl soon , and i m not down for that .
the alleged court case the student is referring was actually dropped , and has since been exposed as a likely politically motivated hoax according to reports.here is last night s student protest , including multiple interviews from both sides of the debate , filmed last night in albuquerque , new mexico , by stuart j hooper .
