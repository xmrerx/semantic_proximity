nairobi ( reuters ) - in a dramatic picture , kenyan opposition lawmaker caleb amisi luyai leans through the window of his car as tear gas billows out , police having fired it at a convoy of opposition politicians in nairobi on oct. 13 .
police acted to prevent the politicians from entering the center of the capital to enforce a ban on staging political protests there ahead of a repeat presidential election .
kenya is holding a re-vote on oct. 26 after the supreme court threw out the result of an election in august won by incumbent president uhuru kenyatta .
his opponent , raila odinga , is boycotting the repeat , arguing that it should not be held until wide-ranging reforms are adopted to prevent another failed vote .
for reuters photographer baz ratner , who took the image , the main challenge is how to cover the story when the protests are moving very fast in a few different focal points around nairobi .
ratner had ridden just ahead of the opposition convoy on his motorcycle when tear gas canisters were fired .
i stopped on the side of the road and put on my gas mask when i noticed one of the cars was engulfed in smoke .
it was moving forward slowly , while i ran towards it as i took a few photos .
ratner did not recognize the driver , luyai , an opposition member of parliament , but saw him leaning out of the window and gesturing .
i helped him open the door .
i walked to the other side where other people who were in the car were lying on the floor .
very quickly , the car drove away , ratner said .
