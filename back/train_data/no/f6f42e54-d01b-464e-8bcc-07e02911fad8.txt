trump s inauguration crowd size was pathetic .
how pathetic ?
you ask .
when the donald officially took over the @ potus twitter account , he didn t use a picture of his own inauguration as the banner image .
he used president obama s : .
@ realdonaldtrump 's official @ potus banner image of his # inauguration is actually @ gettyimages photo of obama 's .
so sad pic.twitter.com/ktezpzgywj noahharlan ( @ noahharlan ) january 20 , 2017naturally , the internet quickly caught on to the fact that no one wants to show up to celebrate trump becoming the grand wizard of our once great nation.for those saying `` trump ca n't be that hated , look at the size of the crowd '' # inauguration pic.twitter.com/sczp6feta5 stefan kay ( @ 5tefank ) january 20 , 2017president trump has officially been sworn in .
there is a lot of white in that crowd .
# inauguration # inaugurationday pic.twitter.com/ueghfvtqxg visuallybetter ( @ isuckatpicking ) january 20 , 2017of all the metrics to measure the rancour and division a trump presidency may bring , the size of a crowd in washington dc seems the weakest .

https : //t.co/qiyynabk1y carrie budoff brown ( @ cbudoffbrown ) january 20 , 2017crowd on the mall in washington dc is one-third the size of barack obamas # inaguration ?
many challenges for donald trump .

as if rain would 've kept the # obamacoalition away in 2009 !
only4rm ( @ only4rm ) january 20 , 2017who is taking bets on how long it takes # trump to pick a fight with the parks service over crowd size ?
rick smith ( @ ricksmithshow ) january 19 , 2017breaking : either dc was just evacuated , or trump had the smallest # inaugurationday crowd at the mall in recent history .

( @ mmpadellan ) january 20 , 2017 @ harolditz @ glenn__kenny to be fair , it was one of the biggest crowds there to attend a 3 doors down concert .
chuck tryon ( @ chutry ) january 20 , 2017as obama and trump looked at over the crowd , obama whispered : `` mine 's bigger . ''
# inauguration @ nationallampoon les east ( @ les_east ) january 20 , 2017i do n't want to hear one word about the massive crowds today .

pic.twitter.com/6lie2dghqh angelia resist ( @ tldrjones ) january 20 , 2017if you ever need to know exactly how unpopular our president is , just look at the tiny , pathetic crowd that showed up to see him officially assume the office of the president .
this is not normal .
nothing about trump s campaign , election , or presidency is normal .
it is time for the american people to steel their resolve to fight against this wildly hated man , to do all they can to keep him from implementing his horrifying and dangerous agenda.the next four years will be hard , perhaps harder than any four-year period in our lifetimes , but one thing americans have always had is the strength to stand together in times of adversity and how much more adverse could things be than staring down a president who is sitting in the oval office thanks to a massive propaganda and fake news campaign , and hacking of his political opponents spearheaded by a hostile foreign dictator ? featured image via screen capture
