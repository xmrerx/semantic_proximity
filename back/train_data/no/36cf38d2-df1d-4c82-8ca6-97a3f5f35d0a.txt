beyonce gets political in her graphic anti-cop performance at the mtv vmas last night .
the mtv awards use to be a fun-filled night of entertainment but now it s a chance for political activism to take center stage .
prior to the show , beyonce met with the michael brown s mom and other moms of people killed by police officers .
we guess she forgot about the fact that all of these cases are legitimate cases of crimes being committed by the deceased .
the truth is way too buried because it s more profitable for the truth to be twisted .
where were the families of police officers like the dallas officers murdered in cold blood ?
nope , beyonce had to stick with a lie and be the political activist she always has been .
remember the super bowl ?
yes , that was where she had her dancers form an x on the field in support of the black panthers fist raised in the air and all .
i have one thing to say about all of this while performing a medley of songs from her hit album , lemonade , the pop megastar was surrounded by backup dancers dressed as angels .
however , as red lights flooded the stage , each of the angels was shot down during the performance , which viewers said was a representation of police brutality .
the imagery of the beyonce performance with the angels getting shot down , one person tweeted .
beyonce too deep .
all the angels were shot , police brutality , another wrote.i think i need a moment after watching @ beyonce s # vma performance https : //t.co/lyvffrieno mtv ( @ mtv ) august 29 , 2016 read more : daily mail
