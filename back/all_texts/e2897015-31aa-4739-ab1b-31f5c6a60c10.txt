Donald Trump, at the second presidential debate, invoked laughs when he claimed to respect women, and that no one respects women more than him.There s a reason people laughed they don t believe him, and for good reason.In a new poll from NBC/SurveyMonkey shows that a huge majority of the American people, 63 percent, do not believe Trump respects women, compared to 36 percent who said he does.When it comes to female voters, nearly 70 percent responded that Trump does not respect women, up from 64 percent pre-leaked audio.Even more telling is the difference in this question pre-tape leak.
Before the bombshell audio recording leaked, 55 percent (still a majority) said Trump did not respect women.
Since the recording leaked, we ve seen an eight percent increase in those that agree that Donald Trump is a sexist pig.But the poll also took into account Trump s post-first debate meltdown over Alicia Machado, in which he degraded the weight of the former Miss Universe and asked voters to watch her sex tape (which doesn t exist).Donald Trump currently trails Hillary Clinton in what s being seen as the biggest gender gap in presidential politics.The fact that Trump wrote off the leaked audio as locker-room talk multiple times (and denied that he said the things he did), shows that he really doesn t care about the issues that women care about.
And it shows that he is unable to take responsibility for his actions.
One can simply say I made a mistake and I m sorry, but it takes a real man to fully own up to what was said and Trump didn t do that.John McCain and Mitt Romney lost their respective elections, in big part, because of the gender gap.
If Trump thinks he can win a national election in 29 days with the historic gap he has now he s got another thing coming his way.Featured image via Scott Olson/Getty Images
