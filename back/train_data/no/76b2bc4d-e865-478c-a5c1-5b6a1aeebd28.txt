richard dreyfuss was on tucker carlson and blew us away with his knowledge of american government !
you will be shocked at his comments he speaks about how important it is for all americans to know civics who knew richard dreyfuss could speak like this ? this interview was so successful that the website for dreyfuss is having technical difficulties.the dreyfuss civics initiative has a facebook page with this message at the top : thank you tucker carlson and richard for the interview tonight .
