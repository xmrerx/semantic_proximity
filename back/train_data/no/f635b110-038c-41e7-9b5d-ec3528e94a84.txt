gaza ( reuters ) - palestinian factions stepped up efforts on thursday to finalize a hamas handover of the gaza strip to president mahmoud abbas as protests broke out in the enclave against the u.s. recognition of jerusalem as israel s capital .
under egyptian mediation , the factions have sought to end a schism dating back to 2007 , when islamist hamas seized gaza in a civil war with abbas s fatah .
a dec. 1 deadline for giving gaza to abbas was postponed to dec. 10 amid disputes .
u.s. president donald trump s announcement on disputed jerusalem on wednesday infuriated palestinians , who see the city as their future capital , prompting hamas to call for a revolt against israel and demand that abbas abandon american-sponsored peace-making .
worried that the recrimination could disrupt the reconciliation efforts , palestinian prime minister rami al-hamdallah and other fatah delegates arrived in gaza on thursday to meet hamas .
this historical stage requires that we all unite and speed up the steps of uniting the homeland , al-hamdallah told reporters .
after hamas call for an intifada , or uprising , dozens of palestinians gathered at two points on the gaza border fence with israel and threw rocks at soldiers on the other side .
one palestinian was wounded by army fire , medics said .
an israeli military spokeswoman said she was checking the report .
in cities inside gaza , thousands of palestinians rallied , some chanting : death to america !
death to the fool trump !
and burning tires .
