NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S.
Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley said on Thursday a range of options remained on the table, including a possible oil embargo, if Venezuela did not move to restore its democratic processes.
There s a lot of support in Latin America to see Venezuela start to respect its people and go back to the democracy it s supposed to be, she told reporters.
If things don t improve, all those options are always there, Haley added, saying specifically that the possibility of an oil embargo remained.
It s not off the table, I can tell you that, she said.
