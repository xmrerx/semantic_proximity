WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The United States on Tuesday welcomed Saudi King Salman s order, reported by Saudi state media, allowing women to drive cars.
We would certainly welcome that, U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert told reporters.
It s a great step in the right direction for that country.
According to Saudi state news agency SPA, a royal degree ordered the formation of a ministerial body to provide advice within 30 days and to implement the order by June 2018.
