will his comments about barack obama race help or hurt his campaign ?
do you agree with carson ?
do you think obama used all of the privileges afforded to him by his white mother and grandparents , then used his victim card to gain support from black voters ? barack obama was raised white , republican presidential candidate ben carson has claimed.mr carson said the president could not understand the african-american experience the way he could.mr obama was born to a white american mother and a black kenyan father .
mr carson s parents are african-american.the comments by mr carson a retired neurosurgeon who finished last in south carolina s primary were criticised as loose talk by another republican .
he s an african american .
he was , you know , raised white , mr carson told a politico podcast on tuesday .
many of his formative years were spent in indonesia .
so , for him to , you know , claim that , you know , he identifies with the experience of black americans , i think , is a bit of a stretch .
but i also recognise that his experience and my experience are night-and-day different .
he didn t grow up like i grew up by any stretch of the imagination , he said.the 64-year-old had a poor upbringing in detroit but made it to yale before a brilliant career as a neurosurgeon.but he has been struggling in the republican nomination race and finished sixth out of six in south carolina at the weekend.via : bbc
