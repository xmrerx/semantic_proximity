boom ! dear abby , my husband is a liar and a cheat .
he has cheated on me from the beginning , and , when i confront him , he denies everything .
what s worse , everyone knows that he cheats on me .
it is so humiliating .
also , since he lost his job 14 years ago , he hasn t even looked for a new one .
all he does all day is smoke cigars , cruise around and shoot the bull with his buddies , while i have to work to pay the bills .
since our daughter went away to college he doesn t even pretend to like me , and even hints that i may be a lesbian .
what should i do ? signed : clueless dear clueless : grow up and dump him .
you don t need him anymore !
good grief woman , you re running for president of the united states !
abbynailed it !
