WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An agreement with Iran aimed at preventing it from developing nuclear weapons does not include giving it access to the U.S. financial system, the White House said on Friday.
The comment from a White House spokesman at a regular news briefing followed a request by Iranâ€™s central bank governor earlier on Friday for the United States and European Union to help Iran gain access to the global financial system.
