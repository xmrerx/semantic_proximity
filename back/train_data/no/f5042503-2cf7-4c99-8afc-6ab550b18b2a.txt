never mind the fact that kid rock fought for and won full custody of his black son , whom he raised by himself.never mind that kid rock was chosen to recieve the detroit chapter of the naacp s highest award for service to the black community .
he s still a racist because a flag makes him one right little al ? none of that matters to the race hustling crowd who make a living by shaking down citizens for violating their special set of rules .
these shake down artists should be in prison , but you re more likely to find them discussing strategy at the white house or attending a democrat party fundraiser .
in the land of the left , these race baiters play an important role in the victim business , and as we all know , the victim business brings in votes .
