jerusalem ( reuters ) - israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu said on thursday many countries would follow the united states in recognising jerusalem as israel s capital and contacts were underway .
wednesday s announcement by u.s. president donald trump reversed decades of peace-making policy on jerusalem , which both israelis and palestinians claim , and drew censure from many countries , among them key allies of washington .
i would like to announce that we are already in contact with other countries which will issue a similar recognition , netanyahu said in a speech at israel s foreign ministry .
he did not name any of these countries .
the united states plans to open an embassy in jerusalem , a move it says could take three to four years .
the u.s. embassy is currently in tel aviv , israel s economic hub , as are those of other countries .
i have no doubt that the moment the american embassy moves to jerusalem , and even before then , there will be a movement of many embassies to jerusalem .
the time has come , netanyahu said .
palestinian islamist group hamas called on thursday for a new uprising against israel after trump s recognition of jerusalem as the israeli capital .
