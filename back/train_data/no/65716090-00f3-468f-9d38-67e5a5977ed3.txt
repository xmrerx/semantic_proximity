the leftist mainstream media would love americans to believe trump had univision propagandist removed from the press conference .
as anyone can clearly see , he had nothing to do with ramos removal and everything to do with him being invited back for a series of questions ( with brilliant responses ) .univision s jorge ramos was removed from donald trump s press conference this afternoon by security after standing up and delivering a sermon before trump could even call on a reporter for a question .
even after the candidate called on another reporter in the room , ramos continued his rapid fire question/political statement mix , talking over any chance the other reporter might have for a question , as can be seen in the video above .
excuse me .
sit down .
you weren t called , said trump to the emotional anchor and reporter .
you can t just stand up and scream , said trump .
amazing how waiting to be called on worked out.other reporters in the room naturally asked trump about the situation , and trump defended what happened saying that ramos simply stood up and started yelling , an accurate portrayal .
even so , ramos was allowed to return to the press conference , was called on , and was able to ask several questions , as seen in this second video below .
