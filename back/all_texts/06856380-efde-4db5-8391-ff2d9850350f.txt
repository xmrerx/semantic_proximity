BAGHDAD (Reuters) - The Iraqi government will not hold talks with the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) about the results of the unconstitutional referendum on independence held on Monday in northern Iraq, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said.
We are not ready to discuss or have a dialogue about the results of the referendum because it is unconstitutional, Abadi said in a speech broadcast on state TV on Monday night.
Masoud Barzani s KRG says the referendum is not binding and was meant to be a legitimate mandate to negotiate with Baghdad and neighboring countries over the secession of the Kurdish-controlled region from Iraq.
The vote was expected to deliver a comfortable yes , and final results should be announced in 72 hours.
