london ( reuters ) - an 18-year-old man who came to britain after his parents were killed in iraq appeared in a london court on friday charged with attempted murder in last week s bomb attack on a packed commuter train in the british capital .
ahmed hassan is accused of carrying out the attack at parsons green station in london on friday which injured 30 people .
wearing a gray sweatshirt and with shoulder-length curly dark hair , he spoke only to confirm his name and address at london s westminster magistrates court .
hassan , from sunbury-on-thames , a town to the southwest of london , is charged with attempting to murder passengers on board a train heading to central london from the southwest suburb of wimbledon .
he is also accused of causing an explosion likely to endanger life using the highly volatile triacetone triperoxide ( tatp ) - known as the mother of satan - or another explosive substance .
prosecutor lee ingham told the court hassan had expressed hatred for britain and his warped view had motivated him to carry out the attack .
there was no application for bail and the case was adjourned until oct. 13 .
the home-made bomb engulfed a carriage in flames , but apparently failed to fully explode .
it was britain s fifth major militant attack so far this year .
police are continuing to question two other men , aged 25 and 30 .
a 17-year-old , who was detained on thursday , was released on friday and will face no further action .
two other men , arrested as part of the inquiry , were also released from custody on thursday .
