beirut ( reuters ) - a hardline sunni muslim cleric was sentenced to death in lebanon on thursday for inciting attacks on the army , as his supporters protested outside the court .
sheikh ahmad al-assir , who refused to recognize the hearing , was convicted for his part in clashes that erupted amid heightened sectarian tensions in 2013 , exacerbated by the war in neighboring syria .
assir rose to prominence supporting the mostly sunni insurgents in syria and condemning the backers of the syrian government , including lebanon s shi ite muslim hezbollah group .
lebanese soldiers raided a mosque complex belonging to assir in june 2013 , after skirmishes between his supporters and opponents in the southern mediterranean port city of sidon .
the army said at least 18 soldiers died in fighting with assir 's supporters , which raised fears at the time of sectarian violence spreading in lebanon .
( reut.rs/2xbmdx6 ) assir went into hiding and was arrested two years later at beirut airport , trying to get out with a false passport .
he rejected his court-appointed lawyer during the trial , which has been delayed several times .
dozens of his supporters protested outside the court in beirut and in sidon on thursday .
the court also convicted more than 30 others , some in absentia , for their part in the violence , imposing sentences ranging from six months in prison to death .
lebanese singer-turned-militant fadel shaker was sentenced in absentia to 15 years .
lebanon has not carried out an execution for at least 10 years .
