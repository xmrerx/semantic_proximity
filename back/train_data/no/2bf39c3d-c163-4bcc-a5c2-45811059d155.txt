president trump has mentioned in the past that he would like to see isis completely wiped out within 30 days of taking office .
if mattis first day on the job was any indication , the president may just get his wish.in iraq , mattis continued to crush isis forces .
one of the strikes , taking place in the city of rutbah , eliminated a tactical unit , two weapons caches , a mortar and a vehicle .
strikes in the city of beiji also demolished a unit and a vehicle , while another strike in kisik blew up a building and a tactical unit.to cap it all off , mattis oversaw two strikes against mosul , the isis region capital in iraq , which annihilated two units , a tank , a factory that manufactures car bombs , and three fighting positions.cnn analyst retired lt. gen. mark hertling defends obama s strategy and calls trump s plan to defeat isis , a sophomoric approach to national security policy .
