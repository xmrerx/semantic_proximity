with respect to the president s tweets about alleged wiretapping directed at him by the prior administration , i have no information that supports those tweets , and we have looked carefully inside the fbi .
the chairman of the house permanent select committee on intelligence said monday that he doesn t believe trump tower was wiretapped , but left open the idea that there was other surveillance against president trump by the obama administration .
let me be clear , i ve been saying this for several weeks , we know there was not a physical wiretap of trump tower .
however , it s still possible that other surveillance activities were used against president trump and his associates , chairman devin nunes , r-calif. , said during monday s hearing on russia s meddling in the u.s. election.trump has said he was surveilled somehow , but has left it to congress to discover how , and has declined to offer congress evidence for his claim .
trump has instead cited press reports that discussed the idea of surveillance against him.more broadly , nunes said the failure of the u.s. intelligence community to get a handle on russia has marked a large failure for the intelligence community and committee .
the fact that russia hacked u.s. election-related databases comes as no shock to this committee , said nunes .
we ve been closely monitoring russia s aggression for years .
a year ago , i publicly stated that our inability to predict putin s regime plans and intentions has been the biggest intelligence failure that we ve seen since 9/11 , and that remains my view today .
