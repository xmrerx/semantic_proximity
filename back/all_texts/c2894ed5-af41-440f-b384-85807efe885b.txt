You can see a partial eclipse, where the moon covers only a part of the sun, anywhere in North America (see Who can see it?
).
To see a total eclipse, where the moon fully covers the sun for a short few minutes, you must be in the path of totality.
The path of totality is a relatively thin ribbon, around 70 miles wide, that will cross the U.S. from West to East.
The first point of contact will be at Lincoln Beach, Oregon at 9:05 a.m. PDT.
Totality begins there at 10:16 a.m. PDT.
Over the next hour and a half, it will cross through Oregon, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and North and South Carolina.
The total eclipse will end near Charleston, South Carolina at 2:48 p.m. EDT.
From there the lunar shadow leaves the United States at 4:09 EDT.
Its longest duration will be near Carbondale, Illinois, where the sun will be completely covered for two minutes and 40 seconds.If you missed the eclipse as it happened, here are a couple of incredible videos that were taken of the eclipse: More of the moon crossing in front of sun in Philly: https://t.co/fKHeCFSNKf #SolarEclipse2017 pic.twitter.com/fjxfUuxOy6 NBC10 Philadelphia (@NBCPhiladelphia) August 21, 2017#SolarEclipse2017 Breathtaking!
