bangkok ( reuters ) - thai prime minister prayuth chan-ocha said on tuesday he would use a special order that gives the military sweeping powers to allow political parties to prepare for next year s general election .
major parties had urged the government for months to lift a ban on political activity , which has been in place since a 2014 coup , to allow them to get ready for the vote .
prayuth , who is also head of the junta , said he would use the special order , known as article 44 , to solve a political deadlock .
the government will have to use article 44 to solve this problem ( political activity deadlock ) , prayuth told reporters , referring to a constitutional clause that grants the military absolute powers .
government spokesperson sansern kaewkamnerd said prayuth would allow parties to take some steps outlined in thailand s new constitution , including reviewing their membership list and ensuring they have at least 500 members to qualify them to run in the november 2018 poll .
the meeting is not considering lifting the ban on political activities at the moment , sansern said .
the military has been running thailand since the may 2014 coup when it ousted the civilian government of prime minister yingluck shinawatra , ending years of political turmoil , including pro- and anti-government street protests .
a coup in 2006 ousted yingluck s brother , former prime minister thaksin shinawatra , whose supporters have dominated the polls since 2001 .
the 2014 coup saw some western countries downgrade ties with bangkok .
earlier this month , the european union said it would resume political contact at all levels with thailand after putting relations on hold .
that announcement came after prayuth said a general election would he held next november .
