washington ( reuters ) - u.s. commerce secretary wilbur ross said on thursday that a $ 5.5 million increase requested for the agency ’ s enforcement budget this year will have a “ real impact ” in cracking down on unfair trade practices and export security violations .
ross told a house appropriations subcommittee that an additional $ 4.5 million requested by the trump administration for the international trade administration ’ s enforcement and compliance section will fund 29 new positions whose primary focus will be the self-initiation of antidumping and antisubsidy investigations .
ross has pledged to have the commerce department take the lead in launching trade cases on behalf of industries that lack the resources or the organization to pursue them .
“ we will ensure that no country or foreign corporation can take unfair advantage of u.s. markets , ” ross said .
the enforcement increases are contained in the trump administration ’ s fiscal 2018 budget requests , which propose deep cuts to food assistance , health care and other social programs along with increases in military spending .
commerce also would get a $ 1 million increase in funding for the bureau of industry and security ( bis ) , the division that enforces export controls on sensitive technologies .
ross said this would fund 19 new special agents at the division that took the lead in an investigation that led to a criminal fine of $ 1.19 billion against china ’ s zte ( 000063.sz ) for violating trade sanctions on iran and north korea .
“ bis took the lead in cracking this case open .
so i am confident that these 19 additional agents , and the bandwidth they represent , will have real impact , ” ross said .
