moscow ( reuters ) - russian opposition leader alexei navalny was detained by police as he left his moscow home on friday to attend a pre-election rally in a provincial town .
russia holds a presidential election in march which incumbent vladimir putin is widely expected to contest .
navalny hopes to run despite russia s central election commission declaring him ineligible because of a suspended prison sentence which he says was politically-motivated .
navalny said on social media on friday that police had detained him in the lobby of his apartment block and told him they wanted to interview him at a police station .
he was released around 11 hours later and told to appear in court on monday to face charges of repeatedly violating laws governing the organization of public meetings and rallies , navalny s spokeswoman told reuters .
he faces up to 30 days in jail if found guilty , she said .
the press service of moscow s interior ministry was cited by the tass news agency as saying navalny had been detained due to his repeated calls to take part in unsanctioned public events .
the authorities say opposition protests must be pre-approved by them , but navalny has in the past said that the russian constitution enshrines the right to hold such events freely .
on friday , he denied the police s latest allegations , writing on social media : i ve never done that .
navalny had been due to address a pre-election rally in the city of nizhny novgorod later on friday , part of a series of regional events he hoped would help him build support for his presidential run .
