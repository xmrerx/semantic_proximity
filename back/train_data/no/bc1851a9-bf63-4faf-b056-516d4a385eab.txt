fox news neil cavuto asked senator rand paul if he believed surveillance was used against the trump campaign .
rand replied to cavuto by saying they already have evidence that surveillance of the campaign took place , everybody admits that somebody spied on mike flynn and he was part of the trump campaign .
so it sounds like what the president said has already been proven to be true .
somebody listened to mike flynn s conversation and revealed it to the press , which is a felony .
and you don t do that unless you somehow eavesdropped on his phone conversation .
the media s been kinda confused about this .
they think there has to be an old-fashioned bug placed on a wire if you haven t looked lately , most of our cell phones don t have wires .
so wire tapping is a broad term for surveillance .
somebody did surveil .
somebody spied on mike flynn and then illegally released that conversation .
