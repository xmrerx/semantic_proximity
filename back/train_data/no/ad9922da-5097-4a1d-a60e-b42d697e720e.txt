an atlanta democrat makes some very valid points on what america needs to become better .
she believes that trump is her candidate .
it s so interesting because this woman is not a republican .
trump gives me real hope and change , not fake hope and change .
i m voting for america because i believe in america .
i never thought i d be saying these words about the country .
democrats don t speak about the country but i ve woken up , i ve seen the truth and the truth is trump , i believe in this guy to make our country better because our country is going to hell !
my daughter can t find a job , she s a college graduate .
black men are 50 % unemployed .
our borders are wide open .
i love everybody don t get me wrong , but we have to close our borders .
trump is speaking the truth and that is why i m here .
the woman went on to add that , democrats are crazy i can t believe i thought that way .
she said her husband supports bernie sanders and that she told him , if he don t vote for trump , we re getting a divorce .
