they were arrested between nine and nine fifteen .
the alert came in at 8:24 , says uppsala police officer , ivan aslund , to the swedish news outlet fria tider.on flashback , the men accused of the rape are identified as middle easterners .
the rape was conducted at an address in uppsala , and the men filmed themselves and sent the assault live via facebook.according to a person who saw the live broadcast , the woman who was raped looked quite intoxicated and appeared completely dead while one of the men molested her .
several people alerted the police when they saw the film.the live broadcast on facebook was not stopped until the police stormed into the room where the woman and the men were .
the men will now be interrogated by the police .
before prosecutors can make a decision , the policemen have to document everything , a complaint , write down observations and conduct interviews with those who have something to say .
once that is done , they will present it to the prosecutor , so it takes time , says aslund.he is otherwise very secretive about the investigation and would not say anything about the rape that was sent live worldwide on facebook from the new sweden.the last transmission shows the police breaking into the apartment and arresting the rapists :
