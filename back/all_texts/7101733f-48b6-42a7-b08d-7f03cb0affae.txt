Donald Trump seems determined to make sure that the United States of America is never seen as the leader of the free world again.
As his disastrous treatment of the leaders of allied nations at the NATO and G7 summits and his continued attacks on democratic values and his buffoonish behavior on Twitter isn t enough, it is now being reported that Trump plans to continue to put his dangerous and ridiculous notion that climate change is some kind of Chinese hoax into policy.
He has taken his worst step yet in that direction, and now plans to pull out of the Paris Accord on Climate Change.Around 200 countries including all of the world s developed nations are a part of the deal, of which the United States was instrumental in sealing.
Now, we will be on par with third world countries on this issue because one of our political parties seems to think that science isn t real.
The decision comes after Senate Republicans wrote Trump a letter urging him to pull out of the deal, citing regulations that would cost American jobs.
Then again, we know that the GOP isn t that bright on this issue and many others.This move comes on the heels of the Trump Administration rolling back most of the climate regulations that the Obama Administration had put in place to help save the environment.
The Paris Accord would have the United States commit to reducing carbon emissions by 26 to 28 percent.Beyond the disastrous effects on the environment, this is just devastating to America s standing in the world.
It shows everyone that we are no longer ready to lead, that we are taking an isolationist approach when it comes to important issues on the world stage, and that we are led by incompetent, science-denying fools who only care about their own craven quest for power.Say goodbye to your standing in the world, fellow Americans.
