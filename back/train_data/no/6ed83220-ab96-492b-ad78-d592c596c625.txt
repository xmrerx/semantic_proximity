new york ( reuters ) - the united states will consider resuming some suspended military assistance to eypt , u.s. president donald trump said on wednesday .
the u.s. government last month decided to deny egypt $ 95.7 million in aid and to delay a further $ 195 million over human rights concerns .
asked if he would restart military to aid to egypt , trump told reporters as he began a meeting with egyptian president abdel fattah al-sisi : we re going to certainly consider it .
on aug. 27 , sources said the trump administration decided to reprogram $ 65.7 million in fiscal year 2017 foreign military financing funds and $ 30 million in fiscal year 2016 economic support fund funds .
reprogramming means these funds would be used for other purposes and would not go to egypt .
the administration made a separate decision to withhold $ 195 million in fiscal year 2016 foreign military financing funds which , had it not acted , would have expired and ceased to be available at the end of the current fiscal year on sept. 30 .
these sums are relatively small in comparison to u.s. aid flows to egypt historically .
according to a march 2017 report by the bipartisan congressional research service , between 1948 and 2016 the united states gave egypt $ 77.4 billion in bilateral foreign aid , including $ 1.3 billion a year in military aid from 1987 to the present .
