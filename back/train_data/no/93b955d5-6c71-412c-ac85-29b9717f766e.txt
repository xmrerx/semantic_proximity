newly installed president donald trump has moved swiftly to turn his fiercely nationalist america first inaugural speech into action , stoking unease abroad over the new direction the united states is headed under his leadership.on day one of his presidency , the white house moved to withdraw the united states from the trans-pacific partnership trade pact .
the obama administration s signature domestic programme , the affordable care act , also fell victim to mr trump s move to unpick his predecessor s policies.in his fiery inauguration address on friday , mr trump painted a bleak picture of america today one exploited by foreign countries , burdened with lopsided alliances and failing to defend its borders .
for many decades , we ve enriched foreign industry at the expense of american industry ; subsidised the armies of other countries , while allowing for the very sad depletion of our military , he said , blasting past policies .
one by one , the factories shuttered and left our shores , with not even a thought about the millions and millions of american workers that were left behind .
what s left behind , he said , is a dystopia of blighted inner cities and rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the land .
this american carnage stops right here and stops right now , mr trump declared .
from this day forward , it s going to be only america first every decision on trade , on taxes , on immigration , on foreign affairs will be made to benefit american workers and american families .
mr trump , revisiting the election campaign themes that resonated strongly with what he called the forgotten voters of middle america , made clear that under his administration , the us will be hard-nosed in protecting its own interests .
we must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products , stealing our companies and destroying our jobs , he said.mr trump s signaling of a dramatic shift in policy has set off ripples of concern in world capitals , even as congratulations and offers to improve ties flooded in .
