Donald J. Trump s rape trial will be held on December 16th and the alleged victim will be represented by a high profile attorney.
This follows the GOP presidential nominee s leaked hot mic video surfacing in which he brags about sexually assaulting women.Casey Anthony was acquitted of murder charges with the help of attorney Cheney Mason and now, he s coming after Trump.The lawsuit alleges that Trump raped a 13-year-old girl at billionaire investor Jeffrey Epstein s Upper East Side mansion in 1994.
The alleged victim detailed a savage sexual attack stating she was tied to a bed, then Trump is accused of exposing himself and raping her.
Trump allegedly responded by violently striking the victim in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted.
That sounds remarkably like what Trump said to Billy Bush in the leaked video: And when you re a star, they let you do it, you can do anything.
Grab em by the pussy.
The victim, Jane Doe, has tried to file the lawsuit three times.
The first suit was dismissed over filing issues and now, another suit was filed to add a new witness to the complaint, as Newsy notes.By the way, do you know how rare it is to have a witness to a rape?High-Profile Criminal Attorney, Cheney Mason, to Represent Trump Child Rape Victim in Upcoming Trial.

Who s doing the raping?
But in reality, Republicans are not sending their best people.
They re sending pussy grabbers and rapists.
We need to shut the GOP down until we find out what s going on.
We need to build a wall around Trump and make his supporters pay for it.WATCH:Featured image via Joe Burbank-Pool/Getty
