And she still wants us to feel bad about that.
And, worse, she s still blaming everyone else.On Tuesday at the Women for Women conference, she reminded us again what a flawed candidate she was last year and what a flawed person she has always been.In her talk before a friendly audience, Clinton said she s writing a memoir and said it s painful to revisit how Donald Trump beat her like a ragdoll in an election that was a lock.Painful?
We re the ones in pain, Hillary.

She was, indeed, untrustworthy: Remember her fainting spell at the 9/11 ceremony?
Remember how long it took for her to tell the truth?
