maga ( @ steve0m2 ) september 28 , 2016hillary clinton on the other hand had barely 400 people at her rally tuesday in raleigh , north carolina.since august 1st when both parties conventions concluded , trump has had more than 312,000 people at his events with thousands turned away due to space limitations .
he has set records for some of these locations in attendance .
however , hillary has only had 12,000 total at her rallies since august 1st .
