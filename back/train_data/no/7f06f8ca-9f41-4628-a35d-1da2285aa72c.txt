harare ( reuters ) - zimbabwe electoral commission ( zec ) chairwoman rita makarau resigned on friday , months before a vote whose credibility is crucial to the new army-backed government s efforts to re-engage international lenders and lure investors , a senior government source said .
makarau , seen as an ally of 93-year-old former president robert mugabe , gave no reason for her resignation , the official , who declined to be named , said .
president emmerson mnangagwa , who was sworn in two weeks ago in the wake of the de facto military coup that ended mugabe s 37-year rule , pledged to hold elections as scheduled next year .
finance minister patrick chinamasa mentioned the credibility of the elections at least five times in a budget speech on thursday , a sign of the vote s importance in shoring up harare s democratic legitimacy .
opposition parties have demanded reforms to an electoral system they say is skewed in the ruling zanu-pf party s favor .
makarau , who has been accused of being partisan , was overseeing an overhaul of the voters roll , which the opposition movement for democratic change has described as shambolic .
makarau did not answer her mobile phone .
a spokesman for the zec was unable to confirm makarau s departure .
