YANGON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will focus on the need to stop the violence and stabilize Rakhine state when he meets with the head of Myanmar s military on Wednesday, a senior State Department official told journalists in Manila.
More than 600,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since the military launched a counter-insurgency clearance operation in Rakhine late August.
A top UN official has described it as ethnic cleansing by Buddhist-majority Myanmar.
Tillerson was due to hold talks in with Aung San Suu Kyi, the de facto leader of Myanmar s less that two year old civilian administration, and the head of the armed forces, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, in the capital Naypyitaw in a bid to stem the refugee crisis.
