As former FBI Director James Comey gave his testimony today, several gems were revealed in the process.
One of the most notable moments was when Comey trashed Trump s credibility, as he stated that the reason he had documented his meetings with Trump and not former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama was because he felt Trump in particular was untrustworthy.Comey called Trump a liar when he was testifying before the Senate, while he was describing the reasons why Trump had fired him several weeks ago.
As soon as Comey said this, the White House collectively lost his mind and went right into doing damage control.
In response, White House Deputy Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders held an off-camera briefing in which she, too, lied her ass off.
Sanders stated: I can definitively say the President is not a liar.
You can only imagine how America has responded to this.
In fact, the entire country is pretty much either laughing or face palming right now.
Trump has proven the be the most dishonest president the country has ever had.
According to PolitiFact, only 17 percent of Trump s statements are true.
Trump scored far lower than any of the other 2016 presidential candidates when they were rated on honesty, which should have been a major red flag to Trump s supporters, if they had only been a little smarter.It is truly a sad day when Americans cannot trust their president or the administration behind them.
The White House s defense of Trump is unforgivable, and proves that America has lost all credibility and respect with the world.
Trump and his minions are a joke, and they are embarrassing what was once the most respected country.
To say that Trump isn t a liar is just about the worst thing you can do because EVERYONE knows the truth.Featured image via Win McNamee / Getty Images
