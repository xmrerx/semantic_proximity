On Sunday, Donald Trump once again embarrassed himself and his country (the United States, not Russia) with yet another tweet attacking fired FBI director James Comey.
I believe the James Comey leaks will be far more prevalent than anyone ever thought possible.
Totally illegal?
Very cowardly!'

Totally illegal?
Very 'cowardly!'
Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 11, 2017We ll give you a moment to consider the actual definition of prevalent and laugh at him.Now that you ve gotten that all out of your system Comey s leak was nothing more than his sharing his private, unclassified thoughts on his meeting with Trump.
It was not illegal.
The conversation was not privileged as Trump claimed while threatening his latest enemy.Comey did nothing wrong but that isn t stopping Trump from amping up his attacks in the wake of the former FBI director s rather damning testimony.Naturally, America once again joined together to mock the jerk who spends time in the Oval Office when he s not busy golfing:'far more prevalent'?
Far more widespread?
Far more popular?
Trump has the best words, he just doesn't know how to use them coherently.

90% of what comes out your mouth or Twitter is a lie or falsity.
No one cares what you believe.

Mr. trump will summon you again in a bit.

Michelle Wilkinson (@BlkDragonsGirl) June 11, 2017This is the part where he tries to pretend he fired him for leaking, and hopes you don t notice the chronology.
Alt.
Sean Spicer (@AltUSPressSec) June 11, 2017You make these tremendous claims but then never back them up with proof of any kind.
It s an upsettingly effective tactic.
Hank Green (@hankgreen) June 11, 2017The ONLY reason #Comey released his personal memos was to counters your fucking claim of tapes .
Put this matter to an end and produce them ?

(@DearAuntCrabby) June 11, 2017One of you is going to jail.
Bet it s not going to be Comey.
PropagandaDepartment (@HoustonsNewNews) June 11, 2017You are handing Comey the easiest defamation suit in history.In case you didn t notice, your days of bullying anyone but the GOP are over The Hoarse Whisperer (@HoarseWisperer) June 11, 2017He is a private citizen that leaked non classified info.
Not illegal.
I m shocked you don t know shit about law since you re always in court Derrick Arthur (@DerrickArthur) June 11, 2017You re kidding, right?
It isn t illegal as it was not classified.
Cowardly is sacking him when he s out of town & then attacking him on TV FashionShark (@WTF_EEK) June 11, 2017 that s not how the word prevalent is used Mike Puterbaugh (@cvmikep) June 11, 2017Admit you lied or give up the tapes.. if they exist and say what you said everyone around the world would have heard them by now.
Julia Kay (@Juliekay3S) June 11, 2017 Prevalent ?
LOL.
Think you mean relevant .
And yes, they will be.
Just not in the way you think.
James Cowan (@jamesjcowan) June 11, 2017Agree totally Marie Cinolauro (@CinolauroMarie) June 11, 2017We talked about this the other day.
You need to use the google before typing words otherwise we re all omg this guy s cray.
Amanda Guinzburg (@Guinz) June 11, 2017Trump is going down.
On Saturday, Donald Trump Jr. confirmed Mr. Comey s version of events all while The Donald continues to lie.It s time for Republicans to step up, put their country before their party, and get him out of office.Featured image via Getty Images/screengrab
