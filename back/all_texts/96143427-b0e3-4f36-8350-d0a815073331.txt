This is priceless.Donald Trump has not even taken office yet, but he and his supporters are already getting their asses handed to them by people from other countries and proving themselves to be complete embarrassments to our nation.When Trump attacked Union Steelworkers 1999 on Wednesday he did so using his favorite attack platform: Twitter.If United Steelworkers 1999 was any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana.
Spend more time working-less time talking.
Reduce dues Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 8, 2016Of course, Trump took a lot of heat for attacking the labor union simply because they were telling the truth about his pathetic deal with Carrier.
But something remarkable and hilarious occurred after a Canadian Twitter user responded to Trump.Matty Granger pointed out to Trump that Time Magazine gave him devil horns on the cover.. @realDonaldTrump The joke s on you, dude.
@TIME gave you devil horns.
pic.twitter.com/isrzTB7GgJ Matty Granger (@reverendmatty) December 8, 2016A Trump supporter responded by writing that Granger is a joke because he lives in Canada.
@reverendmatty @realDonaldTrump @TIME actually the jokes on you you live in Canada pic.twitter.com/lVN93xtDvU JUST DEPLORABLE (@davism0181) December 8, 2016Well, Granger didn t let that slide and humiliated the Trump supporter by pointing out the superiority of the Canadian healthcare system and the fact that Canada is enjoying a period of domestic tranquility.
@davism0181 @realDonaldTrump @TIME Tell it to my free medical care and lack of civil unrest.
Matty Granger (@reverendmatty) December 8, 2016Another Trump supporter tried to jump in but he got smacked down, too.
@reverendmatty @davism0181 @realDonaldTrump @TIME lol free lol socialism retardedness at its finest M2 Studios (@M2_SenorGato) December 8, 2016@M2_SenorGato @davism0181 @realDonaldTrump @TIME People with income under 22k pay $0.00 for unlimited medical care.
So you were saying?
Matty Granger (@reverendmatty) December 8, 2016And then a third Trump supporter tried his luck.
@reverendmatty @M2_SenorGato @davism0181 @realDonaldTrump @TIME then it s not exactly universal is it?
Sure isn t free either Ryan Sauriol (@RyanSauriol) December 8, 2016But these Trump supporters were no match for Granger.
@RyanSauriol @M2_SenorGato @davism0181 @realDonaldTrump @TIME Feel free not to come here to find out how well it works.
Matty Granger (@reverendmatty) December 8, 2016@AllanSchumacher @RyanSauriol In BC I pay what amounts to a pittance in return to what I receive in medical care.
Matty Granger (@reverendmatty) December 8, 2016Americans had better settle in because our country is going to be embarrassed a lot over the next four years as Trump turns it into the laughing stock of the world.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images
