veteran newscaster tom brokaw called out political hack andrea mitchell on her ridiculous comey narrative .
he said , deal with facts in to mitchell in an effort to snap her back into reality .
her judgement is so clouded by her hate for all things trump that she can t see that comey needed to be fired asap .
brokaw even said he didn t know anyone who thought comey was doing a good job !
brokaw is a left-leaning journalist so his judgement isn t clouded with a pro-trump agenda : tom brokaw : one of the things that i learned during watergate is that we dealt with it every day on a factual basis .
there was not a lot of speculation .
now , of course , the media landscape has changed a lot , and we have that going on 24/7 .
i do think , however , that all of us as reporters have to take a deep breath and say let s deal with the facts as we know them at this point .
our obligation i think is to sort it out , truth from fact , and deal with the truth .
amen !
thank you mr. brokaw !
