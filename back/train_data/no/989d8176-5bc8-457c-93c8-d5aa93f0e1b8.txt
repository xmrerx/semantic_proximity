aden ( reuters ) - a suicide car bomber blew himself up at a security checkpoint in the southern yemeni port city of aden on sunday , killing 15 people and wounding at least 20 , residents and a security official said .
islamic state militants claimed responsibility for the assault , without providing evidence .
the attack occurred outside the main security headquarters in aden s khor maksar district , according to aden residents and the security official .
the blast was heard across the city and a plume of smoke could be seen from miles away .
clashes erupted in the area immediately afterward , witnesses reported .
it was unclear who was behind the attack or the clashes that followed .
islamic state claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement posted on the internet , though without immediate evidence to back up its assertion .
is said at least 50 people had been killed by the blast and in clashes .
al qaeda in the arabian peninsula ( aqap ) , the local branch of the global islamist militant network , has been the most active jihadist group in southern yemen in recent years .
aden is the interim headquarters of yemen s internationally recognized government , which had to move there when houthi rebels took control of the capital , sanaa , in 2015 during yemen s civil war .
more than 10,000 people have been killed in the conflict since the houthis advanced on aden , forcing president abd-rabbu mansour hadi to flee and seek help from saudi arabia .
aden is dominated by yemeni forces backed by the united arab emirates , a key member of the saudi-led coalition that intervened in yemen s war to restore hadi .
saudi arabia s air defense forces intercepted a ballistic missile fired from yemen over the capital , riyadh , on saturday , state news agencies reported .
the missile was brought down near king khaled airport on the northern outskirts of the city and did not cause any casualties .
