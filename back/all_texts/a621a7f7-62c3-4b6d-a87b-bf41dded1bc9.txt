The Republican presidential race has gotten so heated as well as sleazy that not even the presidential candidates mothers are left alone.
With the New Hampshire primary just around the corner, a potential voter showed a mailer a super PAC backing Florida senator Marco Rubio sent out to New Hampshire voters.The mailer features a photo of Jeb Bush wearing a golden crown next to a white haired and bejeweled Queen Elizabeth II, who bears a striking resemblance to Jeb s mother and former First Lady Barbara Bush.And in case it wasn t obvious that the mailer is linking Queen Elizabeth to Jeb s mom Barbara, the mailer includes an old quote from Barbara below the photo of Queen Elizabeth.
It reads: We ve had enough Bushes.
Barbara Bush.
The mailer, which is headlined What happened to the Coronation of Jeb Bush?
is clearly linking the idea of monarchy and the seeming monopolization of power by the Bush family, who ve already had two previous presidents and are vying for a third.
The mailer has images of Henry VIII who represents George Sr., and and the Burger King mascot, who represents George Jr.The back of the mailer reads: Most pundits claimed Bush/Clinton general election match up was inevitable, reads the back of the Rubio super PAC mailer.
They said the 2016 election would be a choice between these 2 dynasties.
One has to admit, this is quite a clever mailer as the Bush family is attempting to put yet another son in power.
We re still reeling from the mistakes of Jeb s brother, who plunged the country into chaos in the eight years he was at the helm and we don t need Jeb, who has been unapologetic for the mistakes and crimes of his brother.However, we definitely don t need Marco Rubio, the conservative, robotic, and unappealing Florida senator.
Let s continue to watch in glee as all of the candidates continue to cancel each other out with antics that lack in the most basic of human integrity.
