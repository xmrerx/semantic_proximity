jerusalem ( reuters ) - the israeli military said it attacked a hamas training compound in gaza on monday in response to rocket strikes from the palestinian enclave , which have surged since u.s. president donald trump recognized jerusalem as israel s capital on dec 6 .
neither side reported any casualties in the overnight shelling exchange , which occurred days before u.s. vice president mike pence visits israel and neighboring egypt , which also borders gaza and is involved in its internal politics .
militants in gaza , territory controlled by the hamas islamist group , have launched more than a dozen rockets into southern israel over the last two weeks , the most intensive attacks since a seven-week-long gaza war in 2014 .
two rockets were fired late on sunday , one of them exploding inside an israeli border community and the other hitting an open area , the military said .
another rocket launched early on monday fell short inside gaza , it said .
three structures in a hamas training camp were hit in the israeli counter-strike , the military said .
hamas usually evacuates such facilities when tensions rise , and israel s choice of the low-profile target appeared to signal a desire to avoid more serious confrontation with the group .
israel does not seek escalation , justice minister ayelet shaked said on army radio .
but zeev elkin , another member of prime minister benjamin netanyahu s security cabinet , said in an interview with the radio station that israel s military response would have to be harshened if the rocket fire did not stop .
israeli officials have blamed the fire on smaller militant groups in gaza and called on hamas to rein them in .
should hamas fail to do so , both shaked and elkin said , israel could eventually target the group s leadership for attack .
