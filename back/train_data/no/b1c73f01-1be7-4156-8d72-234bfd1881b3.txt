madrid ( reuters ) - u.s. president barack obama will not visit spain until its parties manage to form a government and end over 100 days of political deadlock , delaying a trip that had been under consideration for july .
“ what ( obama ) told me is let ’ s see if we form a government , because he is keen to visit spain , ” jose manuel garcia-margallo told reporters after meeting obama at a dinner on friday night for a nuclear security summit .
margallo said obama had been considering a trip in july , but given spain could return to the polls the month before , the president would prefer to wait .
george w. bush , obama ’ s predecessor , was the last u.s. president to visit spain in 2001 .
