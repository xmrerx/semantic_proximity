london ( reuters ) - as britain s pound declines against the euro , talk has begun to circulate about the potential for parity .
less noted , however , is the fact that the more the pound weakens and euro strengthens the more the eventual leaving bill britain will pay the european union may cost .
the bill in pounds , if it came today , would have risen nearly 17 percent since the vote to leave the eu in june 2016 1.4 percent since mid-august alone .
britain and the eu return to the negotiating table on monday with the leaving bill high on the agenda .
a net 60 billion euros ( $ 70.8 billion ) has been floated in brussels .
it has been shot down by british officials .
were it to be correct , however , britain would now owe around 9.4 billion pounds ( $ 12 billion ) more than it would have at the time of the vote .
