This is another twist and turn in the mega scandal that is all Hillary s mess.
The interesting thing about this e-mail discovery is that Philippe Reines had been battling with reporters in March via e-mail regarding guilt or innocence in this e-mail scandal:A key member of Democratic presidential front-runner Hillary Clinton s team sent several angry emails to a group of journalists on Tuesday night.
The messages criticized a source for being a lying liar and what the aide described as a reporter s cockamamie theory.
Fast Forward to this new development: State Department officials have uncovered thousands of emails between Philippe Reines, a top Hillary Clinton aide, and members of the media, they previously said did not exist.In a court filing last Thursday, the State Department estimated that a recent search turned up more than 81,000 emails from Reines s official account while at the State Department.
And 17,855 potentially fall within a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) lawsuit filed by Gawker earlier this year.That is a reversal from 2013, when the State Department said a thorough search turned up no responsive records for Gawker s request.
In 2012, Gawker requested all emails between Reines and reporters from 34 media outlets.The State Department did not explain the reversal in the court document, nor did it return a request for comment.It will begin releasing a tranche of Reines s emails by the end of September.After it was revealed earlier this year that Clinton, and potentially some of her aides, used personal email accounts for official business, Gawker sued the State Department over its initial request for communications between Reines and reporters.Via: The Hill
