BRASILIA (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer had minor surgery on Wednesday for a narrowing of his urethra and the operation was successful, his office said.
It was the second time the 77-year-old president had surgery on his urinary tract in two months.
In October, he was operated on to reduce an enlarged prostate that had caused a urinary obstruction.
Temer canceled his scheduled meetings on Wednesday and flew to S o Paulo for tests that were followed by surgery at the city s S rio-Liban s Hospital.
In November, Temer underwent an angioplasty procedure to implant stents in three coronary arteries after his doctors found what they said was a bigger obstruction in one of the arteries.
Wednesday s tests came at a crucial moment in Temer s presidency, as he scrambles to secure votes to pass a pension overhaul bill to help bring Brazil s huge budget deficit under control.
