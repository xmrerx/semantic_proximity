as the democratic party begins to unite and the gop continues to implode , a shocking new poll just released shows hillary clinton beating donald trump by seven points in the state of kansas.the poll shows that 43 percent of voters in the state prefer clinton compared to 36 percent who support trump while 21 percent remain undecided.clinton s support from the socially conservative state comes as voters express mass dissatisfaction with the state s governor , republican sam brownback ( who was lasted to lose reelection in 2014 ) , and the legislature , which has majority republican control.kansas hasn t voted , nor majorly supported , a democrat for president since 1964 , when lyndon johnson swept the nation in a landslide election against barry goldwater.after cruz crushed the republican nominee in the state s caucus ( 48-23 ) , pollsters for the kansas health foundation said the disarray is helping democrats , including clinton , mount a formidable challenge to the state s solid red status .
however , kansas state university political science professor patrick miller is telling democrats not to get too excited : that s a little bit better than ( president barack ) obama did .
so if you assume also that trump is toxic , clinton hasn t closed the deal with millennials yet , she probably has some room to grow .
i think clinton will do better than the average democratic candidate .
i don t think she ll win kansas , but i think she ll probably get a few percent better than obama .
president obama lost kansas to senator john mccain by 15 points , and to mitt romney by 22 points .
however , one upside democrats could have is trump s constant flip-flopping on social issues .
kansans tend to vote based on social issues , as chronicled in frank thomas bestseller what s the matter with kansas ?
if democrats played into trump s past support of abortion rights , same-sex marriage rights and gun control advocacy , his support could be diminished amongst skeptical voters.while trump promises to flip solid blue states like new york , maryland , california and pennsylvania , maybe he should worry about once solid red states like kansas and georgia.featured image via jessica kourkounis
