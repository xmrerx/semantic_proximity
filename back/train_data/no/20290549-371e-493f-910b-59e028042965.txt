berlin ( reuters ) - the wave of refugees that entered germany in 2015-2016 has slowed its integration efforts , according to a study that also showed little progress since 2005 in leveling the playing field for immigrants on education , employment and incomes .
at the height of europe s migration crisis , chancellor angela merkel adopted an open-borders policy that drew more than one million refugees into germany in two years .
in the prior decade , education opportunities picked up for newly arrived immigrants and people born in germany with at least one foreign parent .
but the federal statistics office study released on thursday found the education gap between those categories of migrants and native germans had since widened again , with the proportion of the former lacking a high school certificate growing between 2014 and 2016 .
the scale of future immigration has become a major sticking point in three-party talks that merkel is leading on the formation of a new coalition government , for which she has set an initial deadline of thursday night .
while germany s unemployment rate has fallen to its lowest since the country s reunification in 1990 , more immigrants were unemployed in 2016 than native germans , the study said .
in that year , 13.6 percent of immigrants and 6.2 percent of native germans had low-paying jobs .
merkel s conservatives have proposed to the coalition talks that a suspension of reunifications between migrants and their family members outside germany should be extended beyond a march 2018 deadline .
immigration expert herbert bruecker , a professor at the berlin integration and migration institute , said that would worsen the divide .
our surveys show that people , who are living separated from their families , have a lower life satisfaction and also suffer more often from depression or bitterness , he said .
