the 2016 presidential election continues to defy expectations as faithless electors emerged among democrats refusing to support democratic nominee hillary clinton.in the run-up to the vote of the electoral college , all eyes had been on whether any republican electors would refuse to vote for donald trump .
there had reports of last-ditch lobbying asking electors to switch from trump to clinton.instead , it has been democratic electors who were balking.only eight of 12 democratic electors in washington cast their votes for democrat hillary clinton , who won the state in november .
in an act of symbolic protest , three democratic electors voted for colin powell and one for faith spotted eagle , who has been fighting the dakota access pipeline in north dakota , instead of clinton.there were also reports that two electors , one in maine and another minnesota , tried but failed in their efforts not to vote for clinton.the irony : muhammad abdurrahman , minnesota elector refuses to cast vote for hillary today .
so his vote is invalid for alternative to cast .
