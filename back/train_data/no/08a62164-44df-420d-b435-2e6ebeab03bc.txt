in september 2015 , the sterling heights , mi city council representing a city of 130,000 people in southeastern michigan , denied the proposal for a mega-mosque in a residential neighborhood populated largely by christian refugees who fled islamic persecution in iraq.sterling heights already has two mosques , but a third , the american islamic community center , applied for a permit and was rejected after it was determined its proposed use was incompatible with the residential area .
too much traffic , too little parking , the city planning commission decided by a 9-0 vote against the mosque in september 2015.but in december , the mosque sued the city and the obama justice department joined in , claiming the real reason the mosque was denied was because the city was caving to anti-muslim bigotry in the community .
a settlement deal was announced last night during a sterling heights city council meeting.as expected , the attorney for the mosque developers claimed the reasons these mostly christian refugees from iraq are in opposition to a mosque being built in their residential neighborhood fake : sterling heights , mi residents spoke out against the proposed mega-mosque during a planning commission meeting where the residents were given an opportunity to have their views heard by the city council : many of the sterling heights residents who live in the area of the proposed mosque are christian-iraqi refugees who fled persecution of muslims in their native land .
the last thing they want is an islamic mega-mosque erected in their backyards .
before announcing the decision to go ahead with the proposed plan for building the mega-mosque in a local neighborhood , sterling heights city councilman doug skrzyniarz claimed the primary reasons for going ahead with the plans were to avoid costly litigation while allowing officials to have more say in the mosque s layout .
we have reduced our financial risk and we ve been able to have input on what the actual development is going to contain , councilman doug skrzyniarz told the large crowd .
but it s what he said next , that s not being reported by local or national news outlets that was even more telling and it happens near the end of the video :
