the economic devastation is very real in west virginia .
obama promised to shut down the coal industry as one of his bold campaign promises in 2008 .
hillary s plan is to keep the dream of shutting down the coal industry alive long after obama is out of office .
coal miners are taking and stand and letting america know they are not going to sit back and watch their livelihoods and towns destroyed by a radical leftist president .
watch here : https : //youtu.be/gbj5wwwekjw let s put it this way .
hillary clinton says she s going to shut you down .
bernie sanders says the same thing .
then you got donald trump saying we re going to put you back to work , we re going to save your jobs .
i mean , that means a whole lot to us .
whether it s true or not , the man is the first one who says we re going to put you back to work .
so i m going to support him .
i mean if he goes back on his word , we got another election if four years , we ll vote him out .
