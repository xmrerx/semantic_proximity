With only 357 delegates to go for Trump to cinch the nomination, does this news present a public relations nightmare for the Republican establishment?
Republican National Committee member Randy Evans said Wednesday that Donald Trump would likely be able to secure the Republican nomination if he captures anything more than 1,100 delegates, short of the 1,237 delegates needed for a simple majority.
If Donald Trump exceeds 1,100 votes, he will become the nominee even though he may not have 1,237, Evans said on MSNBC s Morning Joe.
RNC Rules Cmte.
Member Randy Evans: If @realDonaldTrump exceeds 1100 votes, he will become the nominee https://t.co/NmEwHF5FFt Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) April 13, 2016Evans comment is good news for Trump if it s a sentiment shared by other RNC members, since Trump is at risk of falling short of a majority of delegates by the time of the convention in July.
But Evans also warned that if Trump slips much more, the nomination would likely fall to someone else.
If he gets less than 1,000 delegates, then I think we re looking at a contested convention that could go on for many, many days, Evans said.As of this week, Trump leads Cruz in the delegate race 743-545, but he s expected to pick up most of New York s delegates next week, and has polled well in other states whose primaries are approaching.
